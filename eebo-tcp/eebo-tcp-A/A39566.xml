            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SInce the first Impression of this Book, there is a <hi>Butter-fly</hi> flown abroad, that makes a fearfull fluttering among its own favorites for <hi>Infant-sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> from the hands of one Mr. <hi>Reading,</hi> with whom I once held a publick Dispute against it at <hi>Folston</hi> (as is hinted to thee above in <hi>p.</hi> 231. <hi>&amp; p.</hi> 308.) in my <hi>reading</hi> of which Work of Mr. <hi>Reading</hi> had I attained to satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that our present way of <hi>Dipping Believers</hi> is the error, and their way of <hi>Infant-sprinkling</hi> the truth, thou shouldst have had my <hi>Recantation</hi>; or had I seen it sending in any new <hi>supply</hi> of evidence (not availing to my conviction) in <hi>proof</hi> of theirs, and <hi>disproof</hi> of ours, thou might'st likely have seen from me some new <hi>supply</hi> of <hi>Relief,</hi> or new <hi>Reply</hi> to such new <hi>Repulses:</hi> but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>his</hi> to be but a new Book, for the most part furtively collected out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny old ones already routed, and that both in the <hi>Argumentative</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponsive</hi> part thereof (as well that which relates more immediately to my self, as that which relates to the cause I stand up in, as managed by others) there is <hi>Nil ferè dictum, quod non fuit tam contradictum, quàm dictum priùs</hi>; wel nigh nothing spoken that was not both spoken, and spoken to before, by my self in this very Volume, in so much that had he perused it (as he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement and advantage enough to do, it being <hi>extant</hi> in those parts where he lives almost a year before his own) he might have seen his Book here answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before ere it appeared at the <hi>Press,</hi> and have sav'd himself the charges of the <hi>Impression,</hi> I resolved to <hi>supersede</hi> from any further medling with it, as judging it frivolous to fight afresh with every <hi>old Argument</hi> and <hi>Answer,</hi> that thrusts it self out onely in a <hi>new Harness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Howbeit among other of his misrepresentations of my <hi>Arguments,</hi> few or none of which are by him rightly represented<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I cannot but advertise thee of this as most <hi>notorious,</hi> in that <hi>p.</hi> 154. of his Book, (whether in <hi>simplicity</hi> or <hi>subtilty</hi> I know not) he suggests it unto thee for a truth that from this <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position (viz.)</hi> the <hi>Parents to whom</hi> Peter <hi>spake,</hi> Acts 2.39. <hi>were unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers then when he spake so to them,</hi> I inferred this <hi>conclusion, (viz.) that therefore the Gospel promise is not to believers and their children,</hi> and so bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies himself in beating the air, and making good what none opposeth, for our <hi>opinion</hi> is this, which then also was my <hi>conclusion, (viz.)</hi> that therefore the Gospel promise is made not onely to <hi>believers</hi> and their children, but to <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers,</hi> and their children also, to whom it shall be made good too, as in time to come they shall believe, repent, and be baptized. <hi>Ex pede Herculem,</hi> by this little thou mayst see the whole lump, and how apt the man is to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer matters before he hath well heard them, which for any man to do (saith <hi>Solomon</hi>) is follie and shame unto him.</p>
            <p>And now since some know not what the meaning is of those three capital Letters, <hi>(viz.) PPP, CCC, SSS, &amp;c.</hi> with which the title<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> given to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> whether <hi>true</hi> or <hi>surreptitious,</hi> are very often signed by me, but especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this later part of the Book above, when I speak of the three kindes of <hi>Clergy</hi>-men altogether, <hi>(viz.) Papal, Prelatick</hi> and <hi>Presbyterian</hi>; I signifie that this is to intimate unto thee how these three are the <hi>three PPParts</hi> of that great Citie <hi>BBBabylon,</hi> which reigneth over the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:109011:3"/>
of the earth, into which it stands divided before its fall, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17.18.</p>
            <p>Moreover I do thee to wit that what thou findest in the last part of this Book distinguished by the old <hi>English Character</hi> is word for word the last part of that <hi>Paedobaptistical Piece,</hi> which was put out about the <hi>Ashford Disputation,</hi> which Reading abstract from the rest, thou readest all that to a tittle, on which this last part is but a <hi>Paraphrase,</hi> to shew how the <hi>Ministers</hi> own good matter (<hi>unmaskt</hi>) is but a glass, wherein (if they be not blinde) they may easily see their own ill manners, and themselves who talk so much against Toleration of <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> to be more <hi>Heretical</hi> and <hi>Schismatical</hi> than those they call so.</p>
            <p>Finally, desiring thee to help thy own understanding in the Reading of this Book, in such places wherein the sense is clouded, by reason of such defects as fell out in the Printing, through <hi>male-correction</hi> of it at the Press, by this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing <hi>Rule of Direction</hi>; I commend thee to the Lord and Rest</p>

            <p>THESE short Collections of the <hi>Ashford</hi> Disputation had slept long enough, if your private letters had not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakned them by a too much slighting your opponents and their arguments. I know you have seen the thing long since, and heard the other day you intended a Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The last Thursday there was a conference at <hi>Wadhurst</hi> in <hi>Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex</hi> upon the like subject, where were more then one of your opponents at <hi>Ashford.</hi> This relation was objected to them among other things, as a Pamphlet injurious to your self, as neither setting down your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers truly, nor fully. This puts the Publisher upon a further work. Not an new thing upon the subject, but a desire of you (if you give not the cause by your silence upon this <hi>Provocation</hi>) to let something be seen in your own right, by which he may take occasion to clear himself about the publishing of this. To that purpose I was intreated to send you this Copy; that you may not take advantage of those many faults, which through the negligence of the <hi>Printer</hi> are found in your former. Sir, I pray deal clearly and ingenuously, for you deal with such as your self in this, that their aim is onely Gods glory, and the discharge of their own consciences in vindication of the truth, suppressing heresie, reducing those who are gone, confirming those who are doubtful, and praying that God would give the assistance of his spirit to these ends.

            <p>The first I say, is a Story of the long <hi>Disputation</hi> that was held at <hi>Ashford, Iuly</hi> 27<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1649. from noon, till neer seven at night, and it's contained in the five first leaves, whereof two whole ones at least (but say so they had need) are spent in your exact setting down of the <hi>Arguments</hi> and <hi>Answers,</hi> and the rest in <hi>praevious</hi> and <hi>posteriour</hi> passages.</p>
            <p>So that in this first part of your Pamphlet, there are two things in generall which you profess to give <hi>A true Account</hi> of.</p>
            <p>First, The Propositions agreed on between your selves, and your <hi>Respondent,</hi> his <hi>Position,</hi> and what else was precedent, and preparative to the <hi>Disputation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Disputation</hi> it self, and such things as were subsequent to it, in each of which, if I shew not that you have recorded more flat falsities, and down-right untruths than one (and that were too much to fall from your pens, were you <hi>Ministers of Christ</hi> indeed) then let my own pen record me for a lyar, and my own self bear the blame of over-charging you, and that for ever.</p>
            <p>In order to a trial of the Truth in this case between you and me, though I suppose I shall not be more critical in considering, nor volumnous in dilating on them, than your selves are numerous in bewraying of your own negligences, ignorances, contradictions, fictions, nakednesses, and abusive shifts, throughout this your

               <p>Secondly, I observe when ever you come to dispute for your <hi>Childish-christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> you plead only for the <hi>Infants of Believers</hi>: but is not your plea by far too narrow for your practise, whilest you commonly <hi>christen</hi> the <hi>Infants</hi> of all? you know your people are not all in the faith, why else do you preach to them as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane to the end you may convert them thereunto? yet the wickedest wretches you so keep from the <hi>Supper,</hi> that you often keep all from it for their sakes; have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess with their seed to be <hi>christened,</hi> as freely for the most part as the other: doth not that same faith that denominates men believers, saints, godly, and gives them, and (as you say) theirs too a true title to <hi>Baptism,</hi> intitle their persons to the <hi>Supper</hi>? or must a man bring you another, and that a better kind of faith to the one, than he had need care for toward the other? this some of your <hi>Tribe</hi> do not blush to say, because (as the case is) there is nought else to be said: but know ye <hi>Sirs</hi> and they too, that though you have your several sorts of Saints for your severall services <hi>viz.</hi> your grosser sort of believers to admit (not in their own persons neither when at years, but) in their posterity only to your <hi>Rantism,</hi> and a finer sort for the <hi>Supper,</hi> yet <hi>Christ</hi> requires but one sort of faith and saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to both these ordinances, <hi>viz.</hi> no more than a true one to the one, and no less than a true one to the other. Again you had much need (had you not think you?) to set children of believing parents as the only subjects of <hi>Baptism</hi> in the sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, one word more to this yet: Did your <hi>Respondent</hi> assent to you in it (as you seem to say) that the <hi>Baptism</hi> of children is practised by the <hi>Church of God</hi>? how pretily have you put these terms [<hi>practised by the Church of God</hi>] into the very question, and that too as it stands stated beeween us? Did I give, and grant so much? or have you not rather taken it for granted from me whether I will, or no? <hi>Sirs</hi> I had thought I had given you sufficient evidence of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial that the <hi>Baptism</hi> of <hi>Infants</hi> is practised by the <hi>Church of God</hi>; yea though the <hi>Church of the Pope,</hi> and such as you call the <hi>Church of God,</hi> as the <hi>Church of the Prelate, the Church of the Presbyter,</hi> and some others too, do dispense <hi>Rantism</hi> to <hi>Infants</hi> under the name of <hi>Baptism,</hi> yet I did then, as also I do still,

deny it to be, or have been practised by any true <hi>Church of God</hi> primitive, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, that then was, or now is <hi>visibly constituted</hi> according to his will in the word: As for what you call the <hi>Church of God</hi> whether you mean all <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> or the <hi>Protestant</hi> part of it only, it is even therefore no true visible <hi>Church of God</hi> because it <hi>Rantizes Infants</hi>: for that being undoubtedly a strag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from the truth, and an undue administration of that ordinance, not only as to the form of it, but the subject also, the name of the true visible <hi>Church of God</hi> is (<hi>ipso facto</hi>) destroyed from it, were there no more error in it but barely that, if <hi>Doctor Featly</hi> (to whom you send us in your <hi>Review</hi>) define the true Church of God aright; for while he saies that (meaning that only) is a true Church where the word is truly taught, and the Sacraments duly administred, consequently that is no true <hi>Church</hi> where baptism is unduely administ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, That the Arguments used in the disputation should be only express Scriptures, or arguments of necessary consequence from them, All Authorities of Fathers and Churches laid aside; though the practise of the Church was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for, yet would not be yielded to.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

               <p>Secondly, if by Fathers, whose authority you hang so much on, you mean those that were some hundreds of years after <hi>Christ,</hi> and were <hi>canonized</hi> more lately for such, as Father <hi>Origen,</hi> Father <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> Father <hi>Ierom,</hi> Father <hi>Cyprian,</hi> Father <hi>Austin,</hi> and the other objects of the <hi>Clergies Dotage</hi>; and if by <hi>Churches</hi> you mean those that were in the ages when, and places where these Fathers lived, or any other since the <hi>primitive</hi> times, which were the purest, it is but a follie to stand arguing from them, whose words and waies are no more the rule of truth to us then ours are to be to them that succeed us: for verily they might and did speak sometimes not according to the word, and then they were as <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terodox</hi> as others, and our selves are in as good possibilities as they to speak ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the word, and then we are as <hi>Orthodox,</hi> and <hi>Authentick</hi> to the full as themselves. I did therefore utterly disown all authority of these <hi>Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Churches,</hi> for I knew none they had to be a Standard to after ages: yet though I counterpleaded your Plea from their practise, it was not least your cause should be advantaged thereby, for even the Testimonie of those <hi>Fathers</hi> is against you; but because as they were subjected to the word, so were they as subject to error as our selves: but if by <hi>Fathers</hi> you mean the <hi>Primitive Prophets, and Apostles</hi> to whom all your <hi>Fore-fathers</hi> are but <hi>Children, viz.</hi> Father <hi>Peter,</hi> Father <hi>Paul,</hi> Father <hi>Iames,</hi> Father <hi>Iude,</hi> Father <hi>Iohn,</hi> whose Doctrine was the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>Churches,</hi> and by <hi>Churches</hi> those that were then built upon their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as that of <hi>Ephesus, Corinth, Philippi, Rome,</hi> &amp;c. before the falling off

First, that 'twas given out (as my desire to them is it never may be again) by them of our party, that I was a Scholar, and durst meet with Scholars in discourse, and therefore seeing I now was before Scholars, it was expected that I should dispute in the way that's most usual among them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That the way of Dispute by <hi>Syllogisms</hi> (for which some of you had little need to dispute, considering their <hi>illogicall,</hi> and <hi>un-syllogisticall</hi> doings that day, wherein they were all-to-be-puzzled in their matter by fumbling so much about that form) was the clearest, and most compendious to the proving of things, and the preventing of extrravagancies, and disorder; much what in such a manner did you utter your selves, in order to <hi>inforcing</hi> your <hi>Proposition,</hi> to which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply was to this purpose, Namely, First, that though I had been in the <hi>Vniversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and a <hi>Graduate</hi> there, yet I pretended to no great <hi>Scholarship,</hi> yea, that I was a <hi>Dunce,</hi> and a <hi>fool,</hi> which very terms, and no other, I repeated again in my <hi>Position,</hi> and was contented to be counted for no other, as to that kind of learning of much of which I was willingly forgetful, that I might know more of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the plainness of his Gospel. Secondly, that I came not thither to dispute, (nor did I (the Lord is my witness) in that formal way you stood upon) but in plainness to give an account before all, to as many as should ask it, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my ability, and what liberty you should allot me thereunto, (which yet was well nigh none at all) of the way you call <hi>Heresie,</hi> after which I, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did worship. Thirdly, that these <hi>Syllogisticall</hi> wayes of arguing, and the foolish feigned forms of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Disputers</hi> of this world, which men might dispute in about the things of Nature, and the world, were utterly unsuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the seriousness of the things of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the Gospel, which were most effectually delievered, for so <hi>Paul</hi> chose to hold them out, in all plainness of speech, and most commonly hid from people by the <hi>Logicall</hi> terms, and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods</hi> of mans invention; and that the wise and prudent men after the flesh, <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, Schoolmen</hi> and <hi>Casuists</hi> had clouded the truth from the world, for ages and generations toge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Fifthly, That this way was fitter for the <hi>Schooles,</hi> and very unfit for that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory, where the people, for whose sake we were chiefly come together to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,

That infants have the Spirit, faith, holiness, many commendations in Scripture, are such of whom to doubt their having the spirit is a breach of Christian charity, whom to deny baptism to, makes the Covenant of the Gospel worse than that under the law; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyes all the hope that parents can have of their salvation, crosses the practise of the universall Church,</hi> which one would think you should be ashamed to make a book of; might have been expos'd to the consideration of your <hi>Respondent,</hi> in much less than half the half quarter, and given out plainly enough in a few positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for him to have replied to with your leave and silence: but time was so spin'd out by your long productions, and his Repetitions of your <hi>Syllogisms,</hi> that there was but a very <hi>long-little,</hi> in comparison of what else might have been delivered; and <hi>Sirs,</hi> I assure you of this one thing, I beseech you to lay it to heart in time, the generation of you <hi>Disputers</hi> is rejected by the Lord, and a sort of plain Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish men raised up, who notwithstanding the curiosity of your cudgel-play, and those fine forms of your <hi>Fencing-schools,</hi> whereby you shield your selves from the truth, will by their <hi>upright down-right</hi> dealings with you, and the word, be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to beat your cudgels to your heads; and though you seek to lap up the nakednes of your waies, from the sight of the people for a time, in a pair of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi> breeches, yet these are wearing out a pace, so that you shall see within a while, what now you will not, that all your <hi>Syllogisticall</hi> forms, will not secure your <hi>Sylli-popicall</hi> matters.</p>

               <p>This I say is another of your <hi>your figments</hi>: for first to let pass the <hi>Sophisticall</hi> terms you used whilst you askt how or when <hi>Circumcision</hi> ceased to be a <hi>seal</hi> of the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eousness of faith even to <hi>Abrahams</hi> posterity? as if I had granted that <hi>Circumcision</hi> was once a seal of the righteousness of faith even to <hi>Abrahams posterity</hi> as well as himself, and then was changed, ceased, &amp; left off to be so, wheras I told you then, that though 'twas so to <hi>Abraham</hi> himself, yet it never was so to them at all, &amp; do also tel you now, that when a man saies of a thing that it never was so, it is but an <hi>illiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi>

kind of <hi>quere</hi> to ask him again, when it ceased to be so? Secondly, confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that I then affirmed, and also still affirming the same, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Circumcision</hi> was a seal <hi>of the righteousness</hi> of faith to <hi>Abraham</hi> only, and not to his posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; I profess thirdly, before the world, appealing to your own consciences to witness, that as it is most plain in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> so I then made a most plain dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverie of it from the <hi>Scripture,</hi> that there were other <hi>ends, uses,</hi> and <hi>significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of <hi>Circumcision</hi> to <hi>Abrahams</hi> own person (though in some respects there were also the same) then those for which it was dispensed to his seed, and that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding many things, which were promised to <hi>Abraham,</hi> were promised to all his seed together with him, yet there were somethings also promised to <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Covenant of <hi>Circumcision,</hi> which his seed had no promise of at all, as namely, First, That he should be the Father of all Believers. This I am most certain I then instanc'd in, and according to your then demand cleared by <hi>Scripture,</hi> even that very <hi>Scripture</hi> which was then quoted by your selves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the whole verse, whereof <hi>you,</hi> for <hi>your</hi> own ends, mentioned but a part. I told <hi>you</hi> twas evident even thence that <hi>Abraham</hi> had one preheminence, and priviledge that none of his posteritie had ever after him, which he obtained of God by his <hi>preheminence</hi> in believing, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Fatherhood of the faithful</hi>; of which eminent faith of his, which was imputed to him for righteousness, as well as of that eminent prerogative, the <hi>Fatherhood of the faithful,</hi> which God gave him upon that great faith, <hi>Circumcision</hi> was given him as a seal, in such a sence, as twas never given to his seed, a <hi>Seal</hi> I said, for it was a <hi>sign</hi> only but no <hi>seal</hi> to his posteritie, to honor the greatness, not to strengthen the weakness of his faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> to confirm him, that was so great a believer, even beyond hope, n that honorable title, which <hi>God</hi> put upon him; therfore I told you it runs thus, <hi>viz. he received the sign circumcision,</hi> i. e. circumcision, (which in its ordinary use was a sign) a <hi>seal</hi> to him in this special sense, <hi>i. e.</hi> as a <hi>seal of the righteousness of</hi> that eminent <hi>faith which he had, that he might be, i. e.</hi> to that very end and purpose as to ratifie him in that royal title, <hi>The father of all that believe</hi>; to this purpose I then spake, shewing withall that in the same sense in which the father is said to <hi>seal</hi> the sonne, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.27. to be the giver of that meat that endures to eternall life, <gap reason="foreign">

the other would not be, and yet no other then the bare <hi>accidentall occasions</hi> of those <hi>effects,</hi> which flow from something else as the cause thereof <hi>perse</hi>; and most especially when those <hi>consequents</hi> are declared by the word of God to be such, as will upon that occasion <hi>universally</hi> and <hi>unavoidably</hi> come to pass; and thus we may give a shrew'd guess that our cause is good, <hi>viz.</hi> that our <hi>Gospel, Ministery, Church-way</hi> and <hi>Baptism</hi> is the true one, because we see it is secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded now, and ever hath been with what it was of old seconded, and foretold also that it should ever be even every where to the worlds end, <hi>viz.</hi> divisions in fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, <hi>two against three, and three against two, the Father against the Son, the Daughter against the Mother &amp;c.</hi> offences of friends, and fleshly relations, the account of <hi>Heresie</hi> and baseness, hatred of men, persecution, cavils, stirs, tumults about it, by which things <hi>Christs</hi> people, Gospel, Ministers, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations are ever proved to be his <hi>Luke.</hi> 12.52.53. <hi>Math.</hi> 24.9.2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.4, 5. So that where theres none of this I avouch the <hi>Gospell</hi> in its purity is not there though where these are the Gospel is not the cause for that is men lusts and flesh fighting against the light, but the only the <hi>occasion,</hi> whereupon they arise; when <hi>Satan</hi> the strong man holds the house the goods are all in peace, but when <hi>Christ</hi> the stronger man comes to storm him out, there's contention, in hearts, houses, Towns and Countries, as when <hi>Christ</hi> came to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> all was in an uproar, and when <hi>Paul</hi> came with his Gospel to <hi>Ephesus, Athens, Iconium, Lystra, Derbe</hi> lewd fellows of the baser sort were set on by others to raise tumults, for truth tormented them into rage; thus we often judge of <hi>Causes</hi> as <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad, right</hi> or <hi>wrong,</hi> by the <hi>effects</hi> that flow from them, but to reason upon a cause as <hi>good,</hi> or <hi>ill, true,</hi> or <hi>false, right</hi> or <hi>wrong</hi> according to the <hi>might</hi> or <hi>moaness,</hi> the <hi>abilities</hi> or <hi>defects</hi> of the persons that stand up for it is the right way to wrong it indeed, sith the <hi>Antichristian</hi> cause hath the mighty, wise, and prudent <hi>Priests,</hi> and <hi>Potentates</hi> of the world for its <hi>Patrons,</hi> when the poor only, for the most part, receive <hi>Christs</hi> Gospell and the strength that God ordains in defence thereof against the persecutor is the mouths of <hi>Babes</hi> and <hi>Sucklings.</hi> Causes are to be rejected as <hi>wrong</hi> and <hi>false</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>defects</hi> and <hi>weakness</hi> that is discovered to be in the <hi>Arguments</hi> that are brought to maintain, and not by the weakness and defects that may seem to be in those that are more <hi>zealous</hi> then <hi>able</hi> to mannage them, if there appear to be weight in the Arguments: these if strong however <hi>weakly</hi> and <hi>babishly</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded will carry the cause in the conscience of any, but such <hi>Priest-be-charmed</hi> Christians, as in <hi>Charity</hi> to their <hi>Churchmen,</hi> are resolved to yield themselves up to be carried away with every wind of doctrine that passes from them, and, <hi>covering the weakness of them,</hi> to be whifled any way by such arguments as the men themselves, that make them are fain to grant to be weak to prove what they are brought for; for no <hi>Argument</hi> is weak that is sufficient to evince the thing its used in proof of, though it fall from the mouth of never so weak a man; if a weak feeble hand letfall an heavy Axe upon it, or a sharp sword, even the sword of the Spirit the word of God, that is quick and powerfull it may serve to cut off the <hi>Popes head, Tripple Crown</hi> and all, but if the <hi>Pope</hi> himself, and all his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which are the ablest <hi>Humanists</hi> in the world, come out to warre against <hi>Christ</hi> and his cause with <hi>reeds</hi> and <hi>rushes, blind non sequiturs, weak</hi> and <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Consequences,</hi> they must ride back to <hi>Rome</hi> for stronger swords, or else they may force fools into <hi>conformity</hi> to their follies, but never guide wise men after the spirit to believe their cause to be good: as therefore tis not good that an ill cause, that hath but weak Arguments to uphold it, should be owned for good, either in <hi>Charity,</hi> or upon pretence of <hi>ability</hi> in the persons that <hi>patronize</hi> it, as the <hi>Clergies</hi> crooked cause of <hi>Infant-sprinkling</hi> is, for what saies the Parish to those <hi>poor ones</hi> in it, that entertain the Gospel, are you wiser than a whole <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod</hi> of able <hi>Orthodox</hi> Divines? so it is a thousand pitties that a good cause, that

They brought little children to Christ, by his permission, that he should touch them, and to such belongs the Kingdom of heaven, Ergo, Infants in infancy must be baptized,</hi> the consequence of which, as tis no less then this, <hi>they brought sick folks unto Christ, by his permission, that he should touch them, and to such be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs the Kingdome of heaven, Ergo, sick folks must be baptized in the time of their sickness,</hi> so it swayes not me, if it be somewhat more then that of the <hi>Papists, viz. they brought an Ass for Christ to ride on, Ergo, Asses are blessed creatures,</hi> that have a <hi>cross</hi> upon their <hi>crests</hi> ever since, and as for that in special that bore him, happy are hundreds of people that can every one get a leg of him.</p>
               <p>And now whereas you say you feared it; Oh that you did indeed fear the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerable crime of deserting the truth to be charg'd upon you,</hi> then would you return from whence in the uniuersal deluge you are departed, and stand up to maintain that <hi>faith, Gospel, baptism, Church, Order</hi> which was once delivered to the Saints; but now you stand up for <hi>error</hi> and <hi>mans invention,</hi> and though you seem to salve all ore so surely, and to answer so handsomely that all men cannot discry you, yet doth not he see all your wayes, and count all your steps? if therefore you are stept aside out of the way, and walk in vanity upon <hi>fetches</hi> and <hi>far fecht consequences,</hi> despising the cause of God, when in plainness he contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it with you, out of the <hi>mouth</hi> of <hi>babes,</hi> what will you do when he riseth up? when he visiteth what will you answer? yea, when he asks who hath required this at your hands? you will be as blank before him about your <hi>Baby-sprinkling,</hi> as they about their <hi>Bawble Bell-sprinkling,</hi> both being but limbs of the <hi>Idol Bell</hi> that serves the <hi>bellies</hi> of the <hi>Priest-hood</hi>; your <hi>non prohibition</hi> excuses one no more then the other.

to all infants, even those of such parents, who in your preachings are noted for no believers, so in your proofes you overlash as much, and shoot far more wide from your <hi>Principle,</hi> and profess'd opinion, which is that no infants, but those of believers, have right to <hi>Baptism,</hi> when yet you huddle over all in such indefinite language as pleads the baptism of all infants as well as some.</p>

               </gap> 
               <hi>genius</hi> hath gull'd you all along, for verily if mine own <hi>Minerva</hi> may be credited by me, there's not one inch of <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> dictated to you, nor tittle of <hi>consequence</hi> brought by you for the evincing the right of the one to baptism, <hi>viz,</hi> the <hi>Infants of believers</hi>; but if it tended truely to such a purpose, it would tend as truely, and undeniably to evince the other, <hi>viz.</hi> the right of baptism to <hi>unbelievers Infants</hi> also, to whom (in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence) you deny it as well as we: yea I appeal to all rational men in the world to judge, whether you have brought one argument in either your <hi>Account,</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view,</hi> which may not as well be used (though thats ill enough too) on behalf of one of these sorts of Infants, as to the clearing their right to baptism, as of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
            <p>There is but four <hi>general heads</hi> (for all the rest of your proofs are but <hi>subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> to one or other of these) from whence you inferr not only that it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to baptize <hi>believers Infants</hi>; but also that it is wickedness to deny it, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, The being, and appearing of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> to be in <hi>Believers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Deteriorty</hi> of the Gospel-Covenant Comparatively to that of the Law, if when little infants of the <hi>Iews</hi> were all circumcised, little infants of <hi>believing parents</hi> may not now be baptized.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Desperateness</hi> or <hi>Cruelty</hi> that is in the denyall of <hi>Baptism</hi> to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants</hi> of <hi>believing parents,</hi> or the destructiveness thereof to all hope of their salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the hearts of their parents, and down-right endangering their <hi>Damnation</hi> (so dying) if <hi>baptism</hi> be denyed them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The practise of the <hi>Vniversall Church,</hi> which having for many hundred years together administred <hi>baptism</hi> to infants, may not without <hi>damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blasphemy</hi> be once thought to have erred so long a time, in so necessary a matter as <hi>baptism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which four considerations (not to speak as yet of their utter invalidity to prove the <hi>baptism</hi> of any infants at all, for so I must do by and by) I am now to shew how they do not a jot more prove the warrantableness of baptizing of <hi>belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers infants,</hi> to whom we deny that Ordinance, then of the infants of very <hi>Infidells,</hi> and <hi>unbelievers,</hi> to whom your selves <hi>Doctrinally</hi> deny it also.</p>
            <p>As for the last, which ile begin with first, and so go back to that which is first indeed, <hi>viz. the practise of the universal or Catholique Church</hi>; I confess indeed that what you, and the <hi>Pope</hi> too do call the <hi>universal Church, viz. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome,</hi> or to use your own phrase, the <hi>Christian</hi> world, which with me ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, and hath been for many ages <hi>Antichristian,</hi> that vast voluminous <hi>Church body,</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiasticall Empire,</hi> or seven headed, ten horned <hi>universall beast,</hi> that the Whore, or <hi>CCClergy</hi> hath so <hi>universally bejaded,</hi> this hath <hi>universally baptizid,</hi> or rather but <hi>rantized infants,</hi> universally I say, not only in respect of time, and place, <hi>i. e.</hi> in every nation, province, and parish within her <hi>Verg,</hi> in every age of her <hi>Reign,</hi> but also in respect, of the subject, <hi>viz.</hi> all infants that are born in those several nations of what parents soever, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>believers</hi> or <hi>unbelievers,</hi> without exception, and by so much more to infants of very <hi>unbelievers</hi> then of <hi>believers,</hi> by how much (as your selves witness in your pulpits) <hi>Christs flock</hi> in respect of the rest, that are none of his, even in <hi>Christendome</hi> it self, is but a <hi>little flock,</hi> yea and the number of <hi>unbelievers,</hi> in the very Protestant, and most reformed nations of it, which dispense <hi>baptism</hi> to infants as universally as the other, is even many to one surpassing the number of <hi>believers</hi>: But <hi>Sirs,</hi> what is all this to you purpose, I say to your purpose, which
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:109011:41"/>
is to prove by example of the <hi>universall Church,</hi> the practise of <hi>baptism</hi> to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of believers</hi> onely? Suppose this, which you mistake so to be, were the true <hi>Church of God</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> indeed, and that her practise were set for our example, and such a true <hi>Topick,</hi> as <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi> make it, from whence to fetch good warrant to do the like, yet I pray <hi>Sirs,</hi> doth it not as well warrant the <hi>baptism</hi> of <hi>unbelievers infants,</hi> against which you plead, together with us, as of such infants as are born of <hi>believing parents</hi> only, the <hi>baptism</hi> of which infants on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you plead against us? will you argue from the <hi>universality</hi> of the <hi>Christian</hi> worlds doings to the particularity of your own sayings, as if the <hi>universal baptizing</hi> of all <hi>unbelievers infants,</hi> as well as others in all <hi>Christendome</hi> were an Argument <hi>ab exemplo,</hi> and a plain; <hi>As for Example,</hi> that the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of believers</hi> only are to be baptized? <hi>Sirs,</hi> what if a man were minded <hi>in jest</hi> to become a fool so far, in order to the convicting you of folly, as to maintain against you, who deny it, that not <hi>believers infants</hi> onely, but those of <hi>unbelievers</hi> also must be baptized, and should argue this <hi>ab exemplo,</hi> might he not (as D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Featly</hi> saies to us in another case) kill <hi>you</hi> with <hi>your</hi> own <hi>Dudgen dagger</hi>? for seriously <hi>Sirs,</hi> as far as that example is of force, it overturns your turn, who use it, in the thing in order to which <hi>you</hi> alledge it, and overthrows you clearly in <hi>your</hi> question, as <hi>you</hi> state it, and in <hi>your</hi> tenet of a right to <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi> for only <hi>believers infants</hi>; exemplifying rather, if the example were to be heeded, the baptizing, not of such <hi>infants only</hi> as are born of <hi>believing pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi> which we are against, but such as are born of <hi>unbelieving parents also,</hi> whose <hi>baptism your</hi> selves are against, as well as we.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ad hominem</hi> therefore I conclude, and <hi>ab exemplo</hi> on behalf of <hi>unbelievers infants,</hi> as <hi>your</hi> selves do from the same head on behalf of <hi>believers infants on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To hold that the <hi>universal Church,</hi> or <hi>Christian</hi> world hath erred in so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary a matter as <hi>baptism,</hi> for so many hundred years, is little less than <hi>damnable blasphemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to hold it an error to <hi>baptize</hi> the infants, that are born of <hi>unbelieving pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi> is to hold that the <hi>universal Church,</hi> or <hi>Christian world,</hi> which hath <hi>baptized</hi> in <hi>suo genere</hi> such as well as others, hath so long erred, in so necessary a matter as baptism.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo</hi> to hold it an error to baptise the infants that are born of <hi>unbelieving pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi> is little less then <hi>damnable blasphemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Argument whereby you strive to evince <hi>your</hi> opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism of believers infants</hi> above other <hi>infants,</hi> and to evade ours, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of baptism</hi> to them both alike, as <hi>desperate</hi> and <hi>ungodly,</hi> is drawn from the danger of their damnation if it be denied them, and the <hi>destructiveness</hi> of that denyal to all that hope, that else may be had of their salvation, which if it be of force, doth it not cry out as loud against <hi>your</hi> desperate, and ungodly cruelty on behalf of those millions of innocents of infidells, <hi>dying infants,</hi> to whom in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and doctrinally <hi>you deny baptism</hi> as well as we, as it doth on behalf of <hi>believers infants,</hi> who are no more innocent then the other, to whom we deny it also? for if it be such a business, as not we, but you, and the rest of the right <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Priests</hi> seem to make it, the denial of which, <hi>de jure &amp; facta,</hi> damnes so down-rightly the <hi>infants dying</hi> without it, that there's <hi>no hope</hi> to be had of their salvation, so <hi>you say,</hi> or else my <hi>shallow noddle</hi> cannot reach the profoundity of your purpose, in pettering out that pure pious piece of sense which with this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of <hi>yours</hi> is stuffed pag. 13. then its high time, as high a degree of <hi>charity</hi> as <hi>you</hi> would be thought to have towards a few <hi>infants, viz.</hi> one of a hundred, for scarely so many are true <hi>believers infants</hi> to the rest, to plead for the baptism of <hi>unbelievers infants</hi> too, and stand up in the cause of those <hi>innumerable</hi> poor <hi>babes,</hi> that cannot speak a word for themselves against your <hi>Cruelties,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:109011:42"/>
baptism to them, and deny all <hi>hope</hi> of their <hi>salvation</hi> to whom (they so <hi>dying</hi>) it is deni'd: <hi>yea verily Sirs</hi> perswade us to that once, and make us believe that <hi>popish trumpery,</hi> that the <hi>deniall</hi> of <hi>baptism</hi> to any <hi>infants</hi> doth so much as <hi>doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi> damn them, and then I'le plead for <hi>baptizing</hi> of <hi>infants</hi> in a larger way then you who confine it to <hi>believers infants onely, viz.</hi> for the <hi>baptism</hi> of all <hi>babes</hi> and <hi>sucklings</hi> in the world, and that least they die, and so be damn'd before it be dispensed to them so soon as they are well out of the womb: so far are we from that <hi>cruelty</hi> to <hi>infants,</hi> which <hi>you</hi> (<hi>commonly,</hi> though not <hi>properly</hi>) charge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, tha if we thought as <hi>you</hi> think (but <hi>Sirs</hi> mistake us not, for we have good ground to act more <hi>charity</hi> then <hi>your</hi> selves do to all <hi>dying infants</hi>) could we think I <hi>say</hi> that their <hi>salvation</hi> did so depend upon their <hi>baptism,</hi> that their <hi>damnation</hi> would be the issue of denying it, we durst not be so <hi>desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cruell</hi> as <hi>your</hi> selves, nor limit it to some one infant of an hundred, know <hi>Sirs</hi> we are tender in our construction of the condition of all that die in such <hi>minority</hi> as you <hi>sprinkle</hi> in, before they have known or done ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or evil, and are well assured there's no <hi>damnation</hi> to such, of what pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents soever descended, and as little need of your <hi>Rantism</hi> to their salvation; but for you who are so seemingly <hi>compassionate</hi> and <hi>charitable</hi> to a few, how <hi>churlish</hi> are you to a hundred to one, whilst your <hi>cruel doctrine</hi> (excepting such as are born of believers onely) curses all the rest unavoidably to hell? you talk much of your own <hi>charity</hi> to infants, and our <hi>cruelty</hi>; but truly <hi>Sirs</hi> I dare tell you that your <hi>tender mercies</hi> to that age of <hi>infancy</hi> are meer <hi>cruelty,</hi> so long as in your <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish dotage</hi> on some, you send so many packing to perdition; and as <hi>unchristian</hi> as our <hi>cruelty</hi> is, it hath more tender mercy in it to the whole <hi>infancy</hi> of the world, then all your <hi>Christian charity</hi> doth yet amount to; for as you prescribe it p. 5.

            <p>That opinion which destroyes <hi>all hopes</hi> of the <hi>salvation</hi> of many dying infants to one in the world, yea, in the very <hi>Christian</hi> world too, is a most desperate, ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, uncharitable opinion.</p>

            <p>If that opinion which denies baptism to little children, makes the Gospel-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant worse then that under the <hi>law,</hi> then the opinion of those Priests, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny baptism to all unbelievers infants, whereby not a moity onely, but most of the Christian world, in which the most are unbelievers, are cut off from being members of the Church, makes the Gospel-Covenant worse then the <hi>law.</hi>

            <p>But (though not <hi>veraciter,</hi> yet <hi>secundum te O Presbiter</hi>) that opinion which denies baptism to little children, whereby a moity of the Christian world is so cut off, makes the Gospel-Covenant worse then that under the <hi>law.</hi>

            <p>Another curious conceit, whereby you undertake to clear the right of baptizing the infants of believing parents above others, is the being, and plain, yea more plain appearing of the holy spirit to be in these children then in others, or then in men, whom we baptize that make profession, which plain and sufficient appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance (so you stile it p. 5) of the spirits being in these children, is made (say you) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waies, First by these infants faith, Secondly, by these infants holiness, Thirdly by those Eulogies that are given to these children in Scriptures, not inferiour to those

               <p>But above all, the most undoubted reason of all the rest, which to me doth, and may to any one most plainly clear it, that he means not infants is even this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry expression, <hi>viz.</hi> [which believe in me] whereby he denotes and denominates his disciples distinctly enough from all little infants, who are in no wise capable to do that he here ascribes to the other, <hi>i. e.</hi> to believe in Christ, for this infants being utterly uncapable to do, it shews plainly that he means not them: whereas Mr. <hi>Willcock,</hi> whose argument this was, and whose urging it ore again in print if this be, it shall not trouble my conscience, if it do not his own, whereas he I say argues thus, <hi>viz. [These little ones which believe in me]</hi> therefore <hi>infants</hi> do believe, I argue quite contrary from the same Scripture thus, <hi>viz.</hi> these of whom Christ speaks <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.6. did believe, therefore they could not be infants, who cannot possibly believe.</p>
               <p>And if you ask me how I prove it that infants cannot believe, I might answer out of the mouth of <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 18.14. how can they believe on him of whom they have not heard? but sith you have a reply to this, p. 18 Ile onely hint that here, and handle it further, as I have occasion given me to do by your answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, as our objection, when <hi>I</hi> come to <hi>review</hi> your <hi>review,</hi> and at present prove the matter out of Mr. <hi>Willcocks</hi> own mouth, that infants cannot believe, for to believe is to act faith, and <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:109011:47"/>
to <hi>insensible</hi> things, which can properly be done by none possibly but men at years, as not onely <hi>David</hi> is said to be made to hope in <hi>God</hi> while he hung upon the breasts, because God indeed was, even then the God that did defend him, yea as well in as from his mothers womb, though he was never sensible of, nor acquainted with it, so as to hope it in the womb, but the whole creation also figuratively, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.19, 20, 21, 22. is said to <hi>groan, wait, hope, desire, expect</hi> deliverance, because it stands in need of it, from the bondage of corruption, and God also hath determined the time wherein by Christ to redeem it, though many creatures under the curse are no more sensible of it, or capable to groan, then the <hi>fruitless fig tree</hi> Christ cursed, and the Ox, Ass, Horse, Sheep, and sensible creatures that may <hi>groan</hi> are capable to hope for, and expect such a glorious day as shall once come to the creation: thus figuratively indeed infants may be said to believe on Christ because they have need of his protection, and all the help they then have comes from him also, though in infancy they knew it not, nor him, so as actually to hope and trust in him for it, or properly to believe in his name, even more then <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate creatures</hi> in the other case, this is the first way, whereby you profess to prove <hi>infants of believing parent onely</hi> (if you speak to your proposed purpose) to have faith, which how weak it is the weakest eye may discern it, that is not disposed to be blind, and the second is like unto it, which is as followeth, by two arguments of inconsequence.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sirs,</hi> give me leave to make an answer by these ensuing Interrogatories, and I'le expect your Answer to them again; had the <hi>children of the Iews faith</hi>? and did God himself witness that they had it, by setting Circumcision to them as his seal of it, <hi>i. e.</hi> (for thats the sense in which you take the word seal) to assure men that they had it? and is it the consequent that the children of believing pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents have it now? let me then ask you.</p>
               <p>First do you conclude that all the children of believing parents have it now? that I think for shame you will not say, sith every experience witnesses the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; or that some believers children have it now, therefore all believers children are to be baptized? and if so, that is as silly an inference, as if you had argued thus, <hi>viz.</hi> some people believe therefore all must be baptized,</p>
               <p>Secondly, had the Jews children faith? first I wonder how they came by it, sith the word saies faith comes by hearing, and how can there be believing on him of whom they have not heard? and how can they hear without a preacher? and how can they preach except they be sent? and how can they be sent to preach to infants that understand not what is said? except you say (as you are fain to do, not for want of blindness p. 18.) that <hi>infants have an hearing, and the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:109011:47"/>
spirit works upon them miraculously, and yet not extraordinarily neither, but in that ordinary way as he doth on men,</hi> in the <hi>conversion</hi> of whom you say the spirits working is but ordinary, and yet miraculous too, which <hi>Popish Bull</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves well to be baited, but ile fotbear to fall upon it, till I meet it in its proper place in the <hi>Review.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, when had they it begotten in them? in the womb? or if after birth, on what day on the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>, 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, or 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>? for on some of these they received it, if on the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day they were (as <hi>you say they</hi> were) <hi>circumcis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> in token that they had it; but I muse, and am yet to learn on which, and so are your selves too I believe, for all your confidence in asserting it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, was <hi>Circumcision Gods</hi> witness, yea <hi>Gods</hi> seal to assure men of thus much, that those children to whom it was set had faith?</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Risum teneatis amici</hi>? did you ever read or hear that <hi>circumcision</hi> was set to infants to this end, <hi>viz.</hi> to testifie to the world that they had faith? was it set to <hi>Ishmael</hi> as Gods witness that <hi>Ishmael</hi> had faith? was it set to <hi>Esau</hi> as Gods witness that <hi>Esau</hi> had faith, when <hi>God</hi> who would not witness a ly, knew that neither the one of these had it, nor yet the other? unless they lost it again, which sure you will not say; for shame leave such sorry <hi>Shuffles,</hi> are your <hi>Masters in Israel</hi> and know not this that <hi>Circumcision</hi> was set to the <hi>Iews</hi> children, not to shew others that they did believe, but as a <hi>permanent sign</hi> thereof to shew them when they should be at years to take notice of it by sight (as of that transient, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen sign of sprinkling in infancy they cannot do) what things they then should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ to come of <hi>Abraham</hi> after the flesh, and <hi>circumcision</hi> of their hearts by him, &amp;c. was it ever set under this notion as a seal of faith to any person in the world save to <hi>Abrahams</hi> proper person only, to whom too twas a seal not so much to witness, or assure men that he had faith, as to honor that faith, that more <hi>evidently,</hi> and <hi>eminently</hi> then ordinary he had before, with that famous title <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Father of the faithful</hi>? therefore circumcision as given to <hi>Abraham</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. is not said to be the seal of the righteousness of faith (as you cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly rehearse the words leaving out the residue of the verse, which makes them relate to <hi>Abraham</hi> only, as if it had stood as a seal in such a sense to all <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> posterity) but a seal of the righteousness of the faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> that famous faith which he himself had, and to this end that he might be (as none of his meer flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seed ever were) the Father of all them that believe. Secondly, if <hi>circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> were Gods witness that these infants, to whom it was dispensed, had faith, then certainly baptism, which with you at least is of such <hi>Analogy</hi> and <hi>Identity</hi> with <hi>Circumcision,</hi> that it hath the same <hi>subjects</hi> and <hi>significations,</hi> must also with you be Gods witness to others that those infants to whom it is dispensed have faith also, and if so then I must make bold to ask you two things:</p>
               <p>First, Is not this <hi>round about our coal fire,</hi> to prove two things no otherwise then one by another? for when you prove that children are to be circumcised, or <hi>baptized</hi> (which with you is all one, who falsly call baptism (as <hi>Paul</hi> doth not in <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12 for he means another thing by that phrase, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the heart) the <hi>circumcision without hands</hi>) I say when you prove, that children are to be circumcised either one way or other in answer to our why? you say because they have faith and thereby right to the Covenant, and the seals of it; but when you come to prove that children have faith, which we deny, you say tis clear because they have circumcision, and baptism, which are Gods witnesses, seals or evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences to us that they have it: this is not <hi>Idem per Idem,</hi> the same by the same, that is too <hi>effeminate</hi> a probation, but tis <hi>eadem inter se,</hi> or <hi>per se invicem,</hi> the same things reciprocally by each other, and well nigh as <hi>womanish</hi> as that; for whether is it better to say they have it because they have it, or to <hi>say</hi> it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent they have this because <hi>they</hi> have that, and that being as much doubted to clear it thus, <hi>viz.</hi> it is apparent they have that because they have this; and if
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:109011:48"/>
these two <hi>viz.</hi> faith and baptism, faith and Circumcision, did <hi>ponere se invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem,</hi> so that one could not possibly be without the other, they might the better <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare se invicem,</hi> but 'tis not so, for as <hi>faith</hi> may possibly be where neither <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision</hi> nor <hi>baptism</hi> are dispensed, witness the thief on the <hi>Cross,</hi> so ther's nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them but may be, and is too too much dispensed where faith is not.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let me ask you, is <hi>Gods</hi> witness, <hi>Gods</hi> testimony true, or is it false? for say you God himself did witness it, that the children of the Iews, <hi>i. e.</hi> in infancy had faith: false you dare not say it is, nay you do not, but rather p. 5. that <hi>his testimony</hi> as to the truth of it, <hi>is to be preferred before mans,</hi> yea I say let God be true, and every man a liar, but if it be true, how then appears it to be so, if your testimony be not false? how then came it to pass that the most of the <hi>Iews</hi> and their children sucessively in all generations had not faith when they came to years? for it's most evident that most of them were unbelievers, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could not enter into their rest; but their carcasses fell in the wilderness; I know but two shifts you can make, and 'tis much at a pass which you take, for you will contradict your selves in either of them both, for surely, either they fell from that grace (as those infants do also whom you sprinkle from that faith which (as you say and seem to see) once they had) and this flatly contradicts your own doctrine of <hi>impossibility of falling from faith,</hi> or else they never had any such faith as you say they had in infancy, and then either <hi>Gods witness</hi> of such a thing must be <hi>a lye,</hi> which what horrid <hi>heresie</hi> were it to think, and <hi>abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blasphemy</hi> once to utter? or else <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Circumcision</hi> never witnessed such a thing, and that flatly contradicts <hi>your Antecedent,</hi> and so your selves will be found <hi>false witnesses</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> because you have testified of him that he himself did witness by <hi>Circumcision,</hi> that the children of the <hi>Iews</hi> had faith, when he never wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed it at all.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the fourrh grand <hi>Interrrgatory</hi> is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sirs,</hi> what children of the Jews had faith in their infancy witnessed by <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,</hi> were they the children of the <hi>believing</hi> or <hi>unbelieving</hi> Jews? for you are shy me thinks of expressing too often which you mean, and proceeed as <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely,</hi> that you may deceive as <hi>indiscernably</hi> as you can, if of the <hi>unbelievers</hi> then is not this goodly disputing, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <p>Children of the unbelieving Iews had faith and circumcision.</p>
                     <p>Ergo, children of believing Gentiles onely have faith, and must have bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Is not this goodly doing (if 'twere your practise as strictly as 'tis your <hi>plea</hi>) to <hi>baptize</hi> onely <hi>believers children</hi> now upon their own faith, because <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers children</hi> of old were circumcised upon their own faith? this straitens the grace of God under the Gospel, in comparison of the largness of it under the law, for then all children of unbeliving Iewes were circumcised by his appointment, as well as the <hi>infants of believers</hi>; Answerably to which, if you go by that rule, you should conclude thus, <hi>uiz.</hi> all the Gentiles children should be baptized now, as well those of unbelievers as believers', but you turn out unbelievers children from the priviledge, that unbelievers children had before, but if you say children of believing Jews onely had faith then, therefore of believing parents now, then first how doth your Argument and proof drawn from Gods witnessing by Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision that there was faith in the Infants, hold any more to the proof of it in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers infants, then in unbelievers, for he set Circumcision to the infants of the <hi>wicked and unbelievers</hi> among the Jews as well as of the <hi>godly and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, how doth it appear at all that godly and believing parents children then had faith more usually then children of ungodly parents? when good <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> had two vile sonnes <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas,</hi> good <hi>David,</hi> wicked <hi>Absolom,</hi> good <hi>Solomon,</hi> wicked <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> good <hi>Iehosaphat,</hi> wicked <hi>Ioram,</hi> good
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:109011:48"/>
                  <hi>Iosiah,</hi> wicked <hi>Iechoniah</hi> and his brethren, &amp;c. when contrariwise wicked <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haz</hi> begat good <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> wicked <hi>Abia,</hi> good <hi>Asa,</hi> wicked <hi>Amon,</hi> good <hi>Iosia,</hi>, which shews that faith is not entail'd from parents to posterity as you would make it.</p>
               <p>Thus I have spoken to your first way, wherby you prove <hi>Infants of believers</hi> to have the <hi>spirit,</hi> and thereupon right to <hi>baptism, viz.</hi> their faith, and to a first and second of those whereby you seem to prove them to believe, there is yet a third way whereby you would make men believe that Infants of believers do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, <hi>viz.</hi> their <hi>Iustification,</hi> without which there is no <hi>salvation,</hi> but because that's not inserted here at all, but toward the end of the <hi>disputation,</hi> and is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted most vigorously in your Review, I will suspend the prosecution of that head, till I come thither, and proceed next to a consideration of the second, third, fourth and fifth ways, as they lie in order, whereby you would prove believers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to have the spirit, above the infants of unbelievers.</p>

               <p>The next thing whereby you offer proof of it that infants of believing parents onely (remember these still are the subject on which you pretend to proceed, and predicate that these denominants, <hi>viz.</hi> the spirit, faith, holiness &amp;c.) that these I say have the holy spirit, is their holiness from whence you confess here that there was no Argument taken, that is to say, 'twas not proved, and yet a little above p. 3. in the fourth and fifth line of this <hi>sum, aliâs</hi> some of your disputation, you as <hi>blindly</hi> as <hi>boldly</hi> bolt it out, that it was proved by their holiness: the Apocali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptical beast that was and yet was not, scarcely seems more Apocriphal to you, then this was and was not of yours seems Apoplexical, or brainsick to me: This <hi>True-ly</hi> might have been rankt among the rest in your true Account, but to let it pass thus, this cannot but be granted for a truth, that you made as if you would have proved it by their holiness, that infants of <hi>believers</hi> have the spirit, but did not, because I wisht you (but (fool that I was) I have been sorry since that I did at all wish you) to forbear it, for as I was not affraid to give way to your proof then (save onely that I was well aware you would but trifle) so since I marvelled a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more upon the matter, I have found it of more facillity to prove <hi>infants-sprin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kling</hi> by the <hi>popes holiness,</hi> whose <hi>mandamus</hi> it is, then by any holiness of their own.</p>

               </p>
               <p>If <hi>you say</hi> the third, then pray tell me three things.</p>
               <p>First, How its discovered to you, or how you know that theirs such a <hi>habit of holyness</hi> infused into believers infants in that <hi>non-age</hi> whereupon you build your boldness to <hi>baptize</hi> them? for by the fruits only it is that we can know persons <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.6. to be good or evil, and <hi>you</hi> confess pag. 8. that <hi>infants have not the exercise and fruit of faith,</hi> and commonly in <hi>your pulpits</hi> that <hi>holiness</hi> is the fruit of faith, and <hi>Iames</hi> challenges any one if he can to shew him his faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his works, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.18. yea <hi>you say</hi> plainly that the <hi>seed of faith sown after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scovers it self when the season comes p.</hi> 8. <hi>and that no judgement of science can be passed, till the acts themselves be seen, and examined for</hi> a posteriore <hi>only</hi> (mark that word <hi>only</hi>) <hi>the discovery of habits is made,</hi> these are your own sayings in <hi>your Review</hi> p. 18. whereby you plainly <hi>unsay</hi> all that here <hi>you</hi> say of believers infants faith, and holiness, for if it be so that the discovery of these habits is only <hi>a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriore, i. e.</hi> by the fruits, exercises, and acts, and that <hi>Infants</hi> have not these, then how I trow have <hi>you</hi> the discovery of it at all, before the season, that these habits are in them? <hi>yet</hi> such is your shameless inconsiderateness, and custome of contradicting <hi>your</hi> selves, that <hi>you</hi> pretend to a <hi>discovery</hi> of it so farr as to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt here the discovery of it to the world: will <hi>you</hi> allwaies feed the world thus with your own groundless fancies, and fashion it in religion according to <hi>your own</hi> careless conception? will <hi>you</hi> alwaies affirm things so to be, and venture to make them known, and <hi>yet</hi> confess they cannot be known too? <hi>O curas hominum o quantum est in rebus mane!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, pray tell me how this holiness, which you assert to be in believers infants whereby <hi>you</hi> would make it appear that they have the <hi>spirit,</hi> doth appear any more to be in them then the <hi>spirit</hi> it self; are they not both a like dark to us, and unapparent? <hi>yet you</hi> profess to prove the one of these by the other thus, they have <hi>holyness</hi> therefore the <hi>spirit,</hi> and if to one querying, how you know they have <hi>holiness</hi>? you should say thus they have the <hi>spirit,</hi> therefore <hi>holyness,</hi> 'twere a <hi>proof</hi> no more <hi>impregnant</hi> then the other, for <hi>you</hi> could do more then leave the people, whose <hi>blind guides you</hi> are, as much in the dark as before, by this, and by that I am sure you do no less: when men fall to proving (as you have done hitherto all along in <hi>your Disputation</hi>) things <hi>undiscernable</hi> by things as <hi>undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable</hi> as the other, and things that appear not at all, by things that appear no more at all then those they would make to appear by them,
<q>
                     <l>Nescio an anticyram ratio illis destinet omnem.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, I pray tell me how this holiness appears to be in believers infants whom thereupon you would have to be baptized, more then in unbelievers infants whom (though in <hi>your practise you</hi> promiscuously admit them with the other <hi>yet</hi>) in <hi>your proofs you</hi> except from your baptism? is there any more <hi>Specimen</hi> or shew of holiness in them then in these? the best spectacles that ever I beheld with, could never behold it; Is there any <hi>more capableness</hi> of such an <hi>Infusion</hi> of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, or of having such an habit infused? Is there any <hi>experience</hi> of it when they come to years that the infants of believers had this holiness in their infancy and unbelievers infants had not? if so, how is it that when they are grown, the children of unbelievers have holiness very often, when as oft the other prove wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and have not? (have a care of your shinnes (good now) by all means)
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:109011:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
do the children of believers fall from it? is there any promise of God, whereby he stands ingaged to infuse holiness into these infants in infancy, when he will not infuse it into the other? and if so, how it is it that <hi>we must necessarily hold</hi> (for so <hi>you say your</hi> own selves in <hi>your Review</hi> p. 18.) <hi>that God is not bound</hi> (for if he hath promised it as <hi>you say</hi> he hath <hi>Acts</hi> 2. then he is bound) <hi>to work it in all the children of Christian parents, nor barred from working it in any of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of infidels</hi>? Is there any <hi>promptness</hi> to acts of holiness, whence only <hi>you</hi> can clearly argue <hi>ad positionem habitus,</hi> in that infancy in which <hi>you</hi> sprinkle them, in believers infants than in the other? all <hi>your</hi> skill in <hi>Physiogmony</hi> can never find it: or can <hi>you</hi> argue <hi>ad negationem habitus,</hi> to no holiness in an infidels infant more then in anothers? <hi>your very</hi> selves acknowledge you cannot: if not, why more I wonder <hi>ad negationem spiritus? why</hi> more <hi>ad negationem baptismi? why</hi> more <hi>ad negationem nugationis istius vestrae, viz.</hi> your trivial <hi>new way,</hi> or rather <hi>no way</hi> of baptism? to which if it were baptism indeed, you must admit, if not all, then not at all in time of infancy, or else <hi>your</hi> absurdities are unsuffrable, <hi>Sirs</hi> suffer me to come cross to <hi>you,</hi> and hit you home with your own <hi>cross interrogatory</hi> p. 18. are those infants of infidels, between whom, and those of believers, <hi>you objectors</hi> will admit no comparison, inclinable to acts of holiness? or not? if the former, it presupposes then that infidels infants have the habit also as much as the other, and so the working in them, and those born of believing parents may be one, and so their holiness, and faith, and spiritualness, and baptism be one too, which all <hi>your Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> doth deny; if the latter, I freely confess these are not inclinable, nor <hi>yet</hi> the other neither.</p>
               <p>These premised the Answer is in your own very words pag. 18. <hi>That unless it could be certainly presumed what children have the habit,</hi> i. e. <hi>of faith, holiness, what have not, the working of the spirit is not known to us, he is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bound nor barr'd there can be no conclusion made,</hi> and therefore <hi>Quis nisi mentis inops</hi> &amp;c. how justly may they be concluded by themselves, as well as by others, to have <hi>hand plus cerebri quam cimax sanguinis,</hi> and no more under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing then those whose right eye is utterly darkned, who premising these sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences themselves, do for all that make this conclusion, <hi>viz.</hi> that these infants have faith, Holiness, the Spirit, and thereby right to baptism above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>Or secondly <hi>Sirs</hi> do <hi>ye</hi> mean by it some <hi>Negative</hi> holiness, consisting in their being without sin, and having yet no wickedness, and prophanness, the thing, which (and more properly by farr) <hi>you</hi> stile <hi>innocency</hi> in the next words? though yet <hi>o curious criss-cross</hi> you will not hold them guiltless neither: if so, for <hi>my</hi> part I give <hi>you</hi> in <hi>my</hi> assent to it, that infants are innocent, but I cannot help it if it do <hi>you</hi> no good in <hi>your</hi> cause, for first are infants of believers <hi>any</hi> more innocent in time of infancie then the rest? how so? not by birth, for they are all alike born in sin, <hi>secundum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e,</hi> not in life, for it cannot appear that the one have more blurr'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or <hi>barr'd themselves by any actual sin</hi> from baptism (if innocency be that which intitles to it) then the other</p>
               <p>But secondly to say the truth <hi>Sirs</hi> so far is baptism from being intailed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents, and holy ones only, as their only right, that it belongs rather only unto sinners, for though Christ for examples sake, and for other ends, submitted to it, who yet had no sin of his own, but he had ours by imputation, yet the most proper use of it to all else that submit is to signifie the <hi>remission of their sins Mat.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.3 <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. <hi>Act.</hi> 22.16.</p>
               <p>If believers infants therefore be so <hi>righteous, holy,</hi> i. e. <hi>innocent, &amp;c.</hi> as <hi>you</hi> make them, and I dare not deny but that they are, nor dare I saie otherwise for the world of other infants in infancie, having more <hi>charity</hi> than <hi>your</hi> selves, even so much as to presume <hi>unumquem<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> bonum nisi constet de malo, they</hi> are so little inrighted to baptism thereupon, that till they sin <hi>they</hi> are much rather exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:109011:50"/>
from it: for if baptism be a sign to signifie to him who submits to it, the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of his sinnes in plurali,</hi> (as <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. and in all other places it seems to be) then its utterly usless to such (and therefore to infants) as, being yet under no <hi>Commission of sinnes,</hi> need yet no sign of <hi>Remission</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>Secondly. <hi>Matrimonial</hi> holiness I call that, which arises from the <hi>conjugati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>two viz,</hi> one man and one woman only into <hi>one flesh,</hi> according to <hi>Gods</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordinance and institution; the subject of which holiness is not onely <hi>marriage</hi> it self, and the <hi>marriage bed,</hi> which is said to be <hi>honourable</hi> among all men, and <hi>undefiled,</hi> or which is all one, to be <hi>holy, Heb.</hi> 13.4. but also the <hi>married persons</hi> of what rank, quality, religion soever, when once come into that <hi>conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall</hi> relation, whether both or either or neither of them be believers; and the <hi>seed</hi> or infants that are born of them in that condition, which are called by <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.15. a <hi>seed</hi> of his own seeking, a <hi>godly seed,</hi> or <hi>seed of God,</hi> which he owns as truly, lawfully, honestly, holily begotten, according to his own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appointment, and not basely, beastly, trecherously, adulterously, nor corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as those are which are not begotten in the bed.</p>
               <p>Opposite to this holiness, these holy ones (I mean the married couples, and their holy seed) are all the lusts of concupisence, objected on strange flesh; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4.7. adultery, fornication, and unclean agents, <hi>i. e.</hi> adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers; and the unclean issues of the adulterous bed, <hi>viz,</hi> the adulterous brood, or the seed of the adulterer and the whore <hi>Isa.</hi> 57.3.</p>
               <p>This kind of holiness I dare say you do not mean, yea the most of you will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be perswaded that there's any such kind of holiness at all, or if you be it makes nothing for your purpose, for what if infants of believing parents be (as infants of unbelieving parents also are, when begotten in lawfull wedlock) holy in such a sense, doth this tend at all to prove them to have the holy spirit, which is the thing in hand? yet this even this, and no other is all the holiness meant by <hi>Paul</hi> 1 Cor. 7.14. where he saith, <hi>else were your children unclean, but now are they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> that very place which your selves so often send us to, for proof thereof, when we deny your Antecedent in this consequence, <hi>viz. Infants of believers are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, therefore to be baptized</hi>: This that I say as 'tis not deni'd (to my knowledge) by some that are for infants baptism, so is it most undeniable to any that will but plainly and impartially consider the direct drift of the Apostle in the verse, which is not any such matter as to shew that there's such a sanctity in the unbelieving hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, or wife of believing yoke-fellows (for these are there said to be holy as well as the children, with the same holiness) and in their children also, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolles them all, <hi>viz.</hi> the unbelieving parties, and the children, as well as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving parties in the Covenant of grace, or in any such outward Church cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as inrights them to baptism, membership and fellowship in the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but to shew such a sanctity or holiness, as clears both their conjunctions, and conceptions to be pure and guiltless, such as frees their bed from the account of baseness, and their brood from the account of bastardy, both which in the sight of God and men would else be unholy, <hi>i. e.</hi> utterly unlawful and unclean: his scope is (I say) to convince them of the lawfulness of that state, <hi>i. e.</hi> of a believer and unbelievers being man and wife together, by the lawfulness of the seed that proceeds from them, and by both these not onely of the liberty and legality, but the duty also of their continuance together in that civil marriage relation, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding their different religion, as well as if they were in Religion one and the same: The Corinthians had written to him (it seems verse 1) about many cases; wherein they were scrupled, and among the rest about this, <hi>viz.</hi> whether a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band or wife comming into the faith, and leaving their yoke-fellows still in unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; might lawfully own and cleave to them still, as their true and lawful yoke-fellows, as before they did, when they were both in unbelief, or as they may one to another that are both in the faith, or whether they must not rather leave them
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:109011:50"/>
now, and disown them as to that old capacity, because of this spiritual difference that now was between them, in answer to which he tells them, that by all means if the unbelieving parties will be pleased still to abide with them, as before, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving parties must not depart, nor put away; and to satisfie them further in so doing, he renders them this good reason, <hi>viz.</hi> for <hi>the unbelieving wife is sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in, or to the husband, and the unbelieving husband to the wife,</hi> which is as much as if he had said, you are as true man and wife in the account of God as before, your marriage is an honourable, your bed as undefiled as before, your unbelieving husband or wife sanctified as a lawful companion to you as well as before, your living and lying together is as holy, and unblameable in the eyes of God as before, and to put this more out of doubt yet, least any should remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resolved, he minds them further by another argument (<hi>ab absurdo</hi>) the absurdity which they it seems were too inconsiderate of, that would follow upon it, if this were not so, for else (saith he) your children are unclean; <hi>else</hi> (that is) if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny your selves in this case of different Religion to be lawful man and wife together, you heed not (for wise men do not at all times see the ill consequences of things at present, as Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> well observes, and as stark m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>And here I cannot but note by the way how egregiously Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> pedles in a long prate to Mr, <hi>Tombes</hi> page 86, 87. about an impossibility of the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> knowing their seed to be legitimate, and yet doubting their <hi>marriage</hi> to be unlawful, whereas they might in general know it, and yet in special at this time not be so serious in considering it; and how impossible it was for <hi>Paul</hi> rationally to argue from the effect to the cause, so as to go about to convince them of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of their marriage, by a consideration of the lawfulness of their seed, which flowes from lawful marriage, and is a consequent, of which that is the cause: whereas <hi>in cognitione (praesertim confusà) effectus sunt priores causis</hi>: in order to such knowledge as the <hi>Apostle</hi> seeks here to beget them to, which was but as it were a certain remembrance of what they might have easily gathered of themselves, had they not been so forgetfull as to need a <hi>memorandum,</hi> 'tis not irrational to clear the <hi>cause</hi> by the <hi>effect,</hi> as to say there's <hi>smoak,</hi> therefore there's <hi>fire,</hi> yet the fire is the cause of the smoak, <hi>these infants</hi> are no <hi>bastards,</hi> but <hi>legitimate,</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their <hi>parents</hi> were married is the very same.</p>
               <p>This therefore I say again is all the holiness here intended. As for that <hi>federall holiness</hi> you fiddle men in the ear with as the <hi>only holiness</hi> here aim'd at, I confess I once rawly uttered it in discourse my self, when being a <hi>sprinkler of infants</hi> (as you are) and as stiff a stickler for that practise as the blindest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:109011:51"/>
as of a faederal holiness on that place, so upon a more serious search into its sense, I have found it my self so faulty, that if I had said a <hi>fiddlestick holiness,</hi> it had been but somewhat more ridiculous, so far is <hi>Paul</hi> from dilating on any such kind of holiness in that <hi>Scripture,</hi> where to convince them of a meer civil <hi>san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity,</hi> and to shew that <hi>different Religion</hi> destroies not any <hi>civil relation</hi> is verily the very utmost of his errand.</p>
               <p>To inculcate this <hi>yet</hi> a little more upon <hi>you,</hi> let me press <hi>you</hi> to lay to heart these few considerations.</p>
               <p>First that, as here in this fourteenth verse he shews that the civill relation, or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>utive</hi> holiness of the state between man and wife is not nullified by a difference about the faith, so but that they may abide together therein, though one be a believer, and the other an infidel, without any sin or guilt contracted to the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by such continuance in their contract, so in the following verses he shews that the civil relation, or civil sanctity of the State between <hi>Master</hi> and <hi>Servant</hi> is not nullified thereby, so but that they may lawfully live together in that state, though the <hi>Servant</hi> should be a believer, and the Master an infidel; or the <hi>Master</hi> a <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever</hi> and the <hi>Servant</hi> an <hi>Infidel</hi> ve. 21. <hi>art thou called being a Servant, i. e.</hi> to an unbelieving master, <hi>care not for it, i. e.</hi> distract not thy self about it, scruple it not solicitously, as if it were an unholy, unclean, unlawfull, or sinfull state for thee to remain in, for v. 22. <hi>he that is called in the Lord, i. e.</hi> to the faith being a <hi>Servant, i. e.</hi> in bondage to a Master not yet called, <hi>is Christs free man, i. e.</hi> acceptable to <hi>Christ,</hi> even in that state and relation to such a Master as before; and in the favour of <hi>Christ,</hi> as also <hi>he that is called being free,</hi> or a Master himself is <hi>Christs servant, i. e.</hi> one whom he owns for his, accepts and justifies, though happily he may be by covenant in relation still to unbelieving servants, he is holy, honorable, and undefiled in his state as a Master, and that by virtue of the Ordinance of <hi>Christ,</hi> who hath sanctified that condition and relation of Master, and Servant to each other, as holy for them to abide in together, though in <hi>Morall</hi> respects the person of one of them may be holy, and the other wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>The very like to which <hi>Pauls</hi> hints in his exhortation to servants, even of unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving masters, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.1. where he bids <hi>believing servants</hi> that are under the yoke, though to <hi>unbeliving Masters</hi> (for in that he saies &amp; they that have believing <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> in v. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it argues that he means such as have <hi>non-believing Masters</hi> in the first) That they should count them worthy of all <hi>honor</hi> because they are their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters still, by the ordinance of God that hath set and sanctified them in their place and station as <hi>honorable and holy,</hi> though in their persons and practise they may be <hi>contemptible, vile,</hi> and <hi>ungodly</hi>; the like he saies to <hi>Christians</hi> concerning civil <hi>Magistrates,</hi> though infidels, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. that being ordained of God and sanctified, or set apart as <hi>his Ministers</hi> for civil good, they are to have a reverend, honorable, and even holy estimation of them in their hearts, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in their subjection to them in matters civilly righteous, even for conscience sake.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, let it be considered that the holiness here predicated of the unbelieving parent and the children, is not such as is the result of the <hi>faith, and faederal holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of the believing parent, (as is so frequently asserted among you) but of the <hi>marriage Covenant,</hi> which being holy by institution, and honourable among all, and undefiled, gives the denomination of civil sanctity to the unbelieving couple and their seed, as to a couple of believers, and their seed, as also the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of honourable in an unbelieving magistrate and master arises, not from any <hi>praise worthy qualification</hi> in their persons, much less in the persons of the <hi>Correl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives,</hi> as you say the holinesse of the unbeliever doth from the faith of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, but from <hi>Divine ordination</hi> which constitutes them as holy in their places, this will be evident,</p>
               <p>First, if you consider the manner of speech here used by the Apostle, who saies, not the <hi>unbeliever</hi> is sanctified in the <hi>believing wife,</hi> and <hi>believing husband</hi> but in the <hi>wife,</hi> and in the <hi>husband, i. e.</hi> in her being his wife, and his being her husband, and howbeit its true, which is commonly return'd to this, <hi>viz.</hi> that 'tis the believing wife of the unbelieving husband, and the believing husband of the unbelieving wife, when the marriage is between <hi>believers</hi> and <hi>unbelievers,</hi> yet the believing party is not here preferred before the unbelieving parent, as to the conferring of this holinesse upon the issue, but they are said to be both, and that by your selves, who confesse they jointly make <hi>one holy root,</hi> equall in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, and are sanctified, not one by the faith of the other, as you suppose the unbeliever to be by the faith of the believer, but both by the <hi>ordinance of God, viz.</hi> their <hi>marriage</hi> each of other, so that they both alike do sanctifie the issue.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if you consider the true genuine proper direct tendency and weight of this <hi>Relative</hi> particle [<hi>else</hi>] which if you allow it a right reference, relates not to the faith or believing of either, but to their being true man and wife, to the lawful <hi>wedlock</hi> of them both; for that which is the ground of your error about this place is the forcing of this particle [<hi>else</hi>] the wrong way, for <hi>Else, i. e.</hi> (say you) if one of the parents be not a believer, then the children are unclean, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the sense of it runs thus, vix. <hi>else i. e.</hi> if you be not holy in your copulations, if you be not sanctified one in, to, and by the other as lawful man and wife, by your union formerly contracted, notwithstanding your now disunion in Religion, then your children are unclean, and this is truth, for so the children are in this ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil sense, if begotten, and born out of <hi>matrimony,</hi> whether the parents be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers or no, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, and this will yet appear more plainly, if you consider that faith alone in either one, or both the parents begetting <hi>out of wedlock</hi> cannot sanctifie the seed so begotten with this <hi>civil holiness</hi> here meant, no nor with that <hi>faederall holiness</hi> you plead for, nor could it do so even then, when that holinesse or birth privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge you talk of was in force (as now it is not) <hi>viz.</hi> in the daies of the law; for if two believers came together then, out of marriage their seed were not onely <hi>base born</hi>

               <p>Fourthly, if you more seriously consider, that the holinesse in the Infant here must needs be the fruit and result of that, and that must needs be the cause of the holiness here spoken of in the infant, <hi>quo posito ponitur sanctitas, sublato tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litur,</hi> which being in the parents, a holinesse must necessarily be thereupon, which not being in the parents, a holinesse cannot be in the seed: for <hi>positâ causà poni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur effectus sublata tollitur</hi>: abstract the cause and the effect cannot be: suppose the cause and the effect cannot but be: now that which if it be not in the parents the holiness is not, but being in them the holinesse is consequently in the infants, 'tis not the faith, but the <hi>conjugal</hi> or <hi>marriage</hi> Relation of the parents, for as for the first of these, <hi>viz.</hi> faith, it may be in one, yea in both of the parents, and yet no federal holinesse at all be in the infants, witness <hi>Ishmael</hi> the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of the faithful, and his Sons by <hi>Keturah</hi> also, born of him after Co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>venant made with him, and his seed in <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and yet neither of them in that Covenant, witnesse the <hi>base born</hi> children of true believers among the Jews, suppose <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Secondly, what will he get as to the point in hand by his <hi>Synonamizing</hi> faith and faederall holiness, for still neither the one nor the other is made here the cause of the holiness of the seed, for the holiness here spoken of may be where neither of them is, and may not be in the seed, even where they are both in the parent, as for example in <hi>Ezras</hi> time, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10, 3. we find abundance of the Jews, both Priests, and people, that were in the faith, or at least in faederall holiness, yet the children were put away as unholy, as well faederally as otherwise, because their <hi>marriage</hi> was unlawfull, and that <hi>bed adulterous</hi> wherein they lay with <hi>strange wives, Ezra</hi> 10.3. and that both parents possibly may be faithful, and faeder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally holy, and yet their seed be in all senses utterly unclean is evident, for the child of two believing Jews begotten besides the marriage bed, was both a <hi>Bastard,</hi> and also barr'd from the Congregation, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.2. again this faederal holiness as well as faith may be in neither parent, and yet the issue not be unclean, but holy still, and so are all (<hi>Matrimonially,</hi> and civilly at least) that among Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans are the issue of the <hi>marriage bed</hi>; and with the holiness of the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> too, when they come to years, and believe themselves, as not a few children of unbelievers do, and sometimes the seed of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> this therefore <hi>i. e.</hi> the faith, or faederal sanctity of the one parent, nor of both cannot be the cause of this sanctity, is here denominated of the seed, for holiness in the infants is not alwaies, when this is, and sometimes it is in the infant, when this is not in the parent, which being of each without other, cannot be between a true cause, and its effect; but as for the second <hi>viz.</hi> the marriage sanctity in the parents, it is that which being in the parents, holiness is naturally and necessarily in the seed that is born of them, whether they be both or either, or either in faith or unbelief, but being not in the parents, there can be no holiness, no <hi>birth holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> in their infants, nor <hi>Matrimonial,</hi> nor <hi>Congregationall</hi> neither: therefore this is that which is the cause of the holiness of the issue in this Scripture, the result of which, and not of faith in the parents, is this non-uncleanness in their posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and so I have done with this kind of holiness, and with this Scripture which speaks of this <hi>Matrimonial</hi> holiness and no other.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Ceremonial</hi> holiness, I call that same holiness which properly, pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly, and <hi>pro tempore</hi> only pertained to the whole nation, and congregation of <hi>Israel,</hi> denominating them <hi>all holy</hi> every one of them, and distinguishing them from all other people, and nations; which during the time of the <hi>Iews</hi> pedagogy, according to <hi>Gods</hi> own imposition were then accounted <hi>sinners, common,</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean</hi> by a certain <hi>

               <p>We can easily answer you to all this by distinguishing upon the promise, thus, The promise of the Gospel is either of salvation, life remission of sins, the holy spirit, as the earnest, and the inheritace it self to come, or else of external pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges only, and participations of Ordinances, as Baptism, Churchmember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship &amp;c. the promise of the eternal inheritance, life, and salvation we grant is not made, much less made good to any upon terms of the parents faith, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our own personal belief, and obedience, but the promise of outward priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and of right to participation of ordinances, as to be baptized, and inchurcht, this belongs to children upon their fathers faith, so that believers children are children of the promise in this sense, when others are not, and in this last sense it is that <hi>Peter</hi> saies the promise is to you, and to your Children &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> you and yours have the priviledge of right to baptism.</p>

For</p>
               <p>First, neither were these parents believers as yet when <hi>Peter</hi> said the promise is to you and to your children, but onely were pricked at the heart upon some measure of conviction, that the person whom they had crucified was the Lord of life, which thing the very <hi>Devils</hi> believe and tremble at; for in order unto the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting of that saving faith, which yet they had not, he spake these words of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, and exhortation to them, and this to the contradiction of Mr. <hi>Vahan</hi> whod ag'd in an Argument by the head and shoulders from this place at the <hi>Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> disputation, was ingenuously acknowledged by Mr. <hi>Prig.</hi> Nor</p>

               <p>Thirdly, when the parents did believe and were <hi>baptized,</hi> were any of their infants <hi>baptized</hi> with them (as they must have been had that promise been to their infants as well as to themselves, on that single account of being their seed) for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording how many were <hi>baptized</hi> at that time, he <hi>concludes</hi> them under such a term, as <hi>excludes</hi> the infants from that daies work, while he saies thus, <hi>as many,</hi> meaning no more then those (for else he deceives us utterly in his Relation) <hi>as glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received the word</hi> (this infants could not do) were then <hi>baptized,</hi> which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as they are recorded to be about 3000 might in likelihood have amounted to <hi>three times</hi> 3000, if all the infants of all those had been dipped also.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, nor were there any more inchurched that day among the rest, but such as gladly receiving the word, <hi>were then and thereupon baptized,</hi> for of these onely it is said, and not of infants, they continued together in the Apostles do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread and prayers; but all their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants must have bin <hi>inchurched</hi> also as well as they, if equally with their parents, and by vertue of the same promise, the right of <hi>Church-membership</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to them.

               <p>Fiftly, It crosseth the current of all other Scripture to put such <hi>male-constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> upon this, for that the promise of old, I mean the old promise of the Law; which

In which I beseech you to observe how the <hi>Apostle</hi> there denies <hi>Abrahams</hi> own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall children the name of <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed in the sence of the Gospel; first mark how he magnifies them exceedingly, and sets forth their dignity and preheminence above all other people, under the name of <hi>Israelites,</hi> as <hi>to whom pertained the adoption, and the glory, and the Covenants; i. e.</hi> both Testaments the type and the antitype, unto whom then pertained not only the giving of the law, but also the promises (for verily the several excellencies of both law and Gospel, upon the several terms upon which both were established, did in more special sence belong unto that people at that time, then to any people under the Sun, yea the first co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and the promise thereof the <hi>Earthly Canaan</hi> and all the priviledges and ordinances signing it did pertain to them, as the proper heirs therof, by bare fleshly descent from <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi>; yea all that was theirs <hi>ipso facto</hi> (as so born) without more ado, whether they were believers or not believers, as to the Gospel; and as for the <hi>Gospel covenant,</hi> which is now belonging to them in common only with all other men, in one respect it did principally pertain to them above all others, till they lost their preheminence, <hi>viz.</hi> not in respect of any right to it they had by birth whether they received it, yea or no, but in respect of the <hi>first tender</hi> therof, which, when it came in fuller force to be ratified to the world in the preaching of the Gospel, was by special order and appointment from God, in the first place to be tendered unto them, nor was it carried at all to the Gentiles, till these Jews had both slighted and rejected it, when brought to them in the Ministery of <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi>; in proof of which see in <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.5.6.7. where the Disciples sent forth to preach are forbidden to go in <hi>any waie of the Gentiles,</hi> or to any <hi>save the lost sheep of the house of Israel</hi>; yea they were the <hi>Children whose bred</hi> this was at that time; and which till they loathed it, was not to be given to the <hi>Doggs,</hi> excepting a few <hi>Crummes</hi> of it, I mean to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> who till the <hi>Partition Wall</hi> was broken down between them, and the <hi>Iews</hi> by <hi>Christ</hi> crucified, were accounted <hi>Doggs, Common, unclean, sinners by nature,</hi> in a certain ceremonial sense in reference to the Jewes, who then by birth were <hi>holy</hi> in a ceremonial sence, now vanisht, then answering as opposite to that birth uncleanness of the <hi>Gentiles, Mat.</hi> 15.24.25.26.27. see also <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.3. where the <hi>Iews</hi> are said to be <hi>first</hi> bidden to the wedding, so <hi>Luke</hi> 24.46.47. where <hi>Christ</hi> commands that in their preaching the Gospel to all Nations, they should <hi>first</hi> begin at <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; and so we see they did, after his ascension <hi>Act.</hi> 2. see also <hi>Act.</hi> 3.25.26. where the Jews are said to be <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>A cleerer illustration of this to be the true sense and meaning of the spirit in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. you have in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.7.9. where the Apostle uses this term, <hi>viz.</hi> [<hi>they which are of the faith</hi>] to express no other then the very same persons, whom he here stiles the children of the promise, <hi>know ye</hi> (saith he there) <hi>that they which are of the faith, i. e.</hi> which believe (for none else are of faith that I know of) <hi>the same are the children of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and blessed with faithfull</hi> Abraham, he saith not they which be of <hi>Abrahams flesh,</hi> for such neither are accounted his children, as to the gospel promise, nor simply as such are heirs thereof with him, muchless doth he say or mean, that those which are born of the bodies of them that be of faith, are <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, and such as must be signed as his sonnes, and heirs by baptism, in such wise as his own fleshly seed were signed by <hi>Circumcision</hi> as heirs with him of the old <hi>Canaan</hi>: yet these are your common sayings, who raise such a sort of seed to <hi>Abraham</hi> at second hand, or third remove, as will never be able to prove their pedegree, or descent from him, either after the flesh, or after
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:109011:59"/>
the faith either, till they believe themselves, whilest they breath on earth, as if because <hi>Abraham</hi> is the spiritual father of all that believe and walk in his steps, and they his seed, and sons and heirs with him by promise of eternal life, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he must <hi>patrizare</hi> to all their natural posterity too, and be the spiritual fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not of their persons onely, but of their off-spring also: But Sirs, let me tell you he is not so much as a father to his own seed in the Gospel sense, neither can they stand his children; or the children of God, and heirs of the heavenly bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and kindome, because they come out of his loines, unless they do as he did, for though his fleshly seed as a type for the time then being, stood denominated the children of God, and holy in an outward sense, and heirs according to the earthly promise, yet that account is gone now, and there's no other way whereby the <hi>Iews</hi> themselves, much less any generations among the Gentiles, can be stiled the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Abraham,</hi> so as to expect the gospel portion, but believing in <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> in their own persons, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26.29. <hi>Ye are all the children of God by faith in Iesus Christ: if ye be Christs then are ye</hi> Abrahams <hi>seed, and heirs according to the promise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another place which cleers it that <hi>Abrahams</hi> own seed in the old Covenants account are not his own in the account of the gospel, so as barely thereupon to stand in any title to either the priviledges or ordinances thereof, or to fellowship now in his family, is <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. where Christ being cavill'd at by the <hi>Iews</hi> for promising them the priviledge of the Gospel-freedom from sin,, to which they were slaves, servants and bondmen (for all that legal freedom they did so boast of) upon faith and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in his words, discovers so plainly that a man may run and read it, the discarding of the Jews from all these three things which I am now proving, that for want of faith, they are perished from them since the gospel.</p>
               <p>First, from the repute and denomination of <hi>Abrahams</hi> children any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>Secondly, from any share in the glorious, or spirituall blessing of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, from any right of abiding longer in the Church, which they were the children of before, which Church (<hi>as visible</hi>) now as well as then, and to the end of the world, since Gods conferring the <hi>fatherhood</hi> of the faithful upon him, is called the house or family of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, they say in a snuff two or three times ore, that they <hi>are Abrahams seed</hi> v. 33. that <hi>Abraham</hi> is their <hi>father</hi> v. 39. that they are not born of fornication (meaning as <hi>Ishmael</hi> the Son of the <hi>bond-woman,</hi> or servant to their mother <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> was) but they had one father, even <hi>God</hi> v. 41. to which Christ replies, not by denial of any of all this, for 'twas true every tittle in that sense, in which they meant it, <hi>i. e.</hi> the typical sense and meaning of the old Covenant, yea they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, and this Christ confesses in plain terms verse 37. <hi>I know you are Abrahams seed</hi>; yea they were also the children of God by an outward and typicall adoption of them unto himself, as his peculiar ones, and heirs of that typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal inheritance, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.8. &amp;c. but by telling them that <hi>Abrahams</hi> children are accounted of otherwise now then formerly, <hi>viz.</hi> not as comming out of his Ioines, but as doing his works, as being like him, and allied to him, not so much after the flesh as after the faith: whereupon they not yet believing, he denies them to be, and goes about to prove them not to be <hi>Abrahams</hi> children in the true and substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial sense, in this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> verse 39. <hi>if ye were Abrahams children, ye would do the works of Abraham,</hi> to which do but add the minor, <hi>viz. but ye do not the works of Abraham,</hi> and the conclusion follows thus, <hi>viz. therefore ye are not the children of Abraham</hi>: you see Christ asserts them to be <hi>Abrahams</hi> children in the old account, so as to stand members of the old house, but denieth them to be <hi>Abrahams</hi> children in the sense of the new.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they say they are free men, and were never in bondage to any man,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:109011:60"/>
to which <hi>Christ</hi> replies by granting it was so indeed, in the outward typical sense that they were free men, and true heirs of that earthly glory, that was promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Abraham</hi> in that old <hi>Canaan,</hi> but denies them to be freemen as to the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, with that heavenly fredom of the <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which is above the mother of all true believers <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.26. yea in those spiritual respects, in which the Son makes free indeed those that know and receive the truth and gospel, they were but ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants verse 34. and in bondage to sin, which is the greatest slavery of all, as also <hi>Paul</hi> sayes <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.25. that <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was, which was of old, and was in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage with her children, so he saies for all their <hi>Sonship,</hi> yet in truth they are but <hi>servants</hi> and not <hi>sonnes,</hi> he grants their <hi>Sonship,</hi> freedom, and title to the old in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, but denies their son and <hi>heirship</hi> as to the new.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they boast and bless themselves in their standing in the house or fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Abraham, i. e.</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> as to the ordinances, rights and priviledges whereof who but themselves had the title? for this indeed was their advantage of old, that to them were committed all the <hi>oracles of God,</hi> to which Christ replies, true they did stand in the house for a time, yet but for a time, and though sons and heirs in the laws <hi>typical</hi> sense, yet they were were but servants in the Gospels, because they believe not in him, and being but servants (as <hi>Moses</hi> and all his house or church the old <hi>Israel</hi> were, in comparison of Christ the Son, and his house or Church, <hi>i. e,</hi> the Saints) they must anon be packing out of the house, and abide in the Church <hi>i. e. Abrahams</hi> family no longer, that the true Sons and heirs may come in, <hi>i. e.</hi> believers, who are the blessed seed to whom onely the Gospel-promises and priviledges do belong, <hi>ver.</hi> 35. <hi>And the servant</hi> (saith he) <hi>abideth not in the house for ever, but the son abideth ever, if therefore the son make you free,</hi> and that he doth not for all your former freedome, unless you believe in him, and continue in his words, <hi>then shall ye be free indeed,</hi> even to the glory, oracles and blessings of the spiritual house the Gospel-church, which else you must be cut off from for ever: thus Christ tells them, and so indeed it came to passe within a while, for not believing and repenting, which are the only terms that give right and admittance to the ordinances and fellowship of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, these Iews though natural branches of <hi>Abraham</hi> still as much as ever, if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fleshly seed of a believer could have steaded them at all, as to a standing here, were yet clean broken off from the Root <hi>Abraham,</hi> as he st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nds a Root to all the faithful, because onely of unbelief, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20. when such as were wild olives, and no kin at all to <hi>Abraham</hi> after the flesh, were in their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but not their natural seed with them (save as they believed with them) own'd as his children by believing, and as members of the true Church under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. And this was also most directly declared by <hi>Iohn the Baptist,</hi> and the rest of the first ministers of the Gospel, who would not admit of the Jews as Jews, though <hi>Abrahams</hi> own seed, and holy by birth, and members thereupon of that Church under the law to baptism, and membership in the Gospel-church, when they offered themselves upon the aforenamed terms, without faith, repentance, and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for howbeit the Pharisees and Saduces and the whole multitude of people came forth to be baptized of <hi>Iohn, Mat,</hi> 3.7. &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 3.7. &amp;c. pretending and pleading that if baptism were a Church-priviledge, it must needs belong to them, as who were the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> yet see how he rounds them up as having no part nor portion in that matter: <hi>O generation of vipers</hi> saith he) <hi>who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come</hi>? as if he had said, what have you to do with that remission of sinnes, righteousness and redemption from wrath to come, which I preach and baptize in token of, being though invested with circumcision, Church-membership and other legal rites and priviledges, yet corrupt and crooked in conversations? <hi>bring forth therefore, i. e.</hi> to the end that you may be admitted, baptized, and inchurched here, <hi>fruits answerable to amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life, and begin not,</hi> (its like that plea was in their thoughts and mouths too,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:109011:60"/>
whereupon he puts them off from it) <hi>think not to say that we have Abraham to our father,</hi> we are the seed of such an eminent believer, <hi>for God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham, i. e.</hi> God will, without being behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to you, raise a seed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> rather then want them, from among these stones, which whether he meanes stones litterally, or the Gentiles which were yet as stocks and stones in their eies, I leave you further to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, but thus much we may gather hence however, that even in that very time wherein the birth-priviledge and holiness of a fleshly seed stood in full force and power unrepealed (as then it did) so far as to give right to all ordinances of the law, yet, even then I say before, how much more since the <hi>Abrogation</hi> thereof by faith, <hi>Abrahams</hi> own seed could not, much less then may the seed of believing Gentiles, now its repealed, (as such) be admitted to baptism without repentance: the Jews as impenitent and unbelieving as they were, stood uncast out of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Church, while that Jewish Church it self was yet standing, but they could not passe <hi>per saltum</hi> out of that Church into the Gospel Church, nor immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from their right to circumcision, which meer fleshly birth gave them, prove their right, without somewhat more, to baptism; yet thus they might have done, if what gave right of old to one of these ordinances, doth in like manner inright persons to the other,</p>
               <p>And this that <hi>Abrahams</hi> own naturall seed do not now stand his seed, so as thereupon onely, or at all to stand in this house of <hi>Abraham,</hi> i. e. the visible Church of the Gospel, and in title to the promises and priviledges thereof, is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and more lively figured out to our understandings in that admirable allusion of <hi>Paul</hi> to the things transacted of old, as a type hereof in the family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> between the two mothers and their children, <hi>viz. Hagar and Sarah, Ishmael and Isaac, Gal.</hi> 4.21. to the end, where (to give you but a hint of the thing, that you may follow it in your own thoughts at leasure) having first related what is written of <hi>Abrahams</hi> having two sonnes, one by his bond-maid <hi>Hagar,</hi> viz. <hi>Ish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael,</hi> that was born after the flesh, the other by the free woman, or his true wife <hi>Sarah,</hi> viz. <hi>Isaac,</hi> who though born of <hi>Abrahams</hi> flesh as well as the other, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was promised to come of <hi>Abrahams</hi> true spouse <hi>Sarah,</hi> long before he did, was said to be born by promise, he asserts these things to be an Allegory, <hi>i. e.</hi> things which though really and truly done, yet were done also in a figure, and as a shadow of some other things to come <hi>viz.</hi> the two Covenants and two seeds of <hi>Abraham</hi> thereunto belonging, or the two several Jerusalems or Churches of the law and the Gospel, with their several children <hi>viz.</hi> the fleshly seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> and the spiritual, each answering respectively, not only as anti-types to their several types, that point<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus as <hi>Hagar,</hi> and her son <hi>Ishmael,</hi> that stood in <hi>Abrahams</hi> house a while, and were proud and insolent, as if they should have dwelt there for ever, were at last packt out before <hi>Isaac</hi> the true son and heir by promise of the old inheritance, and ordinance, when he was born, and before <hi>Sarah,</hi> who would not indure to have <hi>Ishmael</hi> have any portion in <hi>Canaan,</hi> or any room in the house with her son <hi>Isaac,</hi> so also <hi>Sarah</hi> her self, and her son <hi>Isaac,</hi> I mean the fleshly <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and Jew that dwelt as Mistris, and heir for a time in the house, inheriting only some outward excellencies, and enjoyments, were at last, being found moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thereat, cast out of the house, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Church, the Son-ship, the glory, and all before the true Mother and her children, <hi>viz,</hi> the Gospel Church or true <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi> and the true <hi>Isaac, Christ</hi> and his <hi>Saints,</hi> or seed of Believers, who will not bear nor brook it to have a meer fleshly seed, though of <hi>Abraham</hi> himself, much less of any Gentile believers, to dwell with them in the family: <hi>Isaac</hi> and the fleshly <hi>Israelites</hi> were by promise to inherit the old Testament priviledges, and the <hi>Ishmaelites</hi> were not suffered (as such) to partake with them therein; <hi>Christ</hi> and believers are by promise to receive the eternal inheritance, nor is any mans fleshly posterity, no not <hi>Abrahams</hi> own by <hi>Isaac,</hi> I mean the <hi>Israelites</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves (as such) permitted or promised to participate therein: <hi>Ishmael</hi> though as <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed after the flesh he had a portion, yet had nothing to do with that of <hi>Isaac</hi> the child of promise in the type; <hi>Isaac</hi> though <hi>Abrahams</hi> son, not only after the flesh, but by promise too (as in reference to <hi>Ishmael</hi>) and so in true title to a better portion then <hi>Ishmaels, viz. the Earthly Canaan,</hi> and that as a type for a time, yet being but his fleshly seed in comparison to <hi>Christ,</hi> and believers, and by his bare fleshly birth (save only that he was a spirituall child also by believing) as inferior to them, as <hi>Ishmael</hi> was to himself, hath nought at all to do (as the fleshly seed of <hi>Abraham</hi>) with that heavenly portion that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to these.</p>
               <p>Now then if it be so (and so it will appear to him that doth not trifle, but truely understand the Scriptures, and this last especially which with many more <hi>viz, Heb.</hi> 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. speak expresly of two distinct covenants or Testaments, made with two sorts of seeds of <hi>Abraham</hi> concerning two <hi>Canaans, viz.</hi> an <hi>Earthly</hi> and a <hi>Heavenly,</hi> whereof one all along was a type of the other, for a time only, and now ended, contrary to all our <hi>blind Seers,</hi> that confound, and blindly blend both of them into one) if so I say that <hi>Abrahams</hi> own sons by bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily birth are not now his own in Gospel account, nor heirs (as so born only) of the Gospel promise and inheritance, nor house dwellers in the Gospel Church, for want of personal faith, though <hi>Abrahams</hi> children after the flesh still as much as ever, then I cannot but stand amazed at the perverseness of you the <hi>Priesthood</hi> in three things.</p>
               <p>First in that meerly because you and your people do believe (and I would to God you did believe, for so but few, for all your flourish of either you or your people do indeed) therefore you count your natural seed the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> this you express in plain terms in your <hi>Review</hi> p. 14.</p>
               <p>Secondly in that, even <hi>Eâtenùs,</hi> as your children only, you hold them heirs of the promise of the Gospel covenant made with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:109011:61"/>Thirdly in that you sign them as visibly such by <hi>Baptism</hi> (as you call it) and thereby admit them into membership in the Gospel Church (as you call it) and having yet no evidence of their belief, conclude them under a true title to all outward ordinances, save such as upon your own heads only you keep from them, if by the word they have such title to Church-fellowship, as you say they have, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Supper,</hi> of which you make them snap short, as much, and as groundlessly to the full (if baptism at all belong to them) as we in baptism.</p>
               <p>Sirs, let me reason with you a little, and begg some cool consideration, and ingenuous answer from you concerning these particulars.</p>
               <p>First <hi>which way come your natural seed, you being but Gentiles in the flesh, to be the seed of</hi> Abraham?</p>
               <p>Secondly <hi>why do you, or how can you sign them as heirs of the Gospel promise so simply upon that account only? there are but two seeds of</hi> Abraham <hi>that I know of in all the world,</hi> viz.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>His seed after the flesh, and such are all those that are born of his body,</hi> viz. Ishmael, <hi>and his Children by</hi> Keturah, <hi>to whom he gave portions, and those that came of him by</hi> Isaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>which only (for</hi> Esau <hi>sold his birth-right) were heirs with him of the Land of</hi> Canaan.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>His seed after the faith, and such are those only that walk in his steps</hi> Rom. 4.12. <hi>that do his works</hi> John 8. <hi>Who are also by that same faith which denominates them his children, said to be</hi> Christs <hi>also, and the children of God, and heirs with him of the world according to the Gospell Promise,</hi> Rom. 4.12, 13. Gal. 3.16. 1 Cor. 3.21.22.23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Non datur tertium semen Abrahae:</hi> two seeds of <hi>Abraham</hi> the Scripture mentions, but a third sort cannot be assigned, all and only those that descend from his loines as the <hi>Midianites and others by Keturah,</hi> the <hi>Ishmaelites</hi> by <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> the <hi>Edomites</hi> and <hi>Israelites</hi> by <hi>Sarah,</hi> which last only were the holy seed, and children of promise in reference to the <hi>Hagarens</hi> in a type and sole heirs of the typical <hi>Canaan,</hi> all these I say were the first sort, all believers, of what nation soever, are the second sort, but the natural seed of believers are neither of the one nor of the other.</p>
               <p>As for the children of the <hi>Proselites, i. e. Iews</hi> not by birth, but profession, which by way of exception against this may possibly pop into some of your minds, I utterly deny them (as so born) to be any seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> at all, or heirs of either inheritance, unless they believed also, though their parents (believing) might be his spiritual seed, and heirs of the heavenly inheritance; and if you ask why then was every male among the <hi>infants of Proselites circumcised</hi>? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer not upon any such account as their being <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, or heirs with him of either this or that, but meerly as they were Males in the house of one that was a Jew, at least by devotion, though a stranger as to fleshly relation, that being the express command of God, for the time then being, and during the standing of that Covenant of circumcision (the like to which if you had for infant-baptism, the controversie were at an end between us) that <hi>every man child in every family throughout all generations, whether born in the house or bought with money of any stranger, that was no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

what was done then, as a <hi>Rule</hi> for us now, who so shall produce as the <hi>Pattern</hi> or infer any thing from as the instution of God, according to which we are to act in the New Testament ordinances of Baptism, and the Supper; and yet not act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them neither, but abominably besides them both (as the Priest-hood doth, baptizing (as not at all but rantizing so) not at all after the manner of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, viz. not males only, not on the eighth day only, but any other, when they may as well upon that, not servants also upon the Masters, faith as well as the Children upon the parents, and as for the Supper denying it utterly to infants that might then eat the Passeover) I avouch them to be not a little besides their natural, but much more besides their spiritual intellectualls.</p>
               <p>Let this then satisfy as to any conceit, that any may have, as that the <hi>Proselites</hi> seed were the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and heirs with him because circumcised, viz. that though all <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed that were heirs with him were circumcised, yet all that were circumcised were not thereby proved to be <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, nor heirs with him of either promise, and though his fleshly seed, <hi>Israel</hi> the heir especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and his spirituall seed also, <hi>i. e.</hi> believing Jewes, and <hi>Proselites</hi> were both thereupon to come under that dispensation, and that as heirs too severally of the two severall promises, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>typifying,</hi> and <hi>typified Canaan,</hi> yet many past under circumcision upon that forenamed account only, of being males in the house, that were neither <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed after the flesh nor after the faith, as Servants, and the seed of <hi>Proselite Masters, Fathers,</hi> not appearing yet to believe with them; for even such were to be circumcised under the law, though (by your leave) not such to be by the like reason baptized under the Gospell, for as there is no command for such a matter, so if there had, the Servants of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch</hi> (himself only turning <hi>Christian</hi>) must have been (as tis known they were not) baptized together with him: besides if baptism must be like to circumcision in its subject, then not only he that is not yet apparently an heir, but he also that is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently not an heir by faith must be baptized, aswell as <hi>Abrahams</hi> sonne <hi>Ishmael,</hi> and his servant <hi>Eleazer,</hi> and all the other males of his house were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised, who were all well enough known to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to be none of the heirs of that land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> whereof circumcision was given to him, and his seed in <hi>Isaac,</hi> in token of their inheriting of it, at that very time when he circumcised them.</p>
               <p>I demand therefore yet once again, what seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> your infants are, in that thereupon you undertake (as so) to baptize them? you tell us in your <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view,</hi> pag. 14. <hi>They are</hi> Semen fidei, <hi>the children of his faith, his spiritual seed</hi>; I am ashamed to hear you say so, which way do they come to be, in that minority, his spiritual seed, sith believers only are so? you seem to tell us they are so by believing themselves, for <hi>so Zachaeus,</hi> say you, <hi>by believing was made the Son of Abraham,</hi> as who should say <hi>Zachaeus</hi> became, as infants do, the spiritual seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> by believing, which word <hi>believing</hi> is as much as not having only, but acting faith, which to act not others only but your selves, who sillyly assert them to have faith, do somewhat more sensibly p. 8. confess them to be uncapable.</p>
               <p>Others tell us, and even your selves too sometimes, and in effect in that very same page, that they are <hi>semen fidei,</hi> or the seed of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account, <hi>viz.</hi> as their parents are believers, for the <hi>promise is</hi> (say you, though that is no Scripture phrase at all in that place whence you quote it, <hi>viz. Act</hi> 2.39.) <hi>to believers and their seed, and if the adversaries say that the Iewes were</hi> Semen carnis, <hi>and had right by the promise so these</hi> say you concerning the seed of believers, <hi>are</hi> semen fidei, <hi>and the promise is to them</hi>; which words, <hi>The Promise, The Promise, The Promise,</hi> you will scrible down twenty times in one Treatise before you will sit down once and search out seriously what it is, or once shew distinctly what it is you mean by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:109011:62"/>So then howbeit with <hi>Iohn</hi> baptist, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. with Christ, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.8, 9. with <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 4.13.9, 6, 8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.7.9. there is but one way of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming <hi>Abrahams</hi> spiritual seed, or the children of his faith, so as thereupon to be signed by baptism as heirs with him of the Gospel-promise, and this is not by being the fleshly posterity of a believer, though it should be of believing <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> himself, for even his own fleshly were not his spiritual seed, but onely as they believed with him, but by bringing forth fruits of repentance, doing his works, treading in the steps of his faith, you belike have found more wayes to the wood then one, whereof when ones failes you in the fight, you commonly take your flight by the other, and with you there's two wayes whereby persons, nay, which is a greater mystery, whereby the same persons, even believers infants in their very infancy, may and do become <hi>Abrahams</hi> spiritual sons and heirs, <hi>viz.</hi> first by their own walking in the steps of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, i. e. believing themselves, which though it be the true way of becoming <hi>Abrahams</hi> spirituall seed, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are not capable to walk in it.

               </p>
               <p>But it seems the terms upon which persons become heirs with <hi>Abraham</hi> of Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-promises, and stand in true title to Gospel-ordinances, are not <hi>uniform,</hi> but <hi>multiform</hi> in your imagination, for those on which persons in the capacity of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are priviledged with the title of <hi>Abrahams</hi> spiritual seed, and title to Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-ordinances and enjoyments, are their own believings not anothers; but those on which others, <hi>i. e.</hi> all that are in the capacity of children to those parents are thus highly priviledged, are the believing of their parents, whether they have any faith of their own yea or no, and yet some count that the childs own faith which the parent professes for him.</p>

                  <hi>Sirs,</hi> what pretty intricate blind <hi>bo-beep Divinity</hi> is this of yours? do the same priviledges and promises belong to the believing parents and their children, and yet though exhibited to them both alike in one and the self same phrase and form of speech (for saith <hi>Peter</hi> the promise is to you and your children, and to them that are farre off yea even as many (meaning of you and your children and of them that are far off) as the Lord shall call) do they belong upon such various and different grounds, <hi>viz.</hi> to the parents upon their own faith, to the children upon the parents faith? my father then it seems, what ere his fathers were, must prove his pedegree from <hi>Abraham</hi> by his doing as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, or else he can be no gospel-son, nor share at all in any gospel-priviledges and immunities, but if he were a believer, I his son may prove mine at easier rates by farr, <hi>viz.</hi> by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no further then the faith and faederation of my father.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Sirs,</hi> will this hold a triall think you by the word? is there any such <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glements</hi> as these to be found there? is it to be found there that now under the gospel-Covenant since that outing of the old Covenant, and that fleshly seed, that were heirs of it, and all the tipical pertinencies thereof the faith and faederation of fathers inrights and enrouls all their fleshly seed as Heirs with them of salvation, without any evidence of their believing themselves? then tell me why the fleshly seed of those great believers, <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> stand excommunicated from all Gospel-priviledges, participations of ordinances, promises, &amp;c. even from the beginnings of the Gospel Church and first administring of baptism to this very day? will you plead your own right above theirs to stand his children in the Gospel-Church by saying, we had holy men and believers to our fathers, but their fathers believed not the Gospel, therefore worthily are they cut off with them?

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:109011:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and though remote ones, yet were they not their true fathers after the flesh still as much as ever? did <hi>Iohn Mat.</hi> 3. and Christ <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. and <hi>Peter Acts</hi> 2. deny them a standing in the Gospel house and admission unto baptism and member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship without repentance and belief in their own persons, and doing the works of <hi>Abraham</hi>? did they I say put such off from all Gospel-expectations and priviledges who offered themselves thereto with this plea, <hi>viz.</hi> we have <hi>Abraham</hi> to our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? and dare you admit such without faith or repentance, for whom you can make no higher pretence then this, <hi>viz.</hi> they are the children of believers? me thinks if meer birth-priviledges and fleshly descent, must carry it still without faith in the seed themselves, are not the Iews infants to this day higher born then any Gentiles infants in the world, whose parents are believers? for they verily can say no less then this, we are the natural issue of the father of all the faithfull, yet may they not be own'd barely upon that account to gospel-ordinances, and if the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural seed, and that by <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi> himself the grand believer, which seed could of old claim a room by right of birth from <hi>Abraham</hi> in the house of <hi>Moses,</hi> cannot possibly carry it so high under Christ, as by the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent, onely without faith in themselves, to gain a standing in his house, or so much as right to be stiled their own natural fathers children (as to the Gospel) I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed to see you Gentile believers to conferre upon your meer natural seed the name of <hi>Abrahams</hi> spiritual seed, and denominate your <hi>semen carnis</hi> his <hi>semen fidei.</hi>

               <p>Then learn once I beseech you this lessen from your selves, which you will not learn from <hi>Iohn, Christ</hi> and <hi>Paul, viz.</hi> that the ground of standing <hi>Abrahams</hi> spiritual seed, sons and heirs; and Church-members under the Gospel is not the the faith and faederation of the parents, by vertue of which you plead your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens right to baptism, saying they have believers, as the Jews once to <hi>Iohn</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded theirs, saying, we have <hi>Abraham</hi> to our father, but faith it self in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular persons so standing, for so many Jews, heathens, infidels children as are of the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> i. e. not born of faithful parents, but faithful themseves (as he was) are incorporated; incovenanted, inchurched as <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelically blessed with faithful <hi>Abraham</hi>; but till even believers children, yea <hi>Abrahams</hi> own believe themselves, the parents faith cannot now possibly ingraft them, the time of faith or standing by faith alone in the house, or visible Church of God being now come in, the standing by any fleshly generation what soever is done away, yea <hi>Abrahams</hi> own children, the naturall branches that grow out of his loynes are cut off from standing (as till Chirist they did) now any longer upon their own Root <hi>Abraham,</hi> because of unbelief.</p>
               <p>I say then that no infant in infancy, of what believing parent soever, is either <hi>Abrahams</hi> spiritual seed, or dying in infancy is saved upon any such account as a believers seed, or <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, nor whilst living an infant onely, may be signed by baptism as an heir apparent of salvation: for if <hi>Abraham</hi> stand not a spiritual father to his own meer fleshly seed, he stands not so sure to the meer flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seed of any believing Gentile, for that were to priviledge every ordinary belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and his natural seed above either himself or his own.</p>
               <p>Nor doth this hinder, or deny the salvation of the dying infants of believers, or dispose them ere the sooner (muchless necessarily) to damnation, to say they are not <hi>Abrahams</hi> spirituall seed (<hi>quâ believers infants</hi>) nor heirs to salvation

upon any such account as that, for though neither upon that, nor any other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count at all they may warrantably be baptized, yet its more then possible, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable either (because infallible) that there's other Scripture account enough, upon which when we see them die in infancy we may assert them undoubtedly not to be damned; for as it is most sure and true, that all that are apparently (if really) <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> spiritual seed by faith must so living, so dying be saved, in token and farther evidence of which to themselves more then others they are by the good wil of Christ to be baptized, yet is it neither true, nor necessary that all that are saved must be <hi>Abrahams</hi> spiritual seed by faith, but most certain that some shall be saved, that never were <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed in any sense at all, witnesse not onely the faithful fore-fathers of <hi>Abraham,</hi> for he was their seed, and not they his, but also all dying infants of what parents soever both before <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, and since, of whom to salvation notwithstanding those are the onely termes on which it belongs to adult ones, to whom its preacht, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. these being truly capable of neither, 'tis not required that they should either repent, believe or be baptized. I know this Iustification of dying infants without faith is uncouth, and little less, for all it holds forth so much salvation, then damnable doctrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you Divines, that plead the contrary, but I shall by the help of God make it good to the faces of you all, when I come to consider the baldness of your conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in this point, as you give me good occasion to do in some places, where me thinks you meddle with it somewhat clumsily, as it were in mittins, as if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there's no other way revealed for the salvation of such by Christ, to whom the gospel is preached, who are capable to hear, and do what's required, for such onely the word universally speaks of, when it speaks of salvation in that way, but the way of belief and actuall obedience onely, therefore there's no other way for the salvation of dying infants by Christ, who can possibly neither believe in him, nor obey him, which as it is such shameful stuff, that I cannot bear it with out inward blushing at your blindness, so whether you have not as much cause to be ashamed on't within your selves is well worth your inmost inquiry.</p>
               <p>I say therefore again, so far is this from excluding dying infants of believers from entrance into the kingdome of heaven, to say they are neither <hi>Abrahams</hi> spiritual seed by faith, nor heirs thereof upon that ground onely of being so, that it rather concludes and supposes there's some other ground that is common with them to the innocent infants of even infidels, and all the world, upon which these, whom, though they are hundreds to one, yet your selves in your fierce wrath, and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less cruelty devote universally to damnation, may dying in infancy universally be saved also; which ground if you will yet know it, is the righteousness of Christ, the free imputation of which universally from the father saves not onely all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve from both that, and their actuall transgressions too, but even the whole world, whether they believe it or no from the the imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; so that none at all ever perish upon that account, in which respect he is said to be <hi>the Saviour of all men, but especially of them that believe:</hi> much more doth it, and that without faith, save all dying infants, who as they believe not, so have not as yet <hi>by any actual sin bard themselves, or deserved exemption,</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come liable at all to the second death, <hi>i. e.</hi> the damnation of hell, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls not any but upon personal neglect of the light and grace of life, brought in by the second <hi>Adam,</hi> as the first death onely overtakes mankind for onely that sin of the first <hi>Adam.</hi>

whom alone, and not of Infants at all Christ there speaks, and even every where else, where he speaks to us of the way of life, and this is plain by the reason he there gives why so few are saved, which is the straitness of the gate, and narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the way that leads to life, <hi>viz.</hi> of self-denial, and suffering for Christ, which men mostly being very loath to walk in, it comes to pass that few of them come to life by it; but infants being altogether uncapable to walk in it, are are altogether dis-ingaged from walking in it till they come to capacity so to do, and yet are not damn'd for not walking in it: when we come to years of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and to apprehend the good will of God to us, in providing a Saviour for us, his good will concerning us in order to salvation by him is, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him and obey him, and apply his righteousness unto our selves, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. but whilst we are yet in such minority, as neither to know what God hath done for us, nor to be capable of putting on the Lord Iesus our selves, he himself is pleased to impute his righteousness to salvation to us so dying, even as we our selves, whilst our infants are new born, do not onely provide, but also put on what clothes we have provided in our pitty towards them, for the covering of their nakedness, but when they come to years of such discretion as to discern, and be sensible of their own shame, and capable to dress themselves with their own hands, we expect when in our love we have once provided raiment for them, they should put it on themselves, or go without it: thus candid are we towards the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infants of all sorts: nevertheless, though we tell you of our charity towards them, and of your own cruelty in sending all heathen infants to hell, and this no less then twenty times over, yet we must expect to hear it from ore the pulpit cloth twenty times ore again, before the devil be dead, how blessed and charitable your doctrine is, and what most bloody and cruel opinionists the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> are concerning infants.</p>
               <p>Infants then I say of what parents soever are either such as die in the personall innocency of their own infancy, and so are universally saved, and yet in token, or as a sign thereof to themselves there's neither need, nor sense, nor reason to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them; or else such as live to understanding, and then they appear, either not to do <hi>Abrahams</hi> works, and then we own them not yet as <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, though born of believing parents, yea though of believing <hi>Abraham</hi> himself, not as heirs according to the Gospel-promise, or else to belieue in Christ, and walk in the steps of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and then of what parents soever, though of infidels, we are to own them as <hi>Abrahams</hi> spiritual seed, and such as (so abiding) are heirs apparent by promise of the heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi>: this we can never discern by them in their infancy, not knowing yet whether they shall die infants, or live to years, nor whether when they come to years they will reject Christ or receive him. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this then, that any mans fleshly seed in the world is upon the meer account of their natural descent of such or such parents, or further then as dying in infancy they have no actual sin to condemn them, or living to act sin they believe in Christ (in both which cases the seed of unbelievers are as capable of salvation as the seed of believers themselves) are by promise heirs of salvation, and in token thereof are to be baptized, and in baptism visibly sign'd (more then other chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) as <hi>children o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>No such matter <hi>Sirs,</hi> there's either no good Antecedent or else no good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence in this: for first, if you mean as to the Gospel, Church and Covenant, the children of the unbelieving Jews are not so broken off, and excluded with their parents, in such a sence as you imagine, i. e. upon the Account of their parents unbelief onely, but for want of faith in their own persons, and as succeeding their fathers in unbelief, for if any children of the unbelieving Jews, when they come to years (and children when at years are the naturall seed of their parents, I hope as well as in infancy it self, if being the children of such or such parents alone would either ingraft or exclude) if I say unbelieving Iews children do believe, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is so made to them, that their parents unbelief cannot exclude them, but if the children at years do not believe, the promise is so little made to believers, and their seed as that the parents belief availes no further then to the engrafting of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and he cannot at all entitle all his natural seed by his single faith, nor as heirs of the same heavenly inheritance with him, inright them to the ordinance in token of it: but if you mean as to the old Church and Covenant then</p>
               <p>Secondly, it follows no more then if you should go about to make a way for the needle by the thred, that because the Iews and their seed under the law were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in, and thrown out of Covenant altogether, so the Gentiles under the Gospel and their seed must be owned, and disowned thus collectiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in no whole nation in the world, nor any one or more mens meer natural seed, no not <hi>Abrahams, Isaacs, and Iacobs</hi> (as the other did) to all generations of its continuance, but rather <hi>Sigillatim</hi>) such several persons out of every nation, tongue, kindred and people that fear God, and work righteousness <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.34, 35. even all, and onely such as obey him: <hi>Singulos generum credentes,</hi> not <hi>genera singulorum credentium, vel non.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If therefore you speak of the Jews standing upon the <hi>Root Abraham,</hi> and in the Church before <hi>Christ,</hi> upon the old Covenant account, then I confess that the whole body of them were broken off altogether, and that as they, and their fleshly seed were all incovenanted, so they were all discovenanted at once, when that covenant of circumcision, which God gave to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his fleshly seed <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. concerning the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was it self abolished in Christ cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified; but then the consequence will not hold from that covenant to this of the Gospel; these being two distinct and different covenants, the terms of standing in which are in no wise the same. But if you speak of the covenant of the Gospel, then your <hi>Antecedent</hi> is false, for I deny utterly that the Jews and their seed were altogether alienated from that, further then every individual of them did cut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves off from a right of standing therein by want of faith in their own persons, for as this covenant was never made with any men, and their meer fleshly seed, no not with <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and their natural posterity, so that a bare birth of their bodies doth <hi>ipso facto</hi> make them heirs of the heavenly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance promised therein; nor give them a right (as such only) to be signed as true heirs thereof, but only with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his spiritual seed, <hi>i. e. Christ</hi> and all believers in him; so no men and all their naturall posterity are outed from it together, but as both they, and their posterity do stand together in unbelief upon which account faith being the only way of standing heirs under the Gospel, and the <hi>Iews Children</hi> proving unbelievers in all ages as well as their parents, I confess they are broken off together, and not otherwise, for if the Children of the <hi>Iews</hi> did appear to have faith (as in infancy they cannot, and when they are grown up unversally they do not) their parents infidelity could in no wise prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit their standing; and since neither in infancy, nor at age they appear to be in the faith, their parents in case they were never so faithful can in no wise intitle them to a standing, for then the natural seed of those thousands of <hi>Iews</hi> which did believe in the Primitive times, have a <hi>birth-priviledge,</hi> and holiness to this day, whereupon they may claim admittance unto baptism, as well as any, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if those words <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. if the <hi>Root</hi> be holy so are the branches, were to be taken in such a sense as you put upon them, but we know that though they are branches growing naturally upon that <hi>holy Root</hi> as you call it, of believing parents, yet they are counted unholy by your selves, because they believe not in their own persons, yea if we should ask how the children of those <hi>Iews,</hi> that at first believed, did come to be such strangers to the Gospel Church, your selves would answer vs because they believed not, as their parents did, by which you do no less than grant what we contend for, <hi>viz.</hi> that the faith of <hi>Ancestors</hi> gives no right to their posterity to stand at all in the Gospel Church, and Covenant, but faith in the particular persons only so standing.</p>
               <p>Well then they were broken off: but why? not because they had not believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parents, for <hi>Abraham</hi> was the fleshly Father of all of them, and the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive believing <hi>Iews</hi> were the fleshly fathers of many of them, and are to this day as much as ever, if bare birth priviledge could ingraft them as it did of old in the family of the <hi>Iewish Church</hi>: Nor was it because they wanted title upon which they might have stood still in the <hi>Iewish Church,</hi> if that <hi>Church</hi> it self had stood to this day, for they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, and that gave them capacity e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to dwell in the house before, their own unbelief notwithstanding; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:109011:67"/>
they do not believe themselves, because the terms of standing in the <hi>Church</hi> which before <hi>Christ</hi> were these, <hi>viz. We have Abraham to our Father,</hi> we are the Children of such, and such parents, are now quite changed, so that it boots not to say such a thing as <hi>Abraham</hi> is our father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. unless we can also say we repent, and believe the Gospel.</p>
               <p>The Jews were broken off by unbelief, and thou and thine (<hi>o believing Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi>) must stand by faith, yet not thine by thy faith, but thou thy self by thine, and they by their own; faith is that in which thou standing, and not thy seed, thou hast right to stand in the Church, and not they, in which they standing, and not thy self, they have right to stand in the <hi>Church,</hi> and thou hast none. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity</hi> in <hi>personall</hi> faith gives <hi>perpetual personal</hi> right to <hi>baptism,</hi> and to <hi>Church-membership,</hi> but not a perpetuity of the same right to any mans whole <hi>posterity</hi>; there's now no difference made at all as to Gospel interest, by being either this or that by nature, but in all the world any person Jew or Gentile, male or Female seed of believer or of unbeliever, <hi>Barbarian, Scythian,</hi> bond or free, is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both to be saved, and signed as an heir of salvation by <hi>baptism</hi> upon personal faith, but in no wise the <hi>progeny</hi> upon the faith of the <hi>parentage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet to put it more out of doubt, that the Covenant holiness, and church-right of mens fleshly seed, which was of old, is not continuing under the Gospel, but <hi>Ceremonial</hi> and so ended in <hi>Christ,</hi> in whom your selves say <hi>Iudicialia sunt Mortua, Ceremonialia Mortifera,</hi> I will leave two or three consequences upon the file, which either answer and that not <hi>invitâ Minervâ,</hi> nor stretching your <hi>Genius</hi> beyond sense and reason, rather than want somewhat whereby to prove your <hi>Iudaizing</hi> to be <hi>judicious,</hi> or else by silence say you cannot: I leave you to consult with them as you see occasion.</p>

               <p>Now as to the Minor in the <hi>Prosyllogism,</hi> which is this <hi>viz.</hi> that the holinesse which fanctified the Jews seed, was the same, and no other then that which san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified all the other appertenances of that Covenant, tis but a folly for me to offer to prove it, sith Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> himself (the man that most earnestly pleads the present being of that same holinesse in believers seed as in the Iews seed of old) doth little less then clearly confess it, in the 3 and 4 page of his birth-priviledge, where he writes thus, <hi>viz. common things dedicated for holy service, and use are holy, a people by nature sinners, dedicated to the Lord, are for holy use and service of the Lord, when others are for the service of Idols, therefore Ierusalem a City, none of the holiest for any transcendent holiness of the Inhabitants thereof, is yet cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Evangelist the holy City, by reason of the Temple, and worship there that were holy and from thence</hi> (saith he) <hi>this observation follows, A people that enjoy Gods ordinances convey to their issue a priviledge to be reputed of a society that is holy, to be numbered amongst, not unclean, but holy persons,</hi> in proof of which observation among other things he saies thus, <hi>viz. The land of their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation where they dwelt and injoyed this peculiar priviledge is ordinarily stiled the Holy Land, being the land of Emanuel, and the language there spoke the holy language, being a mark to discern the people of God, the distinguishing and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimminating Epithite given to them was still holy, even all of this root who were branches of Abraham, Isaac, Iacob, all of this lump whereof Abraham, Isaac, Iacob were the first fruits, they peculiarly had this honor to receive, &amp;c. and that in infancy, &amp;c. distinction from all others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All which words of his (collectively considered) must needs bear such a sense as this, <hi>viz.</hi> That as the things that were else wise common, were holy things, and in such sort as the City <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was a holy City, their Temple a holy place, their service, which we know stood mainly in offering of gifts and sacrifices, meats drinks, divers washings and carnal ordinances for that time onely, a holy service, their land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> it self a holy land, their language a holy language, and in a manner every thing of theirs was discriminated by the term holy, from what ever was then counted common and unclean among the Gentiles, in such sort that people were a holy people, and their issue reputed, not an unclean but a holy seed.</p>
               <p>If this be his sense, then me thinks its a very sensless thing for him to affirm that same holinesse to be removed from all other things, that were the subjects then denominated by it, and to remain onely in people and their seed; but if he deny this to be his sense in those recited words of his, I think he must either crack his conscience to evade the disadvantage that accrues to his cause by owning it, or else grant that he was not sensible of what he wrote, for I see not how he can shuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle those sentences into any other sense: And as he, so Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> that backs him in his opinion of birth-priviledge sayes the same, and confesses p. 81. of his book <hi>that the common nature of holiness is one and the same in all these, viz. Priests and Levites, Temple, Altar, Sacrifices under the law, and in the children of believers and their unbelieving yoke-fellows spoken of</hi> 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 7.14. <hi>i. e.</hi> a sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to God, for so saith he there, <hi>i. e.</hi> in such sense as the Priests, Levites, Temple, Altar, Sacrifice, &amp;c. were sanctified, both children of believers, and

also unbelieving yoke-fellows are here said to be holy and sanctified.</p>
               <p>It being then in both Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> own account one and the same holinesse, whereby as well the seed as the land, people, Priests, sanctuary and service were all denominated and distinguished as holy, which surely was no other then a meer <hi>ceremoniall</hi> holiness, its but folly for me to say more in proof of this, that it was the same: nevertheless forasmuch as here is the very foundation of all your falsity and confusion, in that you either do not, or else will not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scern a difference between the time of the law, and the Gospel (for <hi>distingue tempora, et reconciliabis scripturas</hi>) and for that also I am jealous over you with a godly jealously, that I may espouse you, who are yet a treacherous and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, as a <hi>chast ministry</hi> unto Christ, would to God you could bear with me in my folly, and indeed bear with me if I yet insist a little further to shew the same<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of that holinesse, that was then in the Iews land, sanctuary, service, &amp;c. and in their fleshly seed, which that it may yet more plainly appear, I beseech you let it be considered, that (as your selves grant that the holiness whereby the seed was then said to be holy was, not real and inherent, but meerly <hi>dedicative, relative, denominative, i. e. titular, <note n="i" place="margin">

               <p>First, <hi>Si aliquid quare non quicquid</hi>? If you will have any thing holy with that <hi>Ceremonial</hi> holiness now, why not every thing that then was so?</p>

               <p>And now as to the Minor, <hi>viz.</hi> that the commonness, sinfulness, prophan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or uncleanness of some mens fleshly seed above others, oppositely answering to the holiness with which the <hi>Iewes</hi> seed was then holy above others, is totally destroyed, as well as all that uncleanness, and the holiness contrary thereunto, that was then in some meats, and flesh of birds and beasts above others is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved to be a truth to any which will impartially consult and compare these three scriptures each with other (<hi>viz.

Gall.</hi> 2. verse 15. then which, I testifie, no Scripture doth more clearely confute him.</p>
               <p>As to those Scriptures cited out of <hi>Act.</hi> 10. and <hi>Act.</hi> 11. these things are well worthy your observation in them first that <hi>Peter</hi> (though under the Gospel) stood yet opinioned (God having not till now discovered the contrary to him) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:109011:70"/>
to the Law that such meats as were then forbidden to be eaten, and such people as were not Jewes by nature, but by nature sinners of the Gentiles, were unholy, unlawfull, unclean and abominable for him that was a Jew, so much as to eat, or eat with still.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that God did not shew unto <hi>Peter</hi> in that vision any such thing as Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> dreams and seems to himself to have the vision of <hi>viz.</hi> that he had now translated that old commonness and uncleannesse that was once in the Gentiles by nature, and stated it now upon such as are Iews by nature, and such as are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture descended from unbelieving parents, and contrary wise translated and stated the birth-holiness that was once among the Iews by nature, because they now believe not, upon such Gentiles by nature, as are born of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving parents; for no more then Gentiles by nature can I call them still, for all their parents faith, not Christians or Saints by nature (as Mr, <hi>Blake</hi> frivolously fancies them to be) that are descended from Christian parents after the flesh onely; for howbeit the fleshly seed of the Iews are Iews still, both <hi>naturâ, nomine et natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> yet the meer fleshly seed of Christians and Saints, are not Christians and Saints at the same rates in Gods-account (how ever they are in the Popes and his) any more then the meer fleshly seed of believers are by <hi>birth, nature, name and nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> believers as much as their parents, which that they are Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> himself, will not surely be so shameless as to assert: and though he tells us a trifling tale, that the name of <hi>Christian</hi> would not long hold in any family, or among any people if it be not so, that as <hi>Iews</hi> are <hi>Iews by birth, so Christians are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> p. 6. yet I tell him again 'tis no great matter whether it do or no, yea 'tis not onely worth nothing, but worse then nothing to have the meer name and title of Christian, communicated and derived from parents to children, from generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to generation without the nature, for thats the main mischief that hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread all Christendom, and fill'd it with a thousand Antichristians to one true Christian indeed. Secondly, as simply as he saith God provideth for a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in succession of that name from age to age, yet I know no such provision that God hath made in his word for any such thing, as the continuance of the meer name of Christian in one family or nation, by any such birth-priviledge or propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation thereof from Christians to their meer natural posterity, but all the provision that hath been made in this behalf hath been made by the Pope and his priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Yea if God himself had took order for any such matter, then me thinks the name Christian should have been continued to this day among the posterity of that Gospel Church of the Hebrews, i. e. those many thousands of Iews, which in the primitive times turned Christians, yea then so many thousands of the Iews, which then believed, and became Christians <hi>Act.</hi> 21.20 might have multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as easily by this time into one Christian nation at least, by the pastoral power, improvement, and sanctity of Saint <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> as the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> i. e. those few Gentiles, which at first believed there, did at last by the pollitick power, improvement and subtilty of <hi>Sir Simon the Pope,</hi> his supposed successour increase and multiply into so many.</p>
               <p>And as God did not shew unto <hi>Peter</hi> in the forenamed place, that he had now removed that birth priuiledge, and old Covenant holinesse from the Iews by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to the natural seed of believing Gentiles, so</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he shewed him point blank that he had now quite abolished, and put an end to that old outward carnal, legal, ceremonial account of things, and persons as holy and unclean, so that now as no meats, nor flesh of birds and beasts should be counted common or unclean, in relation to other, as aforetime, so no men now or flesh of men <hi>however born,</hi> should by meer fleshly birth of such pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, though unbelieving Gentiles, be counted common or unclean in relation to others, whether Iews by nature, or believing Christians natural seed, as more holy by birth then they, for being cavill'd with by them of the circumcision i. e. the birth

If then we may not call any man, of what blood, nation or parentage soever under the Gospel common or unclean, (as God shewed <hi>Peter</hi> that he should not) no not those who (sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the abolishing of that unclaanness) are as abominable by birth as the Gentiles were in the time of the law, then may we not call any man, however naturally descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, holy upon the same account of that his natural birth, in comparison of others.</p>
               <p>Whereupon though Christ called the <hi>Canaanites</hi> by nature, dogs in reference to the <hi>Iews,</hi> and their seed the children, while that birth-uncleanness or holinesse stood yet unabolished, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.12.26. after which example Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> takes such blind boldness to himself, as to imagine the new born infants of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and unbelievers may respectively be so denominated still, yet he takes upon him much more then God ever gave <hi>Peter</hi> leave to do, or any man else in those dayes of the Gospel, if he now call any person by meer naturall birth more holy, common or unclean then other.</p>
               <p>Tis not now fleshly birth, nor circumcision, nor uncircumcision in the flesh that <hi>discriminates</hi> men as Saints or sinners, <hi>children</hi> or <hi>dogs, holy</hi> or <hi>unclean, in Covenant with God or out, fit</hi> or <hi>unfit</hi> (further then non-age unfits all alike for such a thing) now to be of the visible Church, which is not now nationall neither as heretofore it was, for under the law this only made men communicable or incommunicable one with another, this was the cause why those of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision cavilled with <hi>Peter</hi> till he satisfied them to the contrary, because he being a Iew by nature, and circumcised in the flesh went in to men uncircumcised, and did eat with them, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. from eating with whom he dissemblingly withdrew himself at another time, fearing them of the circumcision, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. which way of discrimination of persons each from other as holy and unclean, fit or unfit for Church-communion each with other by meer fleshly birth and circumcision in the flesh, was but a type, the Antitype whereof is not this, <hi>viz</hi> that believers fleshly seed are <hi>holy, Saints, Gods people, Church-members</hi> by birth, and contrariwise unbelievers fleshly seed by nature <hi>dogs, swine, sinners, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean</hi> in such sort as the seed of Iews and Gentiles were under the law; but this rather and indeed <hi>viz.</hi> that believers themselves spiritually born by faith in Iesus Christ, circumcised in heart, doing <hi>Abrahams</hi> works, are now the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> a peculiar people, a holy nation, neer and deer unto him, that must dwell in his house, and be fed and refresht with that bread, of which there's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, and vnbelievers themselves, unholy ones in heart and life, never new born, nor become children to God and <hi>Abraham</hi> by faith in Christ, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining uncircumcised within, under the unclean lusts of the flesh, are those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean ones, and sinners with whom communion is not to be held by the other in Church bodies, those <hi>dogs</hi> and <hi>swine</hi> to whom the childrens bread is not to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, nor holy things given even the holy ordinances of the Gospel, nor pearls cast i. e. the precious particularities of professed believers, <hi>viz.</hi> baptism and the supper thrown away upon them.</p>

               <p>I cannot therefore but stand amazed in my mind to consider how miserably Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> mistakes himself in taking that text, from which to prove a present birth holinesse in the infants of believing Gentiles, which if there were no other to compare it with, doth sufficiently clear it of it self alone; how much more if compared with those forecited out of <hi>Act.</hi> 10. <hi>Act.</hi> 11 that there is now no such holinesse and uncleannesse <hi>as was</hi> once between <hi>Iews by nature,</hi> and such <hi>as</hi> were then called <hi>sinners of the Gentiles</hi>: yea if that distinction of <hi>Iews by nature, and sinners of the Gentiles</hi> spoken of <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.15. were now in being, &amp; remaining unabolished, it would be so farre from establishing that indeed it would utterly overthrow what Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> pleads for from it, and instead of advancing the naturall seed of believing Gentiles so high in holinesse as he would have them to be by birth, debase
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:109011:72"/>
them rather into a worse condition then I dare say any unbelieving Gentiles seed is in by birth (as to such a kind of uncleanness as they once were denominated by) in all the world; specially if it be so as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self saies p. 10. of his birth priviledge, viz. <hi>That the seed of believing Gentiles are now under one of those two heads in the text</hi>: For if that distinction be not now destroyed, and all men by birth come under one of those two denominations now; under which of them I trow will Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> rank the infants of believing Gentiles? he will not render himself so ridiculous sure as to say they are <hi>Iewes by nature,</hi> and therefore (unless the distinction be totally taken away) he must say they are by nature <hi>sinners of the Gentiles,</hi> which in the sense of the Law, is as if he should say <hi>Doggs, unholy, common,</hi> and <hi>unclean,</hi> and more then we our selves dare say of any now new-born infants under heaven, as in contra-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction to other.</p>
               <p>If he say they are neither <hi>sinners of the Gentiles,</hi> nor <hi>Iews by nature</hi> neither, then either he must say they are some third thing, which if he do Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> himself will contradict <hi>Mr. Blake</hi> in that, for he asserts pag. 10. of his Birth priviledge that <hi>the seed of believing parents under the Gospel must be lookt upon under one member of this division in this text, and that the Apostles distinction and distribution is so full and compleat that a third cannot be assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or</hi> else he must grant that this distinction is now wholly ceased under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which because tis the giving up of his whole cause he will be very loath to do, and therefore rather than do so (then which yet, if he well understood what is best for him he could not do a better thing) of the two he choses, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contradiction of himself, to rank them under a third head, to assert them to be some third thing, namely a sort of carnal holy seed of his own, and the Clergies coining, a Relative holy seed of their own consecrating, a faederall holy seed of their own feigning, a holy seed hatcht in their own heads, which are neither fish, nor flesh, nor good red herring, nor <hi>sinners of the Gentiles,</hi> nor <hi>Iews by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> nor <hi>Iews besides nature</hi> neither, i. e. by personal faith as all true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are, but <hi>quartum quoddam,</hi> a certain fourth thing, called <hi>Christians</hi> from their mothers womb, or ever they are so much as christen'd into the name, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipled into the nature, and yet for all this a seed set forth in such a transcendent manner, as if all other were in comparison of them by very descent, p. 13. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, sinners, unholy, dogs, and filthy swine.</p>
               <p>'Twere enough to make a wise man wonder to see how superlatively Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> magnifies this seed of believing Gentiles, above the seed of all other men in the world, even above the fleshly seed of <hi>Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob</hi> themselves, who only, at least mainly; had the promise of this priviledge of transmitting a Covenant holiness to their issue, and this but typically, and for a time neither, even till that seed should come, i. e.

Sirs where is the blessedness you speak of? where the great preheminence of believers seed under the Gospel doth nowly, in respect of which they are stiled by Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> and others such great and high born heirs, nor yet what inheritance it is, which by that bare fleshly birth onely they are heirs to, I could never yet find of my self, nor learn from any of you. As for the Iews by nature though they were not heirs of heaven it self, upon the meer fleshly birth of <hi>Abraham</hi> without faith <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.13. yet they were not called heirs meerly as born after the flesh in vain, for there was an <hi>earthly Canaan</hi> which they were heirs of, and God gave to them by promise as they were meerly the fleshly seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which also they actually enjoy'd according to the promise, whether they had any faith or moral holinesse yea or no, during that time of the law, but as for the fleshly seed of believing Gentiles, to which Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> translates the same birth priviledge of being holy and high born heirs by nature, they stand heirs (by that natural birth onely) of neither the earthly nor yet the heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi>: Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> feeds us with an empty title of <hi>holiness by birth, heirs by birth,</hi> but can't possibly say we are heirs of heaven by birth of believers, unless we believe our selves, and believing themselves those that by fleshly birth are of unbelieving pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are by promise heirs to it as much as any: nor can he say that the seed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Gentiles are heirs by birth (as the Jews were) of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and yet if the same birth priviledge, birth holiness, birth happiness they had, be now (as he saies it is) made over to such in the same way as twas once standing among the Jews, me thinks as they were disinherited from their land through unbelief, when once the time of standing by faith onely came, as well as from their title to the names of Church, people of God, a holy seed, heirs by birth and such like, so those that succeed them in their whole birth priviledge, should have their inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance as well as the name of heirs by birth, or else how is there such an equaliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the body of Christians with the Nation of the Jews, as Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> pleads there is p. 8. how can we be said to be as largely and in as full and ample manner invested with, and installed into the glorious fleshly birth-rights, which the Jews of old were dignified withal if we have not a plenary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of the outward benefits and blessings of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of that inheritance, which God then gave to those Iews by nature, to us and our fleshly seed, as well as of the outward oracles and ordinances? besides what a poor pitteous piece of birth priviledge is it, to be adopted instead of the Jews into the meer name of holy sons and heirs, and yet to have not a foot of that land which was the Iews inheritance, in respect to their fruition of which by right of a promise to <hi>Abraham</hi> and them, they were then honoured with that name of heirs? but if it be said that we are now by a birth of believing parents heirs (as they were then) of the heavenly inheritance, and the true eternal <hi>Canaan</hi> and kingdom whereof that was but a type, though we have not to do with that typical land it self as they once had; I still strongly deny it that either any Iews by nature then were, or any of the fleshly seed of believing Gentiles now are, by the faith of their fathers onely heirs by any promise at all of the kingdome of heaven, or any further at all then as dying in infancy they never deserved exemption by actuall trangressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or living to age they believe themselves, and so <hi>viz.</hi> dying in infancy before they have bard themselves by actual sin, or believing themselves when grown to age, I say still the fleshly seed, even of such fathers as never had any faith, are by that faith of their own heirs of the kingdom, which God hath prepared for all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

seed began so high as <hi>Abraham</hi> is a thing so out af doubt to me, that I dare say that as the holy land was not relatively holy till they came into it, so the holy seed, as well as the other holy things of that Covenant, were not ceremonially consecrated, nor formally sanctified, nor vouchsafed that title of a holy seed, though vertually they were a choise seed before, till a little before they were to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, and howbeit I challenge no man, yet I intreat any man in the world to shew me if he can where they were denominated and distinguished from all other people as unclean by that term of <hi>a holy people</hi> till God intituled them so by <hi>Moses, Exod</hi> 22.31. <hi>ye shall be holy men unto me neither shall ye eat any flesh that is torn of beasts, ye shall cast it to doggs</hi>: which place compared with <hi>Levit.</hi> 22.8.9. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.6. chap. 14.2. chap. 26.19. doth so plainly shew these two things.</p>
               <p>First, That the holiness there spoken of began but thenceforth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that it was but a certain ceremonial distinction, and a holinese op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to that kind of defilement, which might be contracted by eating of unclean beasts, and so fully ceased in <hi>Christ,</hi> that I even blush to read Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> and have been ashamed in my mind to hear some <hi>Independents</hi> also bring those Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, wherein God called Israel a holy people to himself, to prove, that an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churched believers meer fleshly seed is now by nature holy in the same sense.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then let us hear the conclusion of this whole matter: of the things that have been spoken this is the summe, <hi>viz.</hi> that there are three kinds of holiness, of which when you say children of believing parents have holiness, and consequenrly the spirit, you undoubtedly mean one, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>The Middlemost of which, because your fellow laborers against the Gospel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that chiefly in their books, I have treated on last, and most largely, and I now say three things of it in special.</p>
               <p>First, That it is a Holinesse which once was, but now is not in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That it is a Holiness which of it self, when it was in being, as it was at the beginning of the Gospel before Christ crucified, could not without faith and moral holiness interest the persons in whom it was seated in any of these three things, <hi>viz.</hi> Gospel Promises, Gospel Priviledges, or Gospel Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Not the promises, for they were made to <hi>Abraham</hi> in <hi>Christ</hi> and his spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual seed; not his own fleshly seed upon such terms, as bare birth of his body, or such holiness and righteousness as was under the Law intituling to <hi>Canaan Rom.</hi> 4.13.14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16.29.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Not the priviledges, <hi>viz.</hi> Gospel immunities, and Church-membership, for those that could plead they were under the typical freedomes of the old house, or Church under the Law, as <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed only were, are denyed by <hi>Christ</hi> to be that holy seed that should stand in the Gospel house, that was now to be built, or share in that spiritual freedome which the sonne gives, which is the only freedome indeed, unlesse they did <hi>Abrahams</hi> works, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.32. to the 40<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor yet the Ordinances, no not so much as <hi>Baptism</hi> the initiating ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it self, for when that old holy seed remaining yet under their relative and denominative holiness unabolished, did plead it as to baptism, they were put back by <hi>Iohn,</hi> and not permitted, barely upon that account upon which they stood in the old house, without faith, unless they now believed and amended their lives whose repulse of them when they came to his baptism was this <hi>viz. begin not to say we have Abraham to our Father &amp;c. Mat.</hi> 3.7, 8, 9. <hi>Luke</hi> 3.7.8.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:109011:77"/>Thirdly, suppose baptism were entailed so to that holinesse and a meer fleshly seed of believers, or of believing <hi>Abraham</hi> himself as truly as tis true it is not, yet how grossely were you overseen <hi>Gentlemen</hi> in undertaking to prove the holy spirit by it to be in infants, for thats the <hi>probandum,</hi> the very thing which by the holinesse of infants you went about to make good, for the minor of your first sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logism which was this, <hi>but little children have the holy spirit,</hi> being denied <hi>was proved</hi> (say you) <hi>first by their faith, secondly by their holinesse, thirdly by those Eulogies given them in Scripture</hi>: if then by holinesse you mean this kind of holiness, I mean ceremonial, which once was in the Iews by nature, you have a wet eele by the tail then indeed, for ask but Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> and he'le tell you, that that holinesse was in thousands who yet had not the <hi>holy</hi> spirit, yea in truth all the Iews had that holinesse, of whom not a <hi>Tenth,</hi> even then when they had it, were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in infancy, or at years morally sanctified, or indued with the holy spirit: and as I have said these three things in special, concerning that one kind of holinesse, so I have three things in general to say in short concerning al these three sorts of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, one of them was in infants of old, and now is not but is vanisht, and when it was it proved not the spirit <hi>viz. ceremonial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, another is, but nothing to your purpose, I mean the proof of the spirit, though it be in most infants <hi>viz. matrimonial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the other is not yet come for ought yet appears to infants <hi>viz. morall,</hi> which if it did appear to be in them <hi>positive, qualitativè,</hi> as an inherent quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not <hi>negative</hi> onely so as to be without sin, or absolutely innocent (for abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute innocency hath no need of baptism) then I should say something more to you, but you see it doth not, therefore though you said nothing then (as I wish since I had suffered you to do) from infants holinesse, to the proof of their having the spirit and right to baptism, yet I have searcht, but cannot possibly find what holinesse you could possibly have proved it <hi>by.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have been the larger here, though you gave me but a bare hint, by the nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation onely of infants holinesse: first, because here lies indeed the very principal <hi>knot</hi> and <hi>basis</hi> of this controversie, which you erring in are <hi>consequently</hi> erroneous in all <hi>your wayes,</hi> for <hi>Error minimus in principio fit major in medio, Maximus in fine.</hi> And as for all o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>her arguments <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> they are but as <hi>Auxilliarie</hi> hereunto.</p>
               <p>Secondly, because I am willing also sith you call so much for it, to give out my own grounds for the truth, by the way as I go along in disproving of your false ones, that you may either yield to them if sound, or answer and disprove them, if unsound and rotten: in the residue I shall be so much the briefer.</p>
               <p>The next argument whereby you undertake to prove infants of believing parents to have the holy spirit, is drawn from those <hi>Eulogies given them in Scripture, not inferior to those of the best Saints,</hi> from whence you thus argue.</p>

               <p>I answer first by denying <hi>your Major,</hi> which is not universally true, for persons may be blessed by Christ, and yet not have the holy spirit, for better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of which let it be considered that persons may be blest various <hi>wayes,</hi> from which <hi>yet</hi> to their having the holy spirit theres no consequence <hi>viz.</hi> outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and inwardly, temporally and spiritually, with blessings of the body and of the soul, of this life and that to come: first with outward temporal bodily blessings (abstract from the other) they <hi>may</hi> be and often are blessed, when yet at present at least (for so they must have as to <hi>your</hi> present purpose) they have not the <hi>holy</hi> spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, who possibly also never have it in all their lives, I mean in <hi>that</hi> sense from which <hi>Peter</hi> argues thus to their baptism <hi>Act.</hi> 10. for that some of <hi>you say</hi> when <hi>you</hi> can make advantage on't another way, was the spirit in the extraordinary gifts of it onely, as tongues, prophecy, utterance &amp;c. by which sense how ever <hi>your infancy</hi> is clear cut off from all capacity of having it, and so you are confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by your own party in the very corner stone of this your <hi>babish building</hi>; but Ile

give you the advantage of your own personal <hi>Tenet</hi> let it be what it will (save only that forenamed common sense of the spirit, wherein I have told you, tis in all men, who yet are not therefore to be baptized) I say again, both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and children may be blessed by Christ outwardly only, as with health, peace, plenty, fruitful seasons, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.45. <hi>God is good to all, and sends sun and rain i. e.</hi> all temporal blessings on the <hi>good and evil, just and unjust.</hi> The blessings of bodily protections, as to be guarded with <hi>Angells</hi> from heaven from dangers, and mischiefs; which is another of the <hi>Eulogies</hi> you here instance in, which to save your selves and me some labor, Ile take in hear, it being but a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral blessing, from which it follows not that such as are blessed with it must consequently have the holy spirit; also bodily salvation from and sanation of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ases, distempers, by Christ, who is a <hi>Saviour</hi> of the body; these blessings of the body, the barn, the basket, and the store, health, and external happinesse persons may be, and often are blessed with from <hi>God,</hi> who fills their bellies with hid treasure, so that they prosper and are not plagued, when yet they are wicked in their lives, and far from the holy spirit.</p>
               <p>Secondly; If you take <hi>Christs</hi> blessing (as in this place you must, for its so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and plainly expressed in one of the three Evangelists you quote, which write all the same thing in some difference of prase) for his praying for the persons whom he blessed, I say that even spiritually persons may be blessed by Christ in prayer for them, yea blessed with the blessing of the spirit it self, as <hi>de futuro,</hi> and and yet not, <hi>pro presenti,</hi> have the spirit: for Christ blessed his disciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.50. i. e. prayed for them that they might be endued with the spirit, and yet that he then prayed for, or by lifting up his hands, to the father then blessed them with, did not come on them till some while after: in this sense <hi>Isaac</hi> blessed <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob Gen.</hi> 27.28.29. <hi>Iacob Ioseph, Gen.</hi> 40.15.16. the <hi>High-Priest</hi> all the <hi>People, Num.</hi> 6.23. <hi>Moses</hi> all <hi>Israel</hi> before his <hi>departure</hi> also, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.1. &amp;c, and yet they were not actually possessed of the blessings just then, when they blessed them, but along time after. There is a blessing by <hi>promise,</hi> as <hi>God</hi> blessed <hi>Abraham</hi> with a Son, and the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi>; a blessing by <hi>Prophesy</hi> as <hi>Iacob</hi> blessed all his Sonnes fortelling, as I may say, their several fortunes <hi>Gen.</hi>' 41. a blessing by <hi>Prayer,</hi> as in the forenamed places, and in this of Mat. 19.13. Mark 10.16. And there's a blessing by <hi>putting into actual possession, and fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a mercy,</hi> so God blessed <hi>Israel</hi> with the real enjoyment of the Land of <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> and all temporal blessings in that earthly place, &amp; so <hi>Antitypically</hi> will once bless all the spiritual seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places by <hi>Christ Iesus Eph.</hi> 1.4. Now the three first waies of blessing persons are all concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things to come, and sometimes a long while after; yea in prayer <hi>Christ</hi> blest all that ever should believe on him through the word to the worlds end, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. so long before the thing befell them, that it was even before most of them were born.</p>
               <p>As to your <hi>Minor</hi> then, wherein you say, little children were blessed by <hi>Christ,</hi> I grant it to be true, but not in any such sence as truely argues at all that in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy they had the holy spirit. For</p>
               <p>First, it of the two most plainly appears that his blessing was no other then bodily infirmities, which are as incident to infants as men, and the end for which they brought them shews the utmost he did to them, which was not that he should baptize them (as I shall more clearly shew by and by) but that he should touch them, and put his hands on them, and pray: no question twas in order to heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for twas at a time when he healed many others, if you compare this passage as tis in <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. with the first and second verses of the Chapter: yea <hi>v.</hi> 15. tis plainly expressed what he did, i. e. he laid his hands upon them, and departed thence; besides <hi>Luke</hi> saies they brought little children unto him also that he should touch them: which [<hi>ALSO</hi>] shews that others were brought too, as sick folks commonly were, <hi>because vertue went out of him, so that as many as touched him were made perfectly whole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:109011:78"/>Secondly, if he did blesse them spiritually in his prayers, twas doubtless (yet all whom he healed were not so blessed neither, witness the nine <hi>Leapers</hi>) concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things to come, and if he prayd for their particular salvation, yet they might not immediately have the spirit. But</p>
               <p>Thirdly, What ever twas he did to those particular infants (which whether they were believers infants or no too no man can tell) for many sought him for loaves, and outward mercies, and many for healing of themselves, and children, meerly that they might be rid of their burdens, on whom yet he had compassion for all that) yet first what is this to other infants, or to ours that cannot now be brought to his person? besides what more to believers than unbelievers infants? what more to any then to all? away therefore for shame with such <hi>dry Divinity</hi> as this: <hi>he touched those children and blest them, that were then presented to him, that he might touch them, therefore all believers infants have the holy spirit, and must be baptized</hi>: away with such <hi>dribling dispute</hi> also, it is not fit for <hi>Christs School,</hi> nor mans neither.</p>
               <p>The next <hi>Eulogie</hi> you mention is this, <hi>viz.</hi> Their being declared to have right to the Kindome of heaven, whence your Argument must run thus.</p>

               <p>Bare simple innocency, harmlessnesse and freedom from hurt proves neither holinesse, nor holy spirit to be where it is, it being capable to be not onely in infants, who in respect of age and stature, though not of kind and nature, are in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way at least an uncapable subject of the other, but also in creatures by kind uncapable at any time of the spirit, <hi>viz. doves, sheep, lambs,</hi> every of which (as well as <hi>infants</hi>) are set forth also as examples of meeknesse, patience, innocency, silence, under suffering, as the <hi>Ant</hi> is also for diligence and forecast, the <hi>vine</hi> for fruitfulnesse, the <hi>Serpent</hi> for wisdom to the Saints, and yet have not thereupon the holy spirit, yea <hi>Eulogies</hi> for some one particular natural excellency, qualification and indowment, and those <hi>not inferiour to those of the best Saints</hi> may be given, and that as an example for the Saints, not onely to other creatures and innocent infants, but also to such as are elsewise injurious, and no way ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary to others at all, <hi>e. g.</hi> the <hi>unjust steward Luke</hi> 16. who though a meer child of the world, yet is commended by Christ as having done wisely, yea more wisely (<hi>in suo genere</hi>) then the children of light, and given as a pattern of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and forecast to them, and yet I should be in doubt whether that man were well in his wits or no, that should argue from those <hi>Eulogies</hi> to those holy spirit.</p>
               <p>Secondly from which innocency yet, if it would follow that the spirit is in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, it must be in all as well as some: for is one Infant more free from actual sin, and in point of innocency propounded as our pattern by Christ more then another? is

               <p>And so <hi>Sirs</hi> having weighed all your <hi>Eulogies</hi> one after another in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of right reason, and found them too light, Ile onely add one argument of mine own from the very places you quote, from which if either men did not dote on them, because they are found in the <hi>old Liturgy,</hi> and the new <hi>Directory,</hi> or were not resolved to take tag, rag and long tail, to scrape together even all the impertinencies that ere they can meet with, in proof of infant baptism, rather then to forgo it now they are ingaged in't, there is no clearer consequence in the world then that infants are not to be baptized, and then Ile pass on to your other proofs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If those very numericall infants spoken of in those very places Mat.</hi> 18. <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. <hi>from whence, and from the carriage and practise of Christ there towards them, the priest-hood pleads the baptism of other infants, of whom Christ did never so individually declare (as he did of these, that they should be brought to him, and that of such is the kingdome of heaven) were not baptized by Christ, nor his disciples in the primitive times of the Gospel, which are our pattern, then it follows not from the example of these infants that other infants are, but rather that they are not to be baptized.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But those very infants spoken of in those very places from whence &amp;c. were not baptized either by Christ or by his disciples &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is most undeniably clear, for by what warrant may we take upon us to baptize other infants, when those infants were not baptized that were brought to Christs own person, and whose particular personal right to the kingdom (as you your selves say) Christ there declares? for tis contended by you that the word [<gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>But to deal ingenuously and faithfully with you the text viz.

I never could meet with the man yet that was so shamelesse as to assert that the infants there spoken of were baptized, excepting Dr. <hi>Holmes,</hi> and he indeed helps this lame businesse ore the stile, and lends a left handed lift towards the proof of it, that these infants that were brought to Christ were baptized, and that thus. <note n="o" place="margin">p. 58. of his animad. on Mr. Tombes Exercit.</note>

                  </gap>ling to and fro, that he must have more brains then I, that can pick out of them what he means distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by them: for in some of them one would think he meant as if those infants were
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:109011:80"/>
baptized before they came to Christ, and were brought onely now for imposition of hands, in some again as if they had bin then baptized, and brought then to both that and to the other, but which of the two he means it matters not, so long as I shall prove by and by, that twas neither this nor that.</p>
               <p>But by the way I desire all men to take notice of Dr. <hi>Holmes</hi> his proofs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he strives to clear it that the infants brought to Christ had then the ordinance of imposition of hands, and so had been baptized before, and how they are not onely nothing cogent, but so clearly cogent and consequential to the very contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that he that reads them with reason must needs conclude the Doctors right eye of reason was not a little bleared (not to say absolutely blinded) by one thing or other when he wrote them: yea all he saies for the clearing of that, doth clearly contradict and overthrow it.</p>
               <p>In proof of what he saies in this particular <hi>viz.</hi> that the ordinance of laying on of hands was dispensed to these infants that were brought to Christ, he alledges the practise of the Antient times, at it is mentioned by <hi>Pareus, Caluin, Hoph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Marlorat, Bullinger, and Cotton</hi> too, which all according as Dr. <hi>Holmes</hi> himself hath recorded their words, first severally in chap. seventh of his animad-versions p. 58.59.60. and <hi>summarily</hi> ore again as it were to set his folly on high that all might see it, in the 10th chapter p. 85.86. do testifie <hi>uno ore</hi> with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent that <hi>in antient time infants were not admitted to imposition of hands, nor confirmed in the fruition of Church estate thereby,</hi> that being indeed as himself asserts, from them too, one prime intent of that ordinance which is one of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation doctrines to Church fellowship, till to use the very same phrase he quotes out of them, <hi>being past their childhood, past innocency grown up to years, youths at least, that made profession of faith, they were received not to that onely, but to the supper, and all other Church liberties also.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which term <hi>Antient times</hi> tis not easie to discern neither from him so indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly doth he utter himself in this, as also in most of his other matter, whether he mean the true and pure primitive times of the most antient fathers the Apostles, which is our rule, or the new and post-primitive times of the fathers since them, which though declining daily into corruption, the priest-hood hath ever for ought I find, in more account then the other, yet by one clause he seems more to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to the Apostles dayes, <hi>viz.</hi> in p. 85. the last line, where after he had cited the fore-named Authors, and their joint opinion concerning the dispensing impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of hands in foretimes to grown persons onely, he adds this viz. <hi>so that the original of imposition of hands came down from the Apostles; thus far these lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men</hi> (saith he) but which ere he means it makes much what one for him, there being no times, primitive, or posteren wherein the ordinance of laying on of hands was given to infants, unlesse in that midnight of popery wherein they gave the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to them also: for is it not equally absurd, and (if worse can be) worse then senseless, for a man to gather so undoubtedly (as he doth) that Christ at that time dispensed the ordinance of laying on of hands to those infants in <hi>Mark</hi> 10. in their infancy, because the Apostles and Churches in after times, whose pattern he was, did dispense it to persons ever, when they were past childhood, and grown to years? doth not this rather most evidently evince one of these two things <hi>viz.</hi> either that the imposition of hands Christ gave to these infants was not that ordinance the Apostles in antient Churches practised to men at years onely (and that it was not I shall shew by and by) or else that the Apostles did dispense the Gospell ordinances to other subjects then Christ himself did, whom they were to follow, <hi>viz.</hi> he to infants, and they onely to persons past infancy? Moreover if the Apostles did lay on hands at years, though Christ in infancy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what if Christ had baptized those infants in infancy also? are we more tied to follow his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in that, then in the dispensation of laying on of hands? you see therefore how the Doctor though he borrows his friend Mr. <hi>Cottins</hi> reading, and reasons out of

antiquity (as himself saies p. 86. of his animadversions) to make good a shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful assertion, and argumentation of his own <hi>viz.</hi> that those infants which were then brought to Christ had both baptism and imposition of hands, and even there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore baptism before, because <hi>imposition of hands</hi> then, yet makes so bold with it for all that, as flatly to contradict not himself onely, but Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> also, whose judgement is far sounder then his in this case, by inferring two things from Mr. <hi>Cot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If you say they had baptism before they were brought to Christ, I wonder how they came by it, or where they had it, or who administred it, sith this surely was their first appearance before Christ and his disciples, and how any else but they could do it ask your selves, who make more ado then needs about the bare admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strators of baptism as if they must needs be none but <hi>Ministers in orders</hi>: if you say <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> might do it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my <hi>no</hi> is better then your <hi>yea</hi> if I say he might not, for as you have nothing but thought to ground your thoughts on that he did bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ou nor I neuer find that any were baptized but in doing of that, which infants cannot do <hi>viz.</hi> confessing their sins. Yet of the two this seems rather to be Dr. <hi>Holmes's</hi> fancy, that they had been baptized before they were brought thither, for p. 61, they are supposed here saith he, to have been before baptized, because they were brought to this higher addition, of imposition of hands, and blessing.</p>
               <p>If you say they were then baptized when brought, <hi>it must be either by Christ or his disciples, but neither by him nor them,</hi>

                  <hi>Ergo not at all at that time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First not by Christ, for he baptized not all with his own hands, onely he is said to baptize because his disciples did it by order and commission from him <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.22.23. with <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.12.</p>
               <p>Secondly, nor were they brought to him for any such end as that he should baptize them, but that he should <hi>touch them and pray,</hi> which so soon as he had done, <hi>he went his way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly not by his discipl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:109011:81"/>
of <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptism, but dispensers of baptism themselves also long enough before this time, to have been instructed in the true subject of it, for the bringing of those infants was after <hi>Iohn</hi> was beheaded, but <hi>Christ</hi> by his disciples had baptized in <hi>Iudea</hi> before <hi>Iohn</hi> was in prison, and whilest <hi>Iohn</hi> was yet himself baptizing in <hi>Euon</hi>; yea and had made, and baptized more disciples than <hi>Iohn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides the ground of their rebuke of those that came with little children was no doubt their care, and loathness to have <hi>Christ</hi> too much prest, in which case they sometimes rebuked others, when they throngd upon him so fast for healing, that they had no leasure so much as to eat bread.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that they came not now under <hi>Imposition of hands</hi> in that sense the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> treats on, is most evident.</p>
               <p>First, by the D<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> own quotations of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Calvins,</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Cottons</hi> readings concerning the practise of the first times; for so far are they from clearing such a thing, as he alledges them for, that they clear the clean contrary, the subjects of that imposition of hands, they speak of, being only professors of the faith, and not infants; yea how doth D <hi>Holmes</hi> belabor himself to prove it, that those to whom the primitive Churches dispeased <hi>Imposition of hands</hi> were persons grown to years, more then doth his cause good, and more then any wise man puts him to by the denial of it, but those that were brought to Christ for it here spoken of none other then very infants in their nonage.</p>
               <p>Secondly in that this ordinance of laying on of hands was not likely yet in use and being in this <hi>prae-primitive</hi>-period, wherein <hi>Christ</hi> laid his hands on these infants; the ends in order whereunto it was enjoined, and practised when it was, being such as in this juncture, not only infants, but also the very disciples them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were uncapable of <hi>viz.</hi> (as the Doctors own quotations truly shew) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and full fruition of, confirmation in Church state, Gospel Church liberties, Church-fellowships in all Church ordinances, <hi>viz.</hi> the Supper, and suppicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and also the receiving of the holy spirit, none of all which were yet given to any, in such wise as afterwards they were, no not to the Disciples till either just before (as the Supper) or else after <hi>Christ</hi> was crucified: for howbeit matter for the Gospel Church, and fellowship was fitting, preparing and gathering in by preaching and baptizing even from <hi>Iohn,</hi> who began the Gospel two or three years before that, and the Gospel Church was as it were in a certain <hi>Chaos,</hi> or <hi>Congeries</hi> of matter not yet digested into its perfect form, somewhile before the Jews Church was ended in Christ death, yet it came not to have its own formall constitution, in point of visible order, posture, fellowship, government, offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, discipline, endowments with the spirit, whereby they might be built up an habitation of God, and ordinance of laying on of hands in prayer, specially relating thereunto, till after Christ crucified, and ascended, the holy spirit being not yet come, because Jesus not yet glorified.</p>
               <p>Thirdly they came not for this but for another kind of <hi>Imposition of hand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> which is otherwise called <hi>touching,</hi> which who ever had from him were (in case of diseases) made whole. They came surely for that laying on of hands which D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Holmes</hi> himself speaks of p. 57. out of <hi>Hophman; viz.</hi> a laying on in order to healing, for which healing, by a touch of him, many men, women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren came, or else were brought to Christ, while others that were well came to hear him <hi>Mark</hi> 5.27.28.29.30. <hi>Luke</hi> 6.17.18.19. <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.13.14.34.35.36.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Imposition of hands</hi> therefore that these infants had was not that which persons, when past infancy only, had in the Churches after, and for D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Holmes</hi> to say the Apostles and ancient Churches confirmed persons by prayer, and laying on of hands, when they were past infancy, and not in it, therefore surely Christ to the same intent and purpose laid hands on these in infancy, is equally absurd as to argue thus, <hi>viz.</hi> the Apostles and primitive times practised baptism to men and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:109011:82"/>
women onely confessing sin, and professing faith, therefore it is most fitting, and likely now to be the will of Christ, that persons should be sprinkled in their non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age: so brittle are all the bottoms you yet build on, but to proceed.</p>

               <p>First, is there no <hi>Medium</hi> between being a reprobate, and a present having the holy spirit? there were twelve Disciples at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> which had not so much as heard of the holy spirit, so far were they from having it yet, yet dare you say they were all reprobates? there were many men and women that believed the things spoken by <hi>Philip</hi> pertaining to the Kingdome, upon which the holy spirit had not yet fallen, were they all reprobates, because they had not yet received it? or those thousands <hi>Peter</hi> promised the holy spirit to, were they all reprobates, because they yet had it not, when he spake to them? yea millions of men ly yet in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, and so far from having, that at present they rather scoff at the holy spirit, yet dare you not say they are all reprobates; for some of them may turn at <hi>Christs</hi> reproof (for ought you know) therefore what consequence is there from not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reprobates, to a present possession of the holy spirit?</p>
               <p>Secondly, do you know so precisely which infants are <hi>Elect,</hi> and which <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate,</hi>

               <p>In which words see how plainly you acknowledge that no conclusion can be made of it, that infants of Christians have the habit of faith, i. e. it is a thing that doth not necessarily follow, and cannot appear in infancy at all, nor be certainly presumed, whether they have or have it not, till they come to years, and be seen to act, so that then it may be known by your own confession, and yet in this place I am now in hand with you say no more nor lesse, but in effect the clean contrary, as also p. 16. where you seem to wonder almost, and fault the difficulty in mens understandings that there are at all any doubts in them about their having it, avouching that the Scriptures by necessary consequences confirme the thing viz. that they have it, <hi>That the report of Scripture concerning little children, and the necessary consequences of the former arguments do make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, yea plainly, yea more plainly then the profession of any particular person at years can make it appear of himself.</hi>

               <p>Moreover (to animadvert this present passage of yours yet a little further) wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you say here, that the report of Scripture concerning little infants, which is Gods testimony, and to be preferred before mans, doth more plainly prove it that infants
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:109011:83"/>
have faith and the holy spirit then any particular mans testimony doth prove it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himself,</p>
               <p>I answer, first by denying that God in Scripture gives any such testimony at all concerning little infants litterally taken, that they have faith and the holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if that phrase <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.6. <hi>viz. these little ones which believe in me</hi> could have any such construction as of little infants litterally, yet I deny that he speaks of them any otherwise then by a <hi>Prosopeiâ</hi> as I said before.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if it were to be proved (as it never can be) that he speaks there of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and not figuratively neither, but plainly and properly, yet tis most plain that he speaks but <hi>indifinitely,</hi> not <hi>particularly</hi> of one infant more then another, or of <hi>Christians infants</hi> more then of <hi>infidels,</hi> so as that you can thereupon take on you (as you daily do) to distinguish which have the spirit which have not, and accordingly to admit these to baptism, and debar those, yea you your selves do ore and ore express it p. 5.6. that what the Scripture declares Infants to be, it declares them so to be in generall, specially while any particulars of them have not yet barrd themselves by actual sin, or deserv'd to be exempted from what the Scripture hath in general declared them to be: so that all this that you have brought thus far hath not the weight of a feather, to warrant your good opinion of one infant above another, and your practise of baptism to this or that particular infant (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a believers) rather then an unbelievers.</p>
               <p>It would be no plain but a muddy, totter'd confus'd implicit shufling kind of argumentation for me, if I were to give account why I baptize this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man or woman, and not others to argue thus indifinitly (as you do all along) <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <p>No man may forbid them to be baptized that believe and have the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
                     <p>But the Scripture declares that men and women may believe, and have the spirit.</p>
                     <p>Ergo men and women must be baptized.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>If I should (I say) go on thus in generals onely not making it appear, that thers any faith at all in these individuals whom I baptize, more then in others, I should take him for little better then a fool, who should take me for a wise man in so ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, yet so and no otherwise do you argue, whilst when we put you to prove that those infants whom you baptize have title to it, in contradistinction to heathens infants, whose right to baptism you deny, you give us your account in these inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate terms <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <p>Those that have faith and the holy spirit may be baptized.</p>
                     <p>But the Scripture testifies that little children have faith &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Ergo little children may be baptized.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I say what a bald way of arguing is this? wherein you conclude no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the particular infants, whose right to baptism we put you to plead, while you shut out other, then concerning those very infants also whom you so shut out.</p>
               <p>This is just as silly as if you being put to prove your own particular salvation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Iudas's</hi> should do it thus <hi>viz.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Without making any proof of your own faith in particular, whose salvation you would so prove above his, whereas you should of right argue onward from the <hi>Major</hi> thus <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>And so had you dealt down rightly, and plaid above board in your <hi>Disputation,</hi>

                     <p>All and only those infants that believe are to be baptized.</p>

               <p>But you know of your own selves this would be too broad a discoverie, the <hi>Minor</hi> being so apparently false, that you cannot hide your halting by it from the view of the very vulgar, if you should so express it: for he that hath but half an eie may see, that as there is no more faith to be seen, so the Scripture declares no more faith to be in believers infants, than in the infants of unbelievers; or if you <hi>will</hi> needs have the <hi>Minor</hi> in such general and indefinite terms, yet at least grant us a fair <hi>Conclusion</hi> concerning those particular infants you dispute aboue, no less than that can amount to so much as ingenuity, and then it must run thus, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <p>The Scripture gives good report of little infants in general.</p>

                     <p>The Scripture speaks well of little infants indefinitely, i. e. of some at least (though not all, and we know not which) as having faith, the spirit and right to baptism.</p>
                     <p>Therefore undoubtedly these little infants whom we baptize are well spoken of in that kind and must be baptized.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As tis to argue thus,</hi> The Scripture declares that <hi>John Baptist</hi> had the holy spirit.</p>

               <p>Besides the falsity of both the premises, there's no more at all concluded from them concerning any one infant, then might (if they were true indeed) be as truly concluded from them concerning all.</p>
               <p>First O the rottenness and infirmitie of the <hi>Major</hi>! it is most manifestly fals, for there are many things, which to doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of may be a breach of Christian charity, which yet do not at present sufficiently appear.</p>
               <p>To doubt that this or that particular infant will hereafter live holily, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Gospel, may be a breach of Christian Charity, whose rule is ever to hope the best, till it sees the contrary, and yet that this or that particular infant will live holily and imbrace the Gospel when he comes to age, doth not yet so sufficiently appear, but that (as more plainly as things appear with you in infancie then at age by particular profession) it may more sufficiently appear when they are grown up, yea till then it appeareth not at all.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> also is false, for to doubt that this or that infant hath at present the holy spirit is no breach of Christian charity at all; sith (what hopes soever we may have of them as to the future) yet at present there is no evidence that they have it, nor yet any promise at all that it shall be given to them in infancy, nor at years neither till they believe and obey the Gospel: and as there is no promise of it to them in infancie, so in meer infancy there is no such use of it to them, as tis promised to be of unto believers; neither doth it either quicken, inlighten, convince, convert, comfort, or any other way officiate as a seal of redemption, and remission of sins to such as have no sins as yet to be remitted.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if both these premises were as true as you suppose them, yet would it follow no more from them, nor from all <hi>you</hi> say toward the proof of either of them that believers infants have the holy spirit, then it would that unbel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus all that ever you have done hitherto is utterly undone, for the Argument you began upon, and the basis of your building is, that believers infants (for their baptism only you plead, denying the baptism of other infants, as well as we) have the holy spirit, this upon denial of any sufficience in all your former proofs to make it appear, is at last undertaken by you to be made sufficiently appear in this last <hi>Syllogism</hi>; which if it do not make it as sufficiently appear concerning unbelievers infants (considering your own matter used to prove the Minor) as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the other, then my candle is quite gone out, but if it do then surely the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry light that is in you is utter darkness.</p>

               <head>Disproof.</head>
               <p>First whereas you quere how those we baptize make it appear that they have the holy spirit before we baptize them.</p>
               <p>I answer I know no necessity of making ir appear that persons have the holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit before their admission to baptism, for though we find once that God Antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated his promise, and gave the holy spirit before baptism, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. yet I know not, nor yet do you, any promise there is, whereupon in an ordinary way we can expect it, of receiving the holy spirit of promise till after faith, repentance obedience, turning to God, baptism, and asking of it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.38.39. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. chap. 5.32. chap. 8.16.19. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.13.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as for the holy spirits appearing infallibly.</p>
               <p>I answer first it may possibly appear infallibly to be in some, in whom it is, as <hi>Act.</hi> 10.44.45.46.47. by sundry fruits, and manifestations of it, which may warrant us to say <hi>God is in them of a truth: Mat.</hi> 7.16.17.18.19.20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.25.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:109011:85"/>It may I say undoubtedly appear to be in men and women, but cannot and way at all so appear to be in infants, if we may believe your selves, who tell us p, 8. <hi>that infants have not the exercise and fruit of faith,</hi> and p. 18. <hi>that instruction of the understanding in matter of faith in some sort must go before any act of faith can be discovered, and that no judgement of science can be past upon infants, till the acts themselves be seen and examined, for</hi> a posteriore <hi>onely the discovery of habits is made, and that unlesse it could be certainly presumd what children have it, what have not there can be no conclusion made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And howbeit I am not of the seekers mind, that an appearance of the holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in any person before baptism in water doth exempt him from it, but am well assured that it strictly rather ingages him to it, or else <hi>Peter</hi> could not have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them in name of the Lord to be baptiz'd in water, upon whom the holy spirit fell Act. 10. but must rather have forbid it, as <hi>frustraneous,</hi> and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>superfluous</hi>; yet that the spirit should appear at all to be in men, in order to their baptism, much more that it should appear infallibly to be in them, is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of no necessity that I know of, sith in the word its not required that persons be baptized with the holy spirit first in order to their baptism with water, but that they be first baptized in water, in order to their receiving the holy spirit <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. for the baptism of the spirit as tis promised onely to believers; so we believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, obeying the Gospel, and asking the holy spirit, tis signified to us as one thing that shall be given among the rest, in that very way of water baptism: so that its enough for us (as to the baptism of persons) to take cognizance of it that they believe and repent, which things though they cannot do without the spirit performing its common office of striving, drawing, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, inlightning, convicting of good and evil, sin and righteousness &amp;c. in all which it acts to the whole world, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.8. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.51. yet they not <hi>only may</hi> do them without, but must do them before <hi>they</hi> can <hi>by</hi> promise expect the spirit, in those special respects, wherein he is promised to believers, and calld that holy spirit of promise.</p>
               <p>And now because <hi>you</hi> ask how we know they have faith whom we baptize? I answer <hi>by</hi> their profession, which gives though not infallibility; <hi>yet by your</hi> leave, for all <hi>your</hi> preferring the <hi>Eulogies</hi> given in general to all infants above any mans personal profession for himself in this case a far clearer and better grounded judgement of charity concerning them, that they have faith, then that <hi>you</hi> have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning infants, which at best is but <hi>charity mistaken</hi> for <hi>cruelty,</hi> whilst it takes that to be in infants, and that on pain of their damnation too they <hi>dying without it, viz.</hi> believing see p. 8. which infants are utterly uncapable of; and whilst it takes even that too, without which it holds no infants are saved, to be in but <hi>very</hi> few infants <hi>viz.</hi> believers infants onely, and so damns all other <hi>dying</hi> infants, which are far more innumerable, and as capable of faith, and as little barring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by actual sin from salvation, and as little deserving damnation, as the other, so that whether we or <hi>you</hi> plead the cause of innocent infants let the world judge.</p>
               <p>And whereas <hi>you</hi> suppose that because in <hi>charity onely</hi> we judge men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to believe, therefore we passe no other judgement then that of <hi>charity onely</hi> on them to be the subjects of baptism: herein <hi>you grossely</hi> mistake our grounds of baptizing, for thought that of <hi>charity onely</hi> is the judgement whereby we judge them to be believers, <hi>yet</hi> that is not the <hi>onely</hi> judgement <hi>whereby</hi> we judge them to be the subjects of baptism, but as to that we go upon a judgement of <hi>certainty and infallibility</hi> also, for though it be not infallible to us that <hi>every</hi> one that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses to believe, doth as <hi>truly</hi> believe as he professes, <hi>yet</hi> this is infallible to us concerning him that professes <hi>viz.</hi> both that he professes, and also that professing to believe with all his heart, so that we in <hi>charity may</hi> judge him so to do, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he lie or no, he is <hi>by</hi> the rule of the word <hi>quoad nos</hi> a warrantable, undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and (as no infant is) infallible subject of baptism, for the word requires us to

baptize such, as after our preaching the faith to them, do <hi>truly</hi> professe to believe whether they believe as <hi>truly</hi> as <hi>they</hi> profest or no, for that indeed is not so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible to us, but it warrants us not to baptize <hi>any</hi> infants, who can neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not professe.</p>
               <p>Moreover sith <hi>you say</hi> let us pass the same judgement upon little infants as <hi>you</hi> do, of whom in generall <hi>say you</hi> the Scripture gives so good a report, and against whom in particular no exception can be raised, and so the controversie shall be at an end.</p>
               <p>I tell <hi>you</hi> we do passe not the same, but a far surer judgement then that of <hi>charity</hi> upon infants dying in infancy; and have an hundred fold more clear, and more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der opinion of them then yourselves, whilst we have from the word well grounded hopes and assurance that no dying infant is damned, but you with over pleading the bare outward priviledges of some, most ignorantly damn 20 dying infants to one. But as to your judgement of <hi>charity</hi> concerning infants believing, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby inrighted to baptism, or that same judgement of <hi>charity</hi> which we act toward professors of faith; you may dream as long as you will on such erroneous <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> but those that are awake to righteousnesse, and resolved to sin no more by popish superstition, know well enough that infants (though nere the worse for want ont yet) cannot believe in Christ of whom they are not capable to hear, much less can they professe so to do, and thereby give that good ground, which right <hi>charity</hi> must have, whereupon to build her faith of this, i. e, to believe that they do believe, and believing are certainly to be baptized, so that we have <hi>chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> well grounded concerning infants, and such as comparatively to which <hi>your tender mercy</hi> to millions of them is <hi>meer cruelty,</hi> and yet the controversie is not ended, nor is likely to come to an end in such a way.</p>
               <p>Give me leave therefore a little to play upon you here with your own weapons, and to call for an answer from you to your own queres, and so it may be in a fair way towards an end in time, whereas then you plead the baptism of believers infants and no others, upon such a sufficient appearance that they have faith and the holy spirit. I ask</p>
               <p>First how do these make it appear that they have faith and the holy spirit since they cannot do it by profession.</p>
               <p>Secondly, how far forth do they make it appear to you? <hi>infallibly</hi>? or but <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably? your</hi> selves <hi>say</hi> not <hi>infallibly,</hi> for the <hi>spirit is not bound to all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Christian parents, nor barrd from any of the children of infidels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, what judgement do you passe upon believers infants to be the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of baptism, rather then other infants? that of <hi>charity</hi>? or that of <hi>certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>? that of certainty <hi>you</hi> disclaim p. 18. in these words, <hi>no judgement of science can be passed, till the Acts of faith themselves be seen</hi> and examined, and in these also <hi>viz. unlesse it could be certainly presumed what children have the habit, what have not, for the working of the spirit is not known to us, he is not bound nor barrd, there can be no conclusion made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That of <hi>charity</hi> then is the onely judgement you passe on these, and whereby <hi>you</hi> judge believers infants and no other, to have faith, the spirit and right to baptism, which charity teacheth us <hi>praesumere</hi> &amp;c. to believe and hope all things, &amp; hope the best concerning all till ye see the worst, <hi>especially since litt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Well then to close up all, let me but desire <hi>you</hi> to passe the same judgement of <hi>charity</hi> on all little infants, as <hi>you</hi> do on some, even upon the little ones of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, Infidels, Turks and Pagans (whilst infants) of whom in general, and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discrimmatim</hi> the Scripture gives a good report, not commending believers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants above them, and <hi>against whom in particular no exception can be raised,</hi> more then against the other, saving that one fault (of theirs) onely that they were not born of believings parents, which I hope you have so much <hi>charity</hi> as to pardon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:109011:86"/>Hope, I say as well of the infants of unbelieving parents, that they have faith and the holy spirit, specially <hi>since it cannot appear that these have by any actual sin barred themselves, or deserved any</hi> more then the other <hi>to be exempted from the general state of little infants declared in Scripture,</hi> and then the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie between you and me, which is whether little children born of believing parents only, may be lawfully baptized, is like to be at an end, for then certainly you will either agree to it that all infants in the world, even of <hi>infidels, Turks,</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> (these being in the judgement of <hi>Charity</hi> as undeserving damnation as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) may be and are (dying in infancy, though this with you is as heinous a thing as to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To which <hi>Dilemma</hi> I am well enough assured you can answer nothing in the least measure satisfactory, as the most judicious readers (if you Ministers inquire of them) will undoubtedly affirm also. and so I proceed to your other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> here is most undeniably true for what opinion soever doth make the Gospel covenant worse then that under the Law contrary to <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed both false, and wicked.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Minor</hi> wherein you say that the denial of baptism to little infants makes the Gospel covenant worse then that under the Law, contrary to <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. where the Gospel is said to be a better covenant then that of the Law, in this respect as it is <hi>established upon better promises,</hi> this is most palpably false; yea I appeal to every man, who doth not wilfully shut his eies against the truth, to judge between us, whether our opinion or your own rather doth most clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict that Scripture of your own alledging <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. in order to the true dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning of which,</p>
               <p>First, Mark well what it is that is there asserted concerning the meliority of the Gospel covenant above that of law, and you shall find it to be this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Gospel covenant whereof <hi>Christ</hi> is the Mediator is a covenant that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises better things, better injoyments, or a better inheritance then that of the Law did, whereupon it there bears the name of a better Covenant, then that of which <hi>Moses</hi> was the Mediator.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Mark whether our denial of infant baptism do at all contradict that; for what if infants be not baptized, doth that make that the promises of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel are worse than the promises of the Law? nay verily who ever is or is not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, the promises of the Gospel are both in our opinion, and our constant ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation of it too in this particular, better and as far beyond the promises of the Law, as the <hi>substance</hi> is beyond the shadow, the <hi>City</hi> ir self beyond the map of it that is on the wall; for the promises of the Gospel are of the whole world <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.13. of a heavenly inheritance, incorruptible <hi>Canaan,</hi> Crown, Kingdome,

Abraham</hi> and not to all his fleshly posterity neither (for his posterity by <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Keturah</hi> were excluded, and that covenant established with <hi>Isaac</hi> and his seed only, and that in case of obedience to the voice of <hi>Moses</hi> the Mediator of that Testament, when God should give out his mind to them by him in that covenant more perfectly then he did in the daies of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in case of observance of the Law, whereof circumcision was a part, though given before, and an Ingagement to them to keep the whole, when it should be given, and all this but as a Map, and type for a time of the Gospel Covenant, which was made and established on better promises with a better seed, i. e. not a carnal, but spiritual seed, not such as are of <hi>Abrahams</hi> own much less of any inferiour mens flesh, but such as are of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, and do his works, i. e. believers themselves this is our opinion, which if it do not rather confirm then contradict that meliori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Gospel-covenant, and its promises above that of the Law, which meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority is spoken of <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6.

               <p>But now as for your selves, who stand so much in vindication of the Gospel co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as a better Covenant then that under the Law, and that in that very respect, in which it is said to be a better Covenant <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. <hi>viz. established upon better promises,</hi> ile shew you plainly how you are so far from making it better then the Law, as that you make that of the Law at least equal to it, for whereas that Scripture which you quote saies plainly that the Gospel is a better Covenant than that of the law; forasmuch as it stands on better promises, yet that is never the better for you in your cause whose tenet utterly denies, &amp; flatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts that, for you say that the things promised in the word of the Law, which were signed, and (as your phrase is, not ours) sealed by circumcision, were the very same things that are promised in the word of the Gospel, and signed and (as you say) sealed in baptism, <hi>viz.</hi> the kingdome of heaven; and howbeit this is most manifestly false, for in reality, though you jumble them together into one when it seems to se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ve your turn so to do, in such a confused way as preaches to the world your present ignorance in both the Law and the Gospel, the Law and Gospel are two distinct Covenants, established on two distinct kinds of promises whereof the one was typical of, and so inferiour to the other, the one an <hi>old one,</hi> and a first that vanished before the <hi>second</hi> and <hi>new one, Gal.</hi> 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. 13-9. 1—12.18. and though all that was then promised in the Law, and signed in circumcision, as well as circumcision it self were types of things under the Gospel yet the things then promised upon keeping the Law, and immediately signed to <hi>Abraham</hi> and all his fleshly seed by <hi>Isaac</hi> (save <hi>Esau</hi> and his seed that sleighted it) in that covenant of circumcision, which God gave him, were no other then that literal <hi>Canaan,</hi> that earthly land of promise flowing with milk and honey, and not the heavenly inheritance, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.8. &amp;c. for they that were heirs of the other according to the Law, are not thereupon heirs of this also according to the Gospel <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.13.</p>
               <p>Now howbeit I say that be very false, yet you asserting it that the promise un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, and under the Gospel is the very same, do therein deny the one to be a covenant of <hi>better</hi> promises then the other: for to say the promise of the law is the very same that the promise of the Gospel is; is to say that the one is <hi>as good</hi> as the other, and so to contradict that of <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. which saies the Gospell Testament, and the promises thereof are <hi>better</hi> then the promises under the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:109011:87"/>And secondly if you say the <hi>Meliority</hi> that you hold to be in the Gospel co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant consists not in the <hi>Meliority</hi> of the promises of it above the other, but in the <hi>Meliority</hi> of the administration of it, the Gospel ordinances belonging not to the same only, but to more subjects, then the ordinances of the Law, in which respect we denying Gospel ordinances to infants, which were admitted to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances under the Law, and so cutting of a <hi>Moity</hi> of the Christian world from the Church, which stood members of it before do streiten the Gospel, and make it worse and of less extent the Law.</p>
               <p>I answer first, That the <hi>Meliority</hi> of the Gospel covenant spoken of in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. lies in the <hi>Meliority</hi> of the promises of it above the others, which <hi>Meliority</hi> we affirm but you deny, in saying the promises of both Covenants are one and the same, therefore it is your selves however, and not we that by your tenets make the Gospel Covenant at least no better than the Law, contrarily to that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. and so your opinions and not ours are false and wicked by your own Argument.</p>
               <p>Bvt secondly if it be in very deed to make the Gospell covenant worse than the Laws (as you say it is) to hold infants no capable subjects of Gospel ordinances, some of which were capable subjects of the ordinances of the law,</p>

               <p>Secondly prove that if notwithstanding all that I shall say toward the clearing of our selves, we must needs be held guilty of lessening the grace of God under the Gospel, in comparison of what it was under the law, because we deny the ordinances thereof to infants, to whom the ordinances of the law were dispensed, then you that judge us, condemn your selves also as being in the same kind guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the same, to this purpose lets see what you bring in proof of your <hi>Minor,</hi> in the last Syllogism; and how punctually it concludes to your present purpose, thus you argue.</p>

As for circumcision that it was not so, though I might adde much more to what hath been before spoken in proof hereof in my animadversion of your account, yet Ile save my self that labor, and refer you for fuller understanding, what circumcision was, and was not, to a certain book, that is extant of one Mr. <hi>Iackson,</hi> once of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denden</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> stiled 19. <hi>Arguments, proving circumcision to be no seal of the Covenant of grace,</hi> whereunto is annexed the unlawfulnesse of Infant bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism upon that ground, of which book I must needs give testimony thus far to the world, that it being brought to me, whilst it was but a manuscript, and my self a <hi>Presbyter</hi> of your high places, in some confidence that I could answer it, how easily I might have shufled it off, had I set my self so to do I will not say, but I could not answer it solidly, nor <hi>salva consciencia,</hi> and therefore I let it alone for a time, till considering further of it, and of other things I was stirrd up to the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of by it, I was at last converted to the truth, whereupon as the best answer I was capable to give, I signed it in such wise (as I find <hi>Luther</hi> once signed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther book in the like case) <hi>viz. memorandum</hi> that taking this book in hand at first to confute it, I was at last convinced by it.</p>
               <p>Which 19. proofs of circumcision to be no seal of the Covenant of Grace, if they be weak, and invalid, such a multitude as you are have time enough among you to disprove them, but if you yield to them, be silent and say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>As for baptism I confesse it to be truly and properly a <hi>sign,</hi> and that of the Covenant of Grace, remission of sins by Christ his death and resurrection, which are both not onely signified, but also lively represented, and resembled in the true dispensation of it to believers, yet that it is so much as a sign at all to infants in infancy, or when grown to years either (if dispensed in infancy) I absolutely deny, and affirm that the very nature, use and office of it (as a sign to its subject) is totally destroyed by such immature administration: for a sign (specially <hi>proprie dictum</hi>) that is properly, and not improperly so called in reference to that person, whose sign it is, is some outward thing appearing to the senses, through which some other thing, some inward thing is at the same time apprehended by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, This is the most true and proper difinition that your <hi>Divines</hi> give of a sign in general, but in special of these signes, <hi>viz.</hi> baptism, and the supper, so <hi>Pareus</hi> and <hi>Kekermaen</hi> both do define a sign out of <hi>Austin</hi>

               <p>When you have the same evidence of believers seed in infancy (that the Jewes had of theirs, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are heirs of the kingdom, then I will allow you to do as they did, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>sign and distinguish</hi> them as such: but of the one of these you have evidence in nonage, not so of the other: the kingdome that the Jews by <hi>very nature</hi> were heirs of according to the promise was that of the <hi>Earthly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> of which (and that as a type) they were apparent heirs by no other then very natural birth, and that so soon as ere they were born, and therfore full well within a while might they be signed.</p>
               <p>But that which you take upon you so timely to sign persons as heirs to in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, is the <hi>Antitype or heavenly Canaan,</hi> which no creature is an apparent heir to according to the Gospel promise, upon meer <hi>natural birth</hi> of any parents, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jew or Gentile, till he appear to us (unless he dy before he hath deserved exemption by actual transgression, and then <hi>Charity</hi> teaches us, to hope as well of all as of one) to be born by faith in Christ, which birth (if any infants were capable of it (as to us none are yet) because we cannot presume which have

it, and which not, the workings of the spirit being so unknown to us, that there can be no conclusion made, we cannot by dispensation give right distinction: but as in the type they sign'd them well nigh as soon as they were born with that natural birth of <hi>Abraham, Isaac and Iacob</hi> after the flesh, upon which alone they were heirs by promise of that <hi>earthly Canaan,</hi> so we sign them so soon as they appear to be born with that birth of Christ by faith, by which they are heirs of the true <hi>Canaan,</hi> and thats all the baptism of new born babes can possibly be found any where in the word, this birth if it could be in any infant at all, at least can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not appear to be in one living infant above another, for either they dy before actual transgression hath barr'd them, and then though our hopes are the same of them all, yet are they past signing by baptism, or else they live and are seen to believe, or not believe, and so as they do, or not do they must without distinction, or respect to naturall descent, be signed or not signed alike.</p>

               </p>
               <p>In all which if inquisition be made, how far forth your baptism and circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on do agree or differ, though you contend or rather pretend them to be like one another in each, yet we shall find a deep disparity between them in no lesse then all.</p>
               <p>First, if we ask (as <hi>de subjecto</hi>) this question <hi>quis</hi>? who is the true subject of <hi>circumcision,</hi> who of your <hi>baptism,</hi> yea even your own so <hi>circumcision-like</hi> baptism (much more that baptism which is rightly dispensed) how far is the one divers from the other? though this is one of the main things wherein you profess they must be alike, for that (as I shew'd before) did belong to males onely, this you dispense to females also; that to the natural infants of the Jews though the parents were known to be unbelievers (for <hi>Ioshua</hi> circumcised the seed of all those murmurers that were cut off for unbelief) this (as to no natural infants at all by right, no not to the Jews infants) so by your own confession, not to any infants whose parents are unbelievers, whereby you may see that as the law is changed, so there is a plain change also in the subjects of these two ordinances <hi>circumcision and baptism</hi> not onely as we, but as you your selves contend to have baptism dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed, for as onely so all the male children of the Jews both might and must be circumcised though their parents were never such wicked unbelievers, but even your selves say the Jews seed are all cut off from baptism and the Gospel Church, because their parents are unbelievers; both all the Jews and their males might be circumcised though none of them believed, while that Covenant of circumcision stood, meerly as they were of the stock of believing <hi>Abraham,</hi> but might not be baptized when the Gospel Covenant began in <hi>Iohns Baptism</hi> upon that account, unlesse they now believed in their own persons though they were of the stock of <hi>Abraham</hi> still as much as ever, nor may to this day in your own opinions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if (as to the nature, matter and essential form or being of the <hi>Rites</hi> themselves) we ask the question <hi>quid</hi>? what circumcision was, and what your baptism? how far do they differ? the one being a cutting off the foreskin of the flesh, the other a wetting of the foreskin of the face onely with a few drops of water, no more iike it then chalke's like cheese.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:109011:91"/>Thirdly if, as to the place where, we ask the question <hi>ubi</hi>? where circumcision was dispensed, and where your selves say baptism ought to be? how greatly doth your manner of baptism differ from it? and how much more then ours? for cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision might be dispensed any where but in the Temple, where I find not they were to be brought at all till circumcised, as <hi>Christ himself Luke</hi> 2.21, 22. but your <hi>Rantism</hi> no where else by appointment but in your <hi>Temples</hi>; herein I say our baptism squares more with it than yours, who pretend so much to baptize after the manner of it, for all places are to us alike, where there is conveniency of water enough to baptize in, and therefore we must except the Font and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if, as to the quality, special properties, uses, ends and offices of these two dispensations, the question be asked <hi>in quale quid</hi>? what were the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial properties, purposes, uses, ends, and offices of these two several administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? what things persons were specially obliged to by them? what was speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally signified to persons in them? and such like how little do these look each like the other? for circumcision tied men to the observation of a certain carnal, cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bersome, costly service, Law, Priest-hood, in order to their inheriting the <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Canaan,</hi> which all are now clean changed and confiscate, but baptism, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensed by us according to the word, binds to the observation of another <hi>Law,</hi> and the voice of another <hi>Lawgiver,</hi> High Priest, and Prophet <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> whom <hi>Moses</hi> spake of, and God hath now raised up accordingly, and this in order to a future enjoiment of a heavenly inheritance typed out by the other; and as for your rantism it ties to neither this nor that, but to a certain service, and law of Ordinances, and Gospel, and Church posture, and priesthood of mans own making, which one knows not well what to make of, nor what part of speech to call it but a <hi>participle,</hi> for it takes part of the Law and part of the Gospel, and is neither perfectly, but patcht up out of both by the politick power of the Priesthood, so as it may make most for the peoples painted p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Again, Circumcision pointed as a type indeed at the circumcision of the heart but as a sign so it signified a promise of outward felicity in <hi>Canaan,</hi> and that <hi>Christ</hi> should come of <hi>Abraham</hi> after the flesh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> true baptism signifies the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ, and remission of sins by his being crucified, and such things as were no wayes resembled by the other, <hi>your</hi> rantism just no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, if as to the time of those two services, the question be askt <hi>Quando</hi>? when circumcision, and when your baptism are by right to be dispensed? how miserably do you your selves misse of hitting right with it here too? though it be a main matter you intimate to us your imitation of circumcision in, circumcision being punctually to be performed on the eighth day, true baptism not till the day wherein persons appear to believe withall their heart, and so not in any infancy at all but the infancy of our faith, and even your rantism, though in infancy, as cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision was, yet on what day you please besides the 8th, sometimes after a fourt'night, or a moneth, and sometimes at the half year or years end.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, if, as to the administrator, it be ask <hi>quibus auxiliis</hi>? by whose hands these ordinances are to be administred? how different are they? circumcision being dispensed by the Master, Father, or mother, but as for baptism (as you dispense it at least) none but men in holy orders are to administer it, in which you go not only besides the Gospel which records <hi>Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing baptism, who were but gifted disciples, and neither of them in any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the ministery, save that <hi>Philip</hi> was in office as a <hi>Deacon</hi> to look to the poor, by vertue of which <hi>Deaconship</hi> if you <hi>Presbyters</hi> judge (as the Bishops did before you) that <hi>Philip</hi> baptized, and not rather by his <hi>Discipleship,</hi> I deem you will dote at last as much as they; but also besides the Law you live by.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:109011:92"/>Seventhly, if (as to the account and warrant) it be demanded <hi>Cur</hi>? why they circumcised infants, and why you baptize them? how far do you fall short of the Jewes in this also? for they had express precept, and institution to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise infants over and over again repeated in <hi>Moses</hi> Testament, besides the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident of <hi>Abrahams</hi> own family the self same day wherein the command was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to circumcise all the males at eight daies old, whereas if that which we call the New Testament, be indeed the Register of <hi>Christs</hi> will there is, as is confest by the most ingenuous of your coat, witness Mr. <hi>Hunton</hi> at a publike dispute at <hi>Warbleton</hi> in <hi>Sussex,</hi> neither one-plain precept, nor so much as one president of such a matter as baptizing infants: God never appointed such a thing, neither, to speak in that figure in which God speaks of himself <hi>Ier.</hi> 19.5. came it at all into his mind.</p>
               <p>So like are circumcision, your rule for baptism, and your baptism which you profess to act in by that rule of circumcision, that to say the truth your run out from your rule in every line you write after it, so that I much wonder that you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all men should argue baptism comes in the room of circumcision, so that they are both as one, and the one must be ordered after the example of the other, who in your baptism come no nearer circumcision then so. For verily they meet one another very little nearer then in that general denomination of a sign or <hi>token of a Covenant,</hi> in which the <hi>Rainbow</hi> may be said to be like them both. That two things should be one thing, for so with you your Rantism and circumcision are, and yet be adequate well-nigh in nothing is <hi>riddle me whats this</hi> with a witness.</p>
               <p>And by all this we may see how forcible your Argument is that is drawn from the <hi>Analogy</hi> of baptism with circumcision, which Argument your Dr. <hi>Featly</hi> saies <hi>may be truly called, in regard of the Anabaptists,</hi> Pons Asinorum, <hi>a bridge which these asses could never pass over, for to this day they could never, nor,</hi> quoth he, <hi>hereafter will be ever able to yield a reason, why the children of the faithful under the Gospel are not as capable of baptism, as they under the law of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision</hi> p. 40. but by your leave, through whom that Doctor being dead yet speaketh, the <hi>Dialogy</hi> and discrepation that is between, not only your <hi>Rantism,</hi> as is above mentioned, but also the <hi>true baptism</hi> and <hi>circumcision,</hi> is such a reason to the contrary, as all the <hi>Classes</hi> of <hi>Clergy</hi> men combind together in one <hi>Synodicall Convention,</hi> will never be able clearly to refute as long as they breath.</p>
               <p>As therefore to the Argument of <hi>yours</hi> which I am now in hand with, I come now directly to denie the consequence thereof, for it follows not in any wise that because circumcision was <hi>by</hi> Gods appointment dispensed to little infants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore baptism must be so now, and that not only for those manie reasons above spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, but even for this also, because God did appoint that circumcision should be dispensed to infants under the Law; but did never appoint anie such thing as that baptism should be dispensed to infants under the Gospel, nor is there the least tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in all the Testament of Christ tending to the manifestation of one crumb of commission for that matter.</p>

               <p>So you use to say still indeed of these Scriptures, that they speak of persons at age and not in non-age, and so say I too, but I wonder then where are the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that speak of infants baptism? if all the places of Scripture that speak of baptism at all, speak onely of the baptism of adult ones and so you are fain to confesse they do when we come to examine them one after another, yea I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that at two publique disputes, when we have put you to assign what Scripture infant baptism is commanded in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. hath bin nominated as your war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, out of which when it hath been plainly proved that Christ commands no more in that place to be baptized, then such whom he commands also first to be instructed, reply hath been made to this purpose <hi>viz.</hi> that Christ there requires that such as are capable of instruction should be instructed first, but that hinders not why infants may not be baptized before instruction) but if so I say I wonder still where that place is that warrants it that infants may be baptized at all, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ized for all that, so I say of these words, <hi>let a man examine himself, and so let him eat,</hi> they imply an unlawfulnesse in men and women only to eat the supper without self-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, but not in infants, who being not capable to examine themselves, may (any thing to the contrary there notwithstanding) be admitted to the supper with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it: tis men and women onely, and not children who upon non-examination of themselves are excepted.</p>
               <p>As you argue therefore that every administration to an Nation includes infants, as well as men, unlesse the be excepted, and therefore they must be baptized: I conclude the same from those premises, concerning their right to other ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>viz.</hi> therefore they must be preacht to, therefore they must eat the supper, two administrations given to all nations, from which infants are no more excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted then from baptism. As therefore you take it for an implicit exception of infants from the supper, in that they cannot perform what is required in that place to the receiving of it, i. e. not examine themselves, nor discern the Lords body, though by name they are not excepted, so (if you be not partial) your own consciences will compel you to take it for at least as implicit an excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of infants from baptism, in that they are no way capable to perform those things which are required of persons in order to their admission to baptism in other places <hi>viz.</hi> nor to believe with all the heart, nor to confesse sin, nor amend their lives, nor repent, nor call on the name of the Lord, all which were required of adult ones that come to baptism, as we see <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. <hi>Act.</hi> 22. and also in the <hi>Rubrick</hi> where it being askt what is required of persons to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized? answer is made thus, <hi>viz. repentance whereby they forsake sin: and faith whereby they stedfastly believe the promises of God made to them in that sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> though by name they be not excepted in any of these places.</p>
               <p>Your <hi>cui signatum ei signum nisi obstet</hi> &amp;c. your thredbare Argument <hi>viz.</hi> to whom the thing signified belongs to them the sign, unlesse there be some impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment or in capacity to perform what is required in order to the receiving of the sign, if it had one farthing worth of force in it to give infants accesse to baptism, would equally avail to give them accesse to the supper, if we were minded in good earnest to plead their right to both, in evidence of which I shall argue upon you with your own Argument, thus
<q>
                     <p>To whom the thing signified belongs, to them the sign also belongs, unlesse there be some exception or incapacity to perform what is required to the receiving of the sign.</p>
                     <p>But the thing signified in the supper which is the same thats signified in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism viz. Christ and his benefits belongs to infants, and theres no more excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them from it, then from baptism, nor more incapacity in them to perform that which is required to the supper, then there is in them to perform whats re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to baptism.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ergo</hi> if they may receive the outward sign of baptism, they may receive the outward sign of the supper also.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But in truth as they are no more capable of one of these signs then the other, so are they in very dead both uncapable of, and plainly enough alike excepted from both.</p>
               <p>Secondly, is it so <hi>Sirs,</hi> that infants being a great part (if not the Major part) of all nations must therefore be baptized, because its said baptize all Nations, unless they bad been excepted, then I answer again, if you mean thus, <hi>viz.</hi> unless they had been some way or other (at least vertually or implicitly excepted) then infants are most manifestly and clearly excepted in this very text it self, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. if there were no other in all the Scripture to exclude them: for first though that be Christs commission and direction to his disciples whom to baptize, yet theres no mention
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:109011:94"/>
at all of children, nor yet in <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15.16. where the same will of Christ is declared in other terms, concerning the baptism of such as are convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the faith by preaching, and this D <hi>Featley</hi> himself more then confesses, for he urges it with earnestness p. 62. in these words, <hi>viz. there is no mention of children in either of these texts,</hi> and if so that theres no mention at all then they are not implied, as both Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> and himself (to the contradiction of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self) affirms they are in the word <hi>Nations,</hi> for for children to be both implied, and included in that word <hi>Nations,</hi> and yet neither to be mentioned, nor meant therein at all, are inconsistent, and such a bo-peep as is impossible, and if they be not so much as implied, and mentioned in the commission they must needs be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood to be excepted and excluded.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as there is no mention of children, so there is such a plain limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and restriction of baptism to such persons, as infants in infancy are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be <hi>viz.</hi> Disciples of Christ, <hi>aliàs</hi> persons so taught and instructed by the ministration of men, as to believe the Gospel, that they are more then purblind, who discern not infants (for they are uncapable to learn by the teachings of men) to be in that place excepted: for it is said go ye and teach all nations <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The order of words, by which teaching is here set before baptizing proves nothing, for in Mark <hi>1.4.</hi> that order is inverted, and baptizing set before preaching, thus, viz. Iohn did baptize, and preach the baptism of repentance.</p>

               <p>So saies Dr. <hi>Holmes</hi> indeed p. 7. and tis also a common saying among you all but I tell yod if you were not minded more to pervert, then to preach the Gospel, you could not be ignorant, that that inversion <hi>Mark</hi> 1.4. is such, as altars not the sense so, but that tis in sense, and signification the very same as we contend for out of <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>viz.</hi> that preaching is to go before baptizing, for though it be said there <hi>Iohn did baptize and preach the baptism of repentance,</hi> it must necessarily be understood thus, <hi>viz.</hi> that he preached baptism to persons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he practised it to them; for you cannot be so silly sure as to imagin that <hi>Iohn</hi> first baptized persons when they came to him, before he opened his Mouth to tell them wherefore; yet I know one that being in a streit, did not stick to strein him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self out by such a simple saying as that, but for all that, if that honest man who said thus (I forbear to name him least I shame him) were as true a Minister of the Gospel, as he supposes himself to be, and should go forth with his Gospel to a Nation as ignorant of the truth of baptisme as himself, and offer but such a small matter as his rantism, much more so worthy, so weighty and burdensome a business to the flesh as the true baptism is, <hi>viz.</hi> to overwhelm them in water, without declaring to them first for what end, and purpose, either he would shew himself an Egregious and Arrant <hi>simpleton</hi> in once conceiving they would, or
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:109011:95"/>
they themselves but senseless <hi>Animals,</hi> if they should so suddenly submit to him.</p>
               <p>Moreover its apparent to any, but such as are resolved to shift off truth as long as they can, that the same passage of <hi>Mark</hi> 1.4. as tis recorded Mat. 3.1.5. <hi>Luke</hi> 3.3.7. shewes that <hi>Iohn</hi> first came preaching the baptism of repentance for remission of sins, and then and thereupon people came out to him and were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized of him in <hi>Iordan</hi> confessing their sins.</p>
               <p>Out of that place therefore <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. which is so usually assigned by your selves, as the main Scripture, in which Christ commands infant baptism, though upon examination it is oft asserted to be a place that neither mentions at all, nor once meddles with infants, and that by the self same persons that so as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign it, I argue thus in disproof of them who assign it, as Christ precept for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants baptisme, and in proof that its a plain prohibition of such a thing, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>If Christ there commissionates and commands his Disciples to baptize none but the very same persons whom he commands them also first to teach, and make disciples by teaching, then that place is a plain prohibition, and not at all a precept to baptize infants; for men cannot teach or disciple in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</p>

               <p>As if the precept for baptizing did extend it self to all persons in every nation without any limitation, or restriction, or any praevious preparation to it save one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly barely being of the nations, <hi>Nec mediante doctrinà, nec disciplinâ</hi>: but is it so <hi>Sirs,</hi> then let me ask you, are not the infants of Turks, Pagans, Tartars, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, Jews, unbelievers a part, yea a far greater part, and do they not serve much more to make up the number in nations, then the Infants of believers? why then (if that be the ground you will needs go upon) must not these be baptized as well as the other? yea surely if this be a good argument to prove any ones right to baptism from this place, because he is of the nations, then stark natural fools, as well as infants, yea very profest profane ones, open enemies against the name of Christ, as Turks and Pagans, being a great part of all Nations, have as good right to baptism as any of those you rantize, or we our selves baptize either, for shame therefore forgo such rude kind of ratiocination.</p>
               <p>This therefore that all Nations are bid to be baptized, cannot make <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. to be a precept for baptizing infants, though they be of the Nations, unlesse they were capable to be taught, which because they are not, that place com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding no more to be baptized, then the same whom it commands also to be taught, and that not onely before but immediatly after baptism, is a plain prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of infant-baptism.</p>

                  <hi>Ergo the children of the faithfull are to be baptized.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The former proposition is clearly exprest in the text (saith he) make disciples and baptize them, therefore all disciples are to be baptized,</hi> but had he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded according to mood and figure, or the tenor of this text, or had he not been both blinded, and minded to go besides the sense of the spirit in this place, he would have said therefore all that are first made disciples by instruction are to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and then he had mard all his proceedings concerning infants.</p>
               <p>As for the second proposition which is the assertion of you all <hi>viz.</hi> That infants are disciples, <hi>Mr. Cotton</hi> toward the proof of it so miserably misapplies 2. pieces of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> that he rather proves himself thereby to be yet but an infant in discipleship, and Gospel understanding then proves infants to be disciples from thence.</p>
               <p>The first place is <hi>Isa.</hi> 54.13. whereby its said, by way of promise to the Church of the <hi>New Ierusa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Disciples are taught or learned of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His second place is <hi>Isay.</hi> 65.20. where its said <hi>there shall be no more thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth an infant of daies &amp;c.</hi> in which place, what ere the meaning is, it matters not a rush as to his purpose, so long as its spoken of a time that is yet to come. Now here is such a messe of mistakes as may well make a wise man amaz'd, and and make him muse whether the pen-man of this proof of that <hi>Minor,</hi> that infants are disciples, and consequently to be baptized according to <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. were well awake, or asleep when he set it down, concerning it Ile propound four things to be well examined of you all,</p>
               <p>First whether he be not egregiously mistaken in the persons to whom those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises are made, which if they be all infants of the faithful, considered as in their minority, then is there a mighty mist before my eyes, for really by the best improvement I can make of my understanding, I can possibly ken no such matter, nor that it is any other then the Saints, and faithful ones themselves; even all of them, and not any of their children after the flesh, but as they prove faithfull, and do become Saints in their own persons as well as their parents.</p>
               <p>Secondly whether he be not grossely mistaken about the time wherein these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises are to be fulfilled, in fuller evidence of both which consider, first as to the first Scripture, who ever they are that are there expressed by the term [<hi>thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>] they are all and every of them without exception partakers of the Lords teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of all the other priviledges there promised, for its said, <hi>All thy children shall be taught of the Lord &amp;c.</hi> at that time therefore wherein this shall be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled this promise shall be performed to every individual of those kind of persons, to whom its made, not one excepted, which shews that it is meant onely of the Saints, for they are the Churches children, and not their natural seed, and of that time onely when the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> which is not yet, shall come down from God out of heaven, for so shall it then be with all the faithful that shall inhabit that City of the Lord, whose people are said also to be all righteous, <hi>Is.</hi> 60.21. but this is not performed to all the children of the faithfull now, neither are they all taught of God, with that effectual teaching there promised, as is evident, in that many of them in time prove reprobates, when wicked mens children prove e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:109011:96"/>Secondly, It is expresly shewed in the 17 v. who are the persons whose porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and heritage these priviledges are, for this (saith he) is the heritage of the servants of the Lord.</p>
               <p>As for the second place, so far is it from speaking of infants in infancy, that it rather shewes that there shall be no infant of daies, <hi>i. e.</hi> that shall dy an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, nor old man that hath not filled his daies in that time, but the very child shall dy an hundred years old, i. e. he shall be counted as dying young, or a child that lives but an hundred years, so long lived shall they be in those daies, yea <hi>as the daies of a tree shall be the daies of my people</hi> (saith God) <hi>and mine elect shall long enjoy the works of their hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as to the time when these things shall be, tis not now, but in the reign of Christ, when the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> shall be built with <hi>Saphirs,</hi> and all precious stones, and when the Lord shall make the <hi>New Heavens</hi> and the <hi>New Earth,</hi> which is not yet in being, but is looked for of all the Saints at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ, and the redemption of Israel (as <hi>Peter saith</hi>) according to his promise, which appears plainly by comparing <hi>Isa.</hi> 65. 17—66.22 with 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13, 14. and also by the last text of the two, which Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> abuses, <hi>viz. Isa.</hi> 65. v. 20 which saith this shall be from <hi>thenceforth, i. e.</hi> from the time of Gods creating that new heavens and new earth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Whether he doth not most palpably depart from the matter he took first in hand to prove unto another thing, which is no more to his purpose, then if he had said <hi>bo</hi> to a goose; yea he runs clear away from the Scripture he began upon and never returns to it more, as if he were affraid to come near it, scarce ere so much as facing about, or looking behind him: for what he ought to have clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (but surely he thought he could not, and therefore was not minded to meddle with it) was this, <hi>viz.</hi> that in order to being the subjects of the baptism there injoined infants are disciples, in such a sense as is there spoken of <hi>viz.</hi> made so by the Ministery of the word, and teaching; for saith <hi>Christ</hi> go teach all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons baptizing them, but his is not to the same, not <hi>ad idem,</hi> but <hi>ad aliud quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> a certain other thing, which if he did prove (as he doth not) it could in no wise prove what he brings it in proof of, <hi>viz.</hi> that infants of the faithful, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of some uncouth, unheard of, strange, secret sort of teaching and learning, which these infants have from God, above any other, may be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said to be disciples, and thereupon to be baptized.</p>
               <p>And this though it be not spoken so broadly by any as by Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> who makes it his business so far as to wrest and pervert certain Scriptures into the proof of it, insomuch that some of his fellow fighters for infant-baptism are ashamed on't and disclaim it, (witness Mr. <hi>Bayly</hi> p. 145. where, speaking of infants being disciples, <hi>I speak not</hi> (saith he) <hi>of that which divers maintain,</hi> viz. <hi>the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that in Esay to infants, they shall be all taught of God</hi>) yet is it more ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly hinted to be the opinion of most of you, whereupon you attribute both dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipleship, and baptism to infants, as if that were the main thing meant in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. where Christ means no such matter as the inward secret and unknown teachings of God, but the teachings or making disciples to him by the Ministery of men.</p>
               <p>Thus saies Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> in his <hi>Answer</hi> to the vanity of childish baptism, p. 33. <hi>Infants of believing parents are made disciples of God and Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> in his reply to Mr. <hi>Tombes,</hi> p. 216. <hi>though they be not capable of receiving instruction from men, yet they are capable of Gods own teaching even in their infancy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So Dr. <hi>Holmes</hi> p. 8. <hi>God can preach to the heart and so to children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> page 23. <hi>If they can learn nothing of the parents, yet Christ hath other waies of teaching then by men, even by the immediate workings of his spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:109011:97"/>So you <hi>Ashford Disputants,</hi> p. 8. &amp; 18. <hi>infants have an hearing the spirit o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens their ears,</hi> quo magistro, quam cito discitur, quod docet?</p>
               <p>But <hi>Sirs</hi> first is there any Scripture that teaches you this twattle, unless you mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use to that end those Scriptures Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> doth, that God teaches <hi>believers</hi> infants thus?</p>
               <p>Secondly, doth it appear to you, that any one of the infants, that you sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle in particular, is taught or hath learned any thing of God before you sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle it?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, is it any more evident to you that all believers infants are taught of God, then tis that unbelievers infants are taught by him? have ye not instance, that unbelievers children, not in infancy, but so soon as ever they are capable to learn any thing are often taught of God, and as oft believers children are not? as <hi>Iosia</hi> at eight years was taught of God, and became a precious Saint, though the child of wicked <hi>Ammon,</hi> when all the children of this good <hi>Iosia</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, were left untaught by him, I mean unconverted under all his teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if it were as sure (<hi>as</hi> the contrary is sure, for who sees any effects of Gods teaching them from the womb, when as we see not that they know a jot more then other children, till God teaches them by the instruction of men?) were it sure I say that these infants are taught of God in infancy, yet what is this to prove infants to be the persons commanded to be baptized in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. for there Christ doth not bid them go, and make disciples to him by Gods inward teachings, for that was more then they could perform, but he bids them go, and disciple the Nations, and instruct them, and baptize them, i. e. those that by their teaching are made disciples: nor is there one crumb of commission there for their baptizing of any other: and in this sense taking the word [disciples] his Minor is most false.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, Let it be examined, whether the words of Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> do not clearly contradict sundry of your expressions about the meaning of that word [<hi>Disciple</hi>] about which several of you not a little also contradict your selves, about which therefore either he, or you must be mistaken: for he confesses the true meaning of the word [<hi>Disciple</hi>] is <hi>taught,</hi> or <hi>learned,</hi> and Disciples are such as are taught and have learned: but several of you say that <hi>Discipling</hi> is not <hi>teaching,</hi> and <hi>breeding Schollars,</hi> or making them learned, nor to be discipled, to be taught, or learned, but that <hi>baptizing</hi> may well be rendered a <hi>discipling,</hi> and to make disciples<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or disciple persons, is to admit <hi>Schollars,</hi> and to admit to be taught.</p>
               <p>So Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> saies he learns from certain <hi>Criticks,</hi> better then Mr. <hi>Tombes,</hi> in his reply to Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> p. 212.213.</p>
               <p>So Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> p. 33. <hi>To make children disciples</hi> (saith he) <hi>is to give them up unto God,</hi> i. e. <hi>in baptism, promising to bring them up in the knowledge of God, so soon as they shall be capable of outward teaching, so that they are</hi> ipso fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto <hi>disciples in respect of that promise, and of Gods obligation to teach them,</hi> and such like stuff.</p>
               <p>So Mr. <hi>Bayly</hi> p. 254. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>is not to teach, but make disciples, i. e. to bring to them to the School of God, the visible Church, to dedicate them to Gods discipline to give their names up to be Gods subjects and Schollers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So Dr. <hi>Featley</hi> p. 39. <hi>Though children in their nonage cannot be taught, yet they may be made Christs disciples, by being admitted into his school, their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents giving their names to Christ, both for themselves and their fami<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>So Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> p. 22, 23. <hi>they say,</hi> saith he, <hi>they cannot learn, but they may enjoy the priviledges of the family, and School, and be under his charge and dominion, and that is enough to make them capable of being disciples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:109011:97"/>As if so be when Christ commissionated his disciples to disciple Nations, he meant not that they should teach them, but in a sense abstract from their own teachings, he means thus, go and admit Scholars to be taught, baptize persons, and thereby give them up to me, consecrate them to me, put them out to School to me, so that though they cannot learn, yet they may partake of my protection and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and such like confused foppery as this, which to assert is unsound, shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully non-sensical, and unbeseeming the judgements of any men, but such as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote themselves (unawares) to the delusion of themselves and others.</p>

Then they that gladly received his word were baptized, and the same day there were added</hi> (meaning to those 120. that continued in supplication <hi>Act.</hi> 1.14.) <hi>about</hi> 3000 <hi>soules,</hi> those termes [<hi>they that gladly received the word</hi>] must needs be exclusive of all others that did not gladly receive the word, &amp; consequently of infants that could not, or else we are clearly cousen'd by that story; for if I undertake to relate truly by way of <hi>Chronicle,</hi> who and how many were executed at such an <hi>Assize,</hi> or slain in such a battel on such a day (as <hi>Luke</hi> doth in <hi>Act.</hi> 2. to shew who and how many were baptized on that day) and expresse it in such terms as do include the third part of them only (for the several housholds to which those 3000 souls did belong, would surely have amounted to thrice as many more, had all those whole housholds been baptized with them) I should be reputed as no better then an <hi>Impostor</hi>: but the case is not the same in <hi>Act.</hi> 15.10. for the end and intent of <hi>Luke</hi> the historian, and <hi>Peter</hi> the spokesman in that place was not to relate how many they would have yoaked with circumcision, but the drift of <hi>Peter</hi> was onely to reprove the false teachers, and of <hi>Luke</hi> onely to declare how <hi>Peter</hi> did reprove them for offering so to subjugate, and subvert the brethren, for so they are called ver. 1. even the very same persons which are called disciples ver. 10. which shews also that by the word [<hi>disciples</hi>] he means not infants, for they were persons capable to be taught, yet this is the strongest hold you have whereby you argue infants to be disciples, and taking it by force from thence, that infants are disciples, you run headlong with it to <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. where Christ saies, go teach, or by teaching disciple the Nations, baptizing them, and from thence rest an argument for their baptism, but I am ashamed that I must take occasion (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Ile betray the truth) to reprove the rudenesse of such renowned men, and conclude (all their conceits to the contrary notwithstanding) that <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. is no <hi>commission</hi> nor <hi>command</hi> for infant baptism. It follows not therefore from the wonted circumcising of infants, from which you <hi>Ashford</hi> Disputants dispute it, that therefore they are to be baptized, for this reason <hi>viz.</hi> because there was a command for the circumcising of infants, but (as I have shewd above) none at all (no not from <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.29. nor <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.15. much lesse from any other piece of <hi>Christs</hi> will and Testament) that they are to be baptized now. But Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> fetches it about another way yet, and because Christs own Testament is somewhat barren of provision by way of precept for infants baptism, he runs back to <hi>Moses</hi> Testament, and fetches what help he can from thence, and undertakes to prove the command for the circumcising of infants, to be a consequential and vertual command and commission for the baptizing of them now, p, 35.36.37. <hi>of his sermon.</hi>

               <p>You say right: for howbeit indeed under the Covenant of Circumcision, all the Males whether children or Servants born in the house or brought with money; and they only (not any females were admitted to that administration, yet it is most evident that (as to baptism) it matters not whether persons be male or fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, for they are all one in Christs account, according as they believe in him, one sex having no more right thereto then the other, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26.27.28. But if you betake your selves to the New Testament only as your rule for baptism, though you find warrant there for men and women, yet you find none at all there for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to be baptized: yea that is as much warrant to us in our varying from the manner of circumcision in the point of infants, by omission of it unto them, as 'tis for you to vary from circumcision in the point of females by admission of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to baptism, for as you are fain to plead for all your strong hold of circumcisions being instituted, and of old dispensed to infants, no less then New Testament in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, and instance for the admission of females, so if we insist upon onely the New Testament institution, and example we can as truly say there is neither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept nor president for baptizing infants, as you can say there is both for baptizing females, and with as much confidence as you can say tis evident there, that both men and women were baptized, may I say it is evident that infants were not, at least it is not evident that they were, and that is enough to serve our turn in this case, wherein it lies upon you, who practise infants baptism, to produce some proof or other that twas practised in the primitive times, and some precept direct, or consequential, from the law of Christ, and not to content your selves, and cousin the world with such a poor pretence, as to say that the command for the circumcision of infants is a consequential and virtual command to us to baptize them, which as bindings as you say it is to us in this case, when it comes to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; you see it binds us as little to the same subject, as to the same circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of time.</p>
               <p>You ly groaping for a warrant for your way in the Old Testament, and Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and being not a little aware that you have not warrant enough in the new, you look after that <hi>Law-Giver,</hi> that is long since out of Date to the church, for the doing of which you need no other to accuse you then he, even <hi>Moses,</hi> in whom you trust, who instead of inviting you to learn of himself under the times, and promulgation of the Gospel, how Gospel ordinances should be administred; rather conjures the very <hi>Iews</hi> themselves, that were as we never were, his own disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, whilest his Testament stood <hi>Iohn</hi> 9.28. and that with a curse, from any longer attendance unto his voice, to attendance unto the voice of another <hi>Prophet Christ Iesus,</hi> when God should raise him up unto them, you forget <hi>Sirs</hi> that we are now under the new Testament, and the teachings and Law of another <hi>Law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> another <hi>Apostle,</hi> and <hi>High Priest</hi> of our profession, who was faithfull to him that appointed him as a son over his own house, i. e. the Gospel Church, as <hi>Moses</hi> though a Servant, was faithful to him that appointed him in all his house, the fleshly <hi>Israel:</hi> so faithful was <hi>Moses</hi> as to make all things plain in his Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

so that his Disciples during the time of that Covenant, whereof he was mediator, might easily see, if they were careful to look into his Law, the mind of God concerning them in every administration of that Testament, so that they need not look any where else but to his Law, yea in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.19. <hi>Moses spake every precept to all the people according to the Law,</hi> and shall we think that this man, who is <hi>worthy of more glory then Moses,</hi> and <hi>who is</hi> now as <hi>a son over his own house,</hi> hath not been so faithfull, as to make sufficient provision of plain precepts, Lawes, and ordinances so as to speak distinctly, and to give out his will and Testament clearly, so that his disciples may know it, without running back to learn of his servant <hi>Moses</hi>? doth not God himself say of this Prophet by the mouth of <hi>Moses</hi> himself, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.18. <hi>I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him, him shall they hear in all things, whatsoever he shall say, and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall not hearken to my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him, and he shall be destroyed from among the people, Act.</hi> 3.22. 23.</p>

               <p>First, what is not commanded of God is but tradition of man, for which men shall have no thank for their labour <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.9.</p>
               <p>Secondly, neither are we altogether without such positive prohibition, as may be sufficient to satisfie you at least, who hold the command for circumcision of infants to be a command for the baptizing of them: in order to your understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which, I shall refer you to <hi>Act.</hi> 21.21. where its said of <hi>Paul,</hi> that he <hi>taught all the Iews, which were among the Gentiles, to forsake Moses, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they ought not to circumcise their children, nor to walk after the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes.</hi> In which Scripture I beseech you in the fear of God to observe how tis rehearsed that three things were most expressely forbdiden, as unlawful for the <hi>Iews</hi> themselves, much more to any believing Gentiles under the dayes of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, by <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching.</p>
               <p>First, they were forbidden (in general) <hi>to follow Moses,</hi> i. e. to live after his law and testament any longer, they are charg'd <hi>to forsake Moses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly (in particular) they were forbidden <hi>to circumcise their children,</hi> that being indeed a business the Jews still so doted on, that of all things they were unwilling to let it go, which by the way, shews us plainly, that there was nothing injoyned to be done to infants in the room of it, as some (but simply) conceive baptism was by <hi>Peter Act.</hi> 2. in order to their comfort, under the losse of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for if there had, then surely it would have been specified, and <hi>Paul</hi> would have preached thus to the Jews, the more easily to weane them from that antient custome of circumcising their children (specially considering how loath they were to part with it) <hi>viz.</hi> you ought not to <hi>circumcise</hi> your children now, but instead thereof to <hi>baptize</hi> them, and this may well serve in liew of, and satisfie you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der losse of the other, as being not so painful a service, but an easier sign, and that of better things then those promised in the Covenant of circumcision: but he saies no such matter, if he had there would have been doubtlesse less ado, then it should seem there was, to bring the <hi>Iews</hi> off from that practise of circumcising their infants, of which even after they believed they were so zealous, as not to hear of the abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of it without offence, for this would surely easily have contented and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them, if they might have had their children baptized, as of old they were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised, but this doubtlesse made them so difficult to be perswaded to a forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of circumcising there infants, because they saw the gospel had no answerable dispensation belonging to their infants in the place of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in general again, they were forbidden to walk so much as after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:109011:102"/>
of <hi>Moses,</hi> for the word here rendred customs is [<gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Whether therefore we shall believe him or you in this case judge ye.</p>
               <p>This, as it is of weight in it self, so it must needs be an argument <hi>ad hominem</hi> however, of force enough to stop the mouthes of all such as though they yield the law it self and circumcision to be ceased, yet will needs in point of Priesthood, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Churches, Tythes, Temples, outward administration, infants admission have all things at least after such a manner as the Jews had, and specially to Mr <hi>Marshall</hi> and Dr. <hi>Holms,</hi> and all such as assert, that the very command that was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to circumcise infants of old, is vertually the command to us to baptize them: for thus saies not onely Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> but Dr <hi>Holmes</hi> also out of <hi>Ainsworth,</hi> p. 9. and 7. of <hi>his animadversions,</hi> fetching his argument for infant baptism as far as from the first book of <hi>Moses</hi> called <hi>Genesis</hi> thus.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> of which argument hath no lesse then three false assertions in it. For First, circumcision was not a sign of the Covenant of Grace (as baptism now is) nor did any further relate to the Covenant of Grace, then all other things under the law did <hi>viz.</hi> as types and shadows of the things to come; but that Covenant of which circumcision was given to be immediately a sign and token, was of that earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Canaan,</hi> made with <hi>Abrahams</hi> fleshly seed onely: nor Secondly, were they believers infants only, who were there commanded to be circumcised, but all the male infants and male servants also of every houshold of <hi>Abrahams</hi> posterity by <hi>Isaac</hi> onely, through their several generations, though the parents and masters were unbelievers, as the <hi>Iews</hi> were (for the most part of them) in all ages, and both they and theirs neverthelesse to be circumcised, while that Covenant of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision lasted.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whereas he saies that circumcision of infants (for thats it he falsely
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:109011:103"/>
signs there with that name, <hi>viz.</hi> the sign of the Covenant of Grace) was never yet remanded, or contramanded, it is as false as all the rest for we see plainly that it was remanded by that text I am yet in hand with, <hi>viz. Act.</hi> 21.22.</p>

               <p>Sith then Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> and Dr <hi>Holmes</hi> both say (and so indeed you say all in effect) that the command for circumcision of infants was a command to us to baptize them, and therefore (unless we can shew that command to be remanded again) it is still in force to bind us to baptize them, I dare be bold to tell them that if infant circumcision, and infant baptism were both commanded together in that one and the same precept <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10. where <hi>God</hi> bidds <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his seed to circumcise their children, then they are both uncommanded again in that one and the same prohibition, wherein God by the mouth of <hi>Paul</hi> forbad the <hi>Iews</hi> to circumcise their children any longer: I say if infants baptism were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in that very command for the circumcision of infants, then by <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> for <hi>contrarior<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>m contraria est ratio,</hi> infants baptism must needs be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> in the <hi>remanding</hi> of infants circumcision, the remanding of which by <hi>Paul,</hi> among all the <hi>Iewes</hi> that dwelt among the Gentiles, where he mainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised his Ministrie, is related plainly <hi>Acts</hi> 21.21.</p>
               <p>To conclude then though I utterly deny, as being well assured that nor Dr. <hi>Holmes</hi> nor Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> neither have yet, nor ever will make it good, that the precept for circumcision, is so much as a virtual or consequential command to baptize infants, yet, if it be, <hi>I hope they will receive the same Law they give,</hi> and rest satisfyed in it, that this <hi>Countermand</hi> to circumcise infants, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequential and virtual countermand also to baptize them.</p>
               <p>By all which it appears still that there is not only no <hi>precept,</hi> but also plain <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition</hi> enough of infant baptism.</p>
               <p>And as there is no <hi>precept,</hi> so neither is there any <hi>president</hi> of baptizing infants, as there was of circumcising them of old, from which practise of circumcision therefore there is no consequence to infant-baptism: there is not one <hi>example</hi> to be found any where upon the file of such a thing, as infant baptism, unless it be in your <hi>Parish Registers,</hi> and there indeed you may shew us, not only three or four hundred (as vpon occasion of our calling for example, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <p>You shall find, <hi>saies Mr.</hi> Marshall, the Gospell took place just as the old ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration, by bringing in whole families together, usually if the Master of the house turned Christian, his whole family came in, and were baptized with him.</p>

               <p>Then first me thinks the wife and other females should not be actually bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with him but rather virtually, be baptized in the husband; for you say just so it was in the administration of circumcision.</p>

               <p>I muse much why the houshold of <hi>Caesar</hi> is not named as well as all the rest, but then Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> had clearly contradicted his own assertion, <hi>viz.</hi> that whole families were taken in all at once: for there were many famous disciples and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians that imbraced the Gospel in <hi>Caesars</hi> houshold, though <hi>Caesar</hi> was no Saint nor Christian himself.</p>

               <p>Nor is it said <hi>the houshold of</hi> Aristobulous, <hi>and Narcissus,</hi> but them of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stobulus,</hi> and <hi>Narcissus's</hi> houshold, which shewes that though with him these two masters were disciples themselves, yet but some of their housholds were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples with them, yet he alledges these as examples of infants baptism, when in the Scriptures nomination of them there is no nomination of infants, or baptism either.</p>
               <p>As for all the rest if they are not to be contemned, yet are they not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided in, unless there were much more then is expressed, at least implied to such a purpose, as exemplary proof for infants baptism: for if those whole housholds were all, and every one in them baptized, yet possibly no infant, for all that: for at this hour I know some whole housholds of baptized believers, that have not so much as an infant within them: yea one where there is or lately was both parent, children or grand children all baptized, and yet no infant nor infant baptism a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them neither: and indeed howbeit the word [<hi>whole houshold</hi>] is no where named in the new Testament in relation to this case, yet I do believe that whole housholds might sometimes be baptized then as well as now they are, from whence yet it will not follow that infants were baptized, yea <hi>whole thousands</hi> were baptized sometimes in one day, and yet no infants among them; and that all these housholds you so often instance in, either had no infants in them, or if they had yet none baptized however, is evident enough to those that are not blind, if all the particular instances be examined.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Iaylor,</hi> the Apostles, who never used to preach to infants, <hi>spake to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:109011:104"/>
him the word of God, and to all that were in his house,</hi> the effect of whose preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was not onely his rejoicing and belief, but the belief of all his house also, as well as the baptism of all his house together with him, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.32.33.34.</p>
               <p>And as for <hi>Crispus,</hi> whose houshold is not reported to be baptized (though no doubt they were so) its said that <hi>all his houshold believed in the Lord as well as he,</hi> Acts 18.8. and as for such as were baptized with <hi>Cornelius,</hi> which were more then they of his own houshold, that none of them were infants, tis evident, forasmuch as they were all both ready and capable to hear, and the holy spirit fell on them all in hearing the word, so that it was evident to <hi>Peter,</hi> and as many as came with him, that they imbraced the glad tidings of the Gospel; upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of whose gladly receiving the word onely, and that apparently; <hi>Peter</hi> saies <hi>who can forbid water why these may not be baptized &amp;c? and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord,</hi> Act. 10.44. <hi>to</hi> 48.</p>
               <p>And as for <hi>Stephanus</hi>'s houshold, as they are said 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.16. to have been baptized, so are they all said to have <hi>addicted themselves to minister to the Saints</hi> which are actions exclusive of Infants 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.15. besides, if housholds must needs be taken as comprising infants, then that phrase <hi>salute the houshold of Onesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.19. must be taken so to, and what absurdity were it, to tell <hi>Cradle-bed-Infants,</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> the prisoner remembred his respects unto them: as for that of <hi>Lydia,</hi> as its likely enough she then had none, so no man knowes whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever she had any husband at all, if she had she might have no children, if she had children she might be an antient widow, whose children were grown up to believe with her, and besides that those of her houshold, whether children or ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants or both, that were baptized with her, were not infants but adult disciples is evident, both by that compellation <hi>viz. the brethren</hi> (a denomination never gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them) and mostly because they were such as the Apostles did actually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort (as we never find they did any infants in their infancy) <hi>Act.</hi> 16.14.40. By all which by that time you have laid it to heart, so little ground will be left you from all these instances for the baptizing of infants, that it may without crouding, be well written within the inside of a <hi>cherry-stone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now whereas Mr. <hi>Marshal,</hi> more downrightly then rightly, denies that children did eat the passeover, which most undoubtedly they did.

               <p>Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> himself gives you good reason for that p. <hi>40.</hi> of his Sermon, the Argument (saith he) from the term houshold, is not so strong to prove that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants did eat the passeover, as it is to prove they may be baptized, because no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scripture shews that the passeover doth belong to children, but we have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther plain Scripture proving that baptism belongs to infants, as well as grown men.</p>

            <div type="section">

               <p>I remember indeed that <hi>Mr. Marshall</hi> speaks thus: yea more (and more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdly then thus) doth he speak p. 219. in his reply to Mr. <hi>Tombos viz.</hi> that <hi>we shall never find so good evidence out of the housholds eating the passeover, Exod.</hi> 12. <hi>thereby to prove that women did eat the passeover as this proves that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of the house were baptized</hi>: but I must tell him first, that what influence other Sciptures give toward the proof of either one or the other makes these never the stronger simply, and in themselves, so but that their particular strength and weaknesse stands the same, but Secondly, how dares Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> say theres no other Scipture save that, is not that one particular sentence wherein the word hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold is exprest as eating the paschal lamb enough? specially when the next verse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:109011:105"/>
the latter part of the same verse <hi>viz.

And whereas, for the exemption of women (not as holding these did not eat it, but to secure himself the more from that deadly wound, which he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware will light upon him if he grant that children did eat the passeover <hi>viz.</hi> our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing upon him from thence to their right to the supper, acccording to his own ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing from infants circumcision to their baptism) he brings this reason <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>according to us they were not circumcised, and no uncircumcised person might eat the passeover,</hi> I have to or three things to say to it.</p>
               <p>First, that phrase, no uncircumcised person shall eat it, must either necessarily be understood concerning those uncircumcised ones onely, who were both capable of circumcision, and of whom circumcision was required, or else</p>
               <p>Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </gap>t must be understood that the females were accounted as vertually circumcised in the males.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that very phrase that excludes all, and onely such uncircumcised ones from the passeover as were capable of circumcision, and of whom it was required, serves us against you thus far however as to include and enright all them to the passeover that were circumcised, and so if women did not (as none need doubt but that they did) yet all circumcised males, and cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>quently <hi>male children,</hi> as soon at least as they were capable to eat, were under a right to eat the passeover, and so as to prove you who deny them the supper, to be ingaged in the guilt of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minishing Gods grace, and robbing poor infants of their right, as well as we, if your own arguments be true, <hi>viz.</hi> that to deny such dispensations to infants un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospel, the answerable ones to which were dispensed to them under the law, is to lessen the grace of God in the Gospel Covenant, and make it straiter then it was under the Law, and to bereave little children of what belongs to them.</p>
               <p>Thus Mr. <hi>Marshal,</hi> where by the word housholds he should understand chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as well as others, for his own ends he leaves them out; but where by the word housholds such families are exprest, as in which he knows not that there was one infant, and may know (if there were) by the very places themselves, that they were excluded, yet there he winds things about to wind them in.</p>
               <p>By all this you see how little consequence is in the Argument, <hi>children were circumcised.</hi>

               <p>As I replied then, so I reply still, that for ought I know the children of Turks and Pagans (dying in infancy) may be all saved, yet will it not follow (so much as probably) that therefore in reallity, or in my opinion either, the <hi>Devils</hi> may be saved also, which rude return is recorded by your selves to be then given, and stands for ever before the world, as the end of this your argument, and of your Disputation also, there being to this assertion of mine <hi>viz.</hi> for ought I know the children, or dying infants of Turks and Pagans may be all saved, no other answer given by you in the Dispute, nor yet since in your <hi>Account,</hi> nor yet ever to be expected.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Sirs,</hi> as great an <hi>Extasie</hi> as you seem to be in about this position, yet I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure you if I had not learn'd it before, yet I have learn't it since from your very selves, who so strange at it, to be a thing not so strange as true <hi>viz. that the dying infants of Turks and Pagans may be all saved,</hi> and that the dying infants in your Christendom are in no better condition then the dying infants of Turks and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans (for so I said, and not as you here misrelate it, then Turks and Pagans them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) for if the dying infants of infidels are in no worse condition then your dying infants, then surely yours are in no better condition then they, and that they are in no worse condition then yours, nothing need hinder you more then me (for ought I know) from a belief thereof, unlesse you will refuse to believe your selves, who preach no lesse both to me, and all men no further off hence then in the next page, and the next save one above; for do you not say there that unlesse we will violate <hi>Christian charity, whose rule is praesumere &amp;c. to presume every one to be in a good condition, till he appears to be in an evil, we must believe and hope all things of the little children of believers, since it cannot appear in infancy, that

they have barred themselves, &amp;c.</hi> and if so why not of the infants of Turks, Pagans, and infidels? <hi>specially</hi> (to speak in your own dialect) <hi>since it cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that these have</hi> any more than the other <hi>by any actual sin barred themselves, or deserved to be exempted from the general state of little children declared in the Scriptures, which is this, viz. That of such is the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You see then how you teach us this precious piece of truth your selves p. 4.5. therefore I hope you will learn it your selves, <hi>viz.</hi> that we are to hope well of such infants as have not by actual sin barred themselves from Salvation, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us to teach it too in time, though hitherto you seem to be so far from giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way to us to teach the same, that when we speak well of infants, that have not by actual sin deserved exemption, and hope well of their salvation so dying, you so wretchedly forget it to be the doctrine your selves deliver, that with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation you protest against it as abominable, as if there were as little hope to be had of the salvation of such dying infants, as are not born in Christendome, as of the salvation of the very devils: but your first doctrine shall stand of the two for truth with me, from which, though you often contradict it your selves, I shal not be frighted by your bigg words, but still hope as well of one dying infant as another.</p>
               <p>Secondly (<hi>Risum teneatis amici</hi>?) it is enough I think to set him on smiling who is never so deep in his dumps, to see what a most pat, and pertinent place of Scripture you have here dragged in to the proof of infant baptism, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from whence (<hi>as the wheel barrow goes rumble to rumble so</hi>) it followes that infants are to be baptised: you might as well have said you may find it in the fifteenth of go look it, as send us to a text of so little tendency as this is of, to your present purpose: for what if we are not to mourn over the death of Saints, and Godly friends that sleep in Jesus, as those that can have no hope of such friends as they see to dy ung<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>But Sirs is it so in earnest in your opinion, that no baptism no hope of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>

               </list>
               <p>First I must cry out oh the <hi>Vnchristian cruelty</hi> that is hatched in your hearts, and here expressed, not onely to these thousands of infants, even of Christians that happen to dy unbaptized, at least to whom baptism is at this day denyed to be dispensed, but specially to that numberless number of infants of Turks, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, and infidels, to whom in infancy your own Doctrine denies baptism, as well as ours, and consequently (if your own <hi>bloody tenet</hi> of no baptism no salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to dying in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Tis your common course to clamor and cry out against us, as having no chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian charitie, as being most inveterate, and cruel enemies to infants, only for denying the baptism of those few, to whom you dispense it, as well as those <hi>Myriads</hi> of little ones, to whom your selves deny it together with us: but I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to all people, who are not already so perfectly prejudiced against us by your prating, as to stand resolved to believe nothing but your blind dictates, to judge between us whether we are so cruelly opinioned towards infants, who barely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:109011:106"/>
them baptism, believing the salvation notwithstanding of all that dy in infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy without it, or your selves rather, who deny that dispensation to all <hi>infidels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,</hi> which are twenty to one in the world, and yet hold that dispensation so necessary to salvation, that there is no hope of other then damnation to whomsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it is denyed, whereas in confutation of you out of your own mouths (if your own sense of <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.14 be true, where you contend to have the word <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ones</hi> taken literally for infants) Christ himself saies there, that <hi>it is not the will of my Father that so much as one of these little ones should p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, oh the <hi>palpable papistry</hi> which is here openly professed by you, who yet would seem to protest against every inch of it, for it is one of the grossest pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of popery to hold no salvation to infants without baptism, and one great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie between them and protestants; yet you give the cause thus far, as to grant it to be necessary, and effectual to salvation of infants (whether <hi>ex opere operato</hi> or no, as you are silent in it here, so pray tell us another time) that there need be neither doubt nor fear of such dying infants damnation to whom its dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed, and can be no hope of the salvation of such as dy without it, or at least to whom <hi>doctrinally</hi> it is denied.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, oh the <hi>wretched contradiction,</hi> that is here given.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To your selves, who say above p. 5. <hi>that it is breach of Christian cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to presume otherwise then well of such little infants, of whom it cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that by any actuall sin they have barred themselves or deserved exemption from salvation,</hi> and such are all infants in infancy, whether baptized or unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, whether of Christians or heathens; and yet here you say, there is <hi>no hope of the dying infants of infidels,</hi> and in case we deny baptism to them <hi>as little hope</hi> of the salvation of such dying infants, as are born of <hi>Christian parents</hi> also: Hay-Ho! I dare say the dog is not good Mutton, if this be not uniform Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>Secondly, not only to other writers on this subject, as Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> who p. 85. of his book called, <hi>The way of the Churches in New-England,</hi> saith, <hi>one may remain a member of the invisible Church of the first born, when yet he hath neither part nor portion, nor fellowship in the particular flock and visible Church of Christ Iesus</hi>; which shewes (to the confutation of you, and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> also, who pins the salvation of infants so much upon their <hi>Churchmember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and baptism</hi>) that infants may be supposed to be out of the <hi>Visible Church,</hi> and yet be hoped to be in a state of salvation also; I say not only to other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but to the writers your selves will us to peruse, <hi>viz. Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For first, <hi>Vrsins Catechism,</hi> (as insufficient as it is to prove infant baptism) furnishes us with enough wherewith to confute this unsavory stuff you have here recorded, <hi>viz.</hi> the hopelesness of the salvation of such infants, to whom baptism is denyed, whose words are these <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>If you mean that a denial not <hi>de facto,</hi> but <hi>de jure</hi> i. e. not of baptism it self to infants, but of their right to baptism damns them, and that doctrinally onely, not really, they dying without it, you might have said so then if you had pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but your blunt delivery of your selves here, without any modification of your meaning, makes it out, as if you meant to fright the whole Countrey to baptize all their infants in all hast, as ever they mean to have any hope they shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: besides if they be but <hi>doctrinally</hi> damned, and not really by the denial of baptism to them the matter is so much the lesse, for as they are not one straw the better, whether living or dying in infancy, if they have it, so they cannot be (as to salvation) one straw the worse, if they want it, and die without it, and then what need such thundring out of terror to the parents, as if there were no way but one, that is damnation to their dying infants out of hand; if they do not see to the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizing of them in infancy before they dye? moreover, if it be doctrinally to damn all infants to deny their right to baptism, then how damnable is your doctrine to that innocent age, who deny it to no lesse then 20 to one viz. all the dying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of unbelievers? but the best ont is though your doctrine is so desperate and ungodly as to declare nought but damnation to all such, as the Pope doctrinally damnes i. e. all that are not born within the pale of the Church, yet there is salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion enough for these infants, as well as for the other in Christ Jesus, whereby till they <hi>deserve exemption by actuall transgression,</hi> they may be saved really, though with you they are doctrinally damn'd, and with us as well as you deny'd to have, or so much as to have any right at all to baptism.</p>

               <p>It is further added, that there is no other way revealed for the salvation of little infants but by justification, and that by faith: that way of the present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the righteousness of Christ without faith is a figment of the Anabaptists without ground or reason from Scripture, the Covenant of the Gospel being the righteousness of faith.</p>

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:109011:113"/>
they are first made disciples, in the same words wherein he himself declares it to us by the space of well nigh a whole page together, in order to the making of his matter to serve our turn against himself, and all you that baptize infants, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially against his fellow souldier Mr. <hi>Marshal,</hi> and his critical observations, out of which he tells us that infants are not disciples before, but are made disciples by baptizing, I shall frame this argument <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <p>If Christs Rule be that persons should be baptized when they are first made disciples without delay, or immediately after they are converted and discipled, then persons are not to be baptized before they are converted and disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled.</p>
                     <p>But Christs Rule is that persons should be baptized when they are first made disciples, or immediately after they are converted and discipled.</p>
                     <p>Ergo, they are not to be baptized before they are converted or disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is most clear, and consequent, for if it be Christs will that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing should immediately follow our discipling persons, or converting them to the faith, then consequently tis his will that baptizing should not go before our disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling, and converting them: if baptism must be immediately subsequent to teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or making disciples by Christs commission, then teaching persons, or making them disciples must be <hi>Antecedent</hi> to baptism, unlesse both these be the mind of Christ in his commission whom and when to baptize, <hi>viz.</hi> that they should not baptize persons till they are taught and discipled, and yet (to go round again) that they should not teach them till they have baptized them i. e. in Mr. <hi>Marshals</hi> sense initiated them first to be disciples by baptism, and thereby admitted them to be taught, as for the <hi>Minor,</hi> which is this <hi>viz.</hi> That it is Christs rule that persons shall be baptized without delay, when they are first made disciples, or immediately after they are converted, as I have fully proved it already above, both from the commission for baptizing, and from Scripture example explaining that commission, and from the end and use of baptism, so I shall further prove it in Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> own words, then which I think there need no other (if they be well weighed) to convince a wise man that by Scripture rule no infants in infancy are to be baptized.</p>
               <p>To which purpose he writteth thus p. 126.127. at large <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <p>First, in the commission <hi>Mat. 28.19.20.</hi> Christ adjoineth baptizing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to discipling, go disciple all nations baptizing them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly if any person be so impudent as to say, It is not the meaning of Christ that baptizing should immediately without delay follow discipling, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by the constant example of Scripture; for there is no mention that I can find of any one person that was baptized long after their discipling or that ever the Apostles of Christ did delay the baptizing of disciples, <hi>John 4.1.2.</hi> Iesus made and baptized more disciples then <hi>John.</hi> See how making and baptizing disciples are conjoined, Act. <hi>2.38.41.</hi> the <hi>3000</hi> were presently baptized the same day that they were made disciples without staying till the morrow, though one would think the number of <hi>3000</hi> might have excused the delay, if they had taken lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time to do it in; And some would think that their conversion being so sudden the Apostles would have waited for a trial of their sincerity, but this is not the wisdome of God, though it seem to aim at the purity of the Church: Scripture tells us of another way Acts <hi>8.1.2.</hi> the people of <hi>Samiaria</hi> when they believed were baptized without delay. And v. <hi>13.14. Simon Magus</hi> was presently baptized, though yet not brought out of the gall of bitternesse or bond of iniquity, and had no part or fellowship in that business: yea the <hi>Samaritans</hi> were general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly baptized by <hi>Philip,</hi> before they had received the holy Ghost: for he was yet fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len upon none of them, onely they were baptized in the name of the Lord Iesus verse <hi>16.</hi> So Acts <hi>8.36.37.38.</hi> the Eunuch was baptized in his journey as
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:109011:114"/>
they went, without delaying one day or hour after he professed himself to be a disciple. So was <hi>Paul</hi> baptized as soon as he rose from his blindnesse upon the words of <hi>Ananias, Acts 9.18.</hi> So was <hi>Cornelius</hi> with his friends baptized immediately without delay, the same day <hi>Lydia</hi> and her houshold were baptized without delay Acts <hi>16.15.</hi> and the Iaylor the same hour of the night that he was discipled Acts <hi>16.38.</hi> So the <hi>Corinthians</hi> Acts <hi>18.8.</hi> and <hi>Ananias</hi> language to <hi>Paul</hi> repeated <hi>Acts 22.16.</hi> is plain, and now why tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riest thou? arise and be baptized &amp;c. and of the houshold of <hi>Stephanus</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> baptized, it is implied too; and it is most observable which is said in Iohn <hi>3.26.</hi> of Iesus himself that he baptized (by his disciples) and all men came unto him; where it is undeniable that Iesus baptized without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, even as fast as they came to him and professed themselves disciples, and can we have a better example then the Lord Iesus himself?—And thus you see (<hi>saith he</hi>) that according to all the examples of baptism in the Scripture (not to speak of <hi>Johns</hi> baptism) there was no delaying, no not a day usually but they were all baptized as soon as they were discipled.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus far are the very words of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> brought by him in proof of infant baptisme, and here brought again by me in proof of the clear contrary <hi>viz.</hi> that according to all the examples of baptism in the Scripture, not one infant was ever baptized in the primitive times, but that all that ever were then baptized, did first believe and were converted, were first made disciples by the preaching of the Gospel to them, and did first come and professe themselves disciples, and thereupon were immediately admitted: which things I dare say, twill be out of doubt with all rational considerate impartial Christians, that they were never performed by any infants, and if not, then whether all these examples do not clearly shew rather that no infants were then baptized, then that any were or now ought to be, a child of 7. years old at least may easily decide it: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing so childish is Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> as to set down this at large, that he may thence make himself a clearer way (as by the constant example and practise of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive time) to prove your present practise of baptizing of infants: which premises and conclusion <hi>viz.</hi> that men and women of old were baptized without delay, so soon as ever they were converted to the faith, and were discipled and professed themselves disciples, therefore we must baptize the children of Christians in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, or else our practise is utterly inconsistent with the rule of Christ, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the practise of the primitive times, and consequently a sinful practise, are as sutable, as

               </p>
               <p>And howbeit Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in defence hereof tells us p. 128. they who baptize the children of Christians at age (as the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> do) cannot possibly do it when they are first discipled, I am so amazed at that expression, that I can hardly believe he minded what he said when he pend it, nor do I think the man had his wits well about him when he wrote all the rest that follows in proof therof through out that whole chapter of his, where the further he proceeds, the more he abounds and sinks ore head and ears in absurdities, contradicting himself and his own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and overthrowing the very thing he there prosecutes the proof of, for</p>
               <p>First, so farre is it from being impossible to baptize believers children immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after they are discipled, if we forbear them till they come to years, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is impossible that they should be discipled at all till then, in such a way as all those were discipled in, whom he hath produced as examples in this case, for whatever conversion there seems to him to be of all, or at least the most of the children of believers so timely, that neither themselves nor others be can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:109011:114"/>
when by the preaching of the Gospel they are brought over both to believe, and to be willing to obey the Lord Jesus, and do freely, ser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As for us therefore we have a steady rule to go by in the baptizing of persons, according to which we still baptize them as of old they did, when first discipled, yea though they are persons whose parents were Church-members, or in other meer <hi>relative</hi> only, or <hi>reall</hi> discipleship, yet they are first made Disciples when they first appear to be converted, witness the three thousand <hi>Iewes,</hi> whom Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself doth instance in; who though they, and their parents were all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively holy by birth, and Church-members of the visible Church of old, and as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is pleased to say most simply p. 20. both disciples and Servants of God by very nature, yet in the Gospel sense they were first made disciples, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled so as thereby to be in right to baptism, when they were by <hi>Peter</hi> convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only, and not before: so that if the children of Christians had now either such a <hi>Relative</hi> discipleship (as he calls it, and as he saies the <hi>Iews</hi> children had once by birth) and such a real discipleship, or invisible conversion to God in very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, as he deeply dotes all such to have so soon as ever they they are born, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which yet they have indeed, yet nevertheless that they may be, and also must be first discipled when they are at years in that sense wherein discipling was in the Commission enjoined in order to baptism, it is evident by Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> own alledged instance of the <hi>Iews Acts</hi> 2. who though they were (according to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself as nigh, and in truth more nigh to God by birth, than the fleshly seed of believing Gentiles are, yet were not for all that their old Church-membership and discipleship (for indeed they were (not in infancy) but when grown up discipled unto <hi>Moses</hi>) admitted to baptism thereupon, till they were first discipled unto Christ, and had both heard, and gladly received the word of the Gospel: neither were ever any (as appears by all the Examples forecited) of what parents soever descended, though of <hi>Abraham</hi> himself admitted to baptism in the primitive times, till discipled, i. e. till visibly appearing, and verbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at least professing to repent, believe and imbrace the Gospel: nor is it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for men, to whom Christ gives order to make disciples to him, to do it any other way than by instructing persons till such time as they learn, and receive the things that are taught them.</p>
               <p>Moreover to let pass that round he runs p, 127. where after he had shewed so abundantly, that to be Christs disciples gave persons admission immediately to baptism (to go round again) he expresses himself thus lin. 32. that baptism ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth them to be his disciples; whereas Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> asserts, that we cannot possibly baptize children of Christians at age, immediatly after they are first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled, because we cannot possibly know when such children are first discipled, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be in their first infancy, as I have shewed him already what a steady rule, &amp; direct period of time we keep to in baptizing, as they did in the primitive times, <hi>viz.</hi> as soon as they are first discipled, i. e. when first they appear to us truly to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and profess seriously and sincerely (as far as we can judge) to repent from their sins, and believe in Christ, and desire, and profer to be baptized in his name for the remission of sins, so I must return his own proposition upon him' that they who baptize the children of Christians in infancy (as the <hi>Anti-baptists</hi> do) cannot possibly do it when they are first discipled, and that because they cannot possibly know when such persons are first made disciples, and except they account them to
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:109011:115"/>
be first discipled as we do, <hi>viz.</hi> when professing verbally, and when first appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing visibly and (for ought we can discern) truly to believe and repent from their sins, and desire baptism, which things no infants ever do.</p>

               <p>But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> supposes infants of Christian parents to have a Relative in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-discipleship from the womb, and so hath a sure way of baptizing them, when they are first discipled if he baptize them in their first infancy.</p>

All which things he that imagins they more include then exclude the sucking infants of such, to whom he speaks, is no man in discretion with me.</p>
               <p>As for the other place its most evident the Apostle speaks not of baptism litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally but <hi>Metaphoically</hi> onely there, they were baptized unto <hi>Moses</hi> i. e. by the visible tokens of Gods presence amongst them <hi>viz.</hi> the cloud and Sea assisting and siding with them, and overthrowing their adversaries, they were confirmed in the belief of God, and his servant <hi>Moses,</hi> as we by baptism are in the faith of Gods goodnesse to us, and of his Son Jesus Christ: in further confirmation of which meer figurative sence of the word [<hi>baptized</hi>] you may do well to consider that though they were said to be baptized in the cloud, and in the sea, which phrases however<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sound forth such a total immersion as is not in two or three drops of water fingered on the face, yet they were not so much as wetted with either the cloud or the sea, for its said <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.21.22. the sea was made dry land un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, and they went through it dry shod, or on dry ground, which they could not be well said to do had it so much as rained upon them, such a figurative sence of the word [<hi>baptize</hi>] there Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself denies not p. 90. yet Dr. <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi> urged that place in a publique dispute at <hi>Petworth Ian.</hi> 1651. as one of his arguments for infant baptism, besides Secondly, if you will needs have it proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken that they were baptized really, and not <hi>quasi</hi> baptized, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> yields they were, and if you will needs make that baptism such an emblem of ours, that ours must have an adequate subject to that, which say you, was infants as well as parents, then twill put you to your trumps to excuse your selves handsomly in your now denying to infants the same spiritual meat and drink in the supper, which they then eat and drank of in a figure also <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Manna</hi> and the <hi>Rock,</hi> which both were no other (<hi>Antitypically</hi>) then the bread and wine are mistically in the supper i. e. the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>For all your vain boasting therefore of what innumerable arguments you have from Scriptures, I say the Scriptures are sure enough on our side, nevertheless ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the word in a sutable sense you do well to call your Scripture armes or argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>innumerable,</hi> for indeed they are not to be numbred (for even <hi>unit as,</hi>

               <p>First, as much as you would seem to be verst among the fathers (in which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Priests are better read then in the Scriptures, and some to seem to be better read there then they are, will quote the fathers when they have not read them, but by snaches, and pickt a few fine phrases out of them, to make their sermons the more sententious, yea and sometimes for those very sentences, for which they might more truly quote the Apostles, that primitively pend them, witnesse one of your tribe whom I heard with my own ears say of <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. <hi>he took not on him the nature of Angels,</hi> thus <hi>viz.</hi> for as Saint <hi>Barnard</hi> saith, when as he might as well have said, as the spirit, or as the Scripture saith, <hi>He took not on him</hi> &amp;c. if yet he knew that twas in the Scripture) as much I say as you are versed in the fathers, you are desired by Mr. <hi>Blackwood</hi> (a man better read in those fathers then either you or I) yea you and Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> also, who quotes <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> are desired by him in his <hi>storming of Antichrist</hi> p. 25.26.27. to prove if you can out of any place of <hi>Iustins</hi> genuine works, who is the antientest father extant next the Apostles, whose works are accounted on, that there is so much as the name of infant baptism, much more the thing; yea he tells you ye may as soon find a <hi>Dolphin</hi> in the woods, as any such thing: save onely that tis once mentioned in a spurious book falsely called his, out of which book Mr. <hi>Marshalls</hi> quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, neither doth Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> gainsay this, nor yet Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> in their replies, nay they rather seem to grant that its to be doubted it was so, which makes me as well as Mr. <hi>Blackwood,</hi> not a little wonder that Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> should quote it with so much confidence, I mean so as to assert it thereupon as a matter manifest, that the Church (counting from the time of <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> viz. 150) hath bin possest of the priviledg of infant baptism for the space of 1500 years and upwards, for had he not doubted but that the words, he cites were without question the words of <hi>Iustin</hi> himself, he had not had sin, but now he hath no cloak, sith he demonstrates to all men <hi>Dubitatum per magis dubium,</hi> and tells the world to make them believe that <hi>Iustin</hi> disputes the condition of children that dye baptized and unbaptized, when yet its not believed, but much doubted by himself, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Iustin</hi> did any such thing yea or no: as to the words Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> p. 4. of his sermon cites out of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> who lived toward the end of the second <hi>Century,</hi> which Englisht are thus <hi>viz. Christ came by himself to save all, all I say, who are born again unto God, infants and little ones &amp;c.</hi> its not likely that in this sentence that father by the word [<hi>born again</hi>] meant baptism (as Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> and Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> contend) for by that sence they father such absurdity upon that their father, as children that pretend to honour their father, may be ashamed of, whilst they make him say, Christ came to save all infants that are baptized, when as neither all infants, that are baptized are actually saved, <hi>quâ</hi> bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, nor are any unbaptized infants damned, <hi>quâ</hi> not baptized, but both alike saved as both alike they either dye before they have bard themselves by actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al sin, and derserved exemption, or living to years believe and obey Christ, and both alike damned as living to years they both alike obey not his Gospel, but however let Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> and Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> squeeze what they can from the quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it must yet remain as doubtful whether the speech of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> (if it were his
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:109011:118"/>
own) were at all of infants baptism, as it doth whether the speech fathered on <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> (though it be of infants baptism) were at all his own: and so what dubious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence the second century affords, so much as <hi>de facto,</hi> that infant baptism was then in being, all men may see, whilst you can say no more then perhaps it was so, and a fool may say as much as perhaps it was not, which is a proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble answer to that argument, for tis commonly said in the Schooles (saies Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi>) that <hi>forte ita, solvitur per forte non.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, but what if your testimony <hi>de facto</hi> concerning the practise of infant baptism in the second century were as clear, as tis cloudy, yet what green headed antiquity is this in comparison of that we plead from <hi>viz.</hi> the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves? when you are stormed out of all your strong holds then you send us still to ages above us, and cry out your practise is of 1500 years standing, but sith you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say as we can of ours, tis above 1600 years old (nor is yours now likely to live to it) as good you had said but 15 for our way onely being found in the first century, and yours not at all before the second, we are a people so much elder then you upstarts, that your <hi>antiquity</hi> is but <hi>novelty</hi> with us, whoregardlesse of what by mans wisdome was foisted in in after ages, can aver with as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence as you can that now it is that from the beginning it was not so, nor yet in end shall be: I much marvel why Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> contents himself to preach po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively no otherwise then thus, p. 3. <hi>viz. this priviledge of baptizing infants the Christian Church hath bin in possession of for the space of</hi> 1500 <hi>years and upwards</hi>: he might as easily have said 1600, had his ground been as good for that as for the other, and yet his ground for the other is so infirm, and sinking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, that I believe he must fall down as low as the third century, before he find sure footing for his proof of no more then the bare practise of infant baptism.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Ius</hi> of it its nere the nearer, if he could prove the matter of fact to be in the second, though that still is the main question betwen us, sith tis confest by Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> that he uses not the Testimony and judgements of the Antients to witnesse to the truth of it, but onely to prove a then practise of infant baptism, and the question <hi>de jure</hi> whether infants ought to be baptized, <hi>no one of the fathers, nor yet the joint consent of many</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> p. 58. of his to Mr. <hi>Blackwood</hi>) <hi>is a competent Iudge,</hi> therefore if any of you, who stand so much upon that <hi>young antiquity</hi> of it, and plead the authority of the Church and fathers shall argue thus, tis 1500 years old, therefore it is 1600 you live below that candor ingenuity, and discretion that I find in Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> and <hi>Mr. Blake,</hi> who both deny your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, and in this case close with us in the very truth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as for the third century, tis somewhat more then probable that such a superstition as infant baptism was comming in at least, or else tis like there would not have been such <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> as was about it, for, true, <hi>Or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:109011:119"/>
it being (for all their reasons) as scriptureless as that of <hi>Origen,</hi> who brings no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to prove what he said.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>Babist.</head>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> p. <hi>18.</hi> tells you that it was because none opposed the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of infant-baptism, which if they had, <hi>Origen</hi> would no doubt have maintained by Scripture, as well as affirmed it to come from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</p>

            <div type="section">

               <p>This is strange, when it is most evident, and Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> himself denies it not, that famous <hi>Tertullian,</hi> the first of that Century, that might in respect of his Seniority to <hi>Origen,</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi> be stiled a father to them both, perswades by many reasons to deferre the baptism of children, as most profitable, Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

                     <p>Let them become Christians when they know Christ.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And in another place,</hi> It behooves them that are about to enter into baptism to pray with frequent prayers, fastings, kneelings, watching, and with the confession of all their sinnes past, <hi>which things infants (we know) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>First, then I appeal to your own consciences, and Mr. <hi>Marshalls</hi> also, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be not a plea against it as unlawful, for to decline whats most profitable is unlawful.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whether here be not <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> among the Fathers about it, and so though their testimony serves to prove what Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> brings it for, <hi>viz.</hi> that it was practised in their times, yet it serves not to your purpose, who upon the Fathers and their churches authority, would gather and ground the right of that practise, for who but children will go about to prove the veri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y of a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise by the Authority of those Fathers, whose witnesse agrees not together, and who are contradictory to one another in their testimonies of it, and some of whose testimonies in that thing are quite and clean contradicted by the testimonies of such as concurre with them almost in every thing else? for so I may truly say the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Father <hi>Austin</hi> are, who in one place <hi>viz. ad Volusianum Ep.</hi> 3. (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> quotation of him p. 51.) writes thus <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Custome of the Church in the baptizing of infants is by no means to be despised, nor to be accounted superfluous, nor yet were it at all to be credited, were it not a tradition of the Apestles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus this Father who though inferior to the other in time, yet is not inferiour to the chiefest of them in your Account; but he brings no Scripture neither any more then <hi>Origen</hi> for the same, yet it is like some sleighted it as superfluous in his daies: but <hi>Ludovicus vives,</hi> a man so observant of <hi>Austin,</hi> that he wrote <hi>Annotations</hi> upon him, in those very <hi>Annotations</hi> of his upon the 27th chapter of the first book <hi>De civit. Dei</hi> (according to Mr. <hi>Denns</hi> quotation of him p. 51. against Dr. <hi>Featley</hi>) is so far from crediting that he corrects <hi>Austin</hi> rather as to that piece of faith saying,
<q>That of old it was the custome to baptize none unless they were of full age, and did desire baptism in their own persons; and did undeestand what it was to be baptized.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now who can safely build so much as you do (unless he mean to be both blindly guided with you, and a blind guide to the blind) on the authority of such Fathers, as (saving their honesty in what they knew, and eminency in some things, were yet so silly in some others, that they did the Church no such good office as they wot of, who ere they were that canonized them into such fatherhood over the faith, that their opinions must be as <hi>Oracles</hi> for all to act by: witnesse good Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> the last in that Catalogue, who (saving that he knew some truth, as other honest men did in those dismal daies wherein he lived) was w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:109011:119"/>
up into a mist of so many other errors, besides that of infants baptism, that we may boldly use the proverb, <hi>viz. Bernardus non videt omnia,</hi> for (as Mr. <hi>Blackwood</hi> quotes out of his 65 ser. in p. 31. of his storm) speaking of some Christians that opposed the popish stream he sai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They laugh at us, because we baptize infants, because we pray for the dead, because we require the praiers of Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All which doctrine, though falling from a father, is yet indeed too ridiculous to be received for truth, in these daies of its return from captivity, by any but meer children in the Gospel.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I appeal to your consciences (not to Mr. <hi>Marshalls</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> here, for they from the Fathers assert no more than matter of fact, that infant-baptism was then, whilest you matter of faith that it ought to be) whether that foretold testimony of <hi>Tertullian</hi> may not ballance with those of <hi>Origen, Cyprian, &amp;c.</hi> who were not so near the pure times of the Apostles as he, and whether he were not as likely as <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Austin</hi> to know if it had been so that infant-baptism was a Tradition from the Apostles, and in case he did know it, to what end he should deny it to be now dispensed; or do you imagin him a man of so mean a conceit of the Apostles wisdome, and so highly conceited of his own, that he would forbid that as unprofitable, which the Apostles prescribed, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe a more convenient way himself? sure he must know as well as they if it were Apostolicall, and they possibly might not know so well as he that it was not, being all <hi>Iuniors</hi> to him and one of them, <hi>viz. Cyprian,</hi> so much beholding to him for much of what he had, that he dignified him with the name of his <hi>Master,</hi> such a diligent disciple, i. e. reader and learner of <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> was he, that <hi>Damihi Magistrum</hi> was his common speech of him; so that his rational diswasion from infant-baptism, cannot but be a more cogent ground of faith on one hand, then <hi>Origens</hi> Scriptureless position, and <hi>Cyprians Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick,</hi> and reasonless reasons, and perswasion to it are one the other, unless you will needs so father it over the Fathers themselves, as to <hi>authorize</hi> which of them and which of their sentences you please, disowning the rest, as not <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox,</hi> or <hi>Authentick,</hi> further then they serve your own turns, and then by my consent they shall be no longer fathers to you, but you fathers over them, and us too in their stead.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Marshall,</hi> who hath a longer arm then every body, reaches us a rap yet by a certain quaere, which he propounds to Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> p. 35.36.37. to which till he hath some answer he will conceive we are so sick of <hi>Tertullian</hi> that weele say no more of him. his quaere is this.</p>

               <p>Why may not the diswasion cited out of <hi>Tertullian de baptismo infantium</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably be interpreted of the infants of infidells only, whose baptism he would have deferred, till they come to years, and to profess faith themselves, and not of the infants of Christians? I am inclined to believe that to be the true meaning of the place for such considerations.</p>
               <p>First, because <hi>Tertullian</hi> alledges this double reason why he would have the baptism of little ones delaied, viz. least their Sponsors, or Sureties be in haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of not fulfilling the promises they make on their behalf, by either their own mortality, or the childrens proving untoward, of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

any at all: and as for <hi>Tertullian,</hi> though he mistaking <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning, holds such are holy by a kind of prerogative of seed (as Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> speaks) yet tis very questionable to me, whether it be that so transcendent kind of birth holiness, and prerogative you expound him of, and howbeit Dr. <hi>Holmes</hi> and Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> would fain fetch that father in by force of forged construction to witnesse as a <hi>God-father</hi> to their <hi>federal</hi> holinesse; yet I cannot easily believe by his words, that he hath respect to any more then a bare <hi>recounting,</hi> and reputing these to be holy, in a sense abstract from any reallity of their being holy by natural birth, and in their childhood as the <hi>Doctor</hi> vainly descants on <hi>Tertullians</hi> phrase wherein he mentions them to be holy, or till such time as they are holy indeed by that <hi>new birth</hi> from above; and Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> takes my part against the <hi>Doctor</hi> in this too saying they are in <hi>Tertullians</hi> sense <hi>designati sanctitatis</hi> i. e. as these words are expounded by the following, witnesse the <hi>Doctor</hi> himself, counted holy; but not <hi>Sancti</hi> i. e. not holy, till they be born of water, and the spirit p. 36. much lesse can I ever believe that he counted them holy and priviledged above others so far, as thereupon to assert them, or so much as to allow them to be baptized, for thats an utter in consequence of your own from <hi>Pauls</hi> text 1 Cor. 7.14. and from <hi>Tertullians</hi> text to, who though he take <hi>Pauls</hi> speech of such childrens holinesse a little the wrong way, yet wrests them not so far out of the way to the proof of such a popish practise as you do, yea there is not a little in <hi>Tertullians</hi> testimony you so talk of, that tends at all to testifie the truth of infant baptism; indeed had the <hi>Epithet</hi> given by <hi>Tertullian fidelium filiis</hi> been so as that instead of that phrase, wherein he saies they ought to be <hi>designati sanctitatis et salutis</hi> i. e. reputatively holy and happy ones, he had said they should be <hi>signati sanctitatis, &amp; salutis</hi> i. e. signed, in your own phrase, sealed ones of holinesse and happinesse, there had been some hint towards baptism, but as tis there is none at all of such a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>The Dr. draws neck and heels together to make <hi>Tertullian</hi> speak to his mind, but twill appear he was of another mind then he, as to the baptism of any infants when all is done. for saith he</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:109011:122"/>Secondly, and further to prove it, least Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> and the Dr. should not grant <hi>Vossius</hi> that <hi>Tertullians</hi> denial is of the baptism of all infants, even of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers as well as infidels, I argue that more plainly.</p>
               <p>First from the universallity of the expression of himself in his disswasion, which extends to all manner of persons without exception; for it may be thought he was somewhat soiled with that superstition, which was rife in after ages <hi>viz.</hi> that baptism was best dispensed towards the end of a mans life, that he might have a sign of the forgivnesse of all his sinnes at once, whereupon <hi>Tertullian</hi> would not have unmarried persons baptized until temptation was over, so far was as he from desiring such early dispensation of baptism as that to infants, I say his perswasion to delay it extends to all manner of persons, and therefore to the infants of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers as well as to other little ones.</p>
               <p>Secondly, his indefinit and indifferent expression of these little ones concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which he speaks, for (saith he) <hi>specially about little ones,</hi> promiscuously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all, excepting none, as it had bin necessary for him to do if he would be understood to speak but of some, and not of others: for if Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> should preach or write his opinion against the baptism of unbelievers children onely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to himself his present earnestnesse for the baptism of other little ones, and deliver himself downrightly and indifinitely thus onely, in way of dissawsion <hi>viz.</hi> I would not by any means have little one baptized, I find no ground <hi>bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zare parvulos</hi> to baptize infants &amp;c. so running on and never distinguishing, so as to say in that sermon or speech, I mean onely infants of infidels, I should not take him for so judicious a man as I yet hold him to be, saving his holding so stif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly still for infant baptism.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by the reason he gives why he would not have little ones baptized <hi>viz.</hi> least their sureties should be in hazzard of non-performance of their words, by reason of their own death, or their <hi>God childrens</hi> untowardnesse, which dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger may come as well by baptism of believers infants as of others: As whose <hi>Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,</hi> whether <hi>fathers</hi> or <hi>mothers,</hi> or <hi>God fathers</hi> and <hi>God-mothers</hi> may die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they grow up, or if they live, be frustrated of their ends by the wickednesse of these children, or god-children also.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in that he speaks of such children of whom the Lord said forbid them not to come unto me, which in the Priesthoods own sense at least are believers children, yea and them onely, by which clause according to you he may seem to speak of them onely, rather then of infidels childrens onely, whom you your selves forbid to be brought to Christ at all.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, in that he saies let them become Christians when they know Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like then, if your sense be true, some Infants may be warrantably enough made Christians before they know Christ, but some infants again may not at any hand be made Christians till they know Christ, which if it were <hi>Tertullians</hi> meaning, as tis yours, he might mean honestly in it (as you do) but tis too mean an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to keep touch with the word, which never knew any way but one, wherein di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples and Christians were made, i. e. of profest faith, repentance and baptism, after they knew Christ by the preaching of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, in that he saies we should be more wary then to commit Divine sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to them, to whom earthly substance is not committed, now we know that earthly substance can be no more wisely committed to infants of believers in their non age then to <hi>infants of infidels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, by one end why he would have them be capable to beg salvation first, <hi>viz.</hi> that God may seem to give it to them that ask it, which end is destroyed, if baptism be dispensed to believers infants in infancy, for they can no more ask it then the infants of u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>believers.</p>
               <p>Eightly, because he saies it behoves them, indifinitely (meaning all them) that enter into baptism to pray and confesse sin, &amp;c. which conditions are as exclusive
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:109011:122"/>
of all infants as of some, those of believers being no more capable to do that then infants of infidels are.</p>
               <p>Ninethly, what ever children he disswaded from the baptizing of here (and so saith Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>) its most evident <hi>de facto</hi> that they were wont to be baptized then, or else there had been no object of his diswasion, therefore if his advice to delay to them, were concerning infants of infidels, then its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that in <hi>Tertullians</hi> time twas the custome to baptize infidels infants as well as Christians, and so if antiquity of infant baptism were an argument of its goodnes, its as good an argument of the goodness of baptizing infidels infants also, which with you is well-nigh as bad as the other is good.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">

               <p>True <hi>de facto</hi> we have evidence that the baptism of infidels infants then was, but that fathers disswading from it is an argument that twas nought and though crept in yet a thing that was not so from the beginning.</p>

               <p>Then I hope, if ever you come to be perswaded, and it is a wonder that none of the reasons above be cogent, that twas indeed from baptizing of any children at all that <hi>Tertullian</hi> diswaded, we have an argument of your own for it that the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism of any mens infants is naught also, and a thing that was not so from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and so if Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> himself be not by this time sick of <hi>Tertullian</hi> I assure both him and on all that I am, and of all the Fathers also, with whom in this controversie I would not have meddled, but that your Pamphlet flutters so so with naming the Fathers; and takes i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, I am sick more yet to find the whole Clergy after whom the whole world wonders, and walks in error, wondring so much after these Fathers, and walking after them, where they walk in error, and yet neglecting to give heed to them where they speak the truth, and which is worst of all, sleighting the short pure, and plain waies of God, the Father of all, of <hi>Christ</hi> our Father, and the first Fathers next and immediately under God and Christ, Supreme Governors of the Church, and givers out of the Gospel to the world, I mean the <hi>Apostles,</hi> who in my mind write the way of the Gospel, if men were not willing to go astray from it, because it is narrow, self denying, and thorny, though more briefly yet more clearly to any common capacity, then the most voluminous of all the other fathers do, for we use all plaine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Fourthly, and Lastly I am sick most of all to consider, what a stirr ministers make in their quotations of the Fathers, marching on, and giving such a broad side, as they think, with two or three sentences ou of the fathers, as if they would bear all men down before them, that come near them, no higher read then in the Scriptures, no better armed then with the sword of the spirit, the word of God; For this only is dispised as much as <hi>Davids</hi> sling and stone before <hi>Goliah,</hi> and this too, though in coole bloud the Scripture is confessed by themselves to be so <hi>instar omnium,</hi> that nothing is of any force, but what flowes from it: for though some <hi>Clergy men</hi> dote so far that they believe the Fathers, no otherwise then they would have the world to believe themselves, i. e. because <hi>ipse dixit,</hi> yet some are so wise as to confesse, that how far forth soever the Fathers may serve to prove to us things <hi>de facto</hi> to be done in their several ages, yet their testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyes <hi>de facto</hi> cannot prove any thing to us to be <hi>de jure</hi> at all, whereas if it be so, and ye so it is, I am me thinks become a fool at this time in falling, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was aware, so up to the ears in contest about a few testimonies of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as well as I and others heretofote, in counting so extraordinarily on them: wherefore I do henceforth humbly conceive, and confess my self to the people, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all my fellow <hi>father-fool'd</hi> friends, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Clergy</hi> of all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to have been no better then <hi>childish</hi> and <hi>semi-simple</hi> so far as such high and holy heed, and such heedlesse submission hath been given by us to these fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Schoolmen, and other authors, as hath occasioned extreme seduction from the Scriptures: hear therefore O thou most miserably be wildred Priesthood of the Nations, and understand, for so thou shalt if thou return from out of that thick wood of <hi>Authors, Polemical Tracts, Schoolmen, Casuists, Tomes, Volumes of Fathers, Councels, Commentators, Treatises, Systemes of Theology, fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forms of old and New Creeds, long and short Catechismes, confessions of Churches, &amp;c.</hi> in which thou hast wandred and lost thy self from the truth, to the unfeigned study of that little book of Scriptures, which alone, if thou wilt be admonished by it, is able to make thee, and them that hear thee wise enough unto salvation: Thou speakest what thou hast seen of thy fathers we speak what we have seen of our Fathers: what thine teach in their books, we regard not <hi>quâ ipsi dixerint,</hi> unless <hi>quâ dictum prius</hi> by our Fathers, if they teach no other then what our Fathers teach in theirs, it is no more then what thou, having the same Scripture, the same liberty, to search, the same promise of the same spirit to guide, the same accesse to God in prayer for it, mayest learn, not at second hand from them, but at first hand from thence, as easily as themselves, but when they go aside, from that, and thou with them, and thine with thee a venture, this seems no other to me then <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> with a false flash going before, and <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramus

               <p>By this time you may see O ye <hi>Ashford Synodians</hi>! how little ground you would have gotten by it if the Authorities of the Church of God from the beginning, and the fathers of both that and after ages had been used by you, to the advantage of your disputation, when as not onely the primitive fathers of all i. e. the Apostles, and the Church in their daies, whose authorities you rebell against, are wholly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you, but also the prime of those postern fathers, and the Church in their daies, whose authoritie <hi>you</hi> so stand upon, are nothing fot <hi>you.</hi>

               <p>How little then the Authorities of <hi>fathers</hi> and <hi>Churches,</hi> in case we grant them to come in thereunto, can contribute to your assistance is apparent, and now that those modern authors you promise your Reader such through furniture from <hi>viz.

               <p>Again, some of you pin your practise upon the score of the infants faith, and of these again there are several <hi>subdivisions,</hi> for some ground it on <hi>seminall</hi> faith onely i. e. the habit, or on infants having faith, denying utterly their capacity to act it i. e. to believe (as Mr. <hi>Willcock</hi> and many more.)</p>

               <p>The First is taken from the universall practise of the Church of God, which the Adversaries would not hear of at the Disputation. The grounds of it are expresse texts of Scripture, Mat. <hi>28.20. Lo I am with you alway to the end of the world.</hi> Iohn <hi>14.16. The Comforter shall abide with you for ever.</hi> ver. <hi>17. The spirit of truth.</hi> ver. <hi>26. Who shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance which I have told you.</hi> Iohn. <hi>16.13. He will lead you into all truth:</hi> The Argument is this. To hold that Christs promise is not true, is damnable blasphemy: But to hold that the universall Church hath er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in so necessary a matter as baptism, and that for so many hundred years, is to hold that Christs promise is not true, his promise of being with his Church, of guiding it by the spirit into all truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> To hold the Vniversall Church hath so erred is damnable blasphemy.</p>
               <p>If the Anabaptists object, That the Church of Rome useth this Argument for her traditions; The Answer is, That those traditions which she pleads for were neither universal nor doctrinal, as this of baptism, and therefore the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception against her was just, and those errors which she defends by that, were denyed to be of the universall Church: But the Anabaptists can never prove, that this practise hath not been universall, or dare not say, that this matter is not doctrinal.</p>

                  <hi>A positive argument of very great moment</hi> (saith he) <hi>that may convince the conscience of any ingenuous Christian,</hi> viz. <hi>that the Apostles in their dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to baptize infants, and the whole Catholique Christian Church in all places and ages, even from the Apostles dayes, hath admitted the children of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an parents to holy baptism, therefore tis no error.</hi>

               <p>Moreover twas not the Church, in the capacity of a Church in respect of outward form and order, but his disciples to whom that promise was made, to whom also it was performed, and made good in all ages according, and in such measure as they kept close to him, for in the time of the treading down of the Temple and holy City, and the true worship and worshippers, and of all that visible fabrick and Church posture which stood in the primitive times, and even in the grossest dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, God gave power to his two witnesses i. e. by his word, and spirit in the hearts and mouths of his Saints, impowered them to prophesie and testifie to the truth against the traditions of <hi>Rome,</hi> and against infant baptism as well as other

Howbeit, I say I wish you to advise how safely you, that know it to be your duty, may neglect it, and how groundedly you can assure your selves, that you do believe at all in truth, if you receive not the love of every title of Christs truth, so as wherein it appears to you to imbrace and obey it, yet I am well assured I never utterd the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>viz.</hi> that all that did believe, and were not dipt should be damned, nor is it now, nor ever was it my judgement to this hour; of which for the worlds and your satisfaction, sith I have been very often charged, and that twice or thrice in publique places where I have preacht, so to hold, I shall here give this brief account.</p>
               <p>I judge that all persons in the world (meaning not infants, but such as are at years of discretion, to whom the Gospell comes in any measure) are of some or other of these three sorts, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Either such as neither believe at all, nor so much as in words profess so to do, Or</item>
                     <item>2. Such as in words say they believe, and indeed do not. Or</item>
                     <item>3. Such as both profess to believe, and do indeed believe as they say.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Now I suppose we all hold the first sort, <hi>viz.</hi> professed prophane ones, so liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so dying, will be damned, and unless we will deny the Scriptures, we must needs hold the second sort, whose professed faith is a dead faith shall not be sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>for what doth it profit if a man say he hath faith</hi> Jam. 2.14. <hi>and have not works,</hi> &amp;c. whereby onely faith is proved to be true indeed as it is professed, <hi>can that faith save him</hi>? as for the third sort, <hi>viz</hi> true believers, I subdivide them in my thoughts into 2 ranks.</p>
               <p>First, such as believing in Christ truly for salvation, believe also baptism in its true way of dispensation, and not rantism, to be Christs will concerning them, and these I am certain will submit accordingly and obey him in it, for such as say they have faith, and live in rebellion to what parts of Christs will they know they ought to obey him in, have not faith to salvation what ever they say. Or</p>
               <p>Secondly, such as believing in Christ, neither see nor believe, nor practise baptism in that only true way wherin we dispense it, and all this meerly for want of meanes to discover it to them, or by means of the invincible ignorance of their times, and ages wherein they lived, and wherein, according to the will of God permitting it so to be, the mind of God in that thing hath been hid, and, as we know it hath in many more things for ages and generations together, remained undiscovered, which times of ignorance I believe God much winked at, in those who sincerely owned truth, and obeyed it so far as it then appeared, and as they saw it, though now he commands all men to return from <hi>Babylon</hi> in these daies of light, wherein men may see, but that they will not, yea <hi>many prophets, and righteous ones</hi> in the height of Popery, <hi>have desired to see, and hear what we do,</hi> or may do, <hi>yet could not,</hi> the Scriptures lying lockt up as unlawful well-nigh for any to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult

               <p>First, because the spirit denominates them so to be in Scripture, calling them expressely the two Covenants <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.24. and also very often (<hi>in plurali</hi>) the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, the covenants of promise.</p>

to the promises, as twas the similitude of heavenly things, <hi>the figure and shadow of the good things to come, and a schoolmaster to bring to Christ,</hi> Eph. 2.14. Col. 2.14.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Thus you find the Scripture opposing one of these two to the other, so farre is it from signifying them to be one and the self same Covenant, as you frivolously fain them to be, that you may build your infant-baptism thereupon.</p>

               <p>And as for that reason, which you give of those terms <hi>first, second, old</hi> and <hi>new,</hi> viz. because the law was more antient and antecedent, the Gospel more of late, and subsequent, in this sence tis true the Gospel is succedaneous to the other, as to its last and clearest promulgation under Christ crucified (for else in some degrees of it the Gospel was before the law, and was preacht to <hi>Abraham</hi> (as you alleadge) out of <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8.17.) 430 years before <hi>Moses,</hi> yea and to <hi>Adam</hi> 2000 years before that, yea indeed to say the truth, the Law and the Gospel, were both e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from the beginning, though both more lively illustrated toward the end: the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:109011:137"/>
Gospel in dark promises being both before, and under those plainer promulgations of the Law, as given by <hi>Moses,</hi> and the law in some parcels viz. Sacrifices and some other ceremonies of it, being from <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> before the brighter breakings forth of either the one, or yet the other, in this sence I say tis true, the Law came first by <hi>Moses,</hi> before the Gospel of grace and truth came by <hi>Christ</hi>; whereupon that may be properly called the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>old</hi> one, and this also the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> and the <hi>new,</hi> neverthelesse not onely thereupon, for howbeit the bare noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>first second, old and new</hi> arise from the ones being once, and now aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, the others being since, and still abiding, yet could they not possibly and properly be called so much as two Covenants, much less a first and a second, if they were not truly two, or were only one, for then we may properly call two years one, or one single intire year by the name of two years, and those two the <hi>first</hi> year and the second, the old year and the New year, because there is two parts, two periods, two halves in that one year, whereof one is Antecedent to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which <hi>Py-bald</hi> Bull, <hi>Bipartite</hi> business, odd conceited one-two, or sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple duple is both ridiculous, improper and impossible.</p>

               <p>They are called two Covenants in regard of the double outward dispensation, and different administration thereof, though the Covenant be one and the same, <hi>and so saith Mr.</hi> Marshall <hi>p. 8.9.10. of his Sermon,</hi> viz.</p>
               <p>The Covenant of grace for substance hath been alwaies one and the same, though not for the Manner of administration so p. <hi>12.</hi> The externall admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Covenant is not the same with us <hi>(saith he)</hi> as it was with them, but the Covenant is the same, they were under the same misery by nature, had the same Christ, the lamb slain from the beginning of the world, the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of faith and repentance to be made partakers of the Covenant, the same graces promised in the Covenant, circumcising the heart to love the Lord &amp;c.

               <p>That the Covenant of grace is for substance not two but in all ages one and the same within it self who denies? but what then? is it therefore one and the same with another, that most manifestly, and downrightly differs from it, and is as distinct a covenant also as that within it self? for so verily the law, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so called the first covenant, or the Covenant of Circumcision, was varying won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully from that Gospel Covenant, whereof yet we confesse is to be the type, in both its Priesthood and People, its Mediator and Attonement, sacrifices and offerings, precepts and promises, inheritance and heirs, birth-priviledges and seed, ordinances and their subjects, and all things thereunto pertaining: I say they were very divers each from other, saving still that one was to shadow out the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>viz. Moses the</hi> Mediator, <hi>Ioshua</hi> the Saviour, <hi>Aaron</hi> the High-Priest, and his burnt offerings, for that temporal annuall Attonement, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1, 2. and purgation from fleshly impurities, were all to point our Christ, who is all this spiritually, <hi>viz.</hi> the Mediator, Saviour, High-Priest, Sacrifice, and author of eternal Attonement between God and us, and purification of our Consciences in the Gospel; those earthly promises and inheritance were to represent our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, their fleshly heirship, birth-priviledges, seed, and admission of new born babes to ordinances, to shadow out what high born heirs those babes are, who are begotten to the faith, and their right and title to a standing in the Gospel Church.</p>
               <p>O but saies Mr. <hi>Marshall,</hi> they had the same Gospel Covenant that we have,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:109011:138"/>
the same Christ, the same conditions, i. e. faith and repentance &amp;c.</p>
               <p>First, take notice that with him faith and repentance are the conditions on which persons stood then, and ever before, and do now in the Gospell Covenant which things he knowes infants have not, and therefore are not by right to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly inchurched, and incovenanted under the Gospel. till they visibly appear to have them, yet under the Law they were in covenant, and inchurched for all that and why? because faith and repentance were not the conditions of that Church-covenant and ordinances, nor of heirsh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, but what if they had the same Gospel Covenant, that we have, held forth to them, at least in a darker way, will it follow therefore that they had not also another Covenant over and above that peculiar to themselves, which we have not, whereof circumcision was a token, and which believing Gentiles, much less their seed have nought to do with at all? I trow not, for though we grant Mr. <hi>Marshall,</hi> that they had the substance of the Gospel among them, as also <hi>Adam, Noah,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> had, and the same priviledges of that Covenant that we have (excepting some circumstances of it, wherein we are beyond them) that will not run <hi>retro</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> would fain have it)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the self same priviledges formerly made peculiar to the Iews, are now through Christ conveyed to the Gentiles</hi>: for the old Covenant pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges <hi>viz.</hi> the fleshly birth holiness, and heirship to <hi>Canaan,</hi> and title to be sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as heirs, upon a meer natural descent are such as the best Gentiles, and best believers seed in the world can lay no claim to, for that was (as we see Gen. 17.) a distinct proper Covenant to themselves, as the fleshly seed of <hi>Abraham, Isaac and Iacob,</hi> whom the spiritual seed themselves have (as such) no right to partake with in their inheritance or earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> as this fleshly seed (as meerly such) have no right to partake with the other in their heavenly <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi>

               <p>As I grant the Covenant of Grace, which promises eternal life on conditions (as Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> confesses) of only faith and repentance, to be for substance for ever the same within it self, so I grant that the other covenant <hi>viz.</hi> all those external pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of outward blessings, which were to be enjoyed by the Iews in <hi>Canaan,</hi> in case of their obedience, was a certain outward administration, and lively type of that inward and true covenant of grace, yet still must it be regranted by Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> and all men, that even that was a true, real, and really distinct cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant also of it self, and though that were a plain picture, and a map of the other, and as it were a different dresse wherewith it was clothed upon, and wherein it was exhibited to the world, yet was it not onely an administration of the Gospel, but also an entire covenant, so substantially divided from that, as that its most properly denominated another covenant, and not that, and they both are truly denominated to be two viz. an old and new one, a first, and a second, which they
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:109011:138"/>
could not genuinely be, unless one were more then meerly another form and manner of administration or the other.</p>
               <p>Nay seriously if that Gospel covenant, which both you and wee say is one and the same in substance, onely admitted variation in its circumstances, doth mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply it self answerably to the number of those different clothings, which that one body hath successively come forth in, and must be as multifariously expressed, as it hath shewed it self in various habits to our view, and bear the names of two, of first and second, old and new from its severall and remarkable periods and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations: then sith there hath been not two onely, but as you say truely your selves, four rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And howbeit that was a kind of administration of this, that the map, this the main thing meant by it, that the picture, this the person represented, that the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing this the body, at that time set forth gloriously thereby, yet all this denies not but that that map, that picture, that clothing, that glorious administration was also (as it is also called a distinct Covenant within it self, which though it stood truly for a time, yet because also as a type of what should be under Christ, is now utterly <unclear>abrogated</unclear>, utterly <unclear>nullified</unclear> together with the holinesse of all its most glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous holy ordinances, whereof circumcision was a chief one, and in infancy to be dispensed, and with the holinesse of all their holy things, and their holy persons also i. e. the whole race of the Iews to all their posterities, which holy persons Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> (wellfare his heart for it) in that clause I now answer to, confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to be a type, must consequently confesse their holinesse to be totally taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way now the truth is come in, and not translated from that holy people to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Gentiles and their seed: for these can have none of the holinesse of that old Covenant now, which yet you will needs have to be no more but a bare administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the new.</p>
               <p>And lastly take it to be but so, you will gain by it no smal disadvantage to your cause: for though you yield it not to be point blank another Covenant, yet if you yield it to be another administration of the Gospel Covenant, divers from this we are now under, you grant us enough as to our present purpose, yea as much as we need to desire, for our dispute is not now to the Covenant it self so much, as to its manner of administration; so that let that covenant and this be as much one as they will, yet if the manner of administrations of the Gospel Covenant in its out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ordinances, were then (as you say) unlike to what they are now, you give us no lesse by your own argument then even all that we contend for, for the very thing you plead from the consideration of that <hi>Identity,</hi> which is dreamed by you to be in the Covenant, is an <hi>Identity</hi> in the manner of administration of ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces under both the law and the Gospel: for whoever shall say that the manner of administration of baptism under the Gospel must be as the manner of administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of circumcision was under the law, and in proof thereof shall say the Covenant
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:109011:139"/>
of the Law and Gospel is one and the same, though the manner of administration be different, <hi>suo se ingulabit gladio,</hi> will even quite cut the throat of his own cause, yet thus plainly doth Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> speak p. 12. of his Ser. viz. <hi>Now this external administration of the covenant is not the same with us, as it was with them but the Covenant is the same.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But is it so <hi>Sirs</hi>? so you say it seems as well as we; then you have brought your hoggs to a fair Market indeed, for it the externall administration, which was then be, as to the manner of it, different from that which is now, then I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what pattern you can pick from that manner of administration, whereby to steer your cause now, and to direct your selves about the true manner of this: for will any wise man in any w<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>If any man then ask me this question, viz. sith the Gospel covenant is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly the same for substance, and little children under the law received circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion the seal as you call it, of the Gospel covenant, why then should not little children under the Gospel receive baptism, the seal (so I hear you say) of the Gospel covenant? and why should not this administration of the covenant in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ordinances be after the manner of that of old?</p>
               <p>I answer him out of Mr. <hi>Marshalls</hi> own mouth thus, <hi>because</hi> though for substance the Gospel Covenant be ever one and the same, yet the manner of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal administration thereof, is not the same with us as twas with them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are not to take example in our Dispensations, and administrations by them, nor regard to do after the manner of them, the Priest-hood being chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of necessity there is a change also of the Law, for the administrators are not the same with us, as with them, nor the administrations the same in matter, nor the manner of administration to them the same, nor the subjects to whom these administrations belong the same, for those were to all the holy Jewes, though never so unholy and unbelieving, but these to Jewes and Gentiles as they believe and no otherwise: least of all is the subject of circumcision and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism the same, for that above all the rest was limitted to all males, and those on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at eight daies old, this extending to males and females, and those only when they professe to be believers.</p>

            <div type="section">

               <p>Circumcision was a more Evangelical administration: hen the rest, as being given when the Gospel was preached to <hi>Abraham 430</hi> years before the Law, therefore we may give the more heed to that, sith it is of the Fathers and more then to the other ordinances, which by institution were more immediately of <hi>Moses.</hi>

               <p>Though it were in being so long before <hi>Moses,</hi> yet was it as directly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his law as any other administration what-ever, for howbeit it was before him, yet it is said to be of him, as all the Sacrifices also were, which were of old before circumcision, because he gave them all anew, and plainer promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and was Mediator of all that old Testament service, which ended in <hi>Christ,</hi> and was even from the very beginning.</p>
               <p>Moreover, Though the Gospel Covenant was preached in a type to <hi>Abraham</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. where circumcision was also first appointed, yet that in reference to which Circumcision of the flesh was there instituted, was immediately that first and old

(<hi>quid rides</hi>? such folk as those, though some are ashamed to say they see, yet some are not ashamed to say are to be seen in the world) or doth it signifie such as are true believers indeed? which of the two think you doth it expresse, such persons at years onely, as are in the faith, or onely the natural fleshly seed of such? or if you say both, that that one phrase <hi>viz.</hi> they which be of faith should express two kinds of persons, so differently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended of two so different births <hi>viz.</hi> believers themselves born of God by faith in Christ, and also the meer fleshly seed of believers, who are no higher born then of their bodies, is so far from truth, that it is more then flat folly to conceive it</p>
               <p>And if you mean it not of their being <hi>Abrahams</hi> children really by faith, so as thereupon to be assured heirs of salvation, but of their being counted of the faith, so as to outward membership in the Church onely, tis plain that Gal. 3.7.9. speaks of such onely as are truly in the faith i. e. faithful as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, so as to be not onely outwardly inchurched, but eternally saved also, as none can say all believers children are, some of them proving wretches when they come to years, for <hi>as many as be of faith</hi> (saith he) i. e. faithful as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, are blessed, and shall be justified and saved <hi>with faithful Abraham,</hi> whose faith was imputed to him for righteousnesse, as faith shall be imputed to us also <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.22.23. if we believe on him that raised up Iesus from the dead &amp;c. answerable to that also is <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26.29. <hi>ye are all the children of God by faith in Iesus Christ, &amp; if ye be Christs</hi> i. e. by faith, <hi>then are ye</hi> Abrahams seed, <hi>and heirs according to the promise</hi> i. e. the promise not of the law or old covenant, or earthly <hi>Canaan</hi> (for the <hi>Galatians</hi> were never heirs according to that) nor yet of meer membership and participation of ordinances in the Church, thats more pertaining to the precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory then the promissory part of the Gospel, but of the eternall inheritance it self, which is made not onely to believers and their seed, as you lace it up, but to all men and their seed, on terms of believing and comming in at Gods call, and made good to as many as are so effectually called, so that they obtain the promise of that eternal inheritance indeed: compare <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. with <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. answerable to that also is <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.7.8. where its said in a figure that as the seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> himself by <hi>Ishmael</hi> were not children of God i. e. as to the old Covenant, so as to be counted heirs of that <hi>Canaan</hi> and members of that Church, though they were his true seed, and the children of his flesh as well as <hi>Isaac</hi> was, because <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saac</hi> onely and his seed were the children of that promise <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.19.20.21. <hi>for in Isaac shall thy seed</hi> (saith he) <hi>be called; the children of Abrahams flesh,</hi> the <hi>Ishmaelites, these are not the children of God</hi> in the old legal sense, <hi>but the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the promise are counted for the seed,</hi> so even the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saac</hi> himself are not at all children i. e. the children of God as to the new covenant, so as to be counted heirs of the Gospel <hi>Canaan,</hi> and members in the Gospel church, though they were his true seed and children of his flesh as well as Christ was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ onely and his seed are the children of this promise, for in <hi>Christ</hi> who was the true <hi>Isaac</hi> of whom the other was but the type, must <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed now be called i. e. they that are the children of the flesh onely, whether of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> or of any other man in the world, these are not now (as of old the fleshly seed of <hi>Abpaham Isaac and Iacob</hi> were) the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted now for the seed.</p>
               <p>Tis true, to <hi>Abraham and his seed the Gospel promises were made</hi> as well as those of the law, but mark it, <hi>he saith not unto seeds</hi> in plurali, <hi>as of many, but of one, and to thy seed</hi> in singulari, <hi>that is Christ</hi> Gal. 3.16. of whom being born by faith we are his seed, to whom in and with him the promise is made, for as the believer himself as a believer i. e. as <hi>Abrahams</hi> spiritual seed had no share
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:109011:140"/>
in the old covenant promise i. e. <hi>Canaan,</hi> if not descended from him by <hi>Isaac</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the flesh, because to <hi>Abraham</hi> and that fleshly seed onely (in a type of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, and yet truly too) those promises were made, so a believers fleshly seed, as barely a believers seed, though born of believing <hi>Abrahams</hi> own body, as the Iews are at this day (and thats a higher birth one should think to entitle to the Gospel, if any fleshly birth could do it, then to be born of our Protestant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers) have no share in this new Covenant promise, if not born (as I may say) of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Isaac</hi> i. e. <hi>Christ</hi> after the faith. or by faith in <hi>Christ,</hi> and so personally, even every individual for himself, not <hi>Catervatim,</hi> or <hi>domestica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim,</hi> whole families, whole nations of parents and children at once ingraffed as branches upon the root, and spirituallized into that stock or family of <hi>Abraham</hi> i. e. the visible Church in which his own natural branches, much more any other mans meer naturall branches, can have no place now, any further then as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to believe.</p>
               <p>Indeed the natural branches stood of right upon meer fleshly birth of believing <hi>Abraham</hi> without faith, so long as that fleshly birth-priviledge lasted, and could give a standing, and till the time of faith, and standing there by personal faith one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came, and then they were broken off indeed because of unbelief, yet not nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally as you say, i. e. the whole body for the unbelief of some <hi>viz.</hi> the persons of the children through allages, for the infidelity of the parents, for its evident that as many as believed, and those were not a few, when the rest were rejected, were then and thereupon admitted <hi>Act.</hi> 2.</p>

As long as the law lasted they did remain in the Church by being circumcised; and observing the rites and ceremonies of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:109011:141"/>
the Law, though they did remain in unbelief, but when the time of faith was come <hi>Gal. 3.25.</hi> then they were no longer in the Covenant, and Church by observing the rites and Ceremonies of the Law, which they entered into by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, but now they were broken off through unbelief: which notes out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us that the standing in that Church before Christ in time of the Law, and the standing in this Church since Christ in time of the Gospel is upon different grounds, for the standing in that Church was by being circumcised, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the rites and ceremonies of the Law; but the standing in this Church is by faith, and being baptized into the same faith <hi>Act. 2.38.41. Joh. 4.1. Gal. 3.26, 27. Rom, 11.20.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And it is to be noted that the Iewes, the same people that were circumcised, and in covenant with Abraham according to the flesh, and thereby members of the Iewish Church could not be the visible church according to the Gospell, unless they did manifest faith, and so be in covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the spirit, and baptized into the same faith.</p>
                     <p>Whereas if the Covenant now under Christ were the same that was before Christ with Abraham and his posterity in the flesh, then by the same right they possessed circumcision and the Iewish Church state, they must possesse this since Christ, which they could not do, therefore it is not the same.</p>
                     <p>It is true therefore that the Covenant of God makes the Church both in time of the Law, and Gospel too, for the Church is nothing else but a people in covenant with God, now look how the covenant differs so the Church and people differs which is made by it, and which enter into it.</p>
                     <p>Now the Covenant, whereby God took a people outwardly to be his people then, was that, whereby they did, being circumcised, participate of all those outward meanes which led to Christ, which was to come, <hi>Psal. 149.19.20.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Covenant, whereby he takes a people outwardly to be his people now, whereby they are admitted to be baptized, is that profession they make of faith in Christ <hi>Acts 8.12.37.

                     </p>
                     <p>Indeed it is true that Christ is and ever was the Mediator and Means of salvation, and also that all those that were saved, were saved through faith in him both before and since his comming: But yet because the outward means of making Christ known doth differently depend upon his being yet to come, and upon his being come in the flesh; the one being more dark, the other more plain, the one more carnall, the other more spirituall, therefore the participation of these meanes doth make the state of the participants to differ.</p>

               <p>In the time therefore before Christ (saith he) such as would circumcise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and their males, and observe the Law in the rites, and ceremonies ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, together with their children by generation were the seed and in covenant with that Church, but now since Christ, only such as believe in Christ, and are thereby
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:109011:141"/>
children by regeneration, are the seed and in covenant with this Church, and this he proves further yet.</p>
               <p>First, Because <hi>None of the Natural seed of</hi> Abraham <hi>are in the Covenant by vertue of any natural relation, though they did remain in the Iewish Church till the death of Christ, and as that Church then ceased so their being in the Church by an natural relation ceased also</hi> Act. 10.28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.8. Gal. 5.28.31—3.7, 8, 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>14.16.19.26.28, 29.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, The Gentiles have no natural relation to become</hi> Abrahams <hi>seed by, therefore a believers child cannot become the seed of</hi> Abraham <hi>by being the seed of a believer, unless such children do believe themselves, and cannot otherwise in no respect be participants in the covenant made with</hi> Abraham <hi>p.</hi> 14, 15.</p>
               <p>And again p. 18. <hi>No Gentile</hi> (saith he) <hi>is Abrahams seed at all but by believing the righteousnesse of faith, allthough he be the child of believing pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now therefore because you tell us not only,</p>
               <p>First that believers children in infancy are <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, though they yet do not the works of <hi>Abraham,</hi> i. e. believe not on him that justifyes them, as some of you dote they do, but also,</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the promise of the Gospel is to believers and their seed.</p>
               <p>These both are abundantly confuted by that quotation of mine, which quotes more Scripture then you will ever answer, so that I wonder you blush not to shoot out so boldly two such blind, and unsound assertions together, the second of which I shall say no more to, it being virtually answered by what is more formally spoken to the first &amp; also because I have shewed so undeniably above, that I know your consciences must yield to it, and that from this <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. whence you would wre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t a proof to the contrary, that the promise, if you take it for the profer of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Grace, is to all men in the world, every creature, and so not to believers and their seed only, but to all unbelievers and their seed also, in case they shall believe, for he conditionats the promise on calling, for such these were, whom <hi>Peter</hi> spake to, whilst he was yet speaking that very word to them, <hi>viz.</hi> the promise is to you and your children; but if you take it for the thing promised, which is not Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership and participation of baptism, as some say whose absurdity therein I have declared, but the spirit, remission of sins, and salvation, this is made, good al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to the believer himself; and it is mercie enough to him that it is so I think, but not at all to his seed for his sake, nor his faiths sake, for if it be I testify his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren need no faith of their own: nay more God never made promise to save any of believing <hi>Abrahams</hi> natural seed, without faith in themselves for <hi>Abrahams</hi> sake, as neerly as he took <hi>Abraham</hi> to be his friend; for even he had sin enough of his own to have sunck him, if the same Mediator that saves any of his seed, in that way of faith, had not mercifully saved him the same way, nor yet for <hi>Abrahams</hi> faiths sake, for that merited not salvation for them, nor was it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental, but faith only in themselves, to any one of his sonnes salvation, for every one must bear his own burden, if Christ bear it not, and the just must live by his faith, and not his fathers, neither did he ever promise for his faiths sake to give faith to his natural seed as his, for then they must all have had it (<hi>qua sic</hi> including <hi>de omni,</hi> and being <hi>universale summum</hi>) or God should ly which he cannot; neither could God blame them (as he doth) for unbelief, but himself, without whom (say you they could not believe &amp; who had promised to make them believe and did not; though yet he promised to circumcise i. e. by his spirit to sanctify the hearts of his spiritual seed, as well as his own i. e. all such as believe, and are in the faith with him, for the promise being still sure to all the seed, which it is made to they all must be blessed with faithful <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if God, who made the old Covenant promise of the earthly <hi>Canaan</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his fleshly seed, did not make the Gospel promise to him and
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:109011:142"/>
his fleshly seed, but onely that seed of his that believes with him, can we think that he made that promise to the Gentile believer, and his fleshly seed, for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers sake, unlesse he have faith of his own?</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Babist.</head>
               <p>No we do not say without respect to his own faith, but as the believers seed shall believe, so its made to him, as well as to his parents.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Baptist.</head>
               <p>So its made to the unbeliever and his seed also <hi>viz.</hi> as they shall believe, as well as to either of the other, and by that account you may baptize all the world.</p>
               <p>Again, none of the Jews, though the natural seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and partakers of all the ordinances of the old testament (as <hi>Abrahams</hi> children) could be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be baptized upon that same natural relation, though they pleaded it never so stiffly <hi>Mat.</hi> 3 but only on manifestation of amendment, besides that 3000 converts should not baptize their children, when they were baptized themselves, as <hi>Abraham</hi> by command took all his males, and cirmumcised them the self same day with himself, argues plainly that both the covenant and the promise (as Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> saies truly) as to the manner of administration was now changed, and not continued to parents and children both alike, but as they both alike believed.</p>
               <p>And that these were not baptized with their parents, I take Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> at his word, who (as I have shewed before) confesses it, and if he should not stand to his testimonie herein, yet these words <hi>viz. as many as glady received the word were baptized,</hi> which exclude infants, and were an imperfect relation, if he meant not onely them that received the word, are so cogent that they cannot but compell him.</p>
               <p>So I have escaped two of your bullets, and as for the third <hi>viz.</hi> that the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which is a better Covenant, would be far worse, if believers children be not counted in it, and have not right to baptism, and membership as well as the Iews children, and be valued but as Turks and Pagans, this is so sick of the same dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease of absurdity with the rest, that I fear not its doing much execution: besides, we have lamed it before, having told you before, and proved it too, and now will again, that the exclusion of the fleshly seed from this Covenant and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, which was taken into the first, doth not lessen or straiten the grace of God under it at all, nor render this covenant worse then the first contrary to <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. the place twice quoted by you, where its called a better, for the meliority there spoken of of this covenant above that, lies not so much in the extension of the grace of it to such subjects, as in the meliority of its promises, for this is a better covenant still then the other, who ere it belongs or belongs not to, forasmuch as it makes better promises then the other <hi>viz.</hi> of a heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> and all spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al blessings in and by Iesus through faith, when that promised an earthly <hi>Canaan</hi> onely, and certain temporal blessings therein, on performance of those tedious ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of the law.</p>
               <p>Tis true, theirs in this sense, and thus farre was a Covenant of great grace too, as twas made freely to that people above other nations (for he did not so to any people else) concerning outward benefits, and such statutes and judgements, as should on their observation of them, not onely continue them therein, but as a shadow, type and schoolmaster conduct them to this: yet greater is the glory of the Gospel covenant, which now is, so that the other had no glory in respect of this glory that excelleth, therefore the grace of God under the covenant, to them that are under it, is greater also.</p>
               <p>Besides, if you speak not onely of the <hi>intention,</hi> but <hi>extension</hi> of the grace of God in this Covenant, and in the administration of it too, it goes beyond the other, for not only is the Gospel a clearer promulgation of the eternal covenant,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:109011:142"/>
then that typical covenant was, whereby the glory of it may be seen more plainly, and with open face, then when it was seen onely in the type as a thing to come (for we preach <hi>Christum exhibitum</hi> Christ crucified, a sacrifice already offered, and baptize and break bread in token hereof, but they (and that in much dimnesse too) <hi>Christum exhibendum,</hi> a <hi>Messiah</hi> to come, he was veiled, though seen through the veil in the old, but revealed in this new dispensation) but also it is of larger extent in respect of the subject to which it belongs, for the revelation of it by preaching, and real proferring of the grace of it in the name of God (who is not willing that any should perish, and fail of his grace unlesse they will) is to all people in the world: the old administration of circumcision, and other perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of that covenant, which was the type of this, was limitted and narrowed into a little corner, the land of Israel, the people of the Iews, yea more the very new covenant administration that we are now under, as preaching, baptizing &amp;c. while the old covenant did continue (as it did for two or three year after the beginning of this by <hi>Iohn,</hi> till <hi>Christ</hi> crucified) was streitned exceedingly above what it is among us, for saith <hi>Christ</hi> then, <hi>go not into any way of the Gentiles,</hi> but now since Christ crucified its extended freely to every nation, and every person in it of capacity, of years to receive it (and till then (dying before) they shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be damned for rejecting it) without any exception, as they believe, for <hi>go</hi> (saith he) <hi>into all the world &amp;c.</hi> Mark. 16 Mat. 28. then circumcision was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to males among the Iews, but Christ and baptism is to Jew and Gentile, male and female without difference as they believe, so that the grace is rather length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the administration of baptism by taking in the females, that were not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised, then straitned by the denial of it to infants in their infancy onely, for even those also may be baptized too if they will, when they come to years: the grace of the new covenant therefore is even thus as well as otherwise better then the old, in respect of the extent of it, and its administration also to more subjects, for the Jews onely were the subjects of that grace, and heirs by promise of the earth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly <hi>Canaan,</hi> but all the world are heirs of heaven by promise according as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe the Gospel,</p>
               <p>Besides, if you think that ever God took the whole body of that nation Israel, that belonged all to the typical salvation of the old covenant, into the covenant of everlasting salvation by Christ in relation to their fathers faith without their own, and thence conclude that the whole body of believers seed must be by faith of their parents admitted into that same Covenant of the Gospel, this is a meer <hi>Chimaera</hi> of your own brain, for no such grace of God as this (though some priests of the Iews dreamed of it as well as you, for which they were pretty well curried by <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Mat.</hi> 3. <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.) ever was, now is, or ever shall be.</p>
               <p>As for our valuing believers infants as Turks and Pagans, I tell you we rate them higher then your selves, for we set them not so low as Turks and Pagans that are at years, and wicked, for they though not without many possibilities of life by Christ, yet dying imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Here you drive on four deep, and against a four fold assault, make a four fold repulse, pelting us a main, but with pellets of brown paper.</p>
               <p>To the first I reply, no more need they be taught at circumcision, but the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized are commanded to be taught first, untill they believe <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15.16. and also immediately after, which is so plain, that though here you answer by denying all possibility of childrens being taught before circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, yet else where <hi>viz.</hi> p. 10. and 18. you fence this off with such prety con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary quiddy stuff as this, <hi>viz.</hi> that as to baptism <hi>infants have a teaching, a hearing and a learning, for the spirit</hi> say you <hi>opens their ears,</hi> quo magistro, quam cito discitur quod docet: <hi>he doth it in them, and in adultis too, or else for all their hearing theyl not believe:</hi> but that we shal have more to say to when we come to it,</p>
               <p>To the second that as unwilling as infants were to receive circumcision, and as tedious as it was to them, or servants either that received it, yet by express command if they were Males in <hi>Abrahams</hi> house, he was to dispense it to them, whether they were willing or no, but you have no such flat command to disease your little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants so far as to dip them in water (for so you should if you baptizd them indeed) whether they will or no.</p>
               <p>To the third O wonderful! that <hi>Abrahams</hi> own fleshly seed, even by <hi>Isanc</hi> himself, by bare descent from their bodies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unlesse they also believed as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> did, could become, and be counted no more then bare <hi>semen carnis,</hi> the children of <hi>Abrahams</hi> flesh, &amp; have right by promise <hi>(qua sic)</hi> of no more then the earthly Canaan, <hi>For Ishmael</hi> though born of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and circumcised also as a male of his house, was not heir by promise of so much as that <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.19.20, 21. and yet that the fleshly seed of believing Gentiles should become and be accounted no less then <hi>Abrahams semen fidei,</hi> the children of his faith, and such high heirs thereby, as have right to the heavenly Canaan.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith it seems doth not priviledge his own natural seed, so far as to be his seed in a spiritual relation, but the faith of every Gentile priviledges his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural seed, so far as to be spiritually the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi>: but Sirs me thinks if any fleshly descent in the world could dignify the seed so descended with the high name of the spiritual seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and heirs with him according to the heavenly promise, a fleshly descent from <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> should do it, yet even that meerly, without more, makes the seed no more then the na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tural seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and heirs with him of only the earthly promise. Yea, Sirs, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed is shut out from all spiritual kindred to their own faithful father <hi>Abraham,</hi> notwithstanding the faith of that their Father, unlesse they believe also themselves, and yet our seed who are but Gentiles after the flesh are so specially, so spiritually a kin to <hi>Abraham</hi> by the faith of us their fathers, without their own, is not only to equallize our seed with <hi>Abrahams,</hi> which is the utmost you pretend to, but rather to reckon it as a higher race then that of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams,</hi> a matter which the most capacious brain pan of you all is no way ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable clearly to conjecture.</p>
               <p>To the fourth that circumcision was not voided by the Jewes after infidelity, for twas not set on supposition they had faith, neither was it after voided by their proving <hi>Reprobates,</hi> for it was not set to signify them to be Gods elect, they being not so at all (as Jewes I mean) as to eternal life, but only to that earthly life in

               <p>The reason of these objections against paedobaptism is this, because they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not the nature of baptism, it is Gods seal, he sets it, they that receive it are passive, in that he appoints it to be set to whomsoever he hath made the promise, and with whom he hath entered into covenant: A seal of an estate made to infants in their cradles is firm, so is God's: Now here must be a seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the other side, for both parties must seal in a Covenant, we seal when we believe, <hi>John 3.33.</hi> The Covenant is sealed on both sides when faith comes, God may set to his seal as he did to many of the Iewes, and the seed made void to them through unbelief. The End of Gods setting it to such as he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw would have no benefit of it, is the same with the making of his promises, and sending of his Sonne, to let them know how he would have received them, how sure his mercies should have been unto them, but they would not.</p>

               <p>The reason of all your <hi>Objectations</hi> against our way of baptism, and pleas for <hi>Paedo-Rantism</hi> which you practise is this, you understand not the nature of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism: it is not Gods seal which he sets (which you sillily suppose) for that is his spirit only as I shewed you plainly enough above, but Gods <hi>sign</hi> which man sets, which they that receive aright, are not altogether passive in, but voluntary, and very active; i. e. confessing their sins, calling on the name of the Lord, desiring to be baptized, professing faith in order thereunto, going down in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o the water with the dispenser, and there setting their senses and understandings on work upon the sign, and things thereby signified, submitting their bodies freely to the dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Neither doth God appoint it to be set to whomsoever he hath barely made the promise, for in the word preached he makes it to every Creature <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15.16. but to such as professedly believe in that promise he hath made, and visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, verily (for ought we can judge) have entered into covenant with him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come obedient, such only (so far as it is possible for us to know) are those, with whom he hath entred into Covenant, for say you, <hi>there must be a sealing on the other side, and both parties must seal in a Covenant we seal when</hi> (and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) we <hi>believe:</hi> neither is the Covenant sealed on both sides, so that it can be said these two parties are now entertained into covenant each with other, till faith come and that is not in infancy but after.</p>
               <p>And this your manner of speech; <hi>viz. when faith comes,</hi> here implies to be your own opinion as well as ours, though else where as p. 3.4.8.9.15.16.17.18.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:109011:144"/>
19. you strenuously contend it, yea and (to say the truth) tis well nigh the whole businese of your book to assert and assay to prove it, that faith comes to infants in their infancy, and to make it appear to us (as well as you can by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction) that infants do believe.</p>
               <p>Moreover, (if ever men were troubled with the <hi>simples,</hi> I think you are) is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism Gods seal of an estate, i. e. the heavenly inheritance made over to infants in their cradels? and is that seal of his firm to, i. e, so sure that it cannot fail? then I wonder how that seal, (for so you still stile circumcision and baptism) is made void and infirm to so many Iews and Christian people as it is, for not all, yea few of many do obtain that estate at last, and that most lose it for all that seal, you tell us by their unbelief: but I had thought you had been of the mind, when you wrote your 4th page, that children of Iews, and of believing parents did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all without any exception; for asserting it there positively that the Iews chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren did believe, and consequently that believers children do now, you prove the Antecedent <hi>viz.</hi> that the Iews children did believe, because God did witnesse it by setting to his seal circumcision, which if it were Gods seal to them of their eternall salvation by faith, and witnesse to the world that they had faith also, that seal must be firm, and that testimony true concerning them all, being set to all as well as some, so that unlesse they depart from the faith, which you say God who cannot ly, witnessed they once had (and that your principle of not falling from faith will in no wise give way too) they could not possibly void it by unbelief, and so must necessarily and universally obtain the inheritance: but sith tis most clear you selves also yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it, that they do not, therefore assuredly one of these must be true <hi>viz.</hi> either that circumcision was not to infants in their cradels Gods seal of their eternal sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation (as you say it was) or else that that seal of God is not firm (as you attest it is) or else that God did not witnesse by it that those to whom it was set had faith (as you say he did) or else that Gods witnesse and testimony was not true (which were blasphemy to think) or else that they fell from that faith, which at first they had in infancy; and at the time of their circumcision (and that self confutes you in another case) among all which grant which you will to be true, you must contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict and convict your selves of falshood.</p>
               <p>And lastly, if the end of Gods setting baptism to persons be no other then the very same with that of making his promises, and sending his son, meerly to let them know how he would have received them, how sure his mercies should have been unto them, but they would not, (not to speak of your telling truth here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares <hi>viz.</hi> that mans own will rejecting God first, and not Gods own will first rejecting them without respect to their fore-seen rejection of him in time, is the true cause of their condemnation) then as God makes his promises to all, and sends his son in his love a Saviour to all, so baptism should be dispensed to all without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, belonging as well as Christ himself, tell they appear finally to reject him, to every one as well as any one in the world, but that being denied by both you and us, doth shew that the end of baptizing a person is somewhat more <hi>viz.</hi> not to beget him to the faith before he doth, but to improve him in it when he doth believe.</p>
               <p>To conclude, this whole train of stuff or long tail of that short shower of shot that went before it, is not of so much force as a scottish mist, nor scarce e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to wet a naked man to the skin, therefore bear with my folly in sheelding my self so much against it, i. e. in saying so much in answer to it, for a wise man would have said no more to it but <hi>mumm.</hi>

               <p>The third argument is this.</p>
               <p>Those that have the holy spirit, that have faith, the Anabaptists will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but are the subjects of baptism, but children have so, as their justification

declares, without which there is no salvation.</p>
               <p>Hence it is that the adversaries are put to their shifts to finde out a new way for the salvation of infants, dying in their minority <hi>viz.</hi> The presentment of the satisfaction of Christ without faith, otherwise they conclude they could not be saved; which invention of theirs destroies the Gospel covenant, which is the righteousnesse of faith, and either damns innumerable innocents, whose right to the kingdom of heaven our Saviour hath declared; or grounds their salvation upon a figment of their own brains, such as the Scriptures are wholly silent in, and the Churches of God never dreamed of.</p>
               <p>They alleadge two texts for their proof, <hi>Rom. 5.18. As by the offence of one judgement came upon all to condemnation, so by the righteousnesse of one the free-gift came upon all men unto justification of life, Rom. 11.7. Election hath obtained it:</hi> of which two texts, the latter is nothing for them, for it excludes not justification, for the Apoctle saith plainly, <hi>Rom. 8.30. Those whom he predestinated he justified</hi>: and though the elect onely shall be saved, yet justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation goes between.</p>
               <p>The former is directly against them, for it expressely mentions justification of life: so that the Anabaptists must either prove that justification is not to go before salvation, and so pull in pieces the golden chain, by taking out the link, <hi>Rom. 8.38.</hi> or else that justification is not by faith, and so destroy the Covenant of the Gospel; till when, they justly deserve the censure of damning all infants dying, contrary to evident testimony of Scriptures, and the sentence of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, that to them belongeth the kingdeme of heaven.</p>
               <p>And whosoever shall consider the impertinences of their proofs in a cause of so great consequence, shall have just cause to suspect all their other doctrines, and take heed how to take any thing upon trust from these new masters.</p>

               <p>As for the two texts you say are brought in proof of justification of infants with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith <hi>viz. Rom.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7. who urges the last of them I know not, for my part I take it to be of no tendency at all either to your purpose or ours, therefore I shall not trouble my self with it, but the first of them, which you say is so directly against us, tis because you are blind, if you do not perceive it to be an express downright declaration of a general justification of all from <hi>Adams</hi> sin, as to life, i. e. a resurrection from that bodily death, which that sin brought upon all mankind, and from which as there is now a universal return of every individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al by Christ, so there had never bin any returning for any one man in the world, but by Christ to all eternity world without end, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.21.22.</p>
               <p>Yea as universally as that judgement or condemnation to that first death came by <hi>Adam</hi> upon all men, so that it spreads its black wings upon them all, and brings them all down to the dust from whence they came, so universally is justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation unto life i. e the benefit and resurrection from that death, from which else no one man should ever have risen, come by Christ upon all men, really and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not onely so, but a capacity also, and possibility of eternal happinesse and well being after that resurrection, and all this whether persons believe it yea or no, yea and a promise and certainty of it in case of belief in this Christ, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise indeed a losse of the Resurrections becoming a mercy, and benefit to them, and a lyablenesse even after that escape of the first death, that came by the first <hi>Adam,</hi> to a sorer, even that second death, that lake of fire, which by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam,</hi> by whom comes eternal blessednesse on believers, comes upon all unbelievers, and that for ever.</p>
               <p>So that if there be no salvation to infants without justification, yet thers justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of infants without faith, or baptism either.</p>
               <p>And whereas you argue from the cart to the horse, from the justification and salvation of infants to their faith, I argue from their non capacity to believe to their justification and salvation without it: no salvation or justification without faith, say you, but infants are justified and saved therefore they believe: if no justification and salvation without faith, say I, infants, who cannot believe can
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:109011:146"/>
neither be justified nor saved: but infants, so farre as they need justification, for they have no sins of their own, are justified and saved also, for the kingdome of heaven belongs to them, therefore there is justification and salvation for infants without faith.</p>
               <p>To conclude therefore: this opinion of you adversaries to the truth, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows no salvation to infants without faith, puts you miserably to your shifts <hi>viz.</hi> either to find out a new way of coming by faith, which <hi>Paul</hi> saies comes onely by hearing, or else to damn innumerable dying infants, who whilest they lived, were uncapable to hear the word preached, and so to believe, or else<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as you do p. 18. to dream out a new kind of hearing, whereby infants come by their faith, <hi>viz.</hi> an inward, wonderful miraculous hearing of some voice of the spirit within, such a sigment of your own brains, as the Scripture is wholly silent in, and no true Church of God, nor rational man, but your selves, who dream dreams, and divine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And so I have done both with the head of this third argument, and with that long tail also that trails after, there remains no more of it to be meddled with, but a certain slender sting that sticks to this tail, put forth against us, with more length then strength, in prosecution of the argument, which I shall cut out into many pieces, and after set upon each section severally, and then I hope your great hope of help from these three unworthies, will prove a <hi>forlorn hope</hi> indeed.</p>

                  </gap> it, as well as to prove the matter of it before: and whereas you say you leave the manner of the doing things when it is nor clear to you, to the spirit himself, whose the work is, in other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of faith, I wonder you are so forgetful as to bear such false witnesse as this against your selves, when as in the point of dying infants salvation, which for the matter of it is so clear, that you cannot deny it, though not clear to you in the manner, you leave not the manner of it to God himself, whose work it is to save them, but limit him to the way of Church-membership, faith, baptism, and holinesse &amp;c. whereas the word, that was not at all for infants instruction, declares to men and women what way he will save them in, asking in many places of your book, how can infants be justified without faith? how can Turks and Pagans infants be saved? what hopes of our infant salvation without baptism? and all this too, though there is no fear of their damnation by actual sin, though it also ask you plainly enough, <hi>how can they believe in him of whom they have not heard,</hi> and consequently how can they be saved by faith? though it tell you also plainly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough <hi>Act.</hi> 8. where that question is expressely askt what hinders &amp;c. even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they yet believe not with all their heart, you had said true therefore had your words bin thus <hi>viz. we do it not in other articles of faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas you say the renovation of a soul is no lesse miracle then the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of infants having faith, it seems you confesse it to be a miracle, that faith should be in infants: and for my part I fully conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

then the other: for the one is not at all, and the other where it is, is yet no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle at all, but a matter that happens ever and anon in the ordinary course of things, as a miracle doth not, and besides you are of those I am sure, who are in the mind that miracles are ceased.</p>
               <p>And lastly, for you to sprinkle all the new born infants in all the Christian na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at this hour, as taking it for granted that these all have faith (for so you sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose (though you see not any individual or particular infant hath it, that is brought to you) and yet hold infants faith to be a miracle, and yet to hold miracles to be ceased also, it is, if not <hi>miraculum,</hi> yet <hi>mirandum monstrum et horrendum,</hi> at least to me i. e. a marvelous work and a wonder that ever the wisdome of wise men should so perish, and the understanding of prudent men so come to nought.</p>
               <p>Thus having done with your forlorn hope, Ile march on now to give <hi>check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> to that wretched crew of cavillers, that are so impudent, as to be respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive against reason and its Regiment, and to undertake to make it good against them, that infants have faith, and must have baptism.</p>

               <p>Good Sirs, consider what a reasonlesse reply to reason this is.</p>
               <p>For if by faith you mean only a faculty of believing, what ever in time may be told them, which is the adaequate object of faith in general, that is in all reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creatures: and is <hi>de esse</hi> to them, universally, innate in them, as a part of the rationall soul, as well as the faculty of remembring what in time they may hear, and of willing, and chosing what in time may be propounded to them and of understanding what in time may be taught them; but what is all this to your purpose, who plead faiths being in some infants onely, not in all: when as faith in that sense is as much in all infants as in some, and would (if it could at all entitle such as have it to baptism) entitle all mankind to baptism as well as some, sith all have the faculty of believing things (as beasts which are meerly sensitive have not) flowing naturally from the rationall soul in man?</p>
               <p>But if by faith you mean restrictively, that faith in special, whose adequate object is the word of God preached, in the promise and precept of it, which one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly makes us subjects of salvation and baptism, dare you say that tis of equal neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, and certainty that faith in such a sense is in infants, as the faculty of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>For shame <hi>Sirs</hi> blot out and abjure this absurdity, for you cannot but know that the faculty of understanding in man is <hi>Habitus a naturâ innatus,</hi> a habit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred in them in very nature, yea in all mankind necessarily, <hi>&amp; qua id ipsum:</hi> but your selves say faith, in the sense in which we speak of it, is but <hi>Habitus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusus,</hi> a habit infused, and that into some only, for all say you have it not, and I say tis <hi>Habitus acquisitus,</hi> rather an acquired habit, which comes if not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the gift of God to persons therein, yet also in that way of hearing the word, which on our parts is first done, in order to its being begotten in us, whereby we come to know good and evil first, i. e. to be convinced of sin and guilt in our selves, and righteousness and mercy in God, through Jesus Christ, and then to have faith in him to justification: in this therefore <hi>Reason</hi> remains unrefuted, and rather routs you, then is routed by you.</p>

               <p>First, the faculty of not onely believing in general, but also in special of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Gospel, of believing in Christ to justification is belike as naturally, and necessarily in infants of believers, as the faculty of reason it self, so it seems by your talk, why else is that frequent analogy made by you between these two, and such frequent allusion in proof of one of them to the other, as if whosoever denies one of them <hi>viz.</hi> the grace of saving faith to be in such infants must needs also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the other, and as if whatsoever concludes against such infants being belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers concludes as much against their being reasonable creatures?

               <p>Yea verily the faculty of reason is <hi>habitus naturâ innatus</hi> and <hi>naturâ notus,</hi> a habit that comes by generation, and puts forth it self into several acts of it self, even so many as clearly testifie it to be in us before we are at capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to be taught, and whether ever we be taught any thing or no, for a <hi>specimen</hi> of reason in us must be before we begin to be endoctrinated, or else as good endoctrinate a brute creature: but justifying faith, or belief of the Gospel is such a habit of which we may not onely say (as you do truly in the next page) p. 18. that <hi>instruction of the understanding, in the object of it in some sort must <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Hoop Sirs! what pretty, cutted stuff is here? as if you did not know well enough, but that, for advantage sake to your crooked cause, you rather chuse here to seem ignorant of it, that reaching and learning is not onely for the further bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of habits that are in us into their acts, and perfecting of them in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, but also for the begetting of some habits in us that never were before <hi>viz.</hi> not natural and innate habits, as the faculty of reason and understanding, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction is not for the engendring, but improving of these in us, but all such kind of habits as faith is <hi>viz.</hi> acquired habits; teaching tends not onely, to the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of such <hi>a posteriori</hi> after they are once begun, but <hi>a priori</hi> also to the very being, and begetting of these, whether they be habits about matters of this life,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:109011:152"/>
or that to come, tis true therefore learning is to be continued for the perfecting of habits begun, and begotten in a man, otherwise indeed (as you say) one of 24 years, having once received the faith, need be taught no more, but it is to be also for the beginning and begetting of faith in him, otherwise to one at 24 years of age having not yet received it, the faith is preacht by you in vain that he may receive it.</p>
               <p>There is a teaching to beget grace and faith where it is not, and a teaching to increase it where it is, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18.19. a teaching before, and a teaching after faith and baptism, and if you ask a reason of both these, the one is to beget faith into both the habit, and the act, the other to build it up into higher degrees, the second teaching indeed supposes a being of it in men, the first teaching no being of it as yet when you begin first to preach to them, for your preaching speaks to them as to unbelievers: whereupon this argument holds good, that if ever they had faith in their infancy, they have lost it now, for why else are they taught the element of it? why taught in order to the receiving it? for reason in this objection must be understood as speaking suppositively onely i. e. in case persons had faith in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy its now lost, why else are they taught to this end that they might have it? but not so positively as your expressions represent it, as if reason did really assert that infants do lose any faith they had in infancy, for howbeit reason acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that such in whom faith is, may lose it if they look not to it, yet reason knows well enough that those can never be said to lose faith, in whom faith never was at all.</p>

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:109011:152"/>
return that is here rendred to reasons objection.</p>
               <p>I speak not of a few faults, which in the first part of it escaped the presse, and made it nonsence, for those you corrected in the copy you sent to me, so that I might do no less then do you right so far as to transprint it (as I have done) according to your own emendation: <hi>Nec tibi Typographi crimina dem vitio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But of the faults which escaped the pen, or rather the pates of those that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed this rambling responsion, the major part of which, whether it past from you willingly, and ingenuously, or rashly, and unadvisedly rather I know not, is a most flat unsaying of most of that you have said before; and much of what you say again in the next page after, and an acknowledgement of the clear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that, which you have hitherto tugged for, and which you persue the proof of well-nigh throughout your whole Pamphlet, an absolute overturning of the basis on which your book builds infants baptism, which is this assertion, viz. <hi>That it sufficiently appears that these little infants in particular have faith,</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning infants of believers in contradistinction to those of Turks and Pagans, whom as concerning their original condition, and their birth-right to salvation you ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rank with the Devils, then with the children of Christians; I say a plain deponing of that position you ground all on, viz. that tis apparent the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants you sprinkle do believe, and so a serving of our turn as much as we desire; and as for that little which seems not so directly for us, though by reason of, not the profundity (for tis shallow enough) but the darkness, and muddiness of the matter, it be hard to see clearly to the bottom of it, yet if I do truly sound the sense of it, and reach to the utmost of your meaning in it, it seemes to speak as little for your selves.</p>
               <p>You tell us first, that an Argument from comparison is subject to many obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and cannot hold, unlesse <hi>caeteris paribus</hi> be first proved; whereby you subject the most of your own Arguments in the present point to exception, for I appeal to your selves, and all men to judge, whether they are not mostly drawn from comparisons between the children of the Jewes, and the children of Gentile believers, the circumcision of the one, and baptism of the other; and yet <hi>caete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris paribus</hi> is not at all proved by you to this hour, nor yet ever can be, sith <hi>cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris imparibus,</hi> I mean disagreement almost in all things between Jewes chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Christians, between circumcision and baptism is so manifestly made appear by us, that there hardly appears any analogy at all between them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,</p>
               <p>Secondly, So far as to the freeing of this Argument from comparison between infidels and Christians infants, so as that it may hold without any exception, <hi>caeteris paribus</hi> is granted by your selves, for if by this parity in other things you mean an equality of souls by creation, your selves assert that parity but a page above, <hi>viz.</hi> p. 16. where you say <hi>all souls are equall in their creation,</hi> and so the souls of believers and unbelievers infants.</p>
               <p>But thirdly, If by parity in other things, which you would have proved, you mean an equallity in their natural capacities, and endowments of wit and ingenuity, then either there is such a <hi>parity</hi> in infants of Christians and infidels, or else so far as <hi>disparity</hi> is, the excellency may much rather of the two be supposed to be in the children of Christians, in whom yet <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> suppose them to have the same education, and instruction, there is no more inclination to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Christ by verrue of any habit of faith infused into them in infancy above the other, then there is in the children of <hi>Indians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next you tell us, <hi>If the Objector had considered &amp;c. he would not have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded thus as he doth,</hi> The objector you say is <hi>Reason,</hi> so that <hi>Reason</hi> belike was much besides it self in arguing so unreasonably against your fiction of faith in the Infants of Christians; but what if <hi>Reason</hi> should consider the very same, that you here wish it would, must its conclusion against the belief of believers infants
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:109011:153"/>
be thereupon ere a whit the more unconcluded? and what though among chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren born of the same Christian parents, under the same education, one gives a better <hi>specimen,</hi> not onely in acts of piety and religion, but of knowledge also, may not therefore the habit of faith be more groundedly denyed to be in one, then the facultie of understanding can be denyed to be in the other.</p>
               <p>What still Sirs? still will you make the being of faith in the infants of Christians of equall necessity with the being of the principle of reason and facultie of understanding in infants? the faculty of understanding is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate habit necessarily to be concluded, and that in the highest degree to be in all infants, tis <hi>in omni, per se, quâ ipsum,</hi> but faith in Christ is by your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, but an infused habit, and by your own confession as not in all infants, so in you know not which, and which not till you see them act it: and yet by your own conclusion (to go round again) tis in such not in such, <hi>viz.</hi> not at all in <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> infants (for they are all in a damnable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with you) but in all infants of Christians, even such as yet give no <hi>specimen</hi> of it, and that so necessarily, that a man may as truly deny that which is naturall to them, even the faculty of understanding, as deny the habit of faith to be in them.</p>
               <p>Next in order to a fuller, and more direct answer you prepare the way by a pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of six or seven positions, which you say you must necessarily hold, concerning two or three of which we may say its no great matter whether you hold them or no, for any undoubted, and infallible truth that is to be found in them, in the sense wherein you take them, or at least for any great matter of assistance, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crues to your cause by them, and as for the rest, of which you say you must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily hold them, you might have said rather you must necessarily yield them to us, for indeed they are the giving up of your cause, and no other then the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a dash with your own pen over all that ever you say, throughout the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due of your works, as concerning that sufficient appearance of faith, you assert to be in believers infants: yea he is blind that doth not see you thereby perfectly blotting out again, what ever you penned in that particular with your own hands.</p>
               <p>First say you the habit of faith must be before it can work, I know no neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of holding this for truth, neither indeed would you hold it but that you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine faith to be another kind of habit then it is, for there are more kinds of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits then one, though you speak of habit by the lump all along, as if you were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of but one, for heres ore and ore again, <hi>habit, habit, habit, habit, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,</hi> but not the least hint of what kind of <hi>habit</hi> you mean; you are never the men that distinguish of habits, whereas <hi>qui bene distinguit bene docet,</hi> there being some habits acquired, and obtained no otherwise then by acting, and faith it self is such a habit, as will hardly be proved (for all your confidence in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) to be any other, at least to be apparent in any one, or visible to the view of others till some act thereof hath past the persons in whom it is, neither is any one in the world, that I know of habitually a believer in Christ, till having heard of him or his word he doth actually believe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas you say <hi>the spirit of God infuses this habit</hi>; I grant he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuses it, if you take the word infuse in a true sense i. e. for begetting it in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons by the preaching of the word, other infusion of faith (if yet that may be properly called infusion, which is a phrase rather of your own coining in this case) the word knows none: God indeed gives it, but he gives it in the way of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word of faith, in the way of hearing Christ preached, in which way he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gave it to infants, neither is it his gift to them in any other: the spirit works it, but not without the use of means, not <hi>per saltum,</hi> and in <hi>nictu oculi</hi> i. e. so suddenly as you fancy, but by the discharge of that office he bears from the father to that end and purpose, towards the whole world, i. e. moving, striving, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading inwardly, whilest the word doth without, inlightning, convincing a man

               <p>Fourthly, <hi>where as you say wheresoever the habit of faith is, it inclines to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly actions, when there is opportunity and the season for bringing them forth:</hi> whether this be necessary to be held or no, yet weel hold it to do you a pleasure in calling you thereby from your false cause, for else its like to do you more displeasure
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:109011:154"/>
in your cause of infants faith, then you well considered, when you penned and printed it: for wheresoever faith is, the opportunity and season for its bearing fruit, and working by love and other holy actions is ever present and perpetual: yea its never unopportune or unseasonable for him that hath faith to be acting obedience in one thing or other: yea <hi>if any one say I have faith and have not works,</hi> and holy actions, much lesse, if no inclinablenesse to holy actions, <hi>that faith cannot save,</hi> nor stand him instead <hi>faith without works being dead and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting nothing</hi>: therefore if where ever faith is it inclines to holy actions when opportunity and season for it is, then I am sure there is no faith at all in infants, for there is no opportunity or season at all in infancy, wherein faith is found fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in them: and if you will say they have faith though you have no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it, and prove it is so because it is so, then it is a faith without works, and that faith is dead, unprofitable and cannot save them, <hi>Iames</hi> 2. and if so, you would be better opinioned towards infants in my mind, to hold them saved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith, then to hold they have a faith which cannot save them, for better ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a whit at all then never the better.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, whereas you say that <hi>this inclination to holy actions is not equally alike in all, in whom the habits themselves are,</hi> that may be so too, yet <hi>Sampson</hi> and <hi>David</hi> are no such sufficient instances of it, but that more sufficient might have been given, for as there are many worthy things recorded which both these did by the power of faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. so he of whom you say he exceeded in acts of piety was in some things, not to say as impious, yet impious as well as the other; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides to make comparisons between two such worthies, as doing, the one more good, the other lesse, both which by faith did no lesse the subdue, and in their times fully deliver <hi>Israel</hi> from the <hi>Philistines,</hi> for which the spirit is pleased to record, and recommend them both as examples to all ages, and rank them among others, of whom the world was not worthy, in one line <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.32. <hi>caeteris paribus</hi> unproved too, such comparison (if any be so) is beyond all comparison odious, and subject to many exceptions, but be it all just as you have said it, yet as little yields it to the support of your infant faith, and childish baptism, as if you had said nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, whereas you say <hi>that instruction of the understanding in matter of faith in some sort must go before any act of faith can be discovered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And seventhly and lastly, that no judgement of science can be passed i. e. true demonstration made of this habit of faith till the acts themselves be seen, and examined, and that</hi> a posteriore <hi>onely the discovery of habits is made,</hi> and then from all these preparative premises draw up your conclusive answer in three heads answering thus in the first place viz.</p>
               <p>That <hi>it cannot be certainly presumed what children have faith, what have not, and that the working of the spirit in that particular is not known to us, and ore again also that the spirit is not bound nor barred, and therefore there can be no conclusion made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I say tis all necessarily to be held for truth, yea tis a truth so preciously pertinent to our purpose against the purpose of your own pamphlet, that had we been to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in a little compasse all that need be said toward the appearance of this positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>viz.</hi> that it doth not sufficiently appear by any evidence of it in their infancy, that infants of believers have faith, any more then other infants, we could not in so few words have spoken so pithily to such a purpose, which when I consider, I cannot but wonder, and conceive you will once wonder at your selves, when your eyes are open, that they whose words all these are should act against them all, so absurdly, as to make it the biggest business throughout their book, to make it appear and that sufficiently, that believers infants have faith beyond o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infants.</p>

               <p>For if we say heathens infants are inclined to acts of faith, and should make that good against you, as we shall hardly ere trouble our selves to do, unlesse we did believe it to be truth, can you give any just account of your denial of baptism to these? yea <hi>who can forbid water why they may not be baptized, that have</hi> and are inclined to act faith as well as the other, and in whom as in those of believing parents the work is palpably at least possibly and probably the very same?</p>
               <p>But if we say no, infidels infants are not inclined, then we must take what comes on it, for you are resolved to hit us home indeed, and so you do, while you do that at last cast, which had you done at first, you had saved your selves a deal of hurt, which you have done your selves, by circumlocuting so long in way of proving the very <hi>Minor</hi> proposition of that last Argument which <hi>Reason</hi> urged against you, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Christians children are not more inclined to actions of faith then those of infidels</hi>; for at last you fall flatly as your safest way to deny that <hi>Minor,</hi> and assert contrarily thereto, that children of Christians are more incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to holy actions, then other children, which if it be true.</p>
               <p>First how grosly do you contradict that you say in the lines above, where you seem to grant that there may be more inclinablenesse in infidels children, and promptnesse to holy actions then in Christians?</p>
               <p>Secondly, I wonder how you come to be experienced in it, for if you Clergie men be all Christians, and so you are in your own account, your children (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting some that by the breeding you give them, grow up to the same stamp of Christianity you print upon them) do (for all their native holy inclinations) not seldome prove the lewdest and rudest of any mens children in a Countrey; for not onely through the Priests and Prophets own practise, but from their posterity too oft times prophaness goes out into all the world, or else the Popes had never filled it with iniquitie as they have done.

               <p>Is it so Sirs, that the spirit is not tyed to work by means in little children, in the same cases, wherein he works by means in men, and women?

               </p>
               <p>The spirit is not tied to means, nor to the outward way of hearing the word, so but that though he begets men to faith that way, and by that means, yet he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets infants to believe without it: and such of you as ashamed to assert that the infants themselves have faith, do Rantize them on the fathers faith without their own, excuse the matter thus <hi>viz.</hi>

that he doth work by means among them so, that there is no hope to be had by parents of the salvation of their infants, out of the way of baptism, and no justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of them on of the way of belief.</p>
               <p>Thus you tie and unty, confine and lose the spirit at your pleasure, you give him leave, for your own lusts sake, either to approve of your baptism of children out of his own declared and onely approved way of faith, or if it be needfull as some of you think it is, for infants to believe in order to baptism, then to beget faith without that outward means of hearing the word, but though it is his own good will to justifie and save dying infants by Christ without the outward means of faith and baptism, there he is limitted, and cannot obtain your good will, he must give way to you to baptize infants, out of that ordinary way of faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his will is that men shall be baptized: but he may not save infants out of the ordinary way of faith and baptism, wherein his will is that men by Christ shall be saved, no not by any means in the world.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That by the same reason we may conclude against the faculty of understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in them, and against their having a reasonable soul,</hi> as if it were full as clear, and altogether as absurd to doubt that these infants have faith (which yet your selves confesse you cannot presume, what infants have, and what have not) as to doubt that they have the reasonable soul, which is notoriously known to every Novice in very nature to be in all mankind by nature without exception, and that so also, as essentially to difference them from other creatures.</p>
               <p>The second remaining and remarkable absurdity is this viz. in that you most shamelessely assert that the faculty of understanding comes to persons by the same way and means, whereby justifying faith comes, and no other i. e. by hearing the word preached, for when reason argues against infants believing thus <hi>viz.</hi> faith comes by hearing the word of God, but infants cannot hear so as to understand the word of God preached, <hi>Ergo,</hi> not believe; you reply thus <hi>viz.</hi>

I confesse that <hi>Plus notitiae,</hi> or <hi>acquisitio ulterioris intelligentiae,</hi> increase of knowledge, and the obtaining of more and more understanding may come by hearing, wherein the faculty of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding being set on work, not onely exercises, but improves it self also, and comes to act it self on more intelligible objects then before, now newly discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it, but that <hi>Ipsa facultas intelligendi,</hi> or <hi>ipse intellectus,</hi> the very faculty of understanding it self, which comes by nature, and generation, and is as essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially in man, as the reasonable soul it self, doth come by hearing, is such a mess of matter, as was never heard of to this hour, nor can I conceive what kind of hearing any faculty of the soul can come by, sith the understanding and will must both be known to be in persons, and they thereby to be both reasonable, intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible and eligible creatures before they can be fit subjects to be spoken to, and before intelligible, or eligible objects can reasonably, seasonably, or any other wise then senslessely be propounded to them in preaching, neither, if at all they had such a monstrous kind of inward teaching from the spirit, as you talk of, can they have even that teaching, before they have the faculty of understanding, for that teaching must be at least after they have a being, but they are not in being sooner then the faculty of understanding hath a being in them: yea in order of time the sense of hearing it self is not in us before it.</p>
               <p>And howbeit the <hi>Axiome</hi> be true, if rightly taken, <hi>Nil est in intellectu quod non prius fuerit in sensu,</hi> the understanding apprehends nothing, which some sense or other doth not first some way or other apprehend, yet still the <hi>faculty</hi> of understanding, whereby we <hi>conceive,</hi> and the will <hi>whereby</hi> we <hi>receive,</hi> begin to be in us at least as soon as the senses, <hi>whereby</hi> we <hi>outwardly perceive</hi> i. e. as we our selves begin to be.</p>

               <p>But lets us examine your reason why we are to judge faith to be in these infants, as we are to judge it to be in any that make profession, you say because the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath so amply declared the good will of Christ to them, which is <hi>Tanta mount</hi> to any ones single profession of himself.</p>
               <p>I answer, that the Scripture declares the good will of Christ to little children in general, without exception, and not to one more then another, but whats this to prove any of them to have faith? much more what is it to the proving and making it appear that this and that particular infant hath faith (which is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter now in hand) when other infants have it not? or to prove believers infants to have it exclusively of the infants of unbelievers? yet you say this declaration of Scripture, which your selves confesse p. 5. declares concerning infants in general, proves this or that single infant, in contradistinction to others, to have faith as suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently as any ones single profession proves it concerning his single self, Nay this <hi>report of Scripture makes it appear</hi> (say you most sottishly p. 5.) <hi>that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants have faith, more then the particular profession of any, whom we admit to baptism, can make it appear of himself</hi>; and yet (to go round again) <hi>a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriore</hi> onely i. e. by profession of it onely the discovery of the habit of faith is made: O curious criss-crosse!</p>
               <p>The second reason you here give, why a charitable judgement concerning their faith is due to these particular infants, and not others i. e. infants of believers, and not unbelievers is this <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>To the first I say thus, if the legal covenant did take in all children into the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church (as you say, &amp; as indeed it did) i. e. as well the children of unbelieving, as of believing Jewes, neither had the one of these a strawes more right to circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion then the other, then sith the Covenant of the Gospel is inlarged and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to both Jewes and gentiles, between whom the partition wall is broken down, and they both made one.</p>
               <p>And sith now by the Priests own confession it stands in the same way to be administred among the Jewes and Gentiles as that legal Covenant did for a time among the Jewes only, the Priest himself makes the covenant of the Gospel worse then the legal, that taking in, at least to the visible Church, all children of that people to whom it extended, i. e. the Jewes without any exception, without any respect to the parents being godly or ungodly, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of unbelieving Gentiles, of heathens, Turks and Pagans, and unbelieving Jewes too, which (for all their parents wickednesse, and unbelief) were wont to be received into the Church under the Law, and this not onely from the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church neither (for that were more tollerable of the two, and can do them no hurt, if it be all) but also from the Kingdome of heaven, and salvation it self in their cruel <hi>Charity,</hi> before they have by <hi>actuall sinne deserved to be exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this I speak not as believing any infants in infancy to have right to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the visible Church, and fellowship thereof here on Earth, though yet I believe all infants, as well as some, dying infants, and before they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served exemption and damnation by actual rebellion, to have according to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral declaration of Scripture, right of entrance into the kingdome of heaven; but that I may discover the unruliness of the Priest, who wherein he judges o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of streightning the Gospel condemnes himself, who undertakes to make laws, prescribe rules, impose principles upon all men, and yet breaks his own lawes, varies from his own rules, straggles from his own principles through blindness as much as any other whom he blames for it.</p>
               <p>To the second thus, if it be so indeed (as you told us once before it is p. 7. and here tell us over again that we may know your mind in it) that to deny baptism to infants before they dy, doth <hi>ipso facto</hi> destroy all the comforts, all the hopes that any parents can possibly have of the salvation of their infants, that dy unbaptized, and all the grounds of those hopes, i. e. all those childrens right in the covenant, and promises of Christ, and consequently (this necessarily followes) doth subject them unavoidably unto eternal damnation.</p>
               <p>Then first as I told you once or twice before, so I tell you now again that 'tis your selves, and not we who are the men, that say, no baptism, no salvation, for (say you) there is no ground for parents to hope their children can be saved, no though those parents be believers, though those children believe also themselves, and so both by birth, and by their parents faith, and their own faith too, have right (as you say the infants of Christians have) in the Covenant, and promises of Christ, yet they must damn for all this, if baptism be denyed them, and if they dye without it, their parents must mourne without hope of their Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>This is your judgement of Charity concerning unbaptized infants; even of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so believing parents, having also the habit of faith in themselves, for though parents believe, and believe their children to have faith, too and right to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet deny them baptism, and (all the other notwithstanding) theres no hope of them, the parents can upon no good ground be comfor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed concerning them, but that they are damned.</p>
               <p>Tis you therefore that place such high, and mighty necessity in the bare out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward dispensation of the ordinance, that are so for the ceremony, that hold that the substance doth no good without it, why else do you say that be there never so many grounds otherwise, on which to hope infants salvation, viz. their parents faith, and their own faith, and title thereby to the Covenant, which, though false, simple, and rotten, yet are the grounds on which you hope some dying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants may be sav'd, though you fear the most are damn'd (for indeed the true grounds on which to hope the salvation of all dying infants, is there non-deserving exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption by actual sin, and personal rebellion against the Gospel) why I say though there be never so much ground of hope of their salvation, do you say the grounds, whereupon they elsewise may be hoped to be saved, are all destroyed, if they be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to be baptized?</p>
               <p>Moreover I tell you, that you run round, like a blind horse in a mill, and contradict your selves egregiously, by holding such a high necessity of infants ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism that theres no hope of their salvation if it be denyed them, so that unlesse
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:109011:160"/>
you recant it, youl in the end repent it that ere you lived your selves, and led o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers so long in such delusion; for mark how you mope too and fro in a mist, sometimes you say that birth of Christian parents, and faith in the children so born, these give right to the Covenant, and the promises of Christ, and so to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and the kingdome of heaven, and their right to the promises, and the kingdome, that gives them right to baptism, and to entrance into the visible Church, supposing their right to salvation to be without baptism, and before it, as that which intitles them thereto, <hi>making their visible right to baptism, and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church to depend upon their visible right to salvation,</hi> saying they must be seen by some thing or other distinguishing them from others, who are not heirs, to be heirs belonging to the kingdome, before they be signed as such, and so you argue, making an apparent right to baptism posteriour to their right to salvation, <hi>viz.</hi> to whom the thing signified i. e. heaven appears to belong, to them conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the sign i. e. baptism, else not, but that appears to belong to infants, therefore this, which is as much as to say, we must first look upon them, and believe them to be heirs of salvation, and upon that ground afterward baptize them, so <hi>making the right to the sign depend upon the being of the thing signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Other while again (as here) you turn the cat ith pan, and tell us a tale, that turns all this up side down again, and makes all their right to the Covenant &amp; promises of Christ, to salvation by him, to the kingdome, which all are according to your other opinion to be Antecedent to baptism, and entitling to it, so that no appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent right to the Covenant, and promise, and kingdome, and salvation, no bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, you make I say all these, on which you made baptism depend before, so necessarily dependant on baptism, so subsequent to it, so no way appearing to belong to infants without it, that no baptism no title to life; deny them baptism, and entrance into the visible Church, and they are visibly in the kingdome of the divel, theres no hopes they can be saved, if their parents let them die without it, no grounds on which to hope it, but though believers children, and apparently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough believing themselves, and so thereby in apparent right to the Covenant and promise of Christ, and consequently of salvation, and all this before they may be baptized, yet they are in the visible kingdome of the divel, and do but deny bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism to them, and all those old evidences are worn out, their names blotted out of the book of life, their parents can have no hope of other then their damnation, nay all the grounds on which to hope that any good comes of them, are utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly destroyed.</p>
               <p>So then of the doctrine that you deliver this is the summe, in two round heads <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <p>That infants right to salvation must needs be apparent, or else they may not be baptized.</p>
                     <p>Secondly <hi>(to go round again)</hi> baptism of infants must needs be, or else theres no apparent ground, on which to hope they can be saved.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, I tell you I marvel in my heart, it being so that such danger comes by denying infant baptism, that parents cannot hope they can be saved, how you dare for your ears delay so long as you do, sometimes a week, sometimes a fortnight, sometimes almost a year, as the custom of <hi>England</hi> was of old to baptize but twice in the year <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whitsontide,</hi> and do not rather baptize your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants so soon as they are born, least happily their lying in the visible kingdome of the divel longer then you need to let them, they happen to die before your good chear can be made, and all your kinsfolks come together, and then the parents be left without hope of any other, but that their children remain in the kingdom of the divel for ever: for persons live or dye visibly (say you) either in the visible Church of Christ, out of which you say also theres no salvation, the visible entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which is by baptism, by which therefore unbaptized infants never entred; or
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:109011:160"/>
else in the visible kingdome of the divel: this is one of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> diseased dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions p. 71. for there is no more necessity then there is of sprinkling infants (and thats as little, as little can be) of their being visibly in either, neither are they visibly in either the visible Church of Christ, or visible kingdome of the devill, till they are at years, but <hi>in medio abnegationis</hi>: you salve all that danger, which I confesse is none at all in infants dying unbaptized (but onely that I speak accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your own principles) by telling us that tis not the bare omission, or neglect, but the contempt of the ordinance, that damnes the persons that dye without it.</p>
               <p>I tell you again, that if this may passe for true and currant doctrine among those that hold baptism due to men and women onely, and not infants (as I scarce know how it should, sith neglect of known duty is damnable in a lower degree, as well as contempt of it is in a higher) yet however its false, silly, and nonsensical doctrine among you that baptize none but infants, apply it how you will: for the parents neglect, and the parents contempt of the ordinance as to his infant, is much at one i. e. neither of them damnable to the infant, unlesse you will hold up that saying again in the world, which God protested long since men should never have occasion to use any more <hi>viz.</hi> that the child shall die (eternally) for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers sin, surely the fathers contempt doth not redound any more, then his bare neglect, with any danger, or disadvantage to the infant, and as for the infant he cannot be damned for not being baptized in infancy through his own neglect, or contempt of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, for he neither contemnes, nor neglects it.</p>
               <p>To the third of these three things that you, and I both have thrust here into one place, you in the <hi>Review,</hi> and I in the <hi>Re-Review</hi> in order to the dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them all together <hi>viz.</hi> it unchristens the whole Church of God <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I say thus, confessing that our doctrine unchristens whole christendome, which the <hi>Pope</hi> hath called the Church of God, but is indeed the whole world of Gentiles, that hath got into the outer court, the meer outward form, and name of christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and hath trod down the holy City, and true worship for 1260 years, that whole world that hath for ages and generations wondered after the beast, nor is this inconsistent with the truth of Christs promises of his presence, and guidance among those that are his true Church, and people indeed, for howbeit he hath, according to the word, left those to their own wayes, that left and liked not his wayes, yet he ever hath, still doth, and ever will lead those into truth, that love the truth, and will be led by his spirit, when he will lead them: yea though he tied not himself to teach them, that should chuse the <hi>Pope</hi> for their <hi>Tutor,</hi> yet according to his promise he hath bin more or lesse with those, that observed what he commanded them in his word from the beginning, and so shall be even to the end.</p>

               <p>And howbeit, it hath bin more then once, but once especially, as I have hinted to the Reader in a shrewd shake of sicknesse, that befel me above a twelve moneth since to the great retarding of this work, reported that I was shaken sheer out of my mind, and judgement concerning this way and baptism, so as to have recanted and renounced it, yet I call my God to witnesse, to whom also I give thanks for his mercy toward me in that particular, that partly by the more then ordinary advantages I then had, through my sequestration from all other occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to seek the Lord, to search and try my wayes, and turn again unto him, partly by the more then ordinary ingagements that were then upon me so to do, and that seriously and sincerely, through my dayly expectation to be clapt up in clods of earth, till the great day of acccounts, I have bin much more sweetly sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied since then concerning the truth of this way, then ever I was in all my life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, neither did I then find any cause to repent me of coming to Christ in it, as neither shall any, that renouncing your Rantism do rightly receive it, so they continue to walk uprightly in it to the end: but this I must confesse, I found good cause to repent of it that I had not honoured it so much as I might have done since <hi>I</hi> ownd it, nor walked so profitably, serviceably, blamelesly, holily, and worthily in it, nor so suitably to so holy and worthy a way as it is in it self, not withstanding the account of basensse and foolishness that it hath in the world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30.</p>
               <p>So that ever since that forenamed sifting I had from Satan, by the mouth of that his Agent, by whom he solicited me to forgo my baptism, I side with you in this, <hi>viz.</hi> that tis the Devils worke in the shape of an Angell of light to make men renounce their baptism, and though I am somewhat otherwise opinio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about the Divels affection to infants baptism, then you are, for I think if he hate it, tis as he hates holy water, or any other of his own inventions, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he hath juggled away the truth, and imitated Christs ordinances out of doors, yet I am fully of your mind that he so hates the true baptism, I mean the bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of professed believers, from whence I gather the goodnesse, and validity of it against him, that it is most of the business about which he is at work in the shape of an Angel of light in these daies, wherein his time growes short, and his old kingdome begins to fail him by means of the true baptism, to erect to himself a new kingdome, and in order thereunto to make men renounce that baptism, as knowing that he cannot strike a downright bargain with a soul to become fully his, as the high <hi>Notionists,</hi> and <hi>spiritual Sensualists</hi> of these times do, till it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced its first bargain, made with Christ in baptism, not what was made with

I trow not in case they act through ignorance altogether invincible in the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of their hearts: but if the truths <hi>Antagonists</hi> in this point, whether it be you or we, either see and see not, or may see and will not, or can see and dare not, or find the footing and ground they go upon to be unsure, and slippery, the proofs they practise from to be poor, pedling, and paltry, as God knowes yours are, if you do not, and yet for fear and shame of men, find it not, then the fall may chance to prove a desperate one indeed, and therefore Sirs see ye to it, see that ye see to it, for ye are a generation that in these daies of discovery are seen more into then you are aware of, and may see much more then you do, if you will. And they that say it is so dangerous to be out in the question disputed, that the error, on which side soever, reaches, and leads them that follow it to the end, as farre as hell, had need be more sure of their hand, then you can be in your cause, from the most serious search of Scripture, that they are in the right, and if they find that they are out to return in time.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving razed the rotten Basis of your <hi>Babism,</hi> I come now to reckon with your <hi>Rantism,</hi> and to examine whether our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of baptizing, which is by dipping, or yours, which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by sprinkling, is the baptism which was instituted by Christ, according to that small hint you give me, which is no other then a bare, single, simple denyal of your baptism to be null; for no lesse then that is the next fault wherewith we charge it: As for your selves, as if you were unwilling to have it sifted, as I verily believe, and have suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently experienced that you are, you slide so silently by this question, which is as requisite to be discussed, and duely understood as the other, that howbeit you are not a little concerned for the securing of your baptism, to back it in this particular also, specially since you confesse that you must give it up, if our plea against the form of it prove valid, yet you afford not so much as one <hi>wea-bit</hi> of an argument, whereby to disprove our form of baptizing, nor yet to prove the truth of your own, save only your homely reply to our plea, <hi>viz. we should renounce our bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism too if we should yield them that plea:</hi> which words of yours in a <hi>Sillogistical</hi> form run thus, <hi>viz.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Thus you are resolved to hold the conclusion: neverthelesse such shamefull ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giversation, and utter loathness to put your selves upon tryal by the word I have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver found amongst you in this point, that how justly Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> complains of Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> for refusing to dispute it publiquely p. 134. I know not, but I am sure not more justly then I have occasion to cry out of your unworthy waywardnesse in this case: for though at the Disputation at <hi>Ashford</hi> I did in my position (<hi>some,</hi> but not half the <hi>sum</hi> of which you set down in your <hi>Account</hi>) positively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare my exception against two things in that, which you call your baptism, <hi>viz.</hi>-</p>

            <p>In like manner at the publike dispute, which was at <hi>Folstone</hi> before many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of people, where there was one, if not more, of my opponents at <hi>Ashford,</hi> the Opponents part being put upon me, much more against my expecta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>assis of Clergy men,</hi> who were there, that twas most proper to direct my dispute to their practise, which sith it was the <hi>Rantizing,</hi> and not the <hi>baptizing</hi> of infants, I would prove that their sprinkling of infants was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; but I could at no hand be permitted to proceed in such a way, or to come neer their copy hold in that point, <hi>viz.</hi> their false form of dispensing, though I promised to abide a whole week among them, rather than they should not have discourse enough about the subject; at last I obtained with much adoe a division of the question into two, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Whether infants were the true subject?</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Whether sprinkling were the true manner of baptizing?</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And a solemn Engagement from them, that if so be I would begin upon the first, there should be a discourse after it upon the other.</p>
            <p>But as I forewarned the people, and that before these mens own faces, that it would be at first, <hi>viz.</hi> that they would evade all controversie about that, if it were possible, even so it fell out indeed at last; for after some two hours, or little more, though it were well-nigh a winters day yet to night, it was on their parts so uncessantly urged, that the disputation might cease, and the people for that time be dismissed, that the divel is blind if he did not see that day, that those who sided with him, unseen, against the truth, did judge that there was discourse <hi>too much,</hi> though but a little, about the Subject of baptism, and <hi>enough,</hi> though none at all, about the form.</p>
            <p>But I let passe this, and come to prove the point now in hand, which is this, that dipping or overwhelming in water, and not sprinkling, is the only true form, or manner wherein baptism is to be dispensed, and without which it is either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly no baptism, or at least none of that baptism which is required in the word and may be owned as the ordinance of Christ.</p>
            <p>This is most plain, and in a most plain way I desire to prove it: and first from the signification of the <hi>Greek</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is ever used in the originall, as that whereby this ordinance is expressed, and whence it derives that denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of baptism, the proper plain English of which is to overwhelm, or cover with water, to plunge over head and ears, to put under the water, to dipp, douze or drown in the water.: and it is the derivative of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is <hi>tingo, quod fit immergendo,</hi> to dipp in that manner, as they do that dy cloth and colours, which is by that total submersion of things in the liquor, as all men know they do that dy, and not by sprinkling here and there a drop of water on them.</p>
            <p>Thus I say the word <hi>baptize</hi> signifies, and not to sprinkle; and therefore that I may rouze all those people into a remembrance of this matter, whose Priests de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, and draw them to dream that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> signifies both to dipp, &amp; to sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle, which some, whether it be of that ignorance of the truth that cleaves, and accrues to the common sort of Priests, through their taking things upon trust, and tradition one from another without tryal, or of meer malice making them willful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to hide the truth after they have received the knowledge of it, I know not, God knowes, but some I say stick not still as much as they can to make their people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it; But to awaken such to some attention to the <hi>Heterodoxness</hi> of their Priests, as well as all waies to the <hi>Orthodoxness</hi> of them, I here summon all the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:109011:163"/>
priests in Christendome out of either <hi>Stephanus,</hi> or <hi>Scapula,</hi> the two <hi>Greek Lex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icons</hi> that are in so great request, and of such ordinary use among you, and such friends to your selves, as you may see by the bitter invectives of both of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us as <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> as a <hi>Diobolicall</hi> sect, and therefore would favour your cause as far as in conscience they could, to shew the contrary to what I here have said, <hi>viz.</hi> that <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>te sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that is denominated baptized, or dipped by it, or that it ever signified such a thing as <hi>sprinkling</hi> at all.</p>
            <p>Yea the word that signifies to sprinkle is another word, <hi>viz.</hi>

               </gap>, which is ever used in Scripture by the spirit, when he speaks of such a thing as sprinkling: yea tis used three times in one chapter, <hi>viz. Heb.</hi> 9.13.19.21. and is all along englished by sprinkling, neither is there any one place of Scripture wherein the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is rendered to baptize, or used to signify baptizing, neither is there one Scripture wherein the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> is rendred sprinkling, or used to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify such a thing as sprinkling, not is there any reason why it should be so rendred, specially if you consider</p>

Sprinkling,</hi> and <hi>Baptizing [Anglicè dipping]</hi> by which, as by a second Argument, its most plain that sprinkling is not only not the baptism of Christ, but in truth no baptism at all, and so consequently that he is properly <hi>no-Anabaptist,</hi> who baptizeth them that were but sprinkled, and he <hi>Ano-Baptist</hi> that doth but sprinkle.</p>

out, for in <hi>Cyprians</hi> time people being overgrown with such a superstition, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause baptism was the token to them of remission of their sinnes, therefore they would commonly after conversion delay their submission to that dispensation till toward their latter end, as neer as they could ghesse it approaching on them, that they might thereby have evidence of remission of all their sinnes at once, fearing, if they should be baptized before, least they should sinne again, and so spoil all the comfort they received by baptism, (so far were persons from posting (as they do now a daies) to dispense baptism in infancy to their infants, that they at years did too much delay their own) hereupon it came to passe not seldome, that the procrastinators of baptism were taken with sicknesse on a sudden, and confined to their beds unawares, before they could be baptized, in which case not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how to be baptized in that manner, wherein twas usually dispensed i. e. by dipping in places of much water, and yet unwilling withall to dye without it, they sent to <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who was the oracle of his time, to be resolved, whether in such a pressing case as this was, wherein they were as unwilling to die without <hi>Baptism,</hi> as uncapable to be <hi>baptized</hi> as they should be, it might not as well serve the turn, and be counted sufficient baptism to have a little water applied to them, or <hi>sprinkled</hi> upon them in their beds? to this the good man being loath to leave poor sick soules upon the wrack, whom he saw somewhat affraid to die un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized, returnes his opinion to this purpose <hi>viz.</hi> that in this case, wherein without manifest hazzard of the sick persons life it could not be so well done as it should, it should be done as well as it could, and that they might have some application of the element to them in their beds, which if they died at that time should passe for currant, and be counted lawful baptism:</p>
               <p>Neverthelesse (saith he himself) if they happen to be restored to health again, let them be had to the River, and there be dipped:</p>
               <p>He that doubts of this may read it in <hi>Cyprians</hi> own Epistle to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>So that we see he judged it fit to be done ore again, to be done better, to be done indeed if they lived, but if they then died, he allowed it to be called <hi>Baptism</hi> (though it was none) in favour to the weak, rather then otherwise.</p>
               <p>And here now comes in the first Rise of your <hi>Rantism,</hi> and no small occasion I believe (if it were before begun) of the growth of your <hi>Babism</hi> also, for when the needle was once so clearly entred, how easily would the thred follow after? when it had once past through the mouth of a man so reverend, and respected in his generation (as <hi>Cyprian</hi> was) that it was baptism enough to be <hi>sprinkled</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in such a case, how easily might not onely every tender person that is loath to dipp the foot in cold water, but even every person also, that will do no more then needs must against the will of the flesh, mistake it so far as to make it serve the turn in every case? and when such an easie kind of baptism as tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But to return (I pray pardon this digression) this <hi>sprinkling</hi> which you use is not baptism, or at least not the baptism of Christ (<hi>Cypriano Iudice</hi>) let <hi>Cyprian</hi> judge of it, for if it were, he would not have required persons to be baptized after it, in case conveniently they could.</p>

               <p>By forms I mean not the <hi>accidentall</hi> but the <hi>essential</hi> formes of things, which whensoever they are <hi>two,</hi> those things, whose forms they are, cannot be <hi>one,</hi> for <hi>unius rei est unica tantum forma</hi> i. e. <hi>essentialis,</hi> of one thing there can be but one <hi>essentiaell</hi> form, there may be more <hi>accidentall,</hi> for the <hi>essential</hi> form is that <hi>quae dat esse rei,</hi> which gives every thing to be what it is, and distinguishes it so exactly from every thing else, that its uncapable thereby to be at that time ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, and another thing of another essential form uncapable utterly to be that: now tis the very essential form, wherein <hi>sprinkling</hi> and <hi>baptizing [alias dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping]</hi> do differ for the essential form of that action of <hi>baptizing [Anglicè dipping]</hi> of persons is the putting of them under water, a covering them with water, or plunging them over head in water, but the essential form of your <hi>sprinkling</hi> is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the foisting of a litle water upon their foreheads, for it is not so much as a total <hi>sprinkling</hi> you use neither.</p>
               <p>In a word <hi>Baptizing</hi> properly is the application of the whole subject to the whole element of water <hi>Collectim,</hi> here or there gatherd together, so as to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm him in it, but sprinkling properly is quite another thing, <hi>viz.</hi> the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a little water, or some liquid element to the subject <hi>guttatim,</hi> i. e: by dropps or small portions only, so that these two, <hi>viz.</hi> your <hi>sprinkling</hi> and true <hi>baptism</hi> are no more one thing, then the hurling of a man down some Praecipice, or steep place upon spikes, that let out his heart blood, and the pricking of him till he bleed only with a pin, which in general are both a shedding of blood, as our two parrallels are both a wetting with water, but in special not the killing of a man, as neither are the other both baptizing: so that there may be many ways and meanes of doing a thing, and the thing be but one still if it have essential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but one form, but where there be many essential forms, there are ever as many several things as those are.</p>
               <p>A man may ride many waies, <hi>viz.</hi> East, West, &amp;c. many manner of waies, <hi>viz.</hi> backward, forward, apace or slowly &amp;c. and yet all this is riding still, while the man moves to and fro on horse back, because the very formality of that action of riding consists in being carried by another, but while he moves upon his own Legges up and down, you cannot at that time denominate him rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>In like manner a man may be <hi>baptized [Anglice dipped]</hi> or put under the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many manner of waies, viz. forward, backward, sideway, toward the right hand or left, quickly, slowly, and yet all this while he is baptized, if put under, because the essential form of <hi>baptism, viz. dipping in water</hi> is to be found in all these waies; but if he have two or three drops of water only flerted upon his face, he is no more truly baptized then if you fillip him with a wet finger, for here is <hi>Differentia essentialis,</hi> the very formallity of baptism is absent.</p>
               <p>If <hi>accidentalls</hi> onely, and meer accessaries be wanting unto baptism, special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such superfluities as were in use about the <hi>Popish Rantism,</hi> as <hi>Chris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:109011:166"/>
among you, and as blind as the Priest-hood is now, yet my life for his he shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it once, and own it too, that his businesse is not only not the baptism of Christ, but truly not any baptism at all.</p>
               <p>These two are first the true <hi>Subject,</hi> to whom Christ appointed baptism to be dispensed, which who it is, and who it is not (and how it is but one, for there is but one baptism, and not two) <hi>viz.</hi> believing <hi>Abrahams</hi> spiritual seed, and not a believing, nor unbelieving Gentiles fleshly seed, i. e. all that <hi>quoad nos</hi> believe as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, and not all that ever shall to all generations, for such are the seed as well as the immediate, descend naturally from the loines of such as do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve with <hi>Abraham,</hi> I have abundantly shewed above, nor is it my businesse here.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the true form in which Christ appointed baptism to be dispensed to believers discipled by us, which what it is you cannot be so ignorant as your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise proclaimes you to be, for I dare say it is not <hi>rantism,</hi> and you dare not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but that it is <hi>baptism</hi>: Both these are universally wanting, as I have proved, to your practise, yet if but either only were wanting it were null enough: For</p>
               <p>First, it is most certain that a mistake in the subject, to whom any thing is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be done, doth so nullify that thing so appointed, that it can neither be said to be done as twas apponted, no nor yet that the thing appointed is done at all, e. g. The Parliament commanded men to take, or in case of their resistance to slay those Rebells that were routed at <hi>Worcester,</hi> but should he have been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by them as obeying their command, that should in persuance thereof have beaten and killed other men, who were never there, nor at all ingaged in the <hi>Kings</hi> cause? they ordered a thousand pound to him that should bring in <hi>Charles Stewart,</hi> should he have been rewarded as a doer of their will in that work that should have brought in another man in his stead? <hi>Christ</hi> hath ordained, and so consequently tis his ordinance that persons shalbe first <hi>taught</hi> by us and then bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, is it therefore his ordinance to baptize them who were never taught? the Papists have a trick to baptize (as they call it, for they do but rantize as you do) bells as well as babes, but if they did truly baptize their bells, were it the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Christ? you say no; because bells are a wrong subject, which Christ never appointed baptism to be dispensed to: the very same say we of your babies: a mistake therefore in the subject makes a nullity in the service, i. e. denies it to be any ordinance of Christ at all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, tis most certain that mistake in the matter ordained, so as to make another matter of it, or do distinctly some other thing instead of it, makes all that is done of no effect: <hi>Quod fieri non debuit factum valet</hi> holds onely where the errour is in <hi>accidentals,</hi> and meerly <hi>circumstantialls,</hi> and not in the very <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of the thing it self: if men do one thing on their own heads instead of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that God bidds, they may have pardon in case they crie him mercy, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little thank from him for their paines: neither is he accounred, much lesse ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as doing the ordinance of God, that doth not so much rhe same things that he ordained otherwise, but other things then he hath ordained: when the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> ordained, and gave commission to have <hi>Canterburies</hi> head cut off, those <hi>Synodians,</hi> who also themselves waited to have his kingdome, would hardly have counted that ordinance performed had the Trustees cut off his little finger on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and let him go.</p>
               <p>Nor would the law little lesse then hang that executioner, that having strict charge to hang one man, lets him escape, and in satisfaction falls a whipping of an other: the case is yours, who being commanded to teach persons, and then baptize them, and to keep the commands of Christ without spot till his appearing, do in his absence let go the making and baptizing disciples, and in place thereof only <hi>rantize</hi> and <hi>rantize</hi> only little infants too: in doing which, sith ye do not the thing Christ appoints, ye had as good do nothing.</p>

Neverthelesse the Saints sufferings are not so smal, but that they are oft times totally drenched ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and overwhelmed (as he that is baptized in water) with tribulation, tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, scorn, ignominy, and covered therewith as with a Cloud: as we see the Saints complaints in this case <hi>Psal.</hi> 55.5. <hi>horror hath overwhelmed me</hi> Psal. 61.2. <hi>my heart is overwhelmed</hi> Psal. 77.5. <hi>I am troubled, my spirit is overwhelmd</hi> Psal. 102 1. intituled <hi>a prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered</hi> is the title of the Psalm, and this is with the waters of affliction, Psal. 124.4. so 142.3.-143.4.-so see Psa. 69.2.16. where there is complaints of sinking as it were <hi>over head</hi> and ears, <hi>in deep mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In respect also of which plungings and overwhelmings with sufferings their sufferings are <hi>Metaphorically</hi> stiled a baptism <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.22. which <hi>Metaphor</hi> is very familiar in Scripture, which compares the calamities, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series the Saints suffer in this mortal life <hi>gurgitibus aquarum, quibus veluti mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntur,</hi> to overflowing streames of water, wherein they are almost drownd, and therefore said to be baptized.</p>
               <p>As for the baptism with the spirit, he that shall say it is not such a powring out, as seasons the whole man soul and body, and every faculty of one and member of the other (which if it be, it may well be called a baptism) where in part at least all parts are purged, but of spiritualizing of some parts of the man onely, suppose his face and head, not his heart hands and feet also, but leaving other parts of him carnal and unsanctified, is not yet so well seasoned as he should be with understanding in the Grace of the Gospel. All this therefore speaks plainly to our purpose, and so it is evident still that the primitive Saints were totally dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, by the bare denomination of baptized, which in that particular is spoken of them.</p>
               <p>Secondly it appears yet much more plainly by the subject so denominated in Scripture, and said to be baptized, which is their whole persons, for tis said they were baptized, i. e. men and women, and not their faces or their hands, or their feet onely; for if any member onely had been baptized, it could not be said properly but onely figuratively and improperly (and we are to take things in the most proper sense they will well bear) that men and women were baptized, or that their bodies were washed with water, as in baptism they are said to be <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, when a denomination is made of any whole subject to be so or so, that is not wholly and totally so, that denomination is commonly made <hi>saltem ex majori,</hi> from the Major part of the subjects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so at least, and then too it is but by the figure <hi>Synechdoche,</hi> whereby we must understand that by that whole some part onely is meant, but a denomination of a subject <hi>Ex minori parte,</hi> onely from some small part thereof being so, is a thing seldome or never used, and scarce cleared alwayes from absurdity, when it is by <hi>Synechdoche</hi> it self: for he that should denominate his horse white, and commonly call and distinguish him from all his other horses,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:109011:168"/>
by the name of his white horse, onely from a starre he hath in his forehead, when all the rest of his body is black, would be counted as bruitish as the horse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, specially if he should conceive himself speaking properly enough when he speaks so: yet little otherwise then thus do you speak, and think you speak proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough too, whilst you commonly call them i. e those persons, baptized, that never had more then a little, baptism I cannot call it neither, but meer Rantism on their faces, from which though we are foold together with you by a custome of speech to afford persons that denomination of sprinkled at least, yet to say the truth, tis more then may be well challenged from us, if we should stand upon it, and plead for propriety to the utmost, or for denomination but <hi>ex majori,</hi> which reason would back us in if we should, so little of that little subject i. e. the infant, whose face onely you sprinkle, is sprinkled by you when all is done, but we let that passe:</p>
               <p>Neverthelesse, know this that totall baptizing is the onely true baptizing, and a subject not baptized totally may not be said to be baptized properly, but onely figuratively and <hi>Synechdochecally,</hi> and surely the spirit speaks not all along by <hi>Senechdoche,</hi> and tis as improper almost if not altogether to say that man is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, whose fingers, face, hands or feet onely have toucht the water, as tis to say the swan is black, because his feet are so, or the black-moor white, because his teeth are so: expresse not <hi>dentes et pedes,</hi> and then <hi>Ethiops albus,</hi> and <hi>Cygnus niger</hi> are two monstrous creatures indeed, and <hi>baptizatus merè rantizatus</hi> is no other, then <hi>rara avis in terris nigro<expan>

               <p>Or else when the matters in such particulars, from which we would argue that tis generally or universally so, are meerly <hi>fortuito,</hi> accidentally adventitious, not necessary <hi>per se, de essentia, &amp; naturà</hi> thereunto, then there is no evincing a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral

by it, for it followes not that because one man, or a few men are blind, and lame or maimed, or sick, therefore all are so; or when a matter is meerly indifferent, <hi>ad placitum,</hi> and not <hi>ex necessitate praecepti,</hi> necessary by any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive command of the same thing unto all, as well as some, then tis silly <hi>Syllogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing</hi> from some to all, as to say some men, who were weak did eat herbs, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the disciples did, and we all must eat no other.</p>
               <p>But again there are cases, wherein it followes from one to all, as when the matter spoken of that one doth agree to it, <hi>per se,</hi> and <hi>quâ tale,</hi> then tis true <hi>de omni</hi> also, as one man <hi>quâ homo</hi> is a reasonable creature, <hi>Ergo</hi> all men are so; there are cases also, wherein the Example of what particular persons then did do prove what all then did, or should have done, &amp; what all <hi>ejusdem capacitatis</hi> now should do in like manner; as namly when the matter done by those particulars is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary &amp; no other then what by duty they <hi>stood</hi> bound to, &amp; that by vertue of a cleer command given out not to them only, but to all those that are in the same capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in common with them; but specially when those particulars are recorded for our instruction, and to be patterns and examples for us to follow, then all ought to be in general, as that is, and so <hi>Paul</hi> followed Christ, and others ought to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him &amp; be as he was: and of this sort is the case here in hand, and the examples of the baptism of Christ Jesus and the Eunuch, from which we shew how all men (if at all) ought of right to be baptized: for though your Doctor disciples you (not denying in the mean while but that <hi>baptizing in Rivers is lawful,</hi> and mark that I pray, for it sets our baptizing in rivers out of the reach of all your exceptions, who snarle at it) though I say he disciples you blindly into a belief, that there is another baptism lawful besides that which Christ &amp; the Eunuch had, and that dipping in rivers is not so necessary to baptism, but that they may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted baptized, who never were dipped after such a manner, yet I tell you, through whom he being dead yet speaketh, that if by Rivers he means as we mean <hi>viz.</hi> any places where there is so much water as will well serve to dipp persons (and so he must mean, for else it might be but a pond for ought he knew, where the Eunuch was dipped, for it is called but a certain water in the way) and if by that other lawful baptizing, then that which is received in Rivers, and places of much water, he mean no other then rantizing at Fonts, or as you have now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the businesse at Basons, where there is water enough to sprinkle an 100. but not half water enough to baptize one, you will find that at last to be so far off from being the same water baptism wherewith Christ and the Eunuch were baptized, that it doth not come so neer it as it would do, if it were (as the Doctor calls it) another baptism, sith it is not so much as any baptism at all, for another baptism (such as <hi>Paedo-baptism</hi> would be if men did use it) would be some kind of kin to the baptism of Christ, they both meeting at least in the name of baptism, yet so little that Christ will never own it for his, but no baptism, and such <hi>Paedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantism</hi> is, is not so much as <hi>nomine tenus</hi> in the bare name of baptism any kin to Christ, but that you falsly father it on him as his.</p>
               <p>So that in truth our talk with you about another kind of baptizing then that of Christ, and the Eunuch will be but impertinent, unlesse, you practised ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neverthelesse for discourse sake, and in resolution to the question as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor states it in reference (no question) to his own practise, viz. <hi>whether no other baptizing then that which Christ and the Eunuch had is lawful</hi>? which is as much as to say, whether another water baptism may not serve the turn as well? or whether Christ hath not more water baptismes then one? I answer no there is, i. e. ought to be but one baptism <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. but one water baptisme, one kind of baptisme of that one kind, that must be the meaning, for else theres more i. e. more kinds of baptisme then one: <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.2. i. e. of <hi>Water, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Sufferings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Supposing therefore your <hi>Baby-rantism</hi> to be that other baptism (where note
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:109011:170"/>
that himself confesses yours, for that sure he means to be another baptizing then that <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> dispensed) supposing it I say to be that other baptism he pleads the lawfulnesse of, yet sith Christ ownes but one, even that alienation were enough to discard it as unlawful, and none of Christs, as well as its being none at all, for <hi>new baptism</hi> and <hi>no baptism</hi> will speed both alike with him at last; or if he mean onely that another manner of baptizing in water is lawful then he hath no enemy of us in that point (save that we still shall differ about the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject) for let any administrator take profest believers onely, and baptize them, i. e. overwhelm them in water, and let him do it where he will, yea how he will for me <hi>viz.</hi> backwards or forwards, sidelong or headlong, so he do it, and they be not naked.</p>

               <p>Secondly that it cannot be made appear, that either of them were dipt or plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but onely washt in the River.</p>

               <p>No? did I not shew you sufficiently above in what cases particular examples do prove, what the general primitive practise was, and may be argued from as from a general rule of what ever ought to be <hi>viz.</hi> when that, or those particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar practises are enjoined to all as well as to some, in one and the same word of righteousnesse, but specially when propounded as paterns, and written as rules for our instruction, and such are both these baptismes of <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> which had never been recorded, but for our learning and for examples sake unto us, in which respect, though he needed no baptism, as we do, to be a token to baptism, for howbeit it was <hi>partly,</hi> and perhaps <hi>primarily,</hi> to fulfill all the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of his own law, as well as of <hi>Moses</hi> Law, in his own person, as he te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies it became him to do in <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. for he exacts, and expects no more obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to himself, and the father either active or passive from us, then he acted and yielded to the father first himself, yet was he baptized partly also to the same end, in order to which he did all things else, that he either did or endured, which was imitable, and remaining for us to do after him, as baptism is <hi>viz.</hi> that he might leave us, who are so often charged to follow him, an example that we should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his steps <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21.</p>

               <p>This is true the matter of his baptism is imitable by us, and we are to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized as well as he, nor do I yet see reason (as the Ranter seems to himself to do) why Christ himself should be ingaged to baptism, or the Eunuch either, and our selves exempted from it: but whether it be so needfull to be done just in that manner as you would make it to be, I see no ground yet to believe that.</p>

               <p>Can you be baptized in a better manner think you then that wherein <hi>Iohn</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Eunuch</hi>? me thinks you should not derogate so much from the wisdome of those <hi>Primitive Administrators,</hi> as to imagine such a thing, and if you cannot are you not half wild in contending for a worse?</p>
               <p>Or Secondly would you be baptized in, not so low, base, contemptible, ridiculous tedious a way to the flesh as they, but in a more honourable, more moderate, more easie, more tollerable, more world winning, more self pleasing, more flesh favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a manner? or what is it you would have? me thinks either that soure service
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:109011:171"/>
of going down into a River, or pond, and being dipt, or overwhelmed in water there, which served our Lord Iesus Christ, and that honourable Eunuch, might serve you, or else that easie sweet service of sprinkling which you content your selves with, might have served them, one of the two: for as they were required to be baptized no more then you, so surely in no more unwelcome a way of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism then your selves; and they would not have so farre supererrogated as to have been baptized at all, if it would have fulfilled righteousnesse in that point to have been sprinkled onely on the forehead.</p>
               <p>Nay that would not, for saies Christ when he came to <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> at first refused to baptize him, <hi>Thus it becometh us to fulfill righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>:</p>
               <p>Thus i. e. not onely in this matter, but in this manner, but if you will needs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this service more easily then Christ and the Eunuch did, perform it onely (as in sprinkling you do not) and let be done in what manner, or accidental form you please, and if you like not to do it openly in Rivers or such like places, we stand not on those nicities (though many thousands of Primitive Saints as well as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern were, and are so baptized) let it be done in a Cistern, so it be totally and truly done, yea make one big enough for the disciple and the dispenser to go down in both together, so that the one may conveniently be overwhelmed in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the other, and then let it be done in a <hi>bason,</hi> if you please.</p>

               <p>First to be sure it was not by sprinkling, which yet is all in all among you, and that for these reasons.</p>
               <p>First, because its most certain that the greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> hath no such signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation as to sprinkle, neither is it rendred any where <hi>Aspergo,</hi> in any <hi>Lexicon</hi>
                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:109011:171"/>
or any translator of the testament whatsoever.</p>
               <p>Secondly because sprinkling is no kind of washing at all, neither is there any thing in the world (save as I said before by sluts and slovens) so much as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to be washt onely by that act of sprinkling, much lesse by such a sparing sprinkling as yours is, who sprinkle not the 20th part <hi>pro toto</hi>: indeed a thing may in time be so totally wetted by a continued sprinkling, as it may be put ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by into some kind of capacity to be clensed by rubbing it while the water is on it, and that is farre from your practise too, but not half so well as when it is swil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in water; and in a long while a garment may be all covered colored, and as it were died by sprinkling, as Christ is said in the continued war he wages at the last, partly by the sprinkling of peoples blood upon him, and partly by his riding up and down in the wine press, where there are, as there are usually in wars, gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments rould in blood, and blood up to the horse bridles, to have his raiment all stain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and his vesture as it were <hi>died</hi> and <hi>dipt in blood,</hi> but all this is <hi>hyperbolicall</hi> locution, and not to be wrested to such purpose as Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> do, who because there is not enough neer hand, fetch a proof for sprinkling fourty miles off, which yet proves nothing when it comes, for they know <hi>Allegories</hi> do rather illustrate then evince, but this is not such a deep dying as is by dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it had been a most vain thing for them to have gone down into the River meerly to be sprinkled, if that were the onely businesse they might well have been dispenst with from descending into the water, but sith they were not, it shews that such a thing as sprinkling might excuse them, and if not them, I know not why it should excuse the best of us; though men do much in the service of God in vain, when they do things that man doth, but God never did require at their hands, yet we cannot think Christ did any thing in vain, yet so we must think if we think he went into a river to receive no more then sprinkling: and so we must think of the Eunuch also, of whom we have little reason so to think, for great folks and nobles, such as he was, love to do as little as may be in contradiction to the flesh, and no more then needs must be in this point of baptism, if at all they stoop to it: for he need not have hindred himself so long in his journey, nor diseased himself so much in his body, as to have descended out of his chariot, and after <hi>into</hi> the water, but might much rather have sent <hi>Philip,</hi> or his servant to have fetcht so much water in the hollow of his hand, as would have served very well to have sprinkled him, if no more then so had been required.</p>
               <p>Fourthly it had been stark non-sense for <hi>Mark</hi> to have said of Christ as he doth <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.9. he was baptized of <hi>Iohn in</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Iordan,</hi> if he were not dipt, or if by baptized we must understand sprinkled, for he was sprinkled into the River is as absurd and unelegant English, as to say he was dipt into the rain.</p>
               <p>Secondly it was not by <hi>powring water</hi> upon them, that <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch</hi> were washed: this is the baptism Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> pretends to, as that, and that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which ever he saw dispensed in all his life, as it were disclaiming the way of sprinkling, which yet is your onely wonted way: I believe he saw good cause to be ashamed of owning that any longer for baptism<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as many a one besides him is, who with him puts it off thus, that their baptism is not by the way of <hi>sprinkling,</hi> but <hi>powring of water</hi> upon the infans, <hi>for my part</hi> (saith he p. 134.) <hi>I may say as Mr.</hi> Blake, <hi>that I never saw a child sprinkled, but all that I have seen bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, had water powred on them and so were washed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> saies p. 4. of his answer to Mr. <hi>Blackwood,</hi> that <hi>he never saw nor heard of any sprinkled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O the egregious shifts and shuffling evasions of these men, who perceiving the perverse practise of sprinkling infants summoned, and <hi>sub paena'd,</hi> to come to a trial by the word of God, do disguise it out of its old name, that it hath born with content, and without controul for ages and generations, and doth still among
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:109011:172"/>
many of their own party, till now they begin to see it more strictly then ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after, and likely to come into trouble for its transgression from Christs command) and shroud it under another name, whereby to secure it, so that now they know not, nor ever saw or heard of any such manner of thing done in all the world.</p>
               <p>No Sirs? what never? that is strange: what parts of <hi>Christendome</hi> have you lived, or do you live in? I profess for my part I have lived a Sprinkler of infants my self about some seven or eight years, not only in several parishes, but in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of our <hi>English Christendome,</hi> far distant, yet so far as I remember, I did never see till I came acquainted with the people, whom you nick name <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,</hi> any thing done by any in that particular, that might well bear any other name then that of sprinkling, yea I know where a dispensation of baptism (as twas called) was done so slenderly once to the child of a noted Clergy man, that the father himself was so far in doubt, whether there was so much as sprinkling, or any water at all dropt from the fingers of the Dispenser, that he doubted a while after (whether he do still or no I know not) whether it were not his duty to have it done over again a little better; the Gentleman I speak of, if ever he read this, will surely remember both what, and what Child of his I mean.</p>
               <p>Mean while what more then sprinkling was ever done by my self, or any other in that place, or any other wherever I have been, I cannot call to mind, neither do I know that ever (till of late, that men see advantage lost by it in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy) the name of sprinkling was denyed to what was done in all places of <hi>England,</hi> save such where the manner was, and very newly is upon sight of the falsenesse of the way of sprinkling, to dippe a little more then the tippe of their Noses.</p>
               <p>Besides though the <hi>Rubrick</hi> did prescribe dipping as the onely right form, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in baptism is to be dispensed and in case of weakness declared it sufficient to pour water upon a child, yet what kind of powring was universally used by them who never used dipping, is evident by the <hi>Rubrick,</hi> if we will give it leave to expound it self, for in the Catechism thereof, which is not unknown to Mr <hi>Blake,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> both to have been taught or commanded to be taught all children at any years in all parishes of <hi>England,</hi> this question, <hi>viz.</hi> what is the visible sign or form in baptism? is thus resolved <hi>viz.</hi> water wherein the person baptized is dipped or <hi>SPRINKLED</hi> with it, in the name &amp;c.</p>
               <p>So that howbeit the Bishops were pleased to use the word pouring water (as you do) yet a great piece of pouring it was I promise you that their Priests practised to infants (and it is a chance whether Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> have not in the infancy of their administration, which I suppose was in the bishops reign, done the like, though now happily they make a little better measure, or at least seen the like at some time or other, but me thinks they cannot chuse but have heard of the like in one place of the world or other) a poor piece of pouring, I say when their hands onely being put into water were after held up <hi>perpendiculariter</hi> over the infants face, that it might be wetted a little with what fell <hi>guitatim</hi> from their fingers ends.</p>
               <p>And this hath been the most usual way that I have seen, in respect of which I may say the Priest that administred all commonly by book, and wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hin book, did act beside book, and without book in that service, for howbeit he was in joined to dip the child in the water, as the most expedient way at least, and not so much as to dispence by powring water, unlesse in case of weaknesse onely, yet he made bold, having an inch given him to take an ell, i. e. upon leave granted him to forbear dipping in time of weaknesse only, to forbear dipping altogether, and being authorized by the same Ghostly fathers the Bishops to make powring suffice instead of dipping at such time onely, wherein dipping might not be safely used, to make sprinkling serve instead of pouring also: and in this manner I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:109011:172"/>
the world was gulled by the <hi>Clergy</hi> in <hi>Cyprians</hi> daies, and after, who having the verdict of so grave a Father as <hi>Cyprian</hi> was, that application of water in the bed might stand for baptism in time of sicknesse, in case the sicknesse proved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death (for if they recovered even in his judgement they ought to be had to the River and dipt) for ease sake to the flesh, and such like self ends, made some <hi>slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der slabber</hi> to stand for baptism altogether.</p>
               <p>And that sprinkling only hath been the general way of <hi>England</hi> its evident e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to any, save such, as seeing see not, and have ears and hear not: yea as shy as Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> are of that name sprinkling, as blind and deaf as they would make themselves in this case, as though they never saw nor heard of any sprinkled, yet there are Divines famous in their account, who own it, some of which seem to speak, as if they never heard of such a thing as powring of water in the dispensation of baptism, but only of dipping and sprinkling as the only forms that ever they had the hap to hear of: witnesse (besides several other <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachistical</hi> composures, that I have seen) that specialy of Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> a man not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vindicated by Mr. <hi>Marshall,</hi> but much magnified by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> by the titles of <hi>Rutherfords second, excellent Mr.</hi> Ball, <hi>judicious Mr.</hi> Ball, no <hi>Dull Divine</hi> to be easily misled p. 131.132. which Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> in his <hi>Catachise</hi> p. 24. speaking of the outward sign, element, action, speaks much what as it is in the <hi>Rubrick,</hi> viz. water, wherewith the person baptized is washed by dipping or sprinkling in the name &amp;c. as if he had never seen water poured on a child, but all that ever he saw had been either dipped or sprinkled.</p>
               <p>Nay more then all this, witnesse also the very man that manages this very cause together with them, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> whom I dare say Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> have read, and made no little use of, for he hath furnished them both with sundry of their Arguments against dipping, this man in opposition to <hi>A. R.</hi> which <hi>A. R.</hi> speaking of sprinkling, excludes it by this disjunction, <hi>viz.</hi> that the use of water must be either by infusion or dipping answers thus, not only to the clean contradicting of Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and to the proving of them but so so in their denyals, that ever they saw, or heard of any sprinkled, but also to the excluding of infusion or pouring, which yet in other places he pleads for, which Mr. <hi>Blake and</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> say is the only way, yea all the way that they have seen save dipping, which yet one of them never saw at all, and to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing of sprinkling to be one of the ordinary waies of baptizing: for page. 11. whereas <hi>A. R.</hi> saies the use of water must be either by infusing or dipping, but not by infusing nor sprinkling, for he counts them much what one, therefore by dipping, Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> tells him, as if he had never seen or heard of such a thing as pouring, which is all that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saies he saw in his daies, that <hi>the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry use of the water is one of these two waies, viz. either by dipping or sprinkling</hi> yet Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> that hath read Mr. <hi>Cook, never heard of any sprinkled:</hi> So <hi>Calvin, Tylenus, Buchan,</hi> and all call it either <hi>Aspersim,</hi> or <hi>Immersion:</hi> yet again some Divines seem to speak, as if they never saw nor heard of such a thing as dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, unlesse among the Heretical Anabaptists, which yet is the onely true and primitive form of Baptism, but onely of <hi>pouring on of water or sprinkling,</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse the whole <hi>Synod</hi> of Divines, who in their directory direct the world further out of the way of the word in point of baptism, then the Bishops in their <hi>Rubrick</hi> did, for they in their Liturgy appointed dipping to be done, as the most expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent form, and <hi>powring on water</hi> onely in case of necessity, but the other in theirs directly exclude dipping, as a thing no where appearing to be needful, and order that either of the other shall serve without it: for these are their words p. 45. of the Directory, <hi>viz. He is to baptize the child with water, which for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of doing it, is not only lawful but sufficient, and most expedient to be by powring or sprinkling of the water on the face of the child:</hi> whether any thing that ever hath been done by any in obedience to this directory in that second way
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:109011:173"/>
of sprinkling, which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> denies that he ever saw done, and Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> that he ever heard of as done to any, did ever reach Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> eye, or Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> eare, I leave them seriously to examine; but this I am sure of that the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism of Christ and the Eunuch was dispensed neither by sprinkling as I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above, nor yet by bare pouring on of water which they so plead for: and this I shall now make appear as plainly as the other. For</p>
               <p>First in vain did they descend into the River to have nothing but water poured on them with no greater spout or stream then what runs down contiguously from the hallow of ones hand; but Christ did nothing surely in vain, and <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch</hi> might well have spared their paines in wetting themselves so much, as they must needs do by going down both into the water, and as sufficiently dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged such a service by standing only on the shore.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if by powring you mean the powring of a farre greater quantity of water then what can he held in the hand, as namely out of some scoop, or vessel used to such a purpose upon the face or head, as that might have been done full as well by the water side, if they had not gon down into the water, so it must have been as tedious by running down into their necks and bosomes, and so necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have occasioned the trouble of the shifting of themselves, as very dipping it self can be, or do.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, twas not by washing them in any other way, excepting still that of dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, suppose by applying water to them with their hands or otherwise, and then rubbing it on their bodies, for if so, then this washing must be of their whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, or of some part or parts of them onely, if some part or parts onely, then of those parts which we commonly keep uncovered as the face and hands, or else let it be assigned what other parts, but it was not the face or hands onely that were thus washt, for this again were a very vain thing to go down into the water for, as its said of <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch</hi> that they both did: <hi>frustra fit per plura quod potest fieri per pauciora:</hi> tis meer foolishnesse to fetch a beetle and wedges to cleave a stick no bigger then ones finger, &amp; little wisdome to run so much as ore shoes meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to wash ones face or hands, which may be done as well at the waters side, as in it: if their whole bodies were thus washt, then it must be done either with their clothes on, and that is impossible, for though the whole body may be baptized <hi>i. e.</hi> washt by dipping or swilling it under the water as conveniently, and more comely with clothes on then otherwise, yet they surely have little else to do, and find themselves more work then becomes wise men, that go about to wash persons by rubbing water upon them through their garments, besides while you can totally wash one in that form of washing, Ile wash by dipping at least no less then a score: or else <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utis vestimentis</hi> i. e. stark naked, &amp; that were more immodest then naked dipping.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, nor was it done by <hi>dipping some part</hi> of their bodies onely into wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but the whole, for to dip a person but in part, besides that it is not properly to dipp that person, but onely to dip <hi>some part</hi> of him, is to the dispenser, and the disciple too, <hi>tanta mount</hi> in difficulty if not surmounting a total dipping, yea to dip the whole body of a man at years (for we speak not now of infants, that may at ease be dandled any way in ones armes) is easie enough to the dispenser, when the disciple is once gon down with him into the water, and yields himself to be laid along in it by his hands, but conceive what part of a man you will, except the hands which you will not for shame say is the onely member to be baptized, and Ile say <hi>hic labor, hoc opus est,</hi> tis a matter of no smal difficulty to dip meerly that: for if you will dip a mans head and shoulders onely in the River, you must poise and posture him <hi>Archipodialiter</hi> with his heeles upwards, if his feet and legs onely, you must first at least lift him up wholly, and carry him in clearly from the ground, which kind of dipping men in Rivers, as tis more toilsome surely then that totall dipping, which <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> used, so let him take it, who is minded to make himself more moil then needs, for our parts we have a way
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:109011:173"/>
wherein to do it with more ease, and to do it more sufficiently too, then by the halves.</p>
               <p>As for the other of the Dr. <hi>quibbles viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First (for the rest of them are elsewhere removed) <hi>That the Israelites were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in a cloud, not dipt into it.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> nor sprinkled neither, but onely metaphorically baptized.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>that</hi> Zebedees <hi>children were baptized with blood, the baptism wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Christ was baptized, and yet neither he nor they dipt into blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> Both he and they were baptized with sufferings, shame and contempt, and affliction, and all misery in the world for truths sake i. e. <hi>penè,</hi> yea <hi>penitus submersi,</hi> sunk ore head and ears in deep waters of the proud, going over their souls, and overwhelmed with the waves of the wickeds wrath, prevailing against them for a time, and thats the bloody baptism he speaks of, not litteral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the sprinkling of their own blood upon them, when they were slain, for <hi>Iohn</hi> suffered otherwise, but his blood was not shed at all.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>that the fathers speak of the baptism of tears but no dipping in that baptism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> we mind not what your fathers spake <hi>hyperbolically,</hi> but what our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers spake in truth, and plain sobernesse in this case.</p>
               <p>It was therefore a totall dipping certainly, which was then used, and by which Christ and the Eunuch were baptized in the water, and not any other kind of washing there, as the Dr. dreames, which is also evinced yet a little further by this, forasmuch as though the Eunuch was gone down with <hi>Philip</hi> into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet he was not said to be baptized till <hi>Philip</hi> had dipt him therein: for if the wetting or washing, or dipping of some parts of the body onely might passe for sufficient baptism, then as soon as <hi>Philip</hi> had conducted the <hi>Eunuch</hi> into the River, he might have led him out again as a person sufficiently baptized, for he was washt already and dipt so far as to the <hi>Ancles,</hi> but the businesse was not done though the <hi>Eunuch</hi> was in the River, till he had baptized him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into.</p>

               <p>I answer, we may as well say so indeed, for tis a truth as well as the other, they that are baptized <hi>with</hi> the spirit and fire, are also baptized <hi>in</hi> the spirit and <hi>in</hi> fire, and put <hi>into</hi> the spirit, and <hi>into</hi> fire i. e. wholly into a holy flame of zeal for God, and the Gospel, for thats the baptism with fire that is there mainly spoken of, and not as the Dr. divines that outward appearance of cloven tongues onely, like as of fire that sat upon them in the assembly <hi>Act.</hi> 2.3. for that was but a special, accidentall, visible token of Gods presence extraordinarily appearing among those particular persons at that time, baptizing them inwardly with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is no more necessarily incident to all persons that are baptized with fire, and to all those unto whom that baptism with fire is promised, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all the Saints, that repent and believe the Gospel, as well as those that were met on the day of Pentecost, (as we see <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11. where <hi>Iohn</hi> promises the baptism with fire, as well as with the spirit to all penitents, most of which never had that vision of cloven tongues) which appearance of cloven tongues I say, is no more incident to, nor to be expected by all that are baptized with fire, then the appearance of the spirit descending in shape of a dove, and lighting upon Christ at the time, when he was baptized or filled with the spirit, which was much vvhat such another special, casual and visible token of Gods presence as the other, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to, or to be expected by all those that are baptized i. e. filled vvith the holy spirit: and albeit this phrase [<hi>in the spirit</hi>] may seem to sound so non-sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally to Mr, <hi>Cook</hi> out of our mouthes, that are a people of no account vvith him, yet I hope it shall seem congruous enough out of the mouth of the holy spirit, and the holy Apostles themselves, for they use it more then once, or twice in the holy Scripture, and me thinks he should not be, unlesse he be willingly, ignorant of it; for not onely doth <hi>Iohn</hi> say twice <hi>viz.

Iordan</hi> and <hi>Enon,</hi> that their converts might conveniently be baptized, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> being at <hi>Philippi,</hi> and abiding in that City certain daies to preach the Gospel, on the Sabbath, the most likely time of vacuity from other occasions for people to assemble to hear in, went out of the City by a Rivers side, and there sate down, and spake to as many as resorted thither to hear, <hi>viz.</hi> certain women, (for men for the most part were more shy of the Gospel as now they are) that they might conveniently dispense bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism to them, as should imbrace the Gospel, as a certain woman named <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dya,</hi> and her houshold did, and thereupon out of hand were all baptized, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.12. &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Their baptizing where there was much water for this reason, that they might do the work so effectually to every person as by dipping, is a frivolous conjecture, as if there could be no reason, why Iohn should chose a place, where many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were but that he might dipp the whole man in the water, the cause rather seems to be this, because waters in those hot Countryes were rare, and in some places could not be had in a great distance, and because there came multitudes to be baptized, for the dispatching of which they might well seek places of many waters, where <hi>John</hi> and his disciples might at once be imployed, one water of depth sufficient would have served for the use of dipping, for dipping sake he might have sought for a deep, but needed not to seek many waters.</p>

               <p>The question is not whether <hi>Iohn</hi> had no reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that which we alleadge of baptizing, where there was much water, but whether that which we alleadge <hi>viz.</hi> that he might dipt the whole man be not one reason: as for that you bring <hi>viz.</hi> because there came multitudes to be baptized, and that <hi>Iohn</hi> and his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples might at once be imployed in baptizing, that can be no reason at all of their running into rivers to baptize, nor of their dispensing in <hi>Iordan,</hi> In <hi>Enon,</hi> and in places of much water, or in <hi>many waters,</hi> and therefore (for ought I see yet) ours is the onely one: for verily were it not for the sake of totall dipping, they

need not for the multitudes sake that came to be baptized, nor yet for the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes sake who did baptize (I mean <hi>Iohn</hi> and his disciples, who no doubt were all at once imployed in that work) have sought for a place of much water, or many waters: for as one bason of water may well serve to sprinkle a whole parish of many persons, or if not, its easily replenisht, so many persons imployed at once in sprinkling might easily put their hands into one, or if not, might they not easily have it in many basons? what a poor shift is this? <hi>Rivers, Iordan, Enon, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waters, and why? because many were baptizing, and many to be baptized; one water of depth</hi> (quoth Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>) <hi>would have served for the use of dipping: for dippings sake they he might have sought for a deep, but needed not seek many waters:</hi> but would not one water of no great depth, as a <hi>bason,</hi> yea of no depth at all, as a <hi>cock</hi> or <hi>conduit</hi> have served for the use of sprinkling 1000s? for sprinkling sake, even of multitudes, they need have sought for neither <hi>deep wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> nor for <hi>many waters</hi> neither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or if they must needs have had as many waters as they had dispensers, they might quickly have made <hi>many waters</hi> out of <hi>one,</hi> by filling out of <hi>one</hi> well, <hi>one</hi> cock, <hi>one</hi> bucket, many <hi>ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> rejoices in Mr. <hi>Blackwoods</hi> rendring the word <hi>plurally viz.</hi> many waters, which the translators render in the singular <hi>viz.</hi> much water, supposing he hath such a prize in our yielding to read it so, as takes off the whole force of our reason: but I hope he understands himself better then to believe, that by <hi>many waters</hi> is meant <hi>several waters,</hi> waters in several sourses or channels <hi>divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sim, Sigillatim, seor sim sumptae,</hi> divided and a part one from another, for by <hi>many waters</hi> is meant a confluence of much water together, many waters meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one, flowing, running contiguously, and contained jointly in one sourse, river, channel; otherwise in one <hi>River Enon</hi> it could not be said there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waters, for twas but one floud, as <hi>Iordan</hi> was, so that by <hi>Enon,</hi> or <hi>many waters</hi> he must needs understand much water, a sufficiency, a competency of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the occasion in hand, enough to baptize i. e. to dip, and overwhelm in, and not several waters, for several persons at once to sprinkle in, for this might be done easily without much water, and if not without several waters, yet at least in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral basons of water onely, but the other could not: <hi>many shallowes</hi> were sufficient for many to <hi>Rantize,</hi> and be <hi>Rantized</hi> in, but they sought some one <hi>deep,</hi> one <hi>Iordan,</hi> one <hi>Enon</hi> of depth sufficient, those being onely the most fit to <hi>baptize</hi> i. e. to <hi>dip</hi> in.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, it appears plain that the Saints in the primitive time were totally dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, or overwhelmed in water by that denomination that is given to them after baptism <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3.4. where the Romans are said to be <hi>baptized into the death of Christ, and buried with him in baptism into death</hi>: also <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. when the <hi>Collosians</hi> are said to be <hi>buried with Christ in baptism, and therein also rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him, through the faith of the operation of God, who raised him from the dead</hi>:</p>
               <p>Now we all know that he that is <hi>buried,</hi> is totally put under that element wherein he is buried, whatever it be, whether water or earth, and all over co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with it, not sprinkled with a little onely. <hi>Non quaelibet aquae guttula, nec quaelibet terrae globula:</hi> tis not a little parcel of water, sprinkled on a man can denominate him baptized, as tis not a little clod of earth crumbled on a man can denominate him to be <hi>buried,</hi> for baptism is a burial, an ordinance, and visible sign, wherein every believer is to be visibly <hi>buried,</hi> and every one thats truly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, is totally covered, subjected to that element that buries him, and for a time at least translated by it out of sight.</p>

               <p>I am glad to hear you grant so much truth as you do at the present, and I hope you will see the whole out in the end, for all will not own so much, some, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving no doubt what a foundation it laies for us to build firmly upon all that in this point we contend for, do rather choose to deny this truth that baptism <hi>signifies,</hi> or at least that it <hi>resembles</hi> a death, and resurrection, then by owning it, be forc't to own the true way of baptism indeed.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>As for the representation of the death and resurrection, that is not properly the inward grace signified by baptism, but the washing the soul in the laver of regeneration, and clensing us from our sinnes,</hi> but I can little lesse then admire that he above all men, who quotes the <hi>Rubrick</hi> with little lesse authority, then he doth the bible, and hath no question little lesse then an 100 times in his daies taught little children the <hi>catachism</hi> contained therein, should quite forget to learn it himself, for there its set down plainly, that the inward and spritual grace sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by the outward sign of baptism, is death unto sinne, and a new birth unto Righteousnesse; and besides he knew that in true regeneration, there is a death and resurrection.</p>

            <div type="section">

               <p>However in the manner of baptism as it is administred in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> there is a resemblance of a death and resurrection, for though the child be not alwayes dipt in water, as the rubrick prescribeth, save onely in case of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, which would be dangerous in cold weather, especiall if the child be weak and sickly, yet the minister dippeth his hand in the water, and plucketh it out again when he baptizeth the infant: and these are the very words of Dr. <hi>Featly</hi> next following the words you quoted, and therefore whether he be right in those or no, I am sure he is in these, for there is a resemblance of death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection in our baptism.</p>

                  </gap> there ought to be a resemblance of a death and resurrection in right baptism, he rather goes another way to work <hi>viz.</hi> to patch up a proof of it that there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblace of a death and resurrection in that administration of it, that is used in <hi>England</hi>; but tis in such a way me thinks as may well make all the <hi>seers</hi> asham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and <hi>Divines</hi> confounded, specially you that so dote on that Doctor as to give up your selves to be so blindly discipled by him (as you do and would have others to do so also) that ever such a piece of doctrine should be delivered (and yet behold you justifie and side with it) by <hi>Englands Doctors</hi> in <hi>Divinity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It seems then you dare nor quite gainsay, but that a representation of a death and resurrection is fit to be made in the manner of baptizing, and that the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath prescribed that it shall be done in such a manner, as may be <hi>tanta mount</hi> thereto <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>dipping,</hi> unlesse of necessity through the infants sicknesse it be done otherwise (yet notwithstanding that prescription of the Church,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:109011:177"/>
which of you priests did ever do any other then sprinkle the healthiest infants?) but because the subject of your baptism in <hi>England,</hi> being an infant, is too tender at all times to be dipt or buried in water (where not that your false subject of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity ingages you to forgo the true way of baptizing, which your selves prescribe unlesse necessity forbid it) because I say the child cannot conveniently be buried with Christ in baptism into death in his own person, therefore (<hi>ecce signum</hi>) this visible death, burial, and resurrection with Christ must be all transacted for him <hi>per alium</hi> i. e. by the ministers hand, that is dipped into water, and brought out again as it were instead of the child.</p>
               <p>And this is even very suitable to all the rest, for all the rest of your service in the point of baptism is done by <hi>representatives,</hi> as little as it <hi>represents</hi> what is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be <hi>represented</hi> by it, and one part would mock the other if this should not be done so too: tis true all is done in the childs name, and in the childs stead, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done that of right ought to be done either by, or to the child himself: The infant indeed is askt, dost thou believe in God? dost thou forsake the divel? wilt thou be baptized &amp;c? but others must answer, and promise, and professe, assent to, and vow all these for him, others mouthes must speak his mind, and theres the profession: again he is spoken to by the <hi>minister</hi> saying to him, I baptize thee i e. <hi>dip</hi> or <hi>bury</hi> thee with Christ in baptism into death, for so tis in a little plainer Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, and true sense and intent of the service, but alas its nothing but the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters hand that is dipt, buried, raised again with the drips that hang upon which the infant is onely <hi>rantized,</hi> and there is the <hi>resemblance</hi> of the death, burial and resurrection: but I trust Sirs you will understand at last that when <hi>Paul</hi> saies to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Colossians</hi> that they were buried and raised in baptism, he doth not mean that the dispensers hands, but that their bodies were put under water, and brought out again, in respect of which they were said to be buried into death, and are raised again, i. e. not spiritually onely, and really in respect of the soules dying to sinne, and living to righteousnesse, but outwardly, visibly, bodily in water also, and this significatively, and representatively of the other, and this is my third argument for total dipping.</p>

               <p>If that be granted you will not easily withstand the other, yet that is granted by the most, and must be granted by all whether they will or no: as for Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> themselves they neither of them seem to me to deny, but that such a thing as a death and resurrection are signified in baptism, yea Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> affirms it, yea, <hi>who questions</hi> saith he p. 19. <hi>but our justification and sanctification, or remission of sins, together with mortification and vivification are signified by baptism</hi>? and he saies right, for none can, and I think none doth deny it, but Dr. <hi>Featley,</hi> of all Divines that I know of: yea <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Zanchee</hi> both assert it in their several expositions upon these very places <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2.12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This participation in death</hi> saith Calvin, <hi>is principally to be respected in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, for not onely purgation, but also mortification, and the dying of the old man is proposed there, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And of spiritual circumcision</hi> Paul <hi>maketh two parts</hi> saith Zanchee, <hi>the first he calleth buriall with Christ, the other resurrection with him, and of both these he maketh baptism the sign &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neverthelesse our above named opposers will at no hand give way, that there should be any representation or resemblance made in baptism of these two things, which are the prime significations of it, by putting under water and plucking out

again: yea they seem to chide with their several <hi>Antagonists. A. R.</hi> and <hi>C.

               <p>But if it please you to have patience with me so long, sith those two are the maine men that (beside the Doctor whose repulse is not worth a rush) so mainly oppose our Argument from <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.

               <p>Mr. <hi>Cooks</hi> defence is as followes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What you go about to gather</hi> saith he <hi>from Col.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. <hi>I know not, unlesse this, that as Christ was buried, abode in the grave three daies, and then rose again, So your party baptized must be put under the water, abide there some considerable time, and then come up again, for if you presse a simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of Christs death in going down into the water, and of his resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or comming up out of the water, why not also of his abode three daies by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding three daies or some considerable time, under the water? which will make bad work, neither can any such thing be gathered from those Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I would demand two Questions</hi> (saith he) 1. <hi>How you gather from these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a dipping of the whole man over head and under water? and that a simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Christs death, burial and rising again, to be represented by dipping in water, is signified here? these Scriptures shew indeed that the end of our bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism is to seal our communion with him in his death, and resurrection, by which we are dead to sin, and raised again to holinesse: but if you will presse hence a resurrection by our descending into, abiding in, and comming up out of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, take heed least you be one of those, which adde to Gods word, least he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove you as a lyar, and adde unto you the plagues written in his book, for I know no word of God, wherein this representation is necessarily implyed, much lesse expressed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Besides if you urge death and resurrection to be resembled by descension into, and ascension out of the water you must urge also burial, which is principally there expressed by the biding of the whole man, head and all under for a time, answerable to Christs three daies burial, which cannot be without danger, yea certainty of drowning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If it should be granted that a representation and resemblance of Christs death, burial and resurrection is set before us in baptism, and so of our death to sin, and rising again to holinesse, yet I demand why this may not as well be by infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of water as dipping? can you give me an example of so many killed and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by immersion, or dipping into the water, as I can give of them that have been put to death and buried by infusion of water? I am sure a whole world of men and other creatures (those few that were in the Ark only excepted) were buried in the universal deluge at once by infusion, not by dipping: so that infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or sprinkling may as well clearly signifie death and burial as dipping: and to the preservation of Noah and those that were with him in the Ark (on which waters were poured) from drowning: the Apostle compares baptism as its Anti-type.</hi> Thus far Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> p. 16, 17.</p>
               <p>And then again p. 19, 20.21. he undertakes further <hi>viz.</hi> to argue back again upon us at large, and to prove, that if there must needs be a resemblance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation in baptism of the things, that are signified therby, then it may be as well, nay must be rather by washing, pouring sprinkling then by dipping and putting under

                  <hi>Secondly, with as good reason one may plead thus, that tis most convenient that at the supper every communicant should receive his belly full of bread and wine, and take as long as his stomack and head will hold, to signifie the full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment of the soul with the body and blood of Christ; but who would endure</hi> saith he, <hi>such reasoning</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>These outward elements of water, bread and wine are for spiritual use, and to signifie spiritual things, so that if there be the truth of things, the quantity is not to be respected further then is sufficient for its end, namely to represent the spiritual grace, and that it be neither so little as not clearly to represent it, nor so much as to take off the heart from the spiritual to the corporal thing: yea the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall grace and visible act of God upon the soul signified, and represented by the outward act of baptism</hi> viz.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The application of Christs blood, and donation of the spirit is exprest in Scripture by the name of powring, sprinkling, and that probably, if not certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with allusion to the administration of baptism</hi> Isa. 44.3. Joel 2.28. <hi>I will powre out my spirit upon all flesh,</hi> Ezech. 36.26. <hi>Ile sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean, this clean water questionlesse is the blood and spirit of Christ represented in the water of baptism, so in the new testament</hi> Act. 2. Heb. 10.22. 1 Pet. 1.2. Heb. 9.13. and 14. verses <hi>compared together and</hi> Heb. 12.24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now</hi> (saith he) <hi>let any one without prejudice consider these Scriptures, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at least some of them speak not in allusion to baptism, and whether baptism be not a lively resemblance and representation of the things here spoken of, and withall let him consider whether the thing exhibited in this sacrament, be ever so fully set forth by dipping, and then I leave him to judge whether sprinkling be not as, if not more, agreeable to the nature of this sacrament as dipping or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersion.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>If by baptism</hi> saith he <hi>we are planted into the likenesse of Christs death, and also made partakes of his resurrection, will it follow therefore that there must be some ceremony in the application of the water to resemble it? if you may take this liberty of argument, give me leave</hi> saith he <hi>to attempt the like, and with as good reason to conclude, that baptism must be no other then sprinkling, that
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:109011:178"/>
there may be proportion between it, and that sprinkling of blood and water, that did foreshadow it: or baptism must be onely by powring of water, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a lively representation between that and pouring out of the holy spirit; or that baptism must be by washing with water only, there being a lively proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that, and washing away of sins by Christs blood; you see</hi> (saith he) <hi>what you will gain from these disputes from Analogy and proportion.</hi>

                  <hi>Cook</hi> of whom I may truly say so little do I ken what the man means by it, that he both grants us full as much as we desire, and yet denies us too no lesse then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing we would have; denying indeed, to the contradiction of himself, the very self same things that yet he grants: the truth is I know not what to call it but confusion, nor find I a way how to reconcile some parts of it to the rest, so full of variance it is within it self: one while he grants, asserts and argues the same in general that we do, <hi>viz.</hi> that the spiritual grace, or thing signified in baptism is, and ought to be represented, or resembled in that outward sign, and <hi>that respect is to be had that the outward element of water, which is to signifie the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al thing be used, as to the quantity of it, though not further, yet so far as may be sufficient to its end, which end</hi> (saith he mark his phrase in this passage p. 20) <hi>is to represent</hi> (which is as much as to say to resemble, or lively to set out to our eyes) <hi>that spiritual grace or thing signifyed, and that it be not so little as not clearly to represent it</hi>; yea and which is more, and as much as we say our selves he grants, and asserts it for undoubted truth that the spiritual grace, or thing sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by baptism is (among other things) a death and resurrection: <hi>for who questions</hi> (saith he p. 19.) <hi>but our justification and sanctification or remission of sins together with mortification and vivification</hi> (which is as much as to say those two parts of our sancti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>And in all this he sides so sourdly with us, and jumps so just into our opinion, that if we did hire him to speak our mind for us to the world, we could scarce de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire him to propound it more plainly than he doth, bating only his stiling baptism by the name of a seal, instead of which I wish he would call it only a sign: yea he gives us all that in this case we contend for from those Scriptures, <hi>viz.</hi> that the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual grace or thing signified in baptism is to be therein also represented, and that our death and resurrection by vertue of Christs is that thing that is signified there, or that spiritual grace the signifying of which other things not excluded) is the chief end of our baptism.</p>
               <p>Otherwhiles again he gain saies this grant, speaking of it suppositively onely as page 17.</p>

                  <hi>If</hi> (saith he) <hi>it should be granted that a representation and resemblance of Christs death, burial and resurrection is set before us in baptism, and so of our death to sin and rising again to holinesse,</hi>

               <p>As if he were never the man that had granted, as you see he doth, or ever would grant, or give way to such a thing, and not only so, but as if he were loath, and half angry that any man should speak the truth but himself, or the same truth with himself, he charms <hi>A.

                  <hi>That our mortification and vivification by vertue of Christs death and resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is the spiritual grace or thing signifyed, and that respect or care must be had in the administration of it, that the quantity of water be sufficient clearly to represent the spiritual grace</hi> [but how that can be without enough to be buried in water and raised again, what ere he thinks I know not] <hi>but if you vvill,</hi> saith he, <hi>presse hence a necessity of Resemblance of Christs death, buriall and resurrecti- by our descending into, abiding in, and comming up out of the water, take heed least you be of those that adde to Gods word; least he reprove you as a lyar, and adde unto you the plagues written in his book, for I know not any Word of God, wherein this representation is necessarily implyed, much lesse expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</hi>

                  <pb n="341" facs="tcp:109011:179"/>Thus whereas he saies elsewhere, as I have shewed above, that the end of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism was to represent the spiritual grace as well as signify it, and that the spiritual grace, or thing signified, and to be cleerly represented is mortification and vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, or communion with Christs death and resurrection (which things tis strange he should say against the word of God, for he protests it to be against the word when we say it, and if there be any word expressing or implying a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation, which himself so much talks on, I am sure there is none like those two which we produce, <hi>viz. Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. which most lively shew it, as I shall shew anon, and undeniably declare) yet here in the passage last cited, he that talks of this representation, and resemblance of Christs death and resurrection, and ours with him, as needful to be made in baptism, is a lyar with him and an adder to the word, which warrants no where to presse a resemblance of the thing signified in the dispensation of the outward sign, no not so much as in those Scriptures <hi>Rom</hi> 6. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. So this representation in baptism is with him it seems a matter that must be, and yet must not be, and yet must be.</p>
               <p>And yet for all this (which is the wonder of me, and will be of many more, but specially of every wise man, that hath his wits about him, and would have bin of Mr <hi>Woodcock</hi> too, who without taking notice of any weaknesse in it, extoll'd the Book in the beginning of it, and put it forth to Sir <hi>Iohn Burgoines</hi> patronage, had he well weighed these passages of it) Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> wheeles about once again, and will needes have a representation and resemblance of the thing signified by baptism in the manner of administration of it, and argues stiffely for it to, but the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation must be of what he pleases among the things signified, and not of the main thing signifyed in baptism, it must be of sanctification as tis called a washing a cleansing, a purging, a pouring of the spirit on us, a sprinkling of the blood of Christ on us, and so be done by sprinkling water: but not as it stands divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its two parts mortification and vivification, a death and resurrection: or else if there must be a resemblance of this death and resurrection in baptism, then by an <hi>As for example</hi> fetcht from the old world, that was drowned, dead, buried by an infusion of water, not an immersion, and from the Ark which was rained up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only, and not overwhelmed, this death and resurrection must needs, and may better be resembled by an infusion and sprinkling then by total immersion or dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in water, for if we urge to have the death and resurrection resembled by dipping. i. e. a descension into the water, and ascention out of the water, which we all know was the way of Christs and the Eunuchs baptism, we must urge also burial, which is principally expressed. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. to be resembled too, by biding of the whole man under the water for some time, answerable to Christs three daies biding in the bowels of the Earth, which cannot be without danger, quoth he, yea certainty of drowning: and if sprinkling should not so fitly resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as dipping and plunging, yet the Scripture no where requires the washing of the whole body, to all which I answer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> 1. which thing of his called sprinkling of water on the face, for all he saies it may as well or better (sith so many were of old killed and buried by sprinkling, or raining on them in the daies of <hi>Noah</hi>) serve to resemble our death, and burial then dipping does, yet in truth resembles a death, burial, and resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, little more then a knock o'th' pate.</p>
               <p>Secondly, which drowning of the old world, as it would make not a jot for such a purpose as he pleads for, had it been by such a way as he dreames it was by <hi>viz.</hi> sprinkling, raining on them, by <hi>infu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="342" facs="tcp:109011:180"/>
them ore head and ears: and if he call that <hi>sprinkling</hi> and <hi>infusion,</hi> let him <hi>sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle</hi> or <hi>infuse</hi> water in such abundance, till the water sprinkled or infused, become of such depth about the parties he is about to sprinkle, as to swell ore their heads, and to swill them wholly under it, and I shall own such infusion for right baptism, yet none of Christs ordinance neither, unlesse dispenst to a right subject i. e. babes or beginners in the faith.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, which elegant allusion of his to the ark, as that on which water was onely powred or sprinkled, whence he seemes to argue thus <hi>viz.</hi> that it rained onely on the Ark, or water was onely powred or sprinkled upon the Ark, which Ark was a type of baptism,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> baptism must be dispenst by sprinkling, is as simple a delusion as ever was devised, for if he intend that for an argument to prove that baptism is to be done by sprinkling (and if not what does it there?) it does rather conclude that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism must be sprinkled as the Ark was, for reduce his matter into the form of a syllogism, and see how sillily it concludes <hi>viz.</hi> thus
<q>
                     <p>The Ark was a Type of baptism.</p>

                  </gap>hen he can possibly squeeze out from those premises, and another thing then what is asserted of the Ark in his <hi>minor</hi>: whereas in right form it should run thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Ark typified baptism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Ark was rained on, baptized or wetted by infusion onely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo baptism must be rained on, baptized or wetted by infusion onely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then what simple stuff were this? what a logical lump of artificial non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense?</p>
               <p>Besides, if it would follow that because the Ark which was a type of baptism was sprinkled, therefore the way of baptism is sprinkling, it would more truly follow that because the Ark was half dipt and half sprinkled, one part of it being under the water, another sprinkled with rain aboue the water, therefore the way of baptism is to dip one half of the person, and to sprinkle the other half: but alas the Ark was a type of baptism, as twas the way and outward meanes of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but not in this respect as it was rained on: <hi>nullum simile currit Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, which washings, purgings, sprinklings of Christs blood, and clean water typified of old, and foreshadowed by the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool, and hysop, wherewith <hi>Moses</hi> and the high priests after him sprinkled the old <hi>Israel,</hi> so that they were typically and ceremonially count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed holy, and clean thereupon in a fleshly sense onely, are all expressions spoken not with such allusion to baptism (as Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> imagines) nor are so neer a kin to it as he laies claim to: for if they are all to be resembled and respected by us in our baptism, as things some way or other signified to us therein, yet are they not at all the main, or principall things, or such as are immediately, or prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, but onely remotely, and secondarily signified to us therein, and so not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily to be either all, or at all so much resembled as something else: But the death, burial and resurrection of Christ, which is the rise and root, the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and meritorious cause of all the rest, being that which (though you would shut it out altogether from its interest and right of being represented in baptism of all the rest) is mainly and most immediately signified, and primarily to be eyed, and respected, and all the rest but consequently, and through that, therefore its necessary that this should be resembled most lively, that it may take the deeper impression upon us.</p>
               <p>Yea these matters of Christs death, burial, and resurrection are such <hi>cardinall</hi> things to be considered, as <hi>quibus non mediantibus,</hi> without the mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:109011:180"/>
of which we cannot conceive clearly, nor lay claim to any of the other as ours.</p>
               <p>For as in the supper remotely heaven it self, and all spirituall excellencies are signified to us to be ours, yet all the things signified cannot be represented to the eye, but onely such as are the more immediate significations of it, and are the rise and proper cause of all the rest, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ crucified, and our feeding on him by faith, the seare, and are to be lively set forth unto us, and resembled before our eyes in bread and wine broken, and powred out and received and applied to us, but not all the fruits of his dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h and our faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even so it is likewise in baptism; and indeed the main signification in both is <hi>Christs</hi> person crucified, dead, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and raised, and that is to be resembled in both, and other things <hi>viz.</hi> the benefits of his death as remission of sins, and purging, &amp;c. to be consequentially gathered from that, neither can, nor are, nor need all those to be resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled:</p>
               <p>But as for Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> he pleads stifly to have all these resembled <hi>viz.</hi> washing, purging, powring, sprinkling of the spirit and blood of Christ, but excludes the main thing altogether <hi>viz.</hi> Christs death and resurrection, which are the very rise and ground of all those: And yet if he will needs have all those to be resembled, are they not as much, and much more resembled by dipping and plunging a person in water, then by powring and sprinkling a little water upon him? and is not swilling under water a more effectuall way of washing and clensing then sprinkling? which though it be a <hi>Diminutive</hi> way of wetting, yet in truth is no way of wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all: If therefore he will have washing, and such a washing as well de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>serves the name of clensing to be resembled in baptism, can he have even that done in a better way then by dipping<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or dousing? for verily plunging, is a washing, and a more eminent way of washing, and purifying, and so more lively resembling <hi>ablutionem peccatorum</hi> the purging away our sinnes by the blood of Christ, then aspersion, or bare infusion, either of which without some after rubbing is a way of washing and clensing seldome used by men or women, unlesse it be among flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes that are minded to leave things as foul well nigh as they find them: and I am sure theres no rubbing succedaneous to your sprinkling, which is any ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to your dispensation, for what the priest drops on the midwife rubs indeed, not <hi>on,</hi> but <hi>off,</hi> and so as that is no washing, so (if it were) I hope you do not allow the midwife to give equal influence with the priest unto the dispensation of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</p>
               <p>Besides, both sprinkling and powring are vertualy implied in plunging, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in water, but these are not at all supposed in the other, every lesser wetting being contained, and included in the greater, not so the greater in the lesse.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, which quirk of his concerning a necessity of abiding 3. daies under water answerable to Christs 3 daies buriall, if we will needs urge an necessity of resembling him in his death, burial and resurrection, is so fond, that a fool may find enough wherewith to refel it, for <hi>Mr. Cook</hi> knows that <hi>nullum simile cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit quatuor,</hi> no similitude answers in all things, besides tis the truth and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the thing, not the circumstance, or quantity of time of abode, which is to be respected here, for a burial is as true a burial, when a person abides but 3. minutes wholly under the element, wherein he is buried, as if he abode 3. daies, and a burial is as truly represented by being once under water, as if one continued under altogether, and the resurrection a little better by being brought up again alive, then if one lay till he were altogether dead.</p>
               <p>Sixthly and lastly, which assertion of his, uttered in favour of his assertion <hi>viz.</hi> that the Scripture no where requires the washing of the whole body, is so much the more savouring of either ignorance, or forgetfulnesse in him, or both, by how much one of the very Scriptures, that are quoted by himself, as speaking in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

               <p>But first, I must tell you I observe you know not greatly what to say among you against our urgings of a resemblance of Christs death, and burial, and resurrection from these Scriptures: for some of you stand it out, as much as you well can, that there is not to be any representation of a death and resurrection, as Dr. <hi>Featley</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> both do, the Dr. keeping at such a distance from it, that to fence it farr enough from him he denies any such thing to be so much as signified, Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> yielding that that very thing among others is signified, and that the spiritual grace or thing signified is to be represented too, only you must excuse him as to that piece of the spiritual grace, all the rest but that he will give way to have resembled, but fearing least it can hardly be so cleerly evaded, but that twil needs be proved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them that a death, burial and resurrection must be represented, they fall a proving it that there may be, and is a death burial and resurrection reselmbled in their way of sprinkling, and infusion, as much (if not more then in our way of dipping) but either of them shift for themselves in severall wayes, the Drs way wherein he proves there is a resemblance of death and resurrection in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of baptism, as it is administred in the Church of <hi>England</hi> is this, <hi>though the child be not dipped in water himself</hi> (saith he) <hi>yet the minister dippeth his hand in water und plucketh it out again when he baptizeth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant,</hi> where note, that the Doctor doth conceive that though sprinkling may serve to represent a death and resurrection, as well as our dipping, yet it is upon this absurd account <hi>viz.</hi> in that there is a certain dipping accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies their sprinkling, whereby that resemblance is made <hi>viz.</hi> the divping the hand of the Administrator: but Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> though he be not so gross as to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine with the Dr. that the burying of the ministers hand wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of burying the persons body, which is, if any burial be at all, to be buried in baptism, yet he is as grosse in his conception another way, while he goes about to prove sprinkling, or infusion it self to resemble a death burial and resurrection as sufficiently as dipping, and this too by such a coined <hi>Chymaera,</hi> such a crude and immature imagination as is ridiculous, <hi>viz.</hi> of the old worlds being drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and buried by no more then sprinkling, and the fall of rain: for verily neither was the rain a resemblance of a death, burial and resurrection, or any thing like thereto: nor yet was it the rain but the overflowing of waters by reason of the rain that drowned them, and though that orewhelming was a lively emblem of death and burial, as baptism is to be, yet there was nothing that resembled a resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, as in baptisme there must be, sith they never rose from under it any more.</p>

                  </gap>arre more ridiculous then ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, and yet I know more men of his mind in this particular, I mean so far as to agree to it, with lesse ado then he doth, that a death, burial and resurrection is to be resembled in baptism, and yet to think that the sprinkling or casting water upon the party doth sufficiently make that resemblance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I testify to him that this his way is his folly, and theirs also that approve his sayings, and I advise both him and them that adhere to him to be heartily ashamed of two opinions of his, so equally odd and absurd that I can scarce tell well which of the two are more absurd then the other.</p>
               <p>The one is his supposition that the spiritual grace to be represented and resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in the manner of administration of that ordinance of baptism is sprinkling, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sprinkling with the blood of Christ, whence in order thereto he as unworthily argues, that baptism must be dispensed by sprinkling, which indeed nullifies it from being baptism, if he consider the inconsistency that is proved to be between them.</p>
               <p>The other is the thing in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> his supposition that sprinkling may well not only signify, but resemble a death, burial and resurrection as well as dipping, and is as well required, for so he hints p. 19. to be used in this Sacrament as the other.</p>
               <p>If those, who own these things, and whose own they are, will not be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of them, for my part I am, for to think that the wisdome of the spirit, that in condescension to our dull capacities did leave visible signs to be not only true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances, but also lively resemblances of spiritual things, should order things so unsuitably to sense, as to require and appoint matters utterly unlike one another, and between which there is no <hi>Analogy</hi> at all to answer one the other by way of resemblance, <hi>viz.</hi> such a thing as rantism to resemble a death, burial and resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, which are to be, and are truly resembled all in true baptism, i. e. in dipping, or appoint such an ordinance as baptism, which in plain English is dipping, to resemble rantism only, or sprinkling with Christs blood is no lesse the absurdity in the abstract.</p>
               <p>But as for you your self, you are it seems of Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> mind, i. e. resolved to own no necessity at all of any resemblance of any thing, nor of any ceremony to be in the sign of baptism, representing the things signifyed in it, I shall therefore shew that as in true baptism, i. e. dipping, there is <hi>de facto,</hi> and that Mr <hi>Blake</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses, so there ought to be <hi>de jure</hi> a proportion and resemblance of the death and resurrection of Christ, and of ours with him in that ordinance: whereas there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you say that all signes do not represent the thing signified thereby, tis true who questions that? but twill not therefore follow, but that there are some signs that both do, and may and by institution must not only signify, but also resemble at least the main things that are signified, of which sort baptism is without question one.</p>

               <p>But I pray Sirs be not pickers and chusers thus at your own pleasure, but if you will have an analogy to be held, let it be in such things, wherein it should be held between the old testament sacraments and the new.</p>

               <p>This shewes indeed that twas the opinion of these Reverend men, that there ought to be of necessity as cleer a resemblance as may be of the thing signified in the administration of the outward, and visible sign in all sacraments, or else they are no sacraments, but that is nothing binding to us without some good ground out of Scriptures to believe it, therefore lets see it appear from thence, and if you will from the Scriptures you began upon <hi>Rom. 6. Col. 2.</hi> in which I see nothing on which you can ground, that in baptism there must be visibly, and representatively a death, burial and resurrection, though I grant all these are signifyed thereby.</p>

               <p>I rejoice much to see you renounce that implicit faith, whereby you have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly lived, it may be more upon the mouth of <hi>Calvin, Vrsin, Austin,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Authors, then on the mouth of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> or the mouth of Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in his word; neither do I urge any thing out of these Authors to be taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on trust without trial, yet prove what they say however in this point, and hold it fast too, if by the word you find it to be good.</p>
               <p>I come therefore to consider that which first occasioned all this discourse, and to see if such a matter as a death, burial and resurection of Christ, be not here expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, or at least implyed, neither of which yet is granted by Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> or Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> as things to which true baptism is to bear some resemblance, and here let me tell you though you and the rest are engaged to make the best of your <hi>rantism,</hi> now

you see it questioned, and have begun in the face of the world to defend it, will sooth men up, and tell them there is none but the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> gather that there must be a representation of death, burial and resurrection from those places, and such like, yet we are not alone in our assertions even from those places, that these are to be resembled: for some that wrote impartially upon the places, Rom. 6. Col. 2. even of your own way before the matter came so much in question, have shewed their sense therof to be the same with ours, as concerning the representation of all these; witnesse one Mr. <hi>Thomas Wilson,</hi> who in an exposition of his upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. declares from the 3 and 4 verses thereof in this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That baptism is a pledge of our sanctification in all the parts of it thus, the death of sin</hi> (saith he) <hi>is effectually represented by the water cast on us at our bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> (though by his favor, who was I perceive of Mr. <hi>Cooks</hi> conceit that infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion might serve turn, not half so effectually as by the water overwhelming us) <hi>the burial of sin by our being under the water, and by our comming out of the water our arising out of our sins to a better life through the power of the holy spirit applying Christs death and burial for the beating down of our corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and his Resurrection for our quickening to godlinesse of living.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus he, Neither is he alone in this sense upon these places, but most, if not all modern writers, that do purposely, or but occasionally touch upon these places, as <hi>Calvin, Vrsin, Paraeus, Tilenus, Zanky,</hi> &amp;c. do fully agree with him in this particular, <hi>viz.</hi> that the lively resemblance of Christs death, burial and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, and of ours with him, that is to be held forth in the administration of Baptism, is among other things signified in those Scriptures, and do with him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the words <hi>baptized in his death, buried with him in baptism into death, wherein yee are also risen with him</hi> &amp;c. not of the things signified only, <hi>viz.</hi> our Mortification of sin and rising to holinesse in a way of likeness to Christs death and resurrection, but also of the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tward right and form of administration of the sign it self, to be done in a way of likenesse to them both, so that we by that (as by an image or lively resemblance) may not only be kept in a lively remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the matter of them, but may bear the manner of those matters also in our minds.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Calvin l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 15. <hi>s.</hi> 5. <hi>Alterum fructum affert baptismus qui nostram in Christo Mortificationem ostendit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>id est, another fruit of baptism is this, it sets forth our death to sin in Christ and our new life in him, fitly, as the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel saith</hi> Rom. 6.3. <hi>we are baptized into his death, and buried with him in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism into death that we might walk in a new life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which words he doth exhort us to an imitation of him, as if he should say we are admonished by baptism, that by a resemblance of Christs death, we should dy to our lusts, and by the example of his resurrection, we should rise to righteousness &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Also l. 4. c. 16. s. 16. speaking against such as say (no more then truth though) <hi>Baptismum esse sepulturam, in quam nulli nisi jam mortui tradendi sunt,</hi> id est, <hi>That Baptism is a form or way of burial with which none, but such as are i. e. ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be already dead to sin, or to have repented from their dead works are to be buried.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that he might vindicate infants who yet in infancy cannot dy to sin, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent from dead works, tells us (but believe him who will in that.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nos jam ante Mortuos per baptismum sepeliri,</hi> id est, <hi>That persons are to be buried in baptism, before they be dead, before they repent, or appear to have died to sin,</hi> and to prove that, he cotes this very place <hi>Rom</hi> 6.4. which the scripture (saith he) <hi>Deserte reclamet, nos ea conditione in mortem sepeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri, ut emoriamur ac mortificationem istam exinde meditemur, i. e.</hi> very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legantly proclaims the contrary, namely, that <hi>we are buried in baptism in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, on this very condition, that we may die to sin, and may even by
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:109011:184"/>
that outward visible burial we have in baptism be minded of the duty of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which Exposition is the truth, yet not the whole truth, nor yet so much as serves the turn Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> brings it for: tis true we are baptized into death, or buried in baptism in token that we must, and on this condition that we shall dy to sin, yet not only so, but also in token, and on condition that we are dead in a measure, or have repented already; nor doth it follow because we are buried in baptism, that we may, and in token that we must die more, and more to sin, that therefore we are to be buried in baptism before we die to sin, for we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent before baptism and after it also.</p>
               <p>But however the truth that is in it is enough to serve our turn at present, i. e. to prove his Judgement and ours to jump together, as to the true intent and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of those phrases in the text, viz. <hi>buried with him in baptism into death,</hi> which both hee and we take to expresse the outward rite of baptism, and that that outward rite be performed answerably to the name here given it in manner and form of a burial, which cannot be without submersion, and this too in token, and as a resemblance of our death to sin and burial with Christ, the <hi>signatum</hi> or thing signifyed and resembled, which whether it go before or come with or after the sign is not material.</p>
               <p>And though Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> and we are twain and cannot agree whether we are to be baptized, i. e. buried in baptism before we are dead to sin or after, yet herein we meet in one with all other Expositors on this place so far as I find (Mr <hi>Cook</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> only excepted) viz. that whether <hi>Mortui</hi> or <hi>Morituri</hi> we ought to be buried in baptism according to this place, not spiritually only, for that is the inward thing signifyed into which, i. e. in token and resemblance of which we are outwardly buried, but visibly and representatively also in the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
               <p>Much what to the same purpose speaks <hi>Calvin</hi> again about three or four pages after, 'where coting both the places we are now in hand with, <hi>viz. Romans</hi> 6.4. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He Expounds the words <hi>buried with Christ in baptism</hi> of the verity of the outward rite it self, representing and betokening the spiritual death to sinne that ought to follow it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paraeus</hi> also upon <hi>Vrsin</hi> p. 375. speaking how baptism is a token not only of remission of sin, but regeneration also, which he makes so synonimous with our death and burial with Christ that he cotes these these two places <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. to prove regeneration to be signifyed in it, (for <hi>we are said</hi> (saith he) <hi>to dy and to be buryed with Christ in baptism</hi>) gives this as one reason why we are said to be regenerated that is, in his sence, dead and buried with Christ in baptism, because of the likenesse that is between baptism and those things: so that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so takes the phrase <hi>buried with Christ</hi> in that place to sound forth <hi>Sepelitionem externam internae simulacrum,</hi> that external act of being buried in water by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, that is the lively embleme of the internal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zanchy</hi> also upon Col. 2.12. writes thus viz. <hi>Regenerationis duae sunt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of Regeneration there are two parts Mortification and vivification, that is called burial with Christ, this resurrection with Christ, the sacrament of both these is baptism, in which we are overwhelmed or buried, and after that do come forth and rise again; it may be said truly but sacramentally of all that are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed that they are buried with Christ and raised with him, yet really only of such as have true faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I appeal to all men whether he do not here expound <hi>Paul</hi> in the words <hi>buried with him in baptism and therein risen with him</hi> as speaking of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward rite of baptism whereby the spiritual death and resurrection is resembled, yea and so lively resembled that even such as have no more then the bare outward sign of water in baptism without the thing signifyed may be said, though <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally,</hi>
                  <pb n="351" facs="tcp:109011:184"/>
i. e, and <hi>analogically</hi> and in respect of neer resemblance yet truly to be buried and raised with Christ, this cannot be said of them that are but <hi>rantized</hi> onely, for if in respect of any <hi>Mortification</hi> and <hi>vivification</hi> they may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated buried and raised with Christ, yet that outward rite and ceremony cannot of it self denominate them so much as Sacramentally buried and raised with Christ, for there is not so much as any likenesse of such things in it, but he that hath the true outward rite of baptism, i. e. dipping dispensed to him may be truly said to be buried and raised with Christ, though he have no more, for he hath the same visible overwhelming, and burying in water and raising again in baptism, which in the bare ordinance of baptism Christ himself had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bucan</hi> also that famous professor of <hi>Theology</hi> though he were so far benighted, by being no doubt accustomed to sprinkling, that he saw not the difference that is between it and dipping so far, but that he supposed one might serve as well as the other, yet cotes this sixt of the <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. and 4. to prove the <hi>Analogy</hi> that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the sign and the thing signifyed in baptism in his 24 question in page 668. <hi>quae est analogia &amp; convenientia signi et rei signatae in Baptismo? optima,</hi> &amp;c. saith he. <hi>What is that Analogy and Agreement which is between the sign and the thing signifyed in baptism? Most apt, forasmuch as in the same Manner as the water washes the body, and clenses it from bodily impurities, so the blood of Christ by its merits washes away our sins and spiritual impurities, and his spirit sanctifyes us. Moreover that immersion into water or aspersion doth most clearly denote Rantismon the sprinkling of the blood of Christ in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Sins, and imputation of righteousnesse; but the abode</hi> (<hi>Quantumvis Momentanea, quantula cunque</hi> saith <hi>Tilenus</hi>) though never so small (so that both these confute Mr <hi>Cooks</hi> fancy of a necessity of 3 daies abode under water; if we will have Christs burial represented) <hi>lively denotes the death &amp; burial of our corruption by vertue of the death &amp; burial of Christ, that is, the mortification of the old man, but the rising out of the water doth most anal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>gically as it were object unto our eyes the resurrection of the new man or our vivification, and newnesse of life and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so our resurrection at the last day:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>See how this man, saving that he shuffles in aspersion and immersion as nothing differing, doth own immersion into water, abode under it, rising out of it as the most admirable way of analogy to signifie and resemble what ever was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled in baptism; again in his 53 question p. 692. he quotes <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with allusion to that Scripture that <hi>Predicatione sacramentali we are said in baptism to die, to be buried, to be raised with Christ, and that baptism con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes our faith in these things, because it doth</hi> pingere mortem &amp;c. <hi>plainly paint out the death, burial and resurrection of Christ, and therein is</hi> documentum &amp;c. <hi>a certain lesson of our renovation, and resurrection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now the reason of all such sacramentall locution, whereby the things signified are said to be done in the outward sign, is</hi> (saith Paraeus) <hi>analogia signi et rei sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natae, tale enim quiddam est res significata in suo genere, quale quiddam est signum in suo genere &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The likenesse that is between the outward sign and the thing signified, for such as the thing signified is in its kind, just such a thing the sign is in its kind for as the water washes away the filth of the flesh, so Christs blood our sinnes, and in such a manner as the sign is outwardly dispensed, so inwardly the thing signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the minister acts without, so God within &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As therefore God within by the power of Christs death and resurrection mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies, buries to sin, and raises us to righteousnesse, so must not the administrator without semblably bury the person in water in baptism unto death and raise him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain unto life? or in token of his resurrection to a new life? if not where is then the analogie? and if no analogie why are we said sacramentally in baptism to be buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and raised? sith the cause of all such sacramental locution is because the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:109011:185"/>
are (as <hi>Austin</hi> saies) pictures of the things signified in them? or is aspersion an action as answerable to a burial and resurrection, and painting it out as lively as submersion and emersion do? <hi>hic murus ahaeneus esto,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I know (as sorry a shift as it is) must be your most inmost shelter, when all is done for it can never be with any colour of reason, nor is it by any reasonable men, that I know, save Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> denied but that baptism must <hi>exinstituto,</hi> according to the word, yea that word <hi>Rom.</hi> 6, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. bear analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy to, and the image of the thing signified, yea and that very thing of all the rest, which are represented therein <hi>viz.</hi> a death, burial and resurrection by being under water, and brought out of it again, though by all that sprinkle tis most heedlessely thought, and therefore as senselessely taught that rantism, i. e. as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persion sets forth those to the life, as much as baptism i. e. immersion or overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>
               <p>Among the rest that write of baptism with any allusion to those Scriptures we are yet in hand with, what learned <hi>Tilenus</hi> saith is worth your animadversion, I confesse the man, though in his judgement he seem clear for our manner of bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing by immersion, submersion, and emersion, as that which was the onely primitive action, and institution, yet is so far benighted by the mist and black vail of implicit faith which hath covered all Christendom, as to suppose that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persion may now serve the turn, and that for sundry reasons some of which are appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently false, and never a one of them worth a straw, which ile repeat and answer as I go; for saith he <hi>Ritus in baptismo est triplex, immersio in aquam, mora sub aquâ, et emersio ex aquâ, quam vis autem immersio usitatior olim fuerit presertim in</hi> Judea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The outward ceremony to be used in baptism is threefold, dipping into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, abode under the water, and rising out of the water, but howbeit this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersion was the usual way in former times, especially in</hi> Judea, <hi>and other warmer Countries, rather then aspersion</hi> [where note that he grants (and who does not but Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> that having once denied it do stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously resist it?) that the primitive way in <hi>Iudea,</hi> and those Regions was totall dipping;] <hi>yet</hi> (saith he) <hi>the circumstance pertaines not to the substance of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi> [which is false, for I have proved that to be no baptism that is but sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.]</p>
               <p>

outward rites themselves do teach, for immersion shadowes out to us the pravity of our nature, dying in us, in which our old man dies and is buried with Christ, the progresse of which benefit, putting forth its power in us by a little abode un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the water points out, even as rising out of the water sets forth a new life, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption being done away: hence it is that baptism is called the washing of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and that whereby we are saved <hi>Titus</hi> 3.5. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. namely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause what is done outwardly by the body in the sign, the same is truly perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and confirmed to believers in the soul; and even therefore both the names, and properties of the sign and the thing signified are very often interchangeably at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to each other by a Sacramentally metonimy.</q>

<q>The Form of baptism is that Analogicall relation of the external and earthly, which are the signes, with the heavenly things, or things signifyed: this relation and most lively similitude, that is between them, is the cause why both the names, and the properties of the signes and things signifyed are frequently given to one another by a familiar me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonimy of the holy Scriptures, wherein baptism is called the washing of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and is said to save us, saith he, and in this respect also (say I) we are said to be buryed and raised in baptism in those places, because of that lively resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of and likenesse to a burial and resurrection that ought by institution to be in the dispensation of baptism, and that is in that institution, if practised as ordained by Christ.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now who would think by all this but that this man had been baptized indeed, i. e. dipped into, buried under, and brought out of the water in his baptism, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance and resemblance of Christs death, resurrection and his own with him? for how does he speak, and that out of these Scriptures we are upon, that we ought thus to be baptized? <hi>and these things are exactly exemplified to us</hi> saith he, as if he had the lively <hi>Effigies</hi> of all that was done to him in his baptism dwelling indelably in his mind, as if he had been truly buried, and raised visibly in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism indeed? and yet behold I believe I may be so bold as to guesse by what he saies in favour of infants sprinkling, and by one thing or other, that he was not baptized all this while, but meerly a Rantist, and none of us in practice, though so much for the way of dipping in his discourses.</p>

of a burial and resurrection necessarily to be held forth in baptism, and that no lesse is necessarily implyed at least in these two places, <hi>Romans</hi> 6. and <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2. or else to leave you without excuse in your disownings of it: For</p>
               <p>First, this will appear plainly; if it be considered that by the word baptized in the texts is undoubtedly meant the outward rite, ceremony, sign and form of the administration of baptism.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if it be considered that the phrase <hi>buried with him and risen with him,</hi> i. e. Christ, doth expressely relate immediately, and specially (if not onely) in those texts to that outward sign it self, as that in which, ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, this appears yet further insomuch as there are other phrases in that 6 of the <hi>Rom.</hi> that do intimate, and expresse that spirituall death and resurrection that is signified by the analogical, and representative burial of the body in water, and raising it again in baptism <hi>viz. dead to sin, alive to God, newnesse of life,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Here is mention made of the things signified: And as for that that is spoken of under this expression <hi>buried in baptism</hi> tis delievered as a <hi>medium</hi> whereby, as a motive whereupon, as a reason wherefore, as an image and representative wherein we are both to read, and remember, and also to practise, and perform that other: for do but mark, <hi>how shall we</hi> (saith he) <hi>that are dead to sinne</hi> i. e. should be so, <hi>live any longer therein? know you not that as many of you as were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into Christ</hi> i. e. into or in token of an interest in him of a onenesse, and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with him by faith, <hi>are baptized into his death,</hi> i. e. in token of such a communion with the power of his death, as kills <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Fourthly, this burial and resurrection that is immediately expressed by the words <hi>buried with him in baptism wherein you are also risen with him,</hi> is made a motive, argument, and incitement to the spiritual death, and resurrection, for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are we perswaded to die to sin, and live righteously, because in baptism we are buried in water; and raised again in token that we ought so to do, and on this cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Fifthly tis not only such as is made a motive to the other, therefore is not the other, but such a death and resurrection as is performed, accomplisht, transacted in baptism i. e. in the very time and juncture of our baptizing, therefore cannot be meant of our spiritual death and resurection immediatly, but of that burial and resurrection which the outward man in a figure, or resemblance passes through both at, &amp; in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the ordinance, for the spiritual death and resurection is that, which though it be signified and resembled in baptism, yet it is seldom, if ever, transacted in a person in that juncture of time wherein he is baptizing, but for the most part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or after, yea ever either before or after, and never in the very nick and act of baptism, no neither of your baptism nor of ours, for you who professe to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize infants have a subject, of whom you hope that he will die to sin, when he lives to years, but you look not on him as one that is <hi>mortuus,</hi> but <hi>moriturus,</hi> and that not in baptism but long after it, unlesse you suppose baptism confers the inward grace <hi>viz.</hi> death to sin <hi>ex opere operato</hi> still; but we baptiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ng believers baptize such as repent from dead works, and <hi>in fieri,</hi> though not <hi>infacto esse,</hi> are dead to sin before we baptize them, as well as oblige them to die more to sin after it, yet you say your subjects for all that are buried in baptism too, and so say we of ours, therefore the burial in baptism there meant is no other then that of the sign, for the thing signified <hi>viz.</hi> the death to sin is not done in baptism, whether it be before or after it, and one of the two it is, for <hi>Calvin</hi> saies truly that we hold <hi>baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum esse sepulturam in quam nulli nisi jam mortui</hi> already dead i. e, dying to sin are to be buried, but of himself and others that are baptized in infancy he saies quoting <hi>Rom.</hi> the 6.4. <hi>nos jam ante mortuos per baptismum sepeliri</hi> i. e. before we are dead to sin, we are buried by baptism l. 4. c. 16. S. 16. the burial therefore is not the <hi>signatum,</hi> but the <hi>signum</hi> i. e. their putting under water in baptism, which <hi>sacramentally</hi> is called a burial, even therefore because of the analogy and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse it bears to such a thing, even to Christs burial, and ours with him, which are the things analogized and lively resembled thereby i. e. by immersion, for by aspersion they are not.</p>
               <p>And so I have proved by three arguments hitherto that Christs ordinance of baptism is a totall dipping <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First by the prime signification of the word baptize which is to overwhelm or wash by swilling, or dipping, but never to sprinkle, as Rantize never to dipp or wash.</p>
               <p>Secondly by the practise of the primitive times, which was totally to dip, as I have made appear many wayes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly by the name of a burial and resurrection, thats there given to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward sign by a sacramental <hi>Metonimy</hi> i. e. in this respect as in its dispensation it must bear analogy and likenesse, as spirinkling does not, to the death burial and resurrection of Christ, and ours in him, which are the things immediatly signified in baptism, and therefore mainly, and as lively as may be to exemplified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. If there be yet any more to say against dipping, and for sprinkling, let us hear it, and as I find it true upon triall, or false and feigned, so accordingly I shall ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="358" facs="tcp:109011:188"/>Your first is grounded upon a simple supposition, that an unbaptized person may in no case baptize, or make a fit administrator of baptism, whereas there is nothing in the world more clear then this, that when it is to be done, and cannot be well done otherwise it may be done (as well as by one that was) by one that never was baptized at all: yea why not in case of innitiation after intermission as well as at the innitiation of the Gospel it self? I wonder who baptized <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> that was the greatest administrator that ever was? for either he was baptized surely, or else he was not, if he was ever baptized at all, who baptized him? but if he was never baptized the matter amounts still to be the same, i. e. to evince no lesse then we assert that at the innitiation of the dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether at first, or after a long unlawful cessation, an unbaptized person may baptize: for if <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> himself was not baptized himself, or if he was, either by one that was unbaptized, or else by one that was first baptized by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he talks in his sleep that saies an unbaptized person may not in such a pressing case baptize.</p>
               <p>Your second querie is as unsolidly grounded as the other, and supposes your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion to be this, that no man, though baptized himself, unlesse he be a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, i. e. an ordained officer may baptize, for say you what commission have you to baptize you being no Minister of the Gospel? whereas if by Minister you mean one officiating as a pastor over a people, there is nothing more cleer in the world or in the word either, then that others besides the Ministers may baptize, viz. not any <hi>she,</hi> for which theres no president, but rather precept to the contrary 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. but any prophet i. e. any <hi>he</hi> gifted disciple, especially when by the improvement of his gifts he proves, as not seldome such do, instrumentall of the parties convertion: <hi>Ananias</hi> baptized <hi>Paul</hi> himself, yet was he but a certain disciple <hi>Acts</hi> the 9. if you say that he was sent by God himself, to that service, it serves to shew this however, which we affirm that God limited not that disp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>You therefore make much more a do in this then needs, you strain indeed at a goat, and swallow a camel, and busy your self so about the truth of administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, that you have lost the truth, and substance of the administration it self; were your baptism true baptism indeed, there is no necessity that ordained <hi>Ministers</hi> must administer it, but unlesse it were truer then it is, no matter if it were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver administred at all.</p>
               <p>Know therefore Sirs I beseech you that the verity worth, weight and efficacy of baptism depends not upon the quality of the person administring, but upon the truth of the subject to whom, and the true form wherein tis administred; the Scripture prescribes plainly who they are that shall, and in what manner these shall, but not at all by whom they shall be baptized: tis the duty of them that believe to be baptized, and his duty that baptizes to baptize indeed, not rantize only, and to baptize such as, being taught the Gospel, do believe it, but who they must be that are to baptize those is neither here nor there to the baptism for ought I find in the word, so they be but Masculine disciples: nay though the person baptizing be not only no officer (but in the case above named as yet) unbaptized himself, yet if the person baptized be not only a believing disciple, but also baptized really, and indeed his baptism is never the worse for the other:</p>
               <p>Experience tells me, and I believe many more, that have been baptized ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to truth, that twas drawing neer to Christ with true hearts in his true ordinance that made us accepted in his sight, not the qualifications of the baptizers, whose baptism and ministerial functions (were they invested with both) could add never the more validity nor verity to our baptism, as neither could the non-entity of either of those in them have possibly made the baptism so sincerely submitted to, be in any measure void, and of no effect; the placing so much in persons administring as to think our selves ere the better for that, was that fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical fopery of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for a while, one saying <hi>I am of Paul, another I of Apollo, another I of Caephas</hi> i. e. I was baptized by such or such, which made the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> who with his own hands baptized but some of them, well nigh wish he had baptized none of them at all, when he saw their carnall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

in the persons administring, and blesse God that he baptized no more, least they should have thougt the better of themselves, and of their baptism for its dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of it by his hands.</p>
               <p>The administrators therefore being baptized or not baptizd, minister or no minister maketh the baptism, if elsewise warrantable, neither better nor worse of it self: all this I speak all this while, not as granting that our baptism is by unbapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed persons, and that my self am no minister of the Gospel, for neither of these shall be yielded by any meanes, unlesse you were more able then you are to prove them, I speak it suppositively that if these were both so, yet both my baptizing and being baptized may be warrantable enough notwithstanding or else if we deemed it worth while to seek out what succession our baptism hath had from the Apostles, in a series without interruption, tis possible there were some disciples in all ages that owned the truth, though so few and despised, that their genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can scarcely be declared, for who can declare his generation, whose life in himself, and his was still cut off from the earth? but we go by the word that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all Church and Ministry in our account of our baptism and ministry, and not by succession in either: and as for your selves, that hold so much on succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and boast of a lineal descent of your ministry and Rantism from the Apostles, twill pussle you no lesse to prove that, if we put you to it, then twill if we put you to it to disprove a lineal succession of our baptism, for if we cannot name the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular persons that baptized one another in this way, wherein we do it, successive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the persons of the Apostles in answer to this question who baptized you? and who him? and who him? and so upwards till we come thither, are you able if we ask you who sprinkled you? and who him? and who him? and who him? &amp;c. to particularize more punctually then we? are you able to assign who began our way of baptism first of all in the world, unlesse you begin as high as <hi>Iohn</hi> the baptist? nay verily though Dr. <hi>Featley</hi> would fain father it upon <hi>Stock,</hi> yet its most manifest unto you all that infants sprinkling was denied by some ever since it was known to have a being, for it was controverted in the daies of the fathers, and that it would not have been had there been none that had then denied it, and deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it could not be by any but such as pleaded the baptism of believers, in those times, and were the right way baptized themselves.</p>
               <p>You have not one president of one infant sprinkled, nor proof that such a thing was so much as talked on, for at least an hundred years after Christ, but we are most certain, and your selves cannot deny it, that the bapti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>One word more and then we have done with this, if none at all save such as are baptized themselves may in any case dispense baptism to others, save such also as are by ordination true ministers of the Gospel; then your selves, who pretend solely to the title of baptizing, are no right administrators, as being in truth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther baptized, nor ordained in such wise as the Scripture requires: that your bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism is null I have cleared it enough already, and that your ministry is no lesse is apparent, sith whilst you indeavour to derive it from the Apostles, you can derive it thence no other wise then the Pope doth his, for if a line of succession be a proof of true ministry, you may indeed derive it as well, but not one jot better then he, he can shew you his line of succession, if not from <hi>Peter,</hi> yet at least from <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> himself, that lived in the daies of the Apostles, and you can shew us the line, wherein you came from the Pope, and so through his loines from the other: there is no other way for your ministry to prove its pedigree from the Primitive times but this, no way for you to climb up to the Apostles as the fathers, and founders of your function but by a chain of many linkes, whereof if one happen

               <p>O the wondrous wayes of wretchednesse, if not of wilful wilinesse that the wits of these men work in whereby to wave of the way of God from taking place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them! how do they strive to keep it off as it were at staves end, not yielding it an inch lest it should get an ell, one brings one kind of furniture, wherewith to fight it, another another, yet altogether are but a bullrush, a flag, that shewes like sword and Rapier, but will scarce hold a push if put to it to the purpose: Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> he fetches furniture from Bishop <hi>Vsher</hi> that saies there are ten Scriptures in the acts where the words <hi>ascend</hi> and <hi>descend</hi> expresse no more then removing from one place to another, of which if those he alledges be two of the ten, or supernu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merary it matters not, for if there were 10000 it would do him no right, and truth no wrong in this place, where it is believed by every of the three both himself and his two Colleagues, that here was going up and down from higher places to lower, therefore he may set that cypher some where else, or send it home again to the book whence he had it, and where perhaps it was of use, for here it stands void and serves for nothing.</p>
               <p>And as for their joint sneaping the words <hi>they went down into the water, and

came out of the water</hi> into such a short sense as may serve your own curtaild, and cloudy conceptions of the matter, and exclude our construction that is most clear, and congruous, perverting and mincing it thus, <hi>viz.</hi> that they went down <hi>to</hi> the water, i. e. the channel where the water was, to which there was a descent, and ascended from the water; or if it be allowed to be read (as tis most properly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by the Translators) <hi>into</hi> the water, yet the meaning of that word <hi>into</hi> must be no other then <hi>unto,</hi> I admire how men of such professed piety can convince their consciences to content with such home-spun coverings, such greivous glos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, pittiful put ofs, as they do in this case, I profess they might almost as good say that the heard of Swine, that <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.32. are said to run down <hi>into</hi> the Sea, did but run down to the Sea, and no further, as to limit these Scriptures that relate the baptism of Christ and of the Eunuch, so as to force them to no further sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification then this <hi>to,</hi> and <hi>unto,</hi> and <hi>from</hi> the water as if they went not into it at all.</p>

               <p>But Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> foreseeing no doubt what absurdity must needs be committed in granting the words to be read as they be translated, <hi>viz. they went down</hi> into <hi>the water and ascended</hi> out <hi>of the water,</hi> and yet denying that they were at all <hi>in</hi> the water, and being sensible also surely how it might be noted as a piece of paultry and partiallity, to allow the sense of <hi>into</hi> to the preposition <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> it would be no safe, handsome, acceptable, nor advantagious way to take upon them, as they saw Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> did, to correct the Translators, and mend their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, they are more wary then Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> in that particular, and so (thus <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidit in Scillam, qui vult,</hi> &amp;c.) to decline the Rock of insolence, they drop into the gulf of nonsence, owning the original to be rightly rendred, and reading them according to that rendition, <hi>viz. into</hi> the water, and up <hi>out of</hi> the water, yet denying those phrases they descended <hi>into</hi> the water, and came up <hi>out of</hi> the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,, to sound out any more then Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> saies the <hi>Greek</hi> words do <hi>viz. to</hi> and <hi>from</hi> the water.</p>
               <p>But I must intreat those two Parallels in that opinion, to consider what impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleld improprietie it is to expresse no more then going to the water side, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from it again by these phrases, <hi>viz.</hi> going down <hi>into</hi> the water, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <hi>out of</hi> the water for they imply necessarily a being <hi>in</hi> the water, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at it: he descended <hi>into</hi> hell is more then being at the brinks of hell, he des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended <hi>into</hi> the lower parts of the Earth, is more then bare being on the superficies of the Earth, and so he descended <hi>into</hi> the water, is necessarily more then being <hi>at</hi> the side: the situation of the water below in the bottoms will not salve the absurdity of such expression, concerning being at the water only, and returning, for he descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>to</hi> it, and ascended <hi>from</hi> it is enough for that, but to expresse that only by <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> it and <hi>out of</hi> it, is superfluous and superlative simplicity: whatsoever element, or place in any element we are said to go down into, and come up out of we w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Daniel</hi> was thrown <hi>into</hi> and taken up <hi>out of</hi> the Lyons den, does not that shew plainly enough that he was <hi>in</hi> it? the Swine ran <hi>into</hi> the sea, were they not then in it? I threw it <hi>into</hi> the fire (saies <hi>Aaron</hi> of the molten image he made) and there came out this calf, will any say that the mettals he made it of were only warmed at the fire side? they went down both <hi>into</hi> the water, both <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch</hi> and came up <hi>out of</hi> the water, <hi>Iesus</hi> was baptized of <hi>Iohn into Iordan, Mark</hi> 1.9. and when he was baptized went straitway <hi>out of</hi> the water, <hi>Math.</hi> 3.16. can any man say that these two persons <hi>Iesus</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> of whom also Dr. <hi>Featley</hi> grants that they were baptized <hi>in</hi> the River, were never <hi>in</hi> it at all, but only wetted at the water side?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="367" facs="tcp:109011:192"/>But that <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch</hi> went into and were in the water, and not <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> it and <hi>at</hi> it only, is evident by what I have hinted once already, <hi>viz.</hi> in that it is said they were come <hi>unto</hi> the water before, and therefore this must needs be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> it, or else either the Spirit <hi>Tautologized,</hi> or they <hi>tautopoi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>zed,</hi> and came <hi>unto</hi> the water twice over, but never <hi>into</hi> it at all.</p>
               <p>Two more odd conceits, and emblemes of the emptinesse of their apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this point, two a piece I mean in Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> I shall take notice of briefly in their fore-cited shuffles, and so passe on to the rest.</p>
               <p>First, how peartly doth Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> squitch up <hi>A. R.</hi> with a question or two as if he would catechise him in that which he hath yet need to be further chatechisd himself?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Must they not go down to the water</hi> (saith he) <hi>if they would use it? would the water come up to them in the Chariot any sooner for sprinkling then for dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In answer to which question, I intreat Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> to ask his conscience this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, whether if they had used the water only for sprinkling, there was such nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssity of going down to it as he seemes to intimate, would not the water have come up to them in the Chariot sooner by far for sprinkling then for dipping? yea verily both <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>the Eunuch</hi> might have sat still in the Chariot and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded water enough for sprinkling to be brought up to them thither in the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of the Chariot drivers hand, if there were no bigger a vessel to bear it in, but for dipping enough could never possibly be brought up into the Chariot at all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>he must,</hi> saies he of Christ, <hi>go down and come up from the water, but here is not the least hint that</hi> John <hi>doused Christ over head, or under wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nay rather that conceit of yours,</hi> saith he to A. R. <hi>is here confuted, for if our blessed Saviour had been plunged of</hi> John into <hi>the water, then it would rather have been said that</hi> John <hi>cast or plunged Christ into the water, and took him</hi> out of <hi>the water, but it is only implied that Christ went down</hi> unto <hi>the water and came up again</hi> from <hi>it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O how egregiously, how shamefully doth this man forget, and utter himself as if his senses were sodden into <hi>Trapizuntius</hi> his temper! I would therfore ask him one or two questions <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First: whether <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> doth at all signifie to douse over head, or under wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or to plunge into water yea or no? if not (but I suppose he will not deny it so to do, though he denies it to signifie onely plunging) then I would have him to go to school again to the <hi>Lexicons</hi> which will teach him that it mainly signifies <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, immergo, submergo,</hi> and if <hi>lavo, a bluo</hi> it is such an ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion as is made <hi>immergendo,</hi> but if it doth signifie to plunge dip or douse under water, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm at all, and I dare say he and every one else shall find it for all <hi>lavo, quod fit immergendo,</hi> to signifie a swilling in water altogether<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then I advise him to be think himself, for I think he was asleep when he wrote this passage, that there is at least some little hint that <hi>Iohn</hi> plunged Christ into the water, when its said Christ was baptized <hi>alias, plunged, dipt</hi> of <hi>Iohn</hi> into <hi>Iordan,</hi> or washt <hi>in Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sith that pleases himself, unless he put a difference between the active and the passive and will not yield it to be all one, that <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized Christ, and Christ was baptized of <hi>Iohn,</hi> but though it be said Christ was baptized i. e. plunged of <hi>Iohn</hi> into <hi>Iordan,</hi> overwhelmed in <hi>Iordan,</hi> and that he came out of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is a shrewd sign that <hi>Iohn</hi> did not keep him there, yet this is not plain and significant enough for him it seems unlesse he may have the framing of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits speech another way, that is no whit plainer then the other neither, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Iohn</hi> cast or plunged Christ into the water, and took him out of the water, unlesse it may be said just so all that is said, which yet is the same with that he would have to be said, implies no more then that Christ went down unto the water and
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:109011:193"/>
and came up again from it, without being baptized, so belike: how <hi>A.

I can no more conceive, then I can conceive that this expression <hi>viz. Philip</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch</hi> went down both <hi>into</hi> the water, and he baptized him, is a confutation of him that supposes the Eunuch to be baptized at all, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> are Mr. <hi>Cooks</hi> marginals wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he would have us learn tis like from the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, that their ascension was but from the water, but I muse why he would not set down the words of the other Scripture, <hi>Act.</hi> the 8.39. which expounds this, and where tis <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, which <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> is in latin <hi>ex,</hi> and englished most naturally <hi>out of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second thing more observable in Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> businesse runs thus, First, saith he, <hi>howsoever one or two examples serve not your purpose, but a general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of all examples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>See how Mr. <hi>Bls.</hi> heart misgives him, and well nigh wavers within, whether he had not best yield us these two examples, for all his tugging for them before, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our cause, and therefore now falls, for fear these two will side against him, to serve himself against them another way, i. e. by denying that the testimony of the spirit in these two examples, is of any validity to us without a concurrence of all examples:</p>
               <p>To which I say, had Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> but one half inch of an example in the new testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>baby baptism</hi> how much he would make of it we may see by his cunning counterfeit examples for that thing out of scriptures, that in truth are not onely far from exemplifying such a thing, as the housholds he makes use of are, but also clear examples to the contrary, as the non-baptizing of those very infants that were brought to Christ, and the non-baptizing of those very infants with their parents <hi>Act.</hi> the 2. to whose parents, and their children to, on the same termes of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance when at years, the promise is there made: both which Scriptures he wrests into his turne, yea verily, and had he but one true single example of any one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant baptized in all that word, we should lay down to him, and never open our mouthes more against infant baptism: yet if these two examples do prove for us, it seemes they shall not be heeded, whilst against them, unlesse there be a general concurrence of all examples.</p>
               <p>Wherefore secondly, I tell him of a truth that though me thinks the single exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lord Iesus might content him, and of the Eunuch, for can he shew a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter example then these? yet theres as general a concurrence of all examples in this particular, as there is of the example of any one thing, that is exemplified in the Scriptures: all <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> all <hi>Iudea,</hi> and the Region about <hi>Iordan</hi> were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized i. e. dipt of <hi>Iohn</hi> in <hi>Iordan</hi> confessing their sins, Christ dipt of <hi>Iohn</hi> into <hi>Iordan,</hi> the Eunuch going <hi>into</hi> the water and there baptized, baptizing <hi>in Aenon</hi> because much water, and indeed the very word baptize makes them all examples of our practise, while it signifies <hi>obruo, submergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly saies he, <hi>we have examples giving full evidence of a different practise, and nothing can be concluded for you from these examples of yours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bls.</hi> examples it seems for his different practise must conclude for him, but our examples though never so clear must conclude nothing for us, <hi>ipse dixit</hi> Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> hath forbidden them so to do, and therefore we must sign <hi>ne plus ultra</hi> here, and urge our examples no more, wherefore ile cease.</p>
               <p>Onely secondly, I hope he will give me leave to ask him what different practise it is he meanes, of which he hath examples giving full evidence against ours, and if it be either baptism of infants, or Rantism of infants, or powring water on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, or washing infants any other way, or dispensig Christs ordinance of baptism to men or women in any other way then in the way of dipping, or washing by
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:109011:193"/>
dipping, which <hi>baptizo</hi> signifies, ile promise him faithfully that upon his giving us any one example that gives full evidence of it, or any other kind of full evidence of it besides that of example, any of which he is far from giving in any thing that was ever pen'd by him yet, I shall yield and become his disciple, and follow him as far as I find him following Christ in that or any thing else, and that for ever: till then he must excuse me if in love to his soul I seriously beseech him to search and try his wayes and turn in truth to that truth of the Lord Iesus he yet tramples on.</p>

               <p>There is example given you enough against your way by Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> too of baptizing otherwise then by dipping, in the Iailor, whom they all instance in either expressely, or implicitly, First Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saies in that section of his which you have not yet fully spoke to, that the Iailor was baptized in the night in his house, and therefore not likely over head in that Countrey where water was so scarce, and to this agree some words of Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> concurrent in matter though different in form: we read saith Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> p. <hi>16.</hi> of multitudes baptized even <hi>3000</hi> in Ierusalem without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of going to the Rivers, and of whole families without mention of going to the waters, or fetching store of waters, it is like the waters they had within doors at midnight sufficed <hi>Acts 2.41. Acts 16.15.33.</hi> and saith Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> p. <hi>10.</hi> sometimes baptism was administred where water for dipping was not to be had, and though the Eunuch comming to a river saith here is water, what hindred that I should be dipped? yet there is little probability that <hi>Paul</hi> could say so in <hi>Judas's</hi> house in streight street in <hi>Damascus,</hi> nor the Iailor in his prison in <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi:</hi> you say that baptism was ordinarily in rivers, where there were many waters, but sure there were neither many waters, nor rivers in these mens dwellings, and as sure they went not out in the night unto any such places, yet were they baptized.</p>

               <p>Are these your Examples of baptizing otherwaies then by dipping? certainly unlesse these three men were every one of them either shamefully slighthy in their searches, or willingly ignorant, or smitten with blindnesse, and given up in some measure at least, for their not imbracing this plain easie truth of dipping, in the love thereof, to deep dotage and stronge delusion, they could never believe, much lesse print such palpable untruths, absolute absurdities, and cleer self confutations, as are unavoidably to be seen by him that reads with understanding these parcells they have published to the eye of all men.</p>
               <p>See first how Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> contradicts himself in that clause, <hi>we read of great multitudes baptized even three thousand in Ierusalem without mention of going to the Rivers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To say nothing of the invalidity of this piece to his purpose, nor needlessenesse of the Scriptures mentioning the particular place where every one was baptized, for what if that be not specified every where where baptism is talked on, least the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume should swell, is it not as much as to say they were dipped in that it is said they were baptized, i. e. <hi>submersi, obruti, abluti immergendo,</hi> for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies mainly, I suppose I may safely say only such washing as is by dousing, dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping or swilling, specially since in places enough it is said they were baptized in Rivers, and places of much water: but to say nothing I say of that, mark how this clause of Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> clashes with another of his within a matter of ten lines up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from it, for there giving other reasons, then that of dipping, why <hi>Iohn</hi> chose to baptize in Rivers and running waters, among others he gives this as a speciall one, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Because of the multitudes that were baptized, especially</hi> saith he, <hi>seeing there came such huge multitudes to him to be baptized,</hi> and yet here were great
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:109011:194"/>
multitudes baptized even no lesse then 3000 and yet sith there is no mention of the place where, which by Mr. <hi>Cooks</hi> own reason, if it be a reason, must be a place of running waters, and streams that many might be imploied at once in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing along the river, for the more speedy dispatch, with so great multitudes, therefore these belike went not out to the rivers, though yet theres no more menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned that they did not, then that they did.</p>
               <p>There were thousands of converts <hi>Act.</hi> the 4. the 4. of the matter of whose baptism there is no more mentioned then of the manner of it, and yet there is ground enough to believe they were all baptized, as well as the rest, yea Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> believes it, and in the same way as the rest whose baptism with the manner of it is expressed, for why should others be baptized in rivers because they were multitudes, and yet these multitudes be exempted from that and be dispached with so small a matter as sprinkling? therefore the not mentioning twas done, is an argument as good as nothing; and whereas he saies there is no mentioning of fetching in great store of waters, tis true, that we never read at all of water fetcht to the persons, but of persons going to the water we do, though he saies we do not, for even <hi>Lydia</hi> her self and her family, which is no other then his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, were gone out to a river side to hear <hi>Paul</hi> preach, where being converted they were baptized, that being the wonted place of preaching and praying no doubt in order to the conveniency of baptizing, before ever the Apostles were so much as invited to her house.</p>
               <p>Secondly, of this stamp also is Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> conceit concerning the baptism of <hi>Paul,</hi> who because the particular place or sourse of water wherein he was baptized is not expressed, imagins that he must needs be baptized within doors, and no where else, and so consequently not by dipping, but some other way, whereas there is neither necessity nor probability of his being so, but rather evidence if not from the very place, yet at least from what Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> saies that it was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; For</p>
               <p>First, it seemes to me that <hi>Paul</hi> was not to be baptized within, but to go some where or other to the dispatching of that businesse, wherefore else should <hi>Ananias</hi> rub him up to it as he doth in such wise as this, and <hi>now why tariest thou? arise and be baptized and wash away thy sins</hi> &amp;c. Which as it Argues it was a service <hi>Paul</hi> was tardy to, and I know no mans flesh forward to it further then by faith it is overpowred, specially in such a weak case as <hi>Paul</hi> it seemes was in at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, so it was as who should say, why art thou so undisposed to thy duty in that particular, make hast, and linger not longer about it, but come away and be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized: now had aspersion or infusion been only the work, <hi>Paul</hi> could not have bin so backward as to need such sharp exsuscitation, when once convinced, for theres no such great unpleasantness to the flesh, as to engender any aversenesse unto that, but that <hi>Paul</hi> was more tardy then he should have been (and why he should be so I know not if among the other impediments, at least he was not sensible of some tediousnesse in the service) was uttered in a publique exercise once from that very text <hi>Acts.</hi> 22.16. by a friend of yours, and mine now deceased, at his sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling one of mine own children, in which Sermon the doctrine was this (and a good doctrine it was, and very truly grounded upon the Example of <hi>Pauls dulnesse</hi> in that Scripture, and further cleered by <hi>Lots</hi> loitering in <hi>Sodom</hi>) viz.
<q>That by reason partly of the remainder of corruption in the best, presenting evill when they should do Good, and partly the great grand enemy of our salvation Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, opposing himself to all good, the best that have even renounced their vile life, have an indisposition to holy duties, and have need of excitation and stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Again had he not either been to be baptized within by dipping<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or been to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive within an aspersion or infusion upon his face only he need not to have bin bid to arise, or stand up in order to either of these, so much as from the present posture
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:109011:194"/>
he was in, for if he were then sitting, face rantism might have been done as well, and if he were lying down (which in his then case is the more likely of the two) much better then in a standing posture, in which tis not so easie to dispence a pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the face, least pouring so little as you do it prove rather a Rantism then a baptism, or pouring so much as the baptizer should do on the disciple, if he will needs do it by pouring i. e. till he hath buried him in baptism, or wholly covered him with water, in resemblance of the spiritual, he make way for his bodily buriall in the earth also.</p>
               <p>Whereas therefore Mr. <hi>Blak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> saies thus, <hi>viz.</hi> that though the <hi>Eunuch</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the River might saie heres wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er what hinders why I should not be dipped, yet there is little probability that <hi>Paul</hi> could say so in <hi>Iudas</hi> his house in <hi>straight street</hi> in <hi>Damascus,</hi> or the <hi>Iaylor</hi> at his Prison in <hi>Phillippi,</hi> I say it is very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it was so indeed, that they had not any Ponds or Rivers in their houses, to dip in, but will it follow therefore that they were baptized in the house without dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping? no such matter by Mr. <hi>Bls.</hi> favour, but rather that sith there was not water enough for their dipping within doors, as there was for the Eunuchs dipping with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, therefore they went out to some water or other that they might be baptized, i. e. dipped conveniently, as the Eunuch was, and that may possibly not be farre, for many a one that hath not brooks nor ponds in their houses, yet have them oft not far from their doors, and that <hi>Iudas</hi> had not so who can tell? but whether he had or no, the matter is not great, sith he lived not far from much water however whilest he was living in <hi>Damascus,</hi> for were not <hi>Abana</hi> and <hi>Parphar</hi> Rivers of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascus</hi> though not for <hi>Namans</hi> disease, yet for dipping full as good as <hi>Iordan</hi> it self, and all other waters of Israel.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, See how miserably Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is mistaken, he would make men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, if they would be such Idiots, as to take his single word for it, against the expresse word of God, that in the <hi>Countrey</hi> of the <hi>Iaylor</hi> water was so scarce that he could not be dipped over head, whereas (oh that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would see how the Lord hath left him to discover his too hasty galloping over the Sripture) it is related that a River <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>an just by the same City of <hi>Phillippi</hi> where he dwelt, even that, by the side of which Paul preached, and prayer was wont to be made, where also <hi>Lidy</hi> 1, and her houshold were converted and baptized, and all this no further off then in the very same chapter, where the <hi>Iaylors</hi> baptism is spoken of <hi>viz. Acts</hi> 16.13, 14, 15.</p>
               <p>I perceive this scarcity of water is made a mighty Argument among you against dipping, some saying that water for dipping was not to be had in the houses of the disciples that were baptized, therefore they received no more then some asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or infusion within, some speaking as though water for dipping were not to be had in whole Cities and Countreys where the disciples dwelt, thus doth not onely Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> who denies a sufficiencie of water for dipping over head to be in that Country where the Jaylor dwelt, but also Senior Mr. <hi>Simpson</hi> one of you my <hi>Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> opposers, who in a letter under his hand to a neighbor of his (much of which is <hi>partim directe &amp; verbatim partim oblique &amp; collateraliter,</hi> out of Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> so that it stands or falls in him, and of the rest that is not translated thence into his turn, some already is, and some that is not yet, is to be spoken to as I go along) tells us that <hi>there was not any water in</hi> Jerusalem <hi>wherein so many as were there baptized, in so short a time, at that time of the year when water was more scanty, could possibly have been dipped.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What a strange conceit is this? what not water enough in nor yet about all <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> to dipp a man over head in? for sith he saies not so many, the same water course I hope that one can be dipped in, may also serve to dipp a thousand; shall we think that in the greatest drought that could happen all those brooks the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures mentions <hi>viz. Cedron</hi> and <hi>Siloam,</hi> and the fountain of <hi>Gyhon,</hi> and the Conduit of the upper pool, which ran with several streams, and were at one place all coincident with <hi>Cedron,</hi> were dryed up so that not a place could be found of
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:109011:195"/>
any competent depth for men to dip in?</p>
               <p>But perhaps what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saies concerning <hi>Aenon</hi> upon the report of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers <hi>viz.</hi> that even the River <hi>Aenon it self where</hi> Iohn <hi>baptized because there was much water, is found to be a small brook, that a man may almost step over,</hi> or as I find it expressed to me in a letter to a neer and deer friend of mine, upon the credit of eye witnesse historians, <hi>Aenon was but a small purl scarcely knee deep at the deepest,</hi> so Mr. <hi>Simpson</hi> may say, but it is on his own head if he do, concerning these brooks, that were about <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to all which I shall for brevities sake dispatch this answer here now I am about it.</p>
               <p>And first I intreat Mr. <hi>Simpson</hi> to consider that this serves not his turn howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if <hi>Cedron</hi> and <hi>Siloam,</hi> and the rest that were without the City, and the stream also that ran through the City, from the fountain of the old pool into <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron,</hi> should be all such as <hi>Aenon</hi> is supposed to be, sith the fishpool <hi>Bethesda,</hi> at which lay a great multitude of impotents, and into which one amongst the rest desired to be put, or cast (for the word is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) but could not, was both deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and broader then so, and convenient for many to dip in at once, for if we may credit <hi>Bethesda</hi> it self, the very name instructs us in no lesse <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> being in english no other then the house of flowing down, so called for the concurrence, and confluence of many waters thereinto, see <hi>Calvin</hi> upon the place, who tells you that it was a pool he thinks, into which water did flow down continually, through either channels or pipes, that the Priests (for it was neer the Temple) might as well be furnisht with water for their sacrifices, as the people were with sacrifices themselves in the sheep market wherein it was; others think, and as I take it <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> in his Anotations, that it was a pool at which cattel drank, and in which they used to be plunged; <hi>whereof</hi> saith he <hi>there could not but be great store in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>: so much may well serve without any more to salve the sore eyes of Mr. <hi>Simpson.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ile bate him his <hi>almost,</hi> and yet he will not get much by the matter, for as I have seen others baptized by totall dipping in the like, so was I seen to be baptized my self in a place of so little latitude, that an active man might make shift to step over, not almost but altogether, in which yet there is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enough left behind to baptize a thousand, if not a million more in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and so, not to say how possible it is, if not a thousand to one that <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> eye witnesses never sounded <hi>Aenons</hi> depth in all places, nor secondly how possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly a brook might be much swerved up since then, &amp; somwhat shallowed in so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Generations, nor thirdly how possible it is to deepen the shallowest stream that is very easily in order to such a purpose, for I have seen ancle deep streams so ordered as I speak of, more then once or twice for a need, though that <hi>Aenon</hi> had need to be made deeper in those places, where <hi>Iohn</hi> did baptize, may be twenty times told by some Travellers, that love to hear themselves talk, before I shall believe it once;</p>
               <p>Not to say any thing I say of these, let <hi>Aenon</hi> be but knee deep if you will, ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perience hath so taught the expedience of knee deep to dip in to my self, and other Baptizers that I know, that as we have dipt persons oft where it hath not bin so deep, so, except in such a channel where we cannot well avoid it, we choose now not to go in much deeper.</p>
               <p>See Fourthly how all your three Worthies Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> do deceive you, as being indeed deceived themselves, and that in a manner so plain that none but <hi>Blind Seers</hi> can look beside it, for though each of the three were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in each of those other errors, which they severally utter in your last joint quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and confident commendation of them, yet (wo is me may <hi>England</hi> say that my leaders are so mifled) the whole Trinity of them is at unity, but against all veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this, even in the very thing in which principally you would have us mind them, for whereas, as an instance that baptism was not by dipping, they all alledge that
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:109011:195"/>
the <hi>Iailor</hi> was baptized at midnight in his house, and therefore probably not in such a way as dipping, that he was baptized about midnight is true enough, but that he was baptized in his house, is so contrary to truth, that a very child may find the falsenesse of that assertion, for howbeit Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> saies plain-ly, <hi>its like the waters they had within doores at midnight sufficed, and Mr.</hi> Baxter more plain-ly, <hi>that the Iailor was baptized in the night in his house,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> most plain-ly, <hi>tis sure there was not many waters nor rivers in the Iailors dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and it is as sure that they i. e.</hi> the Iailor and the Apostles <hi>went not out in the night to any such places as were fit to dip in,</hi> yet what saith the word in plain truth? no lesse then this, that the Iailor after he was baptized <hi>brought them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his house and set meat before them, and rejoiced</hi>: for it is said first, that upon the earth-quake, and <hi>Pauls</hi> crying out to him, that he should do him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self no harm, the <hi>Iailor hasted into Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas and brought them out,</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly that they upon his then inquiry told him what he should do to be saved, and <hi>preached the word to him and all his,</hi> whereupon in this intertime, i. e. between the time of the Iailors bringing them out, and his bringing them in again, <hi>he took them and washed their stripes, and was baptized he and all his straightwav.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>that when he had brought them into his house,</hi> which words compared with verse the 30. where it is said <hi>he brought them out,</hi> shew clearly that he, and his were with them still without hearing the word, washing them, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to be baptized i. e. <hi>immergendo</hi> washed of them, he made them eat, and <hi>rejoiced</hi>: now what man, but one minded to overlook what likes him not, can chuse but see this to the confutation of these three mens opinions? which I doubt because it is theirs more then any thing else, may be the opinion of 3000: that the Iailor first brought them out, and then washed their stripes, and was baptized, and then brought them in, and rejoiced with them is clear.</p>

               <p>But Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> hath many more Arguments then those you have yet spoken to whereby he cleerly evinces it, that baptism was not only by dipping then: I hope we shall have your answer to them too, and the rather because they are of some weight, and therefore you are the more willing to slip by them: First (saith he) if the way of baptism were only dipping, then the Baptizer must put the bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed over head in the water, and after a space receive them up again, otherwise he could not say in your sense I baptize thee, but we read of no such thing any where in Scripture, we find Christ and the Eunuch going to the water and coming thence, but neither <hi>John</hi> nor <hi>Philip</hi> putting them into the water or taking them from thence p. <hi>8.</hi>

               <p>I strange that Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> should grant as he doth above p. 6. that <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch</hi> are fitly said to go into the water, and yet say so shortly after, we find no more then their going to the water, and from it again; how fitly can they be said to go into the water and out of it, that go but to and from it I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed already, but tis more strange to me that he should so far forget himself, as to say we read of no such thing in Scripture as of <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Phillips</hi> putting <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch</hi> into the water, or taking them from thence, for we read plainly that Christ was baptized of <hi>Iohn</hi> into <hi>Iordan,</hi> and in <hi>Iordan,</hi> and we read that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch went</hi> down both into the water, and <hi>Philip</hi> baptized him, and that Christ came up out of the water, and that <hi>Philip</hi> and the Eunuch came up out of the water, if all this be not partly an expression, partly an implication of the same thing that Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> saies we no where read of, then I shall never trust my spectacles more, for what shall we think was done to Christ by <hi>Iohn</hi> when it is said he was baptized by him into <hi>Iordan,</hi> if he was not dipped, overwhelmed put under the water? was he sprinkled into <hi>Iordan</hi>? and what shall we think <hi>Philip</hi> did to the Eunuch when it is said he baptized him, after they were both gone down into the water, if he did not put him under it? did he no more then sprinkle, or pour a few drops of water on him? either of those might have been done as easily, and more if they had never gone into the water, yea if they had never went so much as to the water at all; and when it is said of <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch</hi> that they came up out of the water, is it not necessarily implyed (and therefore what need it be expressed) that <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi> who put them under the water did take them up again after a space, and not hold them alwaies under it? for if they had, how they could have come up out of it I know not.</p>
               <p>Had <hi>Mr. Blake</hi> therefore more believed the Scripture, then he did <hi>Mr. Cook,</hi> from whom he borrowed this Argument (and lent it again to Mr. <hi>Simpson</hi> of <hi>Bethersden,</hi> or else <hi>Mr. Simpson</hi> stole it, for without any cotation of <hi>Mr. Blake</hi> he hath it word for word in that forenamed Letter of his, which he desired should be communicated) he would not have transpenn'd Mr. <hi>Cooks</hi> matter, who saies p. 16. of his <hi>there is not the lest hint that</hi> John <hi>doused, cast or plunged Christ into the water, and took him out of the water,</hi> into another phrase viz. <hi>we read of no such thing any where in Scripture that</hi> John <hi>and</hi> Philip <hi>put</hi> Christ <hi>and the</hi> Eunuch <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the water, and took them up again,</hi> but it is your fashion to follow by impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit faith, and to take up things at a venture by tradition one from another as the people do from you.</p>

               <p>Well this is all but by the businesse, let us go on and consider what more Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> brings to disprove dipping to be the primitive custome, he tells you further p. <hi>9.</hi> it was the Apostles way to baptize disciples as soon as they were become Converts the same day, rather sometimes the same houre, as we see in the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> the <hi>Jaylor,</hi> and <hi>Lydia,</hi> and multitudes of others; but conversion of Disciples necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happened when there was no season for dipping, the Element of water being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Cold for that service.</p>
               <p>If any object that in those Countreyes there was no danger in the coldest times.</p>
               <p>He answers, the commission being for all Nations disciples were made in all Countreys; how soone saith he came the word to this Nation? &amp;c. sometimes therefore saith he the water and weather was too cold for dipping.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Number of Converts were so numerous <hi>3000, 5000.</hi> in one day that there was no possibility of baptizing in that Manner, Acts <hi>2.41.</hi> and the <hi>44.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Sometimes the Baptizers were in that condition that they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for that work in that way, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> men newly taken out of the stocks in the Inner Prison, with such stripes that their Convert was fain forthwith to wash them, in this case they were unfit to wade into the water for that work, and had they made any such adventure the Scripture would not have been si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Sometimes the baptized have not been in case for dipping and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, which was <hi>Pauls</hi> case upon the Aparition of the vision he was lead into <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascus,</hi> where he continues without meat or drink three daies, and upon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias</hi> his comming in, and instructing of him he is baptized, and when he had received meat, saith the text, he was strengthned, will any believe he went out in this case with <hi>Ananias</hi> into the water, over head in water before the taking of any sustenance?</p>

               <p>That persons were baptized as soon as ever they became Converts, and could be discerned to be disciples, even the same houre commonly without delay is an undeniable truth, for that and no other was the very period of time at which, what ever their parents were, they were deemed to have true title to baptism: for neither if their parents were wicked were such excluded as were, nor if the parents were godly, were such admitted as were not converted upon the Account of the fathers goodnesse or badnesse, but as they believed or not themselves, and this makes me the more amazed at it, that it is come to passe since that the faith of the father can now intitle the child to baptism, though the child have no faith at all of his own, and yet I muse more sith you all count infants, at least of believers, to be disciples from the womb, why yet you delay their baptism so long, and do it not at the
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:109011:200"/>
same houre of their birth: for whether they be <hi>Discipuli nati,</hi> or <hi>discipuli facti</hi> if they be disciples (as you falsly suppose they are) if the primitive rule were to baptize persons as soon as ever they appeared to be disciples, then (unlesse you have any special instinct, whereby you know them to begin to be disciples, and in the faith, as many of you count them, about that very houre you baptize them in, and not before) you will appear to be a little tardy in your dispensations by your own rule, though in truth you are too hasty for all this.</p>
               <p>Now as to Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> terrible conceit, concerning the coldnesse of the water, specially in some weather, when yet, if dipping were the way, there would by means of mens conversion, occasion be ministred to dip in, sith I see occasion will be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred to discourse more of winter dipping, when I come to Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> grand Arguments, with one of which this is coincident, I shall say nothing to it here, but there speak to both under one, save only that I must here tell Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> that conversion of disciples necessarily happened when there was no season for dipping without danger, the <hi>Climate</hi> being, by reason of persecutions that rose against that way, much more over hot then the Element of water can at any time be over cold, for the owning of that servi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, must it therefore be forborn for fear of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding our lives? if no exemption from a hotter service, why from a colder for the lifes sake? which whoever will save shall loose, but whoever will loose for Christs name sake, and the Gospels shall preserve it to life eternal: as for the rest under that head I fully agree with it <hi>viz.</hi> that whatever that is, there is commission but for one manner of baptism for all nations.</p>
               <p>As to the multitude of Converts three thousand, five thousand converted in one day, which shift word for word Mr. <hi>Simpson</hi> covers his nakednesse with, adding thus much thereunto, <hi>viz.</hi> could <hi>Peter</hi> and those few with him the dispensers of this ordinance have stayed so long in the water, or by dipping every one dipped so many in so short a time?</p>
               <p>I answer how many and in how short a time does the man mean? as for the 5000 it is doubtful whether they were all converted in that one day, or whether he speaks not rather of the whole multitude that believed before, which were 3000 together with those that afterward were added, which might be some 2000 and so 5000 in all; but if there were fullly 5000 that then believed, and that they were all at the same time baptized too, which is not said, and tis more probable (for done it must be) that twas done at another time, or else by other hands then by <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohns,</hi> for they were laid hold on in the Temple as they were speaking, but suppose I say that there be at any time full five thousand newly believing in so short a time as one day, if they could not be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized all in one day they must necessarily, they might lawfully for ought I know stay till the next, but yet 3000 we read were baptized in one day, neither is it such an impossible thing as you, who stumble at every straw, are slugg'd by every rub, and look on duty with such difficulty, as if a Lyon were in the way, would seem to make it, for 5000 to be baptized in one day;

               <p>Many hands of them that have love to Christ may both lessen, and lighten that service, and suffering that is sustained for him, and make burthensome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, (and such I perceive it is to you tenderlings, that make provision for the flesh to fullfill it in the ease thereof, to dipp many, or be dipped your selves in cold water, or weather) possible, easie, and pleasant, and how many hands there might be at work at once at the dipping of the 3000 besides the hands of the 12. who as occasion was made use of others to dispense the ordinance, it being an inferiour work to their preaching, see <hi>Act.</hi> the 9. <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. may be conjectured, when the number of disciples were a hundred and twenty, where if there were but forty dispensers, with what ease might they baptize a 100 a

piece, and do themselves no more wrong neither with abiding in the water, knee deep, or a little more for half an hour together, then he that stands deeper for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most a day together, and washes many a hundred sheep, as I have known some do, and that not by plunging onely, but longer padling with each of them by farre then need be in onely dipping persons, and so letting them go again; besides when once 3000 were baptized, how many hands there were ready to baptize not 5000 onely, but 5 times 5000 if occasion were, and that quickly too, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to any rational man that reckons it; for it is a work which when it is once ready to be done, is done in lesser time, then I have seen taken up by the Parish Priest in his dropping, and crossings, and other font fidlings about an infants face: and if you suppose it may ask so much hand for so many persons in so short a time as one day to make themselves ready for such a work, I hope the same time that serves one to undresse and dresse in, which may be some a quarter, or at most not above half an hour, may as easily serve ten thousand, for as if all set at once to sweep every one his own door, a whole City may be clensed in an instant, so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that is willing addressing himself to the work, a thousand may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as soon as one.</p>
               <p>And as for that other conceit of Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Simpson</hi> transcribes out of his book into his own letter in these words <hi>viz. that</hi> Paul <hi>when he was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by</hi> Ananias <hi>was not in case by reason of his weaknesse to be plunged in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter over head and ears,</hi> as he was not by reason of his stripes to have gone in a deep river or pond, when he baptized the <hi>Iaylor,</hi> it is as wisdomlesse as any of the rest, for what if he were taken out of the stocks in the inner prison &amp; had such stripes that his convert was fain to wash them, was he therefore so unfit, or was it such a strange adventure (as Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> proclaimes it) to wade in the water for such a work as the dipping a few persons? could that water that toucht his legs while he waded, be more mischievous to him, then the water that washed the blood of his stripes? and when he was baptized himself, what though he had fasted three daies from food in that sudden extasie of his mind, which time its like he spent in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting and prayer to the Lord, <hi>for behold he prayeth</hi> saith the text, yet I trow, as dainty of danger as our Clergy men are, that dare dip their fingers, but not their feet in cold water for Christ, that voluntary keeping under of his body did rather fit, then unfit him for burial with Christ in baptism, which his proud flesh would else not have stoopt to.</p>
               <p>Surely Sirs you are men that make so much of every little for Christs sake, that Crosses and diseases your flesh, that you will hardly ever commend your selves as the ministers of Christ did of old 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.5.6. &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26.27. <hi>in much patience, in afflictions, yea in necessities, in stripes and imprisonments, in tumults, in crossings, in labours, in perils of waters, in wearinesse, in painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in watchings often, in hunger and in thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakednesse, in indurance of hardship as good souldiers of Christ</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. which sith you decline with all the might you can, rather then expose your selves freely to for truths sake, therefore (the Lord have mercy upon your persons) your ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall capacity will be cashiered.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>Rantist.</head>
               <p>Tis true it is confest by some, and if it were granted by all that baptism was then by dipping it were not so material to your cause, nor would you get so much ground by it, sith both such as flatly agree to it, and such as see not cause to agree to it so fully as some do, are all agreed in the grand reason why it was so then, and why it may not be so now at any hand viz. the different temper of those climates, wherein baptism first began, and of ours, wherein it now is practised, theirs being so hot, that there could be no danger by dipping in the coldest times, ours so cold, that it cannot but be very dangerous, if not destructive to life and health.</p>
               <p>I grant saith Dr. <hi>Featly</hi> that Christ and the Eunuch were baptized in the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and that such baptism of men especially in the <hi>Hotter Climates</hi> hath been, is, and may lawfully be used, but the question is whether no other baptizing is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full? or whether dipping in Rivers be so necessary to baptism, that none are accounted baptized, but those that are dipped after such a manner? <hi>usitatior olim fuit</hi> &amp;c. submersion was more usual in <hi>Judea</hi> and other <hi>warmer Countreys</hi> saith <hi>Tilenus</hi> then aspersion, notwithstanding sith submersion may prove preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious to the health, specially of such tender infants, as for the most part are baptized now a dayes, we suppose the Church may use which she pleases, and saies Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> if it were otherwise in the primitive times, it would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved but occasionall from a reason proper to those <hi>Hot Countreys;</hi> and saith Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> though it were granted that in those <hi>Hot Countreys</hi> they common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly washed by going down into the water, and being dipped there, whether in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, or ceremonial, or sacramental washing, that will no more inforce on us a necessity of observing the same in baptism now, then the example of Christ, and the Apostles gesture in the sacrament of the supper, ties us to the same; which was leaning, and partly lying, which was their usual table gesture then, now the ordinary table gesture which is usual among us, is most fit, so the usual manner of washing among us is most fit to be observed in baptism, and that is by powring as well as by dipping: so you see these men are all of a mind, that is was, or at least might be so possibly in the primitive times, but if it were, yet not so in ours, in regard of the coldnesse of our climate.</p>

               <p>Then it seems we shall have it amongst you <hi>pro confesso</hi> that in the Apostles dayes the way was dipping, for though Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> keeps a loof off in his hypotheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals, saying, <hi>though it were granted,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> who borrowes well nigh all he saies against dipping from Mr. <hi>Cook, Cookes</hi> it out but conditionally, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>if it were otherwise,</hi> yet <hi>Tilenus</hi> takes our part plainly, and the Dr. drawes neerer to us then so, giving it for gone that in those <hi>Hot Countryes</hi> baptism in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers was then used, onely whether such manner of dipping in rivers be so necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to baptism in all countreyes, <hi>this we say</hi> saies he <hi>is false,</hi> and so for ought I see you say all.</p>
               <p>But Sirs first, I pray tell me from the very bottom of your consciences, whether
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:109011:202"/>
you can conceive that Christ hath appointed two sorts of baptism <hi>viz.</hi> one kind of baptism for <hi>Iudea,</hi> and those regions round about <hi>Iordan,</hi> and another for <hi>England, Scotland, France, Spain, Italy,</hi> and all the regions round about of the Romish Christendom? whether he hath ordained two baptisms, or rather two different dispensations, whereof one is not baptism, to be used in different places, <hi>viz.</hi> baptism for the <hi>Hot Countryes</hi>; and Rantism for the <hi>Cold</hi>? or whether he hath not rather wild one onely baptism, and that a true one, to be used through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world, Dr <hi>Featley,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> suppose the first, but where's Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> all this while their wonted <hi>Coadiutor</hi> in the cause? verily he leaves them a little here, and lends us his hand, who hold that Christ gave order, and commission for no more then one way of baptism in all Nations; for howbeit he finds in his heart to let Rantism passe for currant baptism among them that take the liberty to maintain, and use it for fear of cold p. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet whatever way of baptism the commission was given out for in those <hi>Hotter Countryes,</hi> whether submer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or infusion, (for aspersion he ownes not to be it however) the very same way, and no other, he holds the commission to be for in the coldest Nations under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and this will appear if what he saies in his 9. p. be considered, where after he had used this argument to prove that total dipping was not the way of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive baptism <hi>viz.</hi> because the conversion of disciples, and so consequently their baptism hapned sometimes to be, when there was no season for dipping, the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of water being over cold for that service, he speaks thus in way of answer to an objection <hi>viz. if any object that in those</hi> Hotter Countryes <hi>there was no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the coldest times,</hi> I <hi>answer</hi> saith he,
<q>The Commission being for all nations, disciples were made in all Countries: how soon came the word to this nation? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In which words he is void of common sense that doth not discern Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> siding with us, saying that the way of baptism should be one in all ages, and places, and asserting quite contrary to his fellow disputers against dipping, so far as to confute them to our hands, for whereas they all <hi>uno ore</hi> with one consent cry out that the reason why they baptized by dipping in the primitive time was because <hi>Judea</hi> and the regions round about were <hi>Hot Countryes,</hi> but <hi>England</hi> is a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der climate, and therefore we need not baptize the same way as they d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d: he tells them plainly that the heat of those Countries could be no reason why they should use totall dipping then, more then other nations, because the commission for bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing was one and the same, to all Nations, and disciples were then made in all Countryes, as well as in <hi>Iudea,</hi> in cold Countries as well as in hot, yea <hi>how soon</hi> saies he, <hi>came the word to England it self</hi>? baptism therefore in his account should be the same in <hi>England</hi> as in <hi>Iudea,</hi> not by dipping in <hi>Iudea</hi> more then in <hi>England</hi> because that was a <hi>hot Country</hi> and this a colder, but the commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a like in all places cold and hot, this is the sense those words of his sound forth, but if Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> were silent in this case, the Scripture speaks loud enough, that there is but one baptism for all Nations, and no Rantism ordained for any, for then the commission must include Christs willingnesse to dispense with colder cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates in this point, and in our understandings at least run thus <hi>viz. go and teach all nations, baptizing them</hi> that live in hotter countryes, and rantizing them that live in colder climates; <hi>he that believeth, and is baptized,</hi> if he live in <hi>Iudea,</hi> or any <hi>Hoter Countrey,</hi> or is but rantized if he live in <hi>England,</hi> or any cold Countrey <hi>shall be saved,</hi> in which silly unsound sense to understand those Scriptures is to be silly indeed, and without either sense or understanding: and yet thus it may be understood if this be the reason why they in <hi>Iudea</hi> must be dipt, and we in <hi>England</hi> must be no more then sprinkled for fear of danger <hi>viz.</hi> because <hi>Iudea</hi> was a warm Countrey, and <hi>England</hi> a cold one: for either <hi>Christ</hi> did ordain the thing to be done in this different manner in different regions, or he did not, if he did then it must be first some way or other intimated in the
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:109011:202"/>
commission, but there it is not, and secondly it must be done accordingly in this different manner in the execution, or else they are high transgressors that do but rantize in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> and they high transgressors (and so Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> say they are with a witnesse, but will never prove it.) that baptize by total dipping in <hi>England</hi>; but if he did not ordain it to be done in such several waies in several Regions, according as they are hotter or colder, but in one way only in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then that one way is by baptizing, i. e. dipping onely, or else by rantizing onely; and if by baptizing onely, then they are high undertakers that take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to correct Christs commission saying tis better, and safer to rantize only in some places; if by rantizing onely, then (<hi>non tutum est ludere cum sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, Sirs you grant so much as to say possibly, probably it might be done by dipping in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> and the Hot Regions round about, but may not be in these colder, pray tell me from the bottom of your consciences without stifling them, or shuffling with them, so as not to suffer them to speak, what constructions must be made of those Scriptures, which we have canvast to and fro, which relate the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their baptizings that then were, <hi>viz. Matth.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Mark</hi> 1.9.10. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.38. where it is said of the people and Christ, that they were baptized <hi>in Iordan, into Iordan,</hi> went down <hi>into</hi> the water, and came up <hi>out of</hi> the water, yea were <hi>buried with Christ in baptism Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>Collo.</hi> 2. yea and of all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scriptures, that tell us of the baptism that was dispensed in those <hi>Hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries</hi> as <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.23. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.13.14.15.33. where it is said <hi>Iohn baptized in Aenon because there was much water,</hi> and <hi>Paul went out to a Rivers side, and spake the word,</hi> at which time <hi>Lidya</hi> and hers were baptized, and a while after the Jaylor and his, tell me I say what construction all these, and all the Scriptures that talk of baptism, as dispensed in those <hi>Hot Countryes,</hi> must consequently bear, if it be once granted that such total dipping was the manner of baptizing in the primitive times in those <hi>Hotter Countreys,</hi> must they not then needs have the senses we put upon them, <hi>viz.</hi> that Christ and the rest did really descend <hi>into</hi> the water, were buried <hi>under</hi> the water, and raised again, and not those forced sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, into which you would rest them to your own ends, <hi>viz.</hi> that they went but to the water, and there were wetted onely by sprinkling, or pouring, and from the water again without going into it, or being dipped in it? if you give us one for granted, <hi>viz.</hi> that in <hi>Iudaea</hi> and those <hi>Hot Countreyes,</hi> as <hi>Rome, Phillippi,</hi> and <hi>Collosse</hi> the manner of baptizing was by going down into the water, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dipped therein in this Sacramental washing, you must necessarily give up also all the interest that you claim in those Scriptures for sprinkling, they being no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the relation of what baptism was done in <hi>Iudea,</hi> and those <hi>Hot Coun-Countreys,</hi> and not what was done in cold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if then it be supposed that baptism by submersion, and not aspersion, was the custome in the Scripture times, it must semblably be supposed that the Scriptures themselves, that story out the baptism of those times do speak of that Manner of baptism that then was, and not of another, unlesse we suppose it must be interpreted as speaking of another thing, then that it only speaks of, and so consequently this Scripture, this Testament must be supposed to be wholly on our sides, and to speak only of mens baptism by submersion, and you must suppose out some New Testament of Christ, if you can tell where, for the exemplifying of your baby

where dipping is the Custome, as you happened to come out in such a cold <hi>Climate</hi> where for fear of cold, more then any thing else, that is to warrant such a pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ise, the custome is onely to sprinkle, I appeal to your own consciences, whether such a thing as rantizing would once have come into your minds upon the single search of those Scriptures?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whereas you talk of dipping as the way of baptizing in those <hi>Hot Countreyes,</hi> both Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> also p. 15. assert that <hi>In those</hi> Hot Countrys <hi>waters for dipping were scarce and rare, and could not be had in some places in a great distance,</hi> and therefore, if sprinkling or pouring only must be used in some <hi>Countreyes,</hi> and dipping in other some, in all reason and likelyhood, if any places may be exempted from dipping, sprinkling should be dispensed with rather in those <hi>Hot Countreyes</hi> to save people the paines of travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling so far as they must do for dipping, where the waters were at such a distance from them, and dipping rather appointed to be used in these <hi>Countreyes,</hi> where the Service, as it is not much more tedious then it was in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> at least in cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and sharpest seasons, so may it be moderated as touching the tediousness ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by being done and dispatcht through the vicinity of waters here not very far off from our own doors.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, even those <hi>Hot Countryes</hi> of <hi>Iudaea, Rome,</hi> and the Regions ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about were not within the Torrid Zone, nor so hot, but that if cold water would have quenched love to Christ, and pretence of danger discharg'd from duty, they might have been as shy as your selves of being dipped in water, for even there the waters (saies Mr. <hi>Blak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This <hi>Hot Countrey</hi> catch therefore is an Argument that flashes fairly in the pan and makes a report with a powder, for almost every one lets fly at us out of this Engine, but verily it is an empty Engine, a piece discharged to keep <hi>Cold Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey</hi> Christians from killing themselves with Christs service, but charged with no great store of truth nor sense, nor reason: wherefore Sirs if the coldnesse of this service of total dipping do cause you to stand so coldly affected toward it as not to submit to it here in <hi>England,</hi> unlesse the <hi>Climate</hi> were a little hotter, yet at least let us, who by dipping as weak folks as your selves in winter have experienced how tollerable it is, through Christ strengthening us, for Christs sake to be with <hi>Paul</hi> in cold and perills of water, (so you suppose tis to be dipped) as well as in other hardship: Let us, I say, who are willing to venture on the way of dipping, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed without your offence, and as for us we shall in order to your good be so far offended at your neglect of it, as uncessantly to call upon you and yours, to <hi>repent and be</hi> so <hi>baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Iesus for the remission of sins,</hi> till you can shew us (as I am sure you never will) his letters pattents for your Exemption.</p>

<pb n="389" facs="tcp:109011:203"/>
hath no substance in it, whereupon your cause can possibly live, for though he saies their going into the water then, and being dipped therein no more inforces us to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the same in baptism, then the Example of Christ, and his Apostles gesture in the Supper, which was leaning and partly lying, ties us to the same: but as the table Gesture of sitting now in use among us is fittest for the Supper, so the usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all way of washing, which is by powring as well as dipping is fittest to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in baptism.</p>
               <p>Yet I desire Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> to consider these things,</p>
               <p>First, that if the priesthood had but any such clear example of their being sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the primitive times, as we have of their going down into the water, and being dipt there, they would inforce us with more then Arguments to an obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the very same, yea how hardly have we escaped being inforced by them from dipping, though they have not an inch of instance for their sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling?</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is a vast difference between an example in point of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and meer gesture about a service, and the very substance of the service it self, variation from Christs example in the first is naught enough, but in the other worse then nothing; yet even such is your degeneration from dipping to sprinkling, from baptism to rantism <hi>viz.</hi> not a variation from some certain circumstance in that one matter of baptism, but a variation from the ordinanance it self, a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not what Christ did in another manner, but a doing of another matter then Christ did: dipping with the face upward, and with the face downward is the same thing still, though in a different gesture, and (to satisfie Mr. <hi>Simpson,</hi> who in his letter scarce thinks it a burial in baptism, if the face be not upward, and the water powred on, as the earth is on them, we burie with their faces upward) whether this way or that way is not so much material if there be a total covering and overwhelming with either earth or water, it is a true burial still notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; but dipping and sprinkling are two such diverse things, that the first is both baptism, and burial in baptism, but the second neither the one nor yet the other.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, and yet the gesture is so fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to be heeded in every ordinance, that if we know any one to be better then another, and more assuredly to be that which Christ and his disciples used, I suppose we are bound, if not of necessity, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline it to follow any other mens fashions whatsoever, and I believe Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> did think it worth contending for to exchange the <hi>Bishops</hi> kneeling at supper, for one more suitable to that Christ used.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the gesture Christ used was the same as ours i. e. sitting not leaning, nor yet lying, for though Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> asserts with such confidence that lying was used by Christ, tis undoubtedly utterly untrue: what ere was the usual table gesture then is nothing to the point, or if it be it is most evident it was sitting, as it is now, for if it was in some places the fashion to lean or ly on beds at great banquets (as some tell us) yet I am sure the table gesture was not lying nor lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither any otherwise then as we do <hi>viz.</hi> on one elbow or both when we please: the Scripture saies all along that he sate: Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> greeking it out in the margent as he does <hi>viz.

Christ told <hi>Peter</hi> that the washing of his feet was enough to clense all, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle may signifie as well as much, as a clod of earth doth in possession of much lands, and a corn of pepper signifies our homage for much, and much to such a purpose are those words of Mr. <hi>Cook p. 20.</hi> some of which having been quoted, and spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to before, though not so satisfactorily, but that they sway with me still, I am almost loath to repeat them, yet sith they be so among the other, I can hardly decline the mentioning them once more, by your leave, in answer to the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that a little water doth not so fitly and perfectly represent as dipping and plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, sith in the one the whole body is washed, in the other the face or head on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</p>

               <p>Thirdly, These outward Elements of water, bread and wine are for speciall use, and to signify special things, so that, if there be the truth of things, the quantity is not to be respected further then is sufficient for its end, namely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the spiritual grace, and that it be neither so little as not to represent, nor so much as to take of the heart from the spirituall to the corporal thing: not the washing away the filth of the body in baptism, nor the glutting or satisfying of the natural Appetite in the Lords Supper is to be looked after, but the wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and refreshing of the Soul, which may well be represented by the sprinkling of a little water, eating and drinking of a little bread and wine, In circumcision a little skin was cut of.</p>

                  <q>The Law commandeth us to do our duty, to preserve truth from being lost, so that if truth be lost, while I do my duty, tis no sinne of mine, if it be not lost while I neglect my duty, it is yet my sin, God disposeth of events, not we, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what consequences may be occasioned, sith they are not caused by preaching the Gospel, I may not, for fear of them, nor shall shun to declare the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of God.</q>

               <p>I know necessity and charity do dispense with circumstances in ceremonies, and with ceremonies or ordinances themselves of Gods own institution some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,</p>
               <p>But first, it is with the omission onely, but not with the alteration of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other, if a man converted on his death bed, or on the ladder, when ready to be executed, as the thief was upon the crosse, be willing to be baptized, if it may be, but cannot, in charity he may, and of necessity he must be dispenst with dying unbaptized in such a case, but no man may dispense another thing to him i. e. Rantism in its room and stead, no more then he may give other things then bread and wine in the supper, to a stomach too weak to bear either of those, for that is to take upon him to make another institution, and Gods leave man never had so to do.</p>
               <p>Secondly it must be by leave from the Lord implicit, or expresse, upon which onely we can ground the lawfulnesse of omission, and necessity, and charity, but not charity mistaken, are leave enough no doubt to let a lone, though in no wise to alter what ever he ordaines, as when it neither can be at all, nor can be done conveniently, nor possibly without killing men indeed; whereupon we find no fault found with Israel in the wildernesse for forbearing to circumcise 40 years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it is like least it should hinder them in their warfare, but sure I am they should have heard of it from the Lord if to forgo the sorenesse of that circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they had circumcised i. e. cut off onely the hair of their heads.</p>
               <p>Let the <hi>Ranter</hi> therefore shew us Gods word for his omission; and the <hi>Rantizer</hi> for his mutation of Baptism, and we will fall in with either, as we see it evidenced therein.</p>

               <p>To the second I might answer, that there is not altogether the same reason, for such a totall filling, and swilling in the Supper, as there is for a totall swilling in baptism; sith the main and radical matter, that is to be resembled in baptism is Christs death, burial and resurrection, but the radical thing, that is resembled in that action of our eating and drinking in the Supper, is our faith, whereby we feed upon Christ, and accept him each to our selves as our Redeemer, without
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:109011:206"/>
which that he is a Redeemer will do us no good, for faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is the appropriating of of Christ the bread of life, each to our selves, who is set before us in common in the whole loaf, and as it will do a man no good to have bread and wine before him, which are elements most refreshing, unless he take them, and eat and drink, so neither us to see a Saviour set before us, unlesse we take of his salvation to our selves.</p>
               <p>This is that which is most immediately signifyed, and particularly represented in the Supper, which businesse of bare taking Christ Jesus to our selves by faith, is represented truly in taking never so little, but a burial and resurrection not in never so little water; a few crumbs of bread and sips of wine taken do rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>esent a taking of Christ in the Supper, but not so a few drops of water tiffled upon the face Christs death, buriall and resurrection: and fith you say the refreshment of the soul by the fullnesse is represented in our eating and drinking in the Supper, and yet that eating and drinking a little bread and wine not to fulness is enough in the supper to represent that, and so why not a little water, not deep enough to dip and bury in, applyed to us in baptism, the burial and resurrection of Christ?</p>
               <p>I might answer that the refreshment of the soul by Christ is represented rather in the elements, then in the action of either, eating or drinking in the supper, by the bread which is a strengthner of mans heart, and wine which is for them of a sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful heart, and therefore there might not be altogether the need of representing our refreshing by eating and drinking much, at least so much as Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> talkes of, viz. to the filling and glutting of our selves to the top as long as head and stomack will hold, that action would yield but a small resemblance of a refreshment, and were enough to make a sound man sick, but there is a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in all things, and a difference as we say between staring, and stark mad: thus I say I might answer, and cut off your arguing for analogy, and a small portion of the element in baptism, as well as in the supper, between which there is not fully the same reason.</p>
               <p>But verily I am of your mind that a refreshment of the soul by the fulnesse of Christ is very fit to be resembled and represented by the quantity of the elements, as well as by the elements in the supper also; and yet am I not of your mind that so little, as you ordinarily use, is so very fit as you dream it is to represent it, but of the mind rather that as you are in your baptism <hi>viz.</hi> not out of your ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as you should be if you were baptized in truth by submersion, or putting clear under water, but out in your element rather i. e. in the measure of your wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is not adaequate to the true manner of washing, so you are also in the supper too poor in your provision of elements, for that which is the true and full purport of that sacred service; you have got together many littles to prove that so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle element as you use both in baptism and supper may do as well, if not better, then more, all which are very little to the purpose, <hi>a little may signifie as well as much</hi> saies Mr. <hi>Baxter, a clod of earth, a pepper corn</hi>: but what then? we are to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie with resemblance, or else a sacrament is no sacrament, saith <hi>Austin,</hi> but saies Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> a little may resemble the washing, and the refreshing of the soul may well be resembled by a sprinkling of a little water, eating and drinking a little bread and wine, in circumcision a little skinne was cut off; what then?</p>
               <p>First it was as much as God required to be cut off.</p>
               <p>Secondly it was so much as made it circumcision.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as much as truly and clearly resembled the circumcision of the heart, which is signified, but such is not (for all Mr. <hi>Cooks</hi> conceit) that little water you sprinkle, nor yet that little becad and wine you distribute, it is neither so much as represents clearly the things signified, which are not onely the clearing of the soul by Christs dainties in the supper, which should be resembled by eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, but some more chearing and refreshing of the body, then that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in your communions;</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="396" facs="tcp:109011:207"/>But alas the burial and resurrection of Christ, in baptism should be resembled by submersion, and emersion; and therefore to answer Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> in the words of Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> the outward elements of water bread and wine are for spirri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual use, and to signifie spiritual things, so that if there be the truth of things [but what I wonder if there be not (as I am sure in Rantism there is not) the truth of baptism] the quantity is not to be respected further then is sufficient for its end, namely to represent the spiritual grace [so far then it seemes it must be, and that is enough to confute Mr. <hi>Cooks</hi> Rantism, for it represents not the spiritual grace] and that it be neither so little as not clearly to represent it) [yet so little is the quantity that you use, not of water onely in the one, but of bread and wine also in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ordinarily] nor so much as to take off the heart from the spiritual to the corporal thing] content with all in my heart that it be not too much on this hand, provided that it be not too litle one the other, so but that it may reach to resemble the things signified, for the whole vertue of baptism lying in signification <hi>per ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutionem i. e. per submersionem, per sepelitionem in aquâ,</hi> and the vertue of the supper much what in signification <hi>per recreationem, per representationem plenitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinis: non multum interest, quantum quis<expan>

               <p>To which I reply saith he, <hi>1.</hi> though he be no Physitian, yet his own reason should tell him tis no universal remedy.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Few diseases have cold baths appointed them, I have cause, saith he, to know a little more then every one in this, and I dare say that in Cities like <hi>London,</hi> and amongst Gentlewomen, that have been tenderly brought up, and Antient people, and weak people, and shop keepers, especially women that take but little of the cold air, the dipping them in the cold weather in cold water in the course of nature would kill hundreds and thousands of them either suddenly or by casting them into some Chronicle disease; &amp; I know not what trick a covetous Land lord can find out to get his tenants <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>But Mr. <hi>T.</hi> will salve all this, for he saith that there is no necessity that it be in cold water.</p>
               <p>To which I reply, saith he, <hi>1.</hi> But then he forsaketh the generality of his partners in this opinion, so much as we can learn, who usually baptize in Rivers and ponds.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> And his warm bath would be very dangerous also.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> Where should this bath be prepared? if in private, it will scarce be a solemn engaging act, if in the meeting place of the Church, then</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> It will take no small room, and require no small stir to have a bathiag place, and water to dipp people over head.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> And if they do not run home quickly before they are well ingaged, the hot bath will be turned to a cold one to them, and make them repent this badge of repentance, except they will have all things ready and be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>3.</hi> And it will be long ere Mr. <hi>T.</hi> can clear out of his reading Antiquity what Church had such a bathing place in it; but me thinks they that call for Scripture for infant baptism, should also bring Scripture for their baptizing in warm water, but some say they may stay till the heat of summer, when the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will be warm.</p>
               <p>To which I reply, saith he, where is your Scripture for that? I have prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the constant rule, and Example of Scripture is clean contrary, and requires that men be baptized, when they are first made disciples, and not stay till summer.</p>
               <p>But some desperately conclude that if it be Gods way, he will save our lives, how probable soever the danger may seem.</p>
               <p>I answer, saith he, that this is to begg the question, nay I have shewed, and am shewing that it is not Gods way; God hath appointed no ordinances contrary to his great morall commands.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> God must not be tempted, this was the devils trick to have drawn Christ under pretence of Scripture, and trusting God to have cast himself into danger of death.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> So you might have said to the disciples, that if it were Gods command to keep the Sabbath then they might not rub the ears of Corn, for God could sustain them without.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4.</hi> If it were a duty, yet when it is inconsistent with a greater duty it is at that time a sin, for it is alwaies a sin to prefer a lesser duty before a greater, for the duty of self preservation is a morall, naturall duty, and baptizing is but po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive &amp;c. God hath not appointed ordinances in his Church that will destroy men except they be preserved by Miracles, for then it were a tying himself to a constant working of Miracles &amp;c.</p>
               <p>So that I conclude saith Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> if Murder be a sin then dipping over head in cold water in <hi>England</hi> is a sin, and if those that would make it mens religion to murder themselves, and urge it on their consciences as their duty, are not to be suffered in a Common-Wealth any more then High way Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, then judge how these Anabaptists, that teach the necessity of such dipping are to be suffered.</p>
               <p>Thus you see what opinion these men are of concerning your totall dipping, and upon what ground; yea though Mr. <hi>Tombs,</hi> and others make so light of it, and wash it over as well as they can, yet Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> wipes of all their varnish, and represents it on its proper colour to the world, in its own ugly hue, and maintains it to be no lesse then meer Murder, and you may prate a while, and practise to if you please, having your quiet advantages so to do in this distracted juncture of time, but I hope an order will we taken with you in time according to your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts, is the right Kirk Government were once settled, though hitherto you have the hap to scape Scot-free.</p>

they have not a trick to favor it, &amp;c. were it not as wise a wish as the other? but I spare him, lest I be like him, though if he be not answered according to his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I fear the man may be so wise in his own conceit as to suppose his folly to be wisdome.</p>
               <p>Furtherwhat great store of small stir doth the man make about a warm bath, wondering much where it should be prepared in private or in the Church, and what stir it would require? [as if it were more difficult to build a bath a little wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and a great deal lower then a font, then tis to build a steeple house] and what room it would take? [as if the Church had rather retain her <hi>Rome</hi> then be rob'd of her room, in removing that Romish relique of infants sprinkling] and how dangerous this hot bath may prove too, and become such a cooling card as may soon make men repent of the baptism of repentance, unlesse they run home quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or be brought to bed before the people [as if it were more impossible to bath in baptism without danger, difficulty, and immodesty, then it is to bath (as thousands do) in order to meer health and pleasure.]</p>
               <p>What frivolous quibling is all this? what is the man made of brown paper, and fit for nothing, but to sit by the fire side in a pair of slippers, that his body may be baptized, neither in cold water nor warm, but it must needs be his death with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more ado?</p>
               <p>I speak this not as intending to answer as Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> doth, but to note Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> fidlings, for whether bathing in cold water be a remedy against diseases or no, I am not so far a Physitian as to know; Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> saies it is against some, and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> very wisely confutes him by confessing the same, saying onely,</p>
               <p>First it is no universal remedy.</p>
               <p>Secondly few diseases have cold bathes appointed them, it should seem there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore some have, and whether there be necessity to baptize in cold water or no I say not, Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> saies no, and indeed I see not how degrees of cold, and heat in the element can well vary the nature of the ordinance; but this I say at least, there is no necessity that I know to baptize in warm; for my part I am one, who, as grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous as Christs commandement is to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> do winter, and sommer usually baptize in rivers and ponds, nor shall I go about to scape his scrape, or Mr. <hi>Cooks</hi> either, (who as if a man were undone presently if but dipt in cold water and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, [cryes out of freezing, starving, choaking, stifling, death, murder &amp;c.) by balking one bit of the truth in this point, or disowning the way of dipping in cold water and weather, for which dispensation sith tis, as I have proved, and Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> cannot disprove<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ordinance of Christ for all Nations at all times, as people hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be converted in them, I know no season unseasonable, no time at all untimely, save when it is dispensed to one in time of infancy, nor would it be then untimely, as tedious as it is, any more then circumcision, that was a farre more bloody businesse, were it strictly injoined to be dispensed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants as that was, and as this is to believers at riper years: as for all the paines Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> bestows against it, Improving Mr. <hi>Cooks</hi> argument with all his might, it is all meer babble and bawbling, he tells us it is a desperate conclusion, and a vile answer to say that if it be Gods way hee'l save our lives, how probable soever the danger may seem, and that it is to begge the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>I answer, for my part I beg no question of him, for I have proved the question already, and can prove to his face that dipping is Gods way, and will not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to him to grant it, and being so if this be to be vile and desperate, to conclude that God will save our lives in his own way. Ile be more vile and desperate yet, and conclude with the three worthies, that for Gods way sake ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured one a baptism more bitter then this viz. <hi>baptismum flaminis</hi> not <hi>fluminis</hi> with fire, not water, more hot then this is cold, <hi>our God is able to save our lives,

               <p>He tells us God hath appointed no ordinance contradictory to his great and moral commands, and that we might as well have said to the disciples if it were Gods command to keep the Sabboth (he should have said Sabbath, had he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther known the Hebrew, or remembred himself, for saboth is another thing, for sabbath is rest, but saboth, or sabaoth is hosts as we may see in these places <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.8. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>As if circumcision were not as contrary to the duty of self-preservation as dipping in water, as if the Priests profaning the sabbath by servile work, were not as contradictory to the moral command (as your very selves call it) of Sabbath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, as either of those to self-preservation, and yet when all is done all these were to be done, and none of these contradictory to the other neither, for in very deed God never commanded sabbath-observations so strictly, as that the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the dayly sacrifice should be neglected, yea and the life not onely haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded, but utterly lost, and laid down for Christs name sake and the Gospels; he tells us that the duty of self-preservation is a moral natural duty, and baptizing but positive, I tell him again he saies as much in that, as I desire he should say, to the confirming of our tenet, for if baptizing be a positive duty, so far as tis posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive it must take place against the other, a positive command being to be obeyed rather then self to be favoured in any wise, in any case whatsoever: God gave <hi>Abraham</hi> a positive command to slay his son, therefore that being positive, and the favouring and sparing of himself and his son, though moral and natural, yet but suppositive, i. e. to be lookt at so far onely as God lent him leave to injoy his son, it must be done, and the other let alone, God must be trusted, and his will obeyed, and the saving of his son must give way to the slaying of him: the positive duty of killing him being the greater, and to be preferred before the other, and the sparing him being inconsistent with this, though elsewise a duty, yet would have been at that time a sin. In that therefore he yields baptism to be a positive command, as if self-preservation were not so, he yields us more then we are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to take of him, for howbeit for the most part it is positive, and therefore, so far as such, to be observed, without respect to the ill consequences of it to the lifeward, yet verily I question my self, though I find no expresse exemption from baptism in any case, whether there be not (yea it is certain there are) some cases, wherein the forbearance of the dispensation may, yea and must be dispenst with, but those are not the coldnesse of the water and weather, but the utter impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the persons submitting to it, of whom else it is required, or his being bard from it, either as the thief on the crosse was, or by imprisonment, or by some such absolute sicknesse or weaknesse as confines persons necessarily to their beds, and puts them out of capacity and ability to betake themselves, where it may be done as it ought, I am willing to modify Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> rigid epithete of a positive command, whereby he denominates baptism, so far as to spare persons in these cases and respects, and to stile baptism a duty but suppositive i. e. a thing that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily must be done, if either possibly, or conveniently it may be done; but if it cannot, may be let alone: but this proves not that self-preservation must be alwaies prefer'd before baptism, for then it need never be obeyed at all, there being no time, wherein it can be done with so little seeming tediousnesse, and disease to a mans self, but that self will willingly excuse it self from obeying it, by pleading the duty of self-preservation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="402" facs="tcp:109011:210"/>This duty of self-preservation hath couzened as honest a man as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ere now, and it couzens the whole Priesthood to this hour, who generally suppose that God is no further to be served, then self may be preserved, hence no pay no preach, no countenance from the magistracy, no continuance in their ministry, but for selfs sake they turn still with the times, but no faster; as if they durst trust God no further then they see him, and this was the plea, whereby <hi>Peter</hi> would fain have put Christ beside a duty that he foresaw would be dangerous, for Christ and himself too: but Christ gave him no great thanks for his labor, <hi>far be it from thee Lord</hi> quoth he, <hi>to go to</hi> Ierusalem <hi>and suffer</hi>; by no means let this be: he thought he did well to rebuke Christ for owning the Gospel in that case, wherein he must expose himself to suffer, but get thee behind me Satan saith Christ, thou art an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, thou savourest not the things of God, but those that be of men, thou think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est as if he should say that self must be favoured, before positive duty be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the life must be saved, and the gospel obeyed no further then is consistent with self-preservation, but I tell you saith he, that if any man will be my disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple he must deny himself, and take up his crosse and follow me. for he that will save his life i. e. discharge no duty that may prove dangerous to his life, shall lose it, but he that will lose his life for my name sake, and the Gospel, shall save it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.11. to 26. if <hi>Paul</hi> had stood so much upon the point of self-preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and counted his life so dear unto himself, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> seems to do his, he would have harkned to such as besought him to favour himself, and not have gon up to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> where he knew not what should befall him, save that he knew that bonds and afflictions did there abide him, if he would there testifie to the Gospel <hi>Act.</hi> 20.22.23.24, 21.22. nor would he have exposed himself to so many hazzards and perils by sea and land, perils by water, perils by hunger and thirst, and cold and nakednesse, none of all which things moved him, that he might witnesse to the Gospel:</p>
               <p>He tattles to us <hi>that God must not be tempted, and that it was the divels trick to draw Christ under pretence of Scripture and trusting of God to have cast himself into danger of death</hi>; who doubts of all this, but is it tempting to perform a positive command of God, and expose our selves to danger and difficulty in the discharge of our positive duty to him, because it is so to indanger our liues by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, which we have no call to, nor warrand for, and which is absolutely sin, and hath not the least dram of duty in it at all? it is true it would have been but pretence of Scripture, and trusting of God in Christs casting himself from the pinacle of the Temple, but dare he saie there is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but pretence of Scripture and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of God in submitting to his own ordinance of baptism? is there no more word to warrant us to be baptized, and to trust in God, and to expect his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection in the execution of that so absolute a command, then there is to warrand the execution of our selves, which God universally forbids, and that on no more ground then the bare bidding of the devil? who would think a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister should be so moped as to make these two a like warrantable? it was the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels trick therefore to draw Christ under pretence of Scripture and trusting of God to self-execution against duty; and whether it be Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> trick onely, or the divels in him to draw men under pretence of Scripture and tempting of God to self-preservation so far as not to trust God in the discharge of duty, is not amisse for Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to examine for that it savours not of spirit but of flesh it is so sure that it needs no examination.</p>
               <p>If therefore it were indeed so dangerous to be dipt, as is imagined by Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> yet I see no word of Christ willing a declension of the dispensation.</p>
               <p>But what if this be but a meer Chimaera of these mens coining, how much lesse are we then excused in our non-submission? and yet such and no other will it be found to be at last by then we have sounded this most murderous mater to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.</p>

               <p>Hear therefore o ye doters on <hi>Mr. Baxters</hi> deep divinity; he talks (if you will believe him) as if it were little lesse then impossible that persons should be dipped in cold weather in cold water, and not be killed suddenly by hundreds and by thousands, or at least not be cast into some Chronical disease, which within a while must be an occasion of their death; whereas there are hundreds if not thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands alive at this hour even in this cold Countrey, as they call it, many if not most of which have past through that sharp service in the sharpest seasons, conversion falling out as ordinarily in winter as in summer, whose present health both proves the falsnesse, and reproves the madnesse of your prophet.</p>
               <p>Yea I have cause to know a little better then every one, and a little more then Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in this, <hi>Expertus loquor,</hi> I speak by experience, against which no Argument of his availes, I have seen since my five or six years converse among the commonly called Anabaptists many a one baptized totally in cold watet and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too by others, besides toward two hundred by my silly self, many of which have come forth covered, though not with yce, as Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> phrases it out, yet with that water which yce truly covered but just before, yet never saw I any one so bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in all that time, who was not, if not better in meer bodily respects, yet at least as well after it as before; he tells you (if you will believe him) that totall dipping is <hi>for nothing but to dispatch men out of the world that are burdensome,</hi> but then I wonder how the Creature called Anabaptist, that is so burthensome to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> doth not dy out of the way by hundreds and thousands, and so save him and others that labour of dispute against their growth, but rather grow from hundreds into thousands so fast that they are not likely to be dispatcht out of the world, till they are such a burthensom stone as will press them to death, i. e. the whole Priesthood, that is troubled with them.</p>

               <p>Yea whereas Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> dares say that in Cities like <hi>London,</hi> and amongst Gentlewomen that have been tenderly brought up, and antient people, and weak

people, and shopkeepers, especially women that take but little of the cold aire, dipping in cold weather would in the course of nature kill hundreds and thousands suddenly, or cast them into some Chronical disease, I dare say that in the City of <hi>London</hi> there is hundreds, if not thousands dipped in cold water, and as it happens, in cold weather too, many of which are Gentlewomen tenderly brought up, and antient and weak people, and shop keepers, and women that take but little of the cold aire, and yet by the course of grace they are preserved from perishing by either cold or suffocation: yea and out of the City of <hi>London</hi> too, for these hands have baptized of all these sorts in the Countrey, <hi>viz.</hi> Gentlewoman most tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought up, very antient people, very weak people, shopkeepers, and specially two women both alive at this day, which I'l become a fool in telling you of them sith Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> compells me, did take so little of the cold aire that one of them, if my memory fail me not, and if I were truly informed, was but once out of her house in 5 year before, by reason of a dropsy; and that was with much adoe, and but a little before her dipping, and to hear this doctrine, notwithstanding which weaknesse, and such swellings that she was wellnigh twice as bigg as now she is, and scarce able to betake her self to the water, she was dipped, and was rather better in body, then worse after it, and after sending for some elders of the Church to pray over her, and anoint her with oile in the name of the Lord according to his own institution in that behalf <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. was within a while so asswaged in her swellings, that she is now as sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The other had scarce been out of her Chamber in two years together, and durst not dip her finger in cold water, and was ready to have her breath stopt with the least annoyance that could be yet was dipped, and was better after it (through Gods mercy) for a pretty while so as to go abroad: though she now is weak, and much what as she used to be before.</p>
               <p>If then you will not believe the words of God, believe the works, believe the Miracles, for it is by Miracles that they are preserved who are dipt in cold water and not destroyed saies Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> which if it be then God hath wrought very many Miracles among the men you nickname Anabaptists of late, for they are constantly preserved from perishing by either cold, or suffocation: yea I have known many a one better in body, but I nere knew any one, of whom I could safely say they were the worse in body or Soul for being dipt, save such as turned from the truth after turning to it, for the latter end with such indeed is worse then their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Yet how rashly do these men shoot their bolts to the murdering of the truth, whilst they make the ordinary practise of it no lesse then flat murder it self, and that undeniably to any understanding man, unless there be a preservation by a miracle; for else it <hi>destroyes men</hi> quoth Mr. <hi>Baxter, it directly tendeth to overthrow mens lives in the course of Nature, it will kill hundreds and thousands of them; but if a man scape perishing with cold, yet how can he</hi> (i. e. how is it possible for him) <hi>to escape being choaked</hi> quoth Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> and stifled with the water, if he must be plunged over head to signify his death to sin?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly kept under water to signify his burial?</p>
               <p>How can a man escape choaking Sirs, if he be put and kept under the water? why I tell you that either he can, or else he cannot, if he can, why then he can, and so Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> is confuted; if he cannot in the course of nature, without mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, then it being certain that thousands do scape choaking, it should seem God by Miracle secures them, and yet for all this nor Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> nor Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> are convinced; whether it be the more shame for them or no not to be so, I leave it to themselves, and all understanding men to consider.</p>
               <p>Or perhaps Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> means how can a man escape choaking if he be kept three daies under water, for so quoth he the disciple must, as Christ abode three daies
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:109011:211"/>
under water, if Christs burial be represented, but not onely his own party, for <hi>mora sub aqua quantu lacunque</hi> saith <hi>Tilenus, quantumvis momentanea</hi> saith <hi>Bucan,</hi> abode under the water for never so little a while doth most lively resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Christs Burial, but his own practise confutes him clearly in this, for as the Ministers hand with which Dr. <hi>Featley</hi> resembles Christs burial is not dipt three daies together under water, so the insusion of water upon the face of the infant, which why may it not represent the burial as well as dipping quoth Mr. <hi>C.</hi> p. 17. doth not last for three daies together neither.</p>
               <p>Thus you see how well Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> have quitted themselves in their proof of our practise to be murder, and against the sixth commandement, and what high and mighty reason Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath to accuse us to the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate as murderers, and to suggest it his duty to him out of Mr. <hi>Craddock,</hi> to restrain us to save the lives of his subjects, and not to suffer but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy us.</p>

               <p>Well, if it do not prove to be murder, and so against the eighth commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet I am sure it will prove to be adultery to dip naked, as they say you do, and so flatly against the seventh, for either you dip naked or you do not, if you do not, then you cannot dip the whole body: but if you do, if that be not so shame fully sinful as is scarce fit to be named among Christians, I know not what is: and this Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> and <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> doth intimate to us, whose words I shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so intimate to you at the present.</p>
               <p>I would know with these new dippers saith Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> whether the parties to be doused and dipped may be baptized in a garment, or no? if they may, then happily the garment may keep the water from some part of the body, and then they are not rightly, baptized, for the whole man say they must be dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</p>
               <p>Again, I would ask what warrand they have for dipping, or baptizing gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments more then the Papists have for baptizing bells? therefore belike the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty must be naked, and multitudes present, as at <hi>Johns</hi> baptism, and the parties men and women at ripe years, being able to make confession of their faith and repentance; yet though they both sin against the sixth commandement indange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring life, and against all common honesty and civility, and Christian modesty required in the seventh commandement, they must have this way observed, because they fancy it the onely baptism: shall we think saith he, this was the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism of <hi>John,</hi> Christ and his Apostles? thus he,</p>
               <p>And saies Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> Another wickednesse in their manner of baptizing is their dipping persons naked, as is very usuall with many of them, or next to naked, which is usuall with the modestest that I have heard of, against which I argue thus.</p>
               <p>If it be a breach of the seventh commandement, thou shalt not commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, ordinarily to baptize the naked, then it is intollerable wickednesse, and not Gods ordinance, but so it is, therefore.</p>
               <p>The Minor is thus evident <hi>saith he,</hi> that commandement forbids all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citements to uncleannesse, and all immodest actions, but to baptize women naked is an immodest action, and an incitement to uncleanness therefore, and to this he saies Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> answered it was thought no immodesty in former times; but though it may seem no immodesty in Countries where they still go naked, yet among such as are not savages me thinks it should saith Mr. <hi>Baxter;</hi> if Mr. <hi>T.</hi> could baptize naked all the Maids in <hi>Bewdly,</hi> and think it no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modesty, he hath lost his common ingenuity, and modesty with the truth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, every good man is to watch over his heart, and to pray that he be not led into temptation, and would it be no snare and temptation to Mr. <hi>T.</hi> to be frequently imployed in baptizing maids naked? me thinks the very mention of it saith he, could I avoid it is immodest, and what it may be to all sorts of specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors I stand not to expresse;</p>
               <p>Besides all this <hi>saith he,</hi> it is likely to raise jealousies in Ministers wives and others, and so to foment continual dissentions, and it will make the ministry a scandal, and make the people look on them as so many vile incontinent men, if
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:109011:212"/>
auricular confession brought that infamy, no wonder if ordinary baptizing naked do it.</p>
               <p>Further, it would debauch the people, and bereave them generally of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon modesty, if once it growes into custom to behold each others nakednesse, and sure that practise is not of God, which so directly tends to bereave men of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon civility, modesty, ingenuity and humanity:</p>
               <p>Moreover, it would make the worship of God ridiculous, would not vain young men come to a baptizing to see the nakednesse of maids, and make a meer jest and sport of it?</p>
               <p>Moreover the practise of baptizing naked would bring a general reproch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Christian profession among the enemies of it, and discredit the truth, for when Christians have the repute of Adamites, who will turn Christians? so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber men will be loath to take a woman to wife that hath the impudency to shew her self naked to an assembly, and would esteem it next to taking one from the stewes.</p>
               <p>If they shall say to all this, as Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> said in his Sermon, it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary they be naked, I reply <hi>saith he,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First if it be next to naked the difference is not great, and the former inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences will follow, and God would not have the Iewes go up by steps on his altar, lest their nakednesse be discovered thereon, <hi>Cam</hi> was curst for beholding his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers nakedness, Christ tells us it is adultery to look on a woman to lust after her; the Scripture forbids filthiness, and uncleannesse, as not to be named among Saints.</p>
               <p>Secondly, such as would have them wholly, or mostly covered differ from their partners, and to dip them covered will overthrow their own arguments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the necessity of washing the whole body, for this will be no washing but a soak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or steeping, if they stay in long enough, it may wash the garment, but the body will be but infused in all likelihood, and so I leave this unsavory practise, which were it not necessary to confute I should not meddle with it.</p>
               <p>But in these last cases we dispute not against bare words, but against experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and known practises, for their naked baptizing is a known thing, and the wickednesse that hath followed on some, and that some have died on't, and I would saith he, have others more wise, and escape both dangers, onely let me say saith he, thus much more that it is very suspicious, and to me unsavory that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> should say no more, but that it is not necessary they should be baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed naked, and in cold water, as if he took it to be lawful, but not necessary: me thinks he should rather have given his testimony against it, as sinful, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed some dislike, if he he do indeed dislike it, and judge it sinful, and if he do not, I dare say he is very far gone: one may see what you are by the words of these men, who have here set you out in your colours, so that I hope all, that read or hear what they say, will rather abhor then adore your dipping doings, and if you were not a people past all shame and sense of sin, me thinks you should abhorre your selves in dust and ashes, at the remembrance of your abhominable baseness in this particular; yea give me leave to say one word more to you, who were a minister once that did baptize infants, and it is the words of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to Mr. <hi>Tombes p. 255.</hi> I conjecture that by that time you have baptized half as many maids and women naked in a cold River, as you have baptiz'd infants like an officiating Priest, your feet will either take cold, or your heart will take heat: if you would be ruled by me you should not indeavour to introduce into the Church a custome for every young minister or neighbour, so much as to look on a bathing <hi>Bathsheba</hi> or <hi>Susanna,</hi> least to those without, the name of a Church and a stewes, a Presbyter and a Pander, a Christian and a fornicator, do prove Synonimaes.</p>

               <p>Here is thunder enough, but no lightning, a shrill sound but an empty barrel; such is Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> book indeed, specially this twofold fardle about murder and adultery, in which whether there be more noise or non-sense I know not, but sure I am there is ten times more twittle-com-twattle then truth: this doctrine would make a terrible rumbling in a Country Church as they say, and make all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple amazed to hear what manner of men these Anabaptists be, but he that sleeps there with his eyes open, will be s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Of these two accusers of the brethren Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> is more candid, and a little more modest then the other, and yet he utters so much that he hath much reason to be ashamed of it, for howbeit he does not so audaciously charge us with that foul fact of naked dipping as the other doth, yet by some simple supposals,</p>
               <p>First, that persons cannot be rightly baptized by dipping with a garment on [as if they may not be put under, and covered and buried therein cloathed aswell as naked, and as if a soaking or steeping in water (Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> bald conceit of our dipping) were not a washing or burying.]</p>
               <p>Secondly that it is as unwarrantable to baptize garments, as tis for the Papists to baptize bells [as if those that baptize persons in garments, did as directly, and intentionally baptize garments, as the papists do baptize bells, or as if it were more unwarrantable for us to wet the cloathes, that persons are baptized in, when we baptize their bodies, then tis for the priests to wet the head cloaths of infants when they rantize their faces.]</p>
               <p>By such silly supposals I say as these that there can be no true totall dipping, unless the persons be uncloathed, he subtly insinuates the world into a certain suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at least a shrewed suspition that dipping naked is the onely baptism dispensed among us, for which hee'l once be ashamed; but as for Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> he is so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuous, impudent and uncivilly foolish in this present parcel of his, you have here spread before us, that I professe against it as having in it much falsenesse, and more immodesty then I ever saw expressed at the totall dipping of any person that ever I saw dipped in my life: for he not only makes a long supervacaneous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of his dislike of dipping women and maids naked (in which is such a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse and over often nomination of those termes too, as tends more to the offending of chast, and corrupting of unchast consciences, then to any use of edifying at all) but also most rashly relates it to the whole world to be the usuall, ordinary known practise of a people, that are as abhorrent of such abominations as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>As for his Argument it is a fallacy called <hi>Ignoratio Elenchi,</hi> for he concludes not the point in question, for they, who stand most for baptizing by totall dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, are all (for ought that ever I heard of) as much against naked dipping as himself: yea so far are we all, (if any had been otherwise minded Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
                  <pb n="409" facs="tcp:109011:213"/>
would surely have assigned them, whose design was to vilifie us what he could, so far are we all from countenancing such a practise, that I dare, in the name of all the Churches of the Baptists through England, declare their unanimous utter detestation of it, in Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> own words, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is a breach of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Commandment, an intollerable wickednesse, an immodest action, an incitement to uncleannesse, likely enough to raise jealousies in Ministers wives, yea and other womens husbands too, and so to foment continuall dissention, a means to debauch people, and bereave them of all common civility, modesty, ingenuity, and humanity, to turn Gods worship into contempt, and make it meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ridiculous, to bring a general reproach upon the Christian profession among all the enemies thereof, yea amongst the most sober and discreet, to discredit the truth, and prejudice men against it; yea verily tis scandal, reproach and discredit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, in that it is but belied by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to be so base, how much more, and more justly would it be reproached, if his reports were as true as they are full of falsehood; we I say acknowledg the practise of naked dipping to be as bad, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> proves it to be, therefore <hi>quorsum haec</hi>? to what purpose doth he with such prolixity proceed to prove, what no sober minded man of either party doth deny?</p>
               <p>This is <hi>aliud a negato</hi>; a plain absurd a berration from the question, which is not whether it be a sin ordinarily to dip naked or no? but whether we ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly use that kind of dipping?</p>
               <p>The first which none doubts of, he indeavours to make evident as one that light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a candle, whereby to shew men that the sun shines.</p>
               <p>The second, which is unknown utterly among us, he proclaims to be our usual, notorious, known practise: but he offers no proof of this at all.</p>
               <p>Such silly Sophistry as this Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> uses also in almost every of these Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereby he professes to disprove our practise as unwarrantable, conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all along another point than that in question; for whereas our tenet is that persons at years, professing to believe, of what parents so ever born, are to be baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he most simply, and sinisterly concludes against us, as he supposes, in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of four or five Arguments that the children of Christians may not be baptized when they come to years, and that this practise of baptizing of Christians chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is utterly unconsistent with the Rule of Christ: as for us we say as much, neither is it our practise or opinion to baptize Christians children at age, upon that account meerly, as they are Christians children any more then the children of them that are no Christians, unlesse they professe to be believers and Christians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as their parents do, and upon that account, <hi>viz.</hi> as they professe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, we baptize hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in his Christianity, and as sure as he is ignorant when he began to professe to be a Christian, so sure I am that he never yet began to professe to be a Christian in truth, who knowes not that ever he was otherwise, but hath and holds his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession as the Turk and Jew do theirs <hi>viz.</hi> for the true one at a venture, because they were born and bred in it, and received it by Tradition onely from forefathers.</p>
               <p>And as he will prove himself to be what he professes to be <hi>viz.</hi> a hater of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant violence, so I advise him to be a hater also of violent ignorance, of which hateful quallity in my mind he hath as much as any of the greedy gang, <hi>Gangraena</hi> it self onely excepted, not excepting Dr. <hi>Featley,</hi> Dr. <hi>Bastwick,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bayliff,</hi> Mr <hi>Pagit,</hi> not any among the proud pack of Prelates, that most perheminently prate against the Gospel.</p>
               <p>And sith Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> saies this much more that it is very suspicious, and to him unsavory that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> should say no more but that it is not necessary that they be baptized naked, as if he took it to be lawfull, though not necessary, and thinkes he should rather have given his Testimony against it as sinful, and expressed some dislike if he do indeed dislike, and judge it sinful, and if he do not he dare boldly say he is very far gone, let me say thus much more, that then it is as suspicious, and to me unsavory, that Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> should say no more but that it is a breach of the seventh commandement, ordinarily to baptize the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, as if he took it to be lawful to do it sometimes, but not ordinarily: me thinks he should giue his Testimony against it as sinful, to do it at all, and express some dislike if he do indeed dislike and judge it sinful, and if he do not, I dare boldly say he is gone farther in filth, then Mr. <hi>T.</hi> or any baptized person ever went yet, save such as are gone quite off from the way of truth to the dishonour of it since they owned it, whose sin yet (the more shame for Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi>) he in his next ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, laies to the truths charge, and theirs, who both own and honour it by abiding in it, who are lesse gladly, and more sadly sensible of their sins, and villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies then Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> can be, by how much by reason of their lasciviuos wayes, which many follow, the way of truth they walk in is, as was foretold it should be 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1.2.3. by Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> and his admirers evil spoken of.</p>
               <p>But if Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> shall still say it is suspicious and unsavory for Mr. <hi>T.</hi> to say the one, but not for himself to say the other, and will none of the foregoing advice to repent and be baptized, but rather reject the counsel of God against himself being not baptized, because he hath experience (by hearsay) that we baptize females naked, then a rod and a rod for the back of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> who pardons to himself the same defects, wherein he holds others guilty, who so slenderly takes up every tattle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the truth, and proclaimes it for truth to the whole world, for the simple be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth every word, but the prudent man looks well to his going <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.15 a prudent man foresees evil and secures himself, but the simple passe on and are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.3.</p>
               <p>As for his next and last argument against us which he drawes from the judgments of God that ever follow us, wherein he jumbles all kinds of sectaries into the name of Anabaptists as the Antibaptists use commonly to do, witnesse <hi>Featley</hi> and others, and makes them bear the burden of all the mischiefs that were ever perpetrated by all the mad braind men in all the world, as <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> and all the rest of his ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting strain, it is scarce current consequence to say Gods judgements are upon a people, therefore that people are none of his, for all things come alike to all, &amp; none knowes love or hatred by what is before him here <hi>Eccl.</hi> 8.14. and the 9.1.2.3. yet sith he speaks of ruinating judgements, let the consequence passe as valid, but then his minor is utterly false, for the Anabaptists are not all ruinated yet, nor will be till the Clergy are quite cashiered, as evident as it is that they have every where withered and suddenly come to nought heretofore, and since he speakes of spiritual judgements <hi>e. g.</hi> that practise saith he hath never helped, but hindred the work of God where it comes, nor hath God blest their ministry to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:109011:215"/>
of soules as he hath other mens, but rather they have been instruments of the Churches scandal and misery.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that hath been the inlet to most other vile opinions, few stop at it but go much further, God hath usually given up their societies to notorious scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous wicked lives, and conversations more then others that professe godlinesse, and never prospered them so far as to have any established Churches, which should credit the Gospel. I grant that some of these are sad emblems of a people none of Gods, onely Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> hath here saddled the wrong asse, for this way of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism hinders onely the work of mans Tradition, which would make void the commandement of God, but being it self the work and way of God, is hindred where ere it comes by Priestly malice, preaching Gods fear after precepts of men, nor hath God blessed the Nationall ministry to the true conversion of soules as he hath done theirs, but to the conversion of them to a Gospel of their own making, for repent and be baptized was the Gospel that <hi>Peter</hi> preached, and that is it that is now practised by us, and how many are converted and baptized accordingly is so evident, that it needs no proof at this hour, but repent and be not baptized is the Gospel the Priesthood preaches, and if you call that conversion, which indeed is confusion, we confesse their converts are more more then ours, such instruments of scandal and misery to the true Churches are the Priests in all places by their reproaches, nor is baptism the inlet of any vile opinions any more then the same was in the primitive times, wherein many that were baptized did turne hereticks, when they had done, as they do now, but what wise man then impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to their baptism? and yet some of those opinions Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> calls vile, will be proved to his conscience in due time to be the truth: yet many that are baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed do run out to very vile opinions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and practises no better then their principles, and stop not there indeed as he saies, but go much further, and degenerate into wayes o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But what then? shall we impute that fault to his being baptized? I trow not; for howbeit Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> so imagines, yet it was because he honoured not the truth, when he had owned it, nor walked in Christ after he had received him, in which case how often God gives over to strong delusions is evident, not only by the word, which declares that when men like not to retain God in their knowledge he oft gives them over unto vile affection,</p>
               <p>But also by sad experience in the world in these last times, wherein 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. and the 2.3.1. doctrines of divels are rife among them, that once owned the faith, yet the faith not a whit in fault for all that, but departure from the faith before expressed.</p>
               <p>And that the fall of these men is into worse then ever before, it is no argument against, but rather for the way they newly fall from, the sensuality of such as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate themselves from the true Churches in the later times, i. e. congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal after these are once separated from the false ones i. e. the nationall, being prophesied of 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>Iude</hi> 19. of old, that it should be greater then that of all beastly men that were before them; besides <hi>corruptio optimi pessima,</hi> the higher the rise into reformation, the more desperate the fall into deformation, of those that reform and prove deformed again: that greater depth of hell therefore men fall into that fall from us, proves the hight of our Churches to be neerer heaven, then that of yours, <hi>for if after they have escaped</hi> &amp;c. 2 Pet. 2.20.21.22. when <hi>Cop</hi> was in his standing in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I remember very well, for I knew him better then then ever since, he had some bounds from conscience to his corruption, but having been once inlightned higher then Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ever was yet

in the will and way of God, and tasted of the heavenly gift, and made a parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the holy spirit, and obeyed the truth as it is in Jesus, and yet fallen away, his conscience is seard with a hot iron, and I have small hope of his renewing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst by repentance, who thus denies the Lord that bought him, and crucifies the Lord afresh, and is twice dead, pluckt up by the Roots, a raging wave of the sea foaming out his own shame.</p>
               <p>But what is all this to those that yet walk in truth of baptism, more then to warn them that they depart not from it, as he hath done, lest they come into the same condemnation with him? doth it prove baptism to be the cause of that gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that often followes, when a person is baptized? in no wise, for his non abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the love of the truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that doctrine of Christ gives God occasion to give over to the height of wickednesse.</p>

               <p>Secondly, much if not more then a third part of it, <hi>viz.</hi> from p. 262. to p. 286. consists almost universally in a particular private publike prate to Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> in vindication of himself f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly much if not much more then a third part of the residue, <hi>viz.</hi> from p. 289. to 338. he spends in division with other divines for pleading and practising baptism to infants from other grounds and principles and to other ends and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses then himself doth, as namely, from Tradition, and yet in order to baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal regeneration, as Mr <hi>Bedford,</hi> who is fain to fly to tradition for proof of infant baptism, and yet holds that baptism doth really as an instrumental efficient cause confer, and effect the grace of regeneration of nature on infants, which Mr <hi>Bedford,</hi> Dr. <hi>Burges,</hi> Dr. <hi>Ward,</hi> together with Mt. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself, and I know not how many more Divines, in the meandrous multitudinous mist of whose <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> opinions a man may sooner loose himself then find the truth, are all ore the tops of the boots in dissentaneous discourses about a businesse called baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal regeneration, the quiddity, quantity, and commodity of which <hi>non ens,</hi> of which nonsense, as to infants, is so curiously pryed into, and learnedly inquired after by them, that it is not for every ordinary body, that hath no more learning then <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> had, who never <hi>Scholasticallized</hi> the plain Gospel out of the reach of plain men and poor folks, as our Rabbies now adaies do, to come within a mile or two of their meaning; some divining on this wise, some on that, some one thing, some another, some that baptism is instituted to work the first grace in infants, i. e. habitual, but not in men, in whom the first grace is prerequir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as Mr. <hi>Bedford,</hi> some thwarting that by this reason, that baptism cannot have two different uses to men and infants, and yet saying with all, that it may be for some ends to the Aged, for which it is not to infants, as <hi>Mr. Baxter,</hi> some saying that baptism is a Physical, some a Metaphysical, some a Hiperphysical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument to convey real grace into infants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the spirit working it in them thereby naturally, or rather supernaturally, as <hi>Mr. Bedford</hi> who holds that it really conveyes grace on all infants elect, or non elect, and Dr. <hi>Burges,</hi> who yet differs and subdivides from him, holding that it conveyes grace on the elect infants only, and not on the non-elect, some that baptism is onely a moral instrument, and

the spirit neither a Physical nor Hyperphysical, but a moral Agent in baptism, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying and so working on the souls, sealing and conveying no real grace, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative grace, i. e. right to the real, as <hi>Mr. Baxter,</hi> who saith that real true grace and change of mind is to go before baptism, as a condition both in the institution, and every example of baptism through all the bible, therefore not to be conveyed in it, this <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> proveth by the institution <hi>Math.</hi> 28.18. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. and by the examples of the <hi>Iewes, Samaritans,</hi> the <hi>Eunuch, Paul, Lydia,</hi> the <hi>Iaylor,</hi> the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who all did gladly receive the word, repent and believe, and then and thereupon only were baptized p. 300. and because all this is exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive of infants, who have no faith nor grace (for to the utter confutation of the <hi>Ashford</hi> Disputers, who say infants in <hi>their infancy have faith and the spirit of grace, and that apparently enough, the Scripture making it plainly appear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> professeth that it is <hi>utterly unknown to any man on earth and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revealed in the word, whether God give infants any inherent spiritual grace or not</hi> p 301.</p>
               <p>Therefore to salve his baptism of infants that have not that grace, and faith in them, that is prerequired to be in persons to be baptized, as a condition, he very goodly tells us that by grace and faith being prerequired, as a condition, he means <hi>either in the party or another for him,</hi> so then though infants have no faith in themselves yet <hi>o mirandum</hi>! they have faith in the loines, i. e. in the hearts of their parents, and so are to be baptized, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Thus oh how these men, who more stink of the Schooles then skill in the Scriptures, are at variance about their own inventions, bending their brains some one way, some another, to botch up their businesse of infant-baptism, and yet, as fast as one builds up, another of them saves us a labour, and razes and pulls down to our hands; oh what stoch, what stuff, what stirs, what strife, what stickling, what striking flatly against each others principles, what a ditty, what a do is here among them? as if the Divines were all mad: so let all the fraternity of divines be divided o God, and fall out ever about their own fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, till they find thy truth, and never let them agree better among themselves on what account to baptize infants, till they (ashamed of themselves, and people ashamed of waiting on the Seers for determination of what is truth) be all driven to confesse as (blessed be thy name) Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth already p. 301. That <hi>they find it a hard controversie to prove infant baptism it is so dark in the Scripture, much more a hard task to prove different uses of it to men and infants,</hi> as needs they must if they prove it to be of use to infants, for it signifies not at all to them as it does to men, and so to conclude, to the freeing of themselves from that puzzle and perplexity, and fire of contention that now they fry in, for their hatred of that one onely plain way of truth that leades to piece, that verily tis not thy will that any infant at all should be baptized; and let Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> who was once in doubt of infant baptism, upon sight of the slender grounds that other divines did hold it from, till satan seduced him back again to the belief of it again, be perswaded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if it be thy will, on sight of the more weak and slender principles, which with much ado he hath found out, whereon to satisfy himself and others, and to sit still in the shadow of that superstition, to be not almost onely, but altogether, saving their sufferings from him, such as thy servants are, whom he yet vilifies what he can.</p>
               <p>As then to <hi>Mr. Baxters Appendix</hi> of Animadversions on Mr. <hi>Bedfords,</hi> Dr. <hi>Burges,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Wards</hi> absurdities about baptismal regeneration of infants, tis no matter to us, yea I conceive it a likely means of it self to make wise men renounce Infants baptism, that read there at what ods they are, and how they wrangle among

               <p>And as touching separation, I know but three separations they have had since they stood under the name of Christian Churches, answerable to the different Christian Religions, of point blank Papism, prelatical Prostantanism, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Presbyterianism, which the parishes haue past under since they have been Parishes, viz. a Presbyterian separation by appointment of the present Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who on pain of their displeasure commanded all to separate from the lesser superstitions of episcopall formes, ceremonies, services, to a finer and more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectorian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> kind of Protestant profession; a generall Protestant separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Appointment of our english state under K. <hi>Ed.</hi> and Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> who commanded all on pain of their displeasure to separate from the Romish grosser superstitions, Popes Supremacies, masse and other Marian opinions and professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, also a parochial and a paropopical separation, or distinct oppidal division of their particular selves from each other, and all other particular Churches i e. Towns besides themselves, by the appointment of the Pope and his Subs and Subsubs <hi>viz.</hi> Christian Emperours, Kings and Princes, who when they threw down their Crownes, and gave up all their power to make one beast called Christien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and themselves and theirs to be ruld and reignd over wholly by the whore at her wil, did both separate all Christendome from the world, and then sub-separate it into many smaller Christendomes, and constituted Churches i. e, national provincial, parochial: and thus <hi>Ked.</hi> and <hi>Bew.</hi> first began to be Churches, or societies visibly separated from the world viz. by the call of the Pope, who separated one parish from another; but Christs Churches had another separation i. e. by the word barely preached, and not by outward force imposed, they were called to faith in Christ, and baptism, not Rantism, into his name for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins, and after that continued in the Apostles doctrine, and in fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship one with another, not forced, but free, and in breaking of bread and prayers: these are the Churches to which as then, so now the Lord adds dayly such as shall he saved, and therefore I must tell Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> and the honest men in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ked.</hi> or <hi>Bew.</hi> that are of Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> beguiling that except they repenting both for and from their dead works, and their vain conversation in point of baptism, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, Church-fellowship &amp;c received by Tradition from their fathers, and their unadvised zeal in siding to smite Christ with reproches thorow the sides of the true Churches, be baptized better then ever they have been, and do as those did in <hi>Act.</hi> 2. which as no infant then did so now none can do, they have neither the true matter nor the true form constitutive of the visible Church of Christ, yea so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them onely as shall gladly receive the word, which infants cannot do, and yet may do well enough too, neither that nor walking in fellowship being requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of them, as it is of others, and be baptized according to his will, shall be owned as the true visible Church of Christ in these two parishes as Christs appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, the residue of Mr. Bs. book which containes his arch argumentation from three principles for infants baptsm viz. their discipleship Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and rightship of being dedicated unto Christ, is for the most part, to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of any that are minded to own the truth, though not so intentionally in way of formal answer to Mr. Ba. so fully and effectually enervated before, where the same arguments, as they are used by others, are examined, that it could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount

to no other then superfluity, and Tautologie to answer them over again, because they are urged in another, that is a more pedantick for me by him, whose work is not at all to produce any new principles from which to prove the point, but onely to improve more largely in a way of labor more long then strong, to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age more formally in a way of hipothetical syllogism, and to drive on more furiously these few old ones; therefore excuse me, specially since Mr. <hi>T.</hi> hath given reply some while since, who is more strictly concern'd in it, if I am loath, unless there were more need then Mr. <hi>Baxs.</hi> new triming up of two or three old arguments ministers thereunto, to begin and play over the whole game again; I know a trick worth two of that <hi>viz.</hi> to refer you to what is already written by Mr. <hi>T.</hi> and what I have said my self above, and my friend thereby be admonished, for to make many books, much more upon one subject is to no end, and much study is a weariness to the flesh, yet a general return I may chance to give, and some brief reply to his arguments in particular.</p>
               <p>The truest general verdict I can give of it, if I may speak my judgement without offence, is this, it is a three footed stool, the legs of which are all lame, and decrepid made by Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> for the people of <hi>Ked.</hi> and <hi>Bewd.</hi> to sit at ease on, in that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish posture and practise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in which truth being hid for ages and generations, both they and all Christendome have been housed, and out of which Christ Jesus is now about to storm them; it is a tree shooting forth with three Trunkes against the truth, whereof the middlemost which is the main, runs out <hi>in tot ramos, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulos, &amp; ramusculos</hi> so many smaller boughs, twigs, and twiggles, and layes it self forth at large into such a train of Trivials, so many littles to the purpose, that he will find himsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Mr. Blake,</hi> the <hi>Ashfordian dispute</hi> and others, which all are also more then enough enervated before, whereupon I shall trouble my self no further then thus with that toy, the author whereof in his epistle to the Anabaptists, as he calls them, about <hi>Marden,</hi> tells strange stories of his being stormed on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very side, and almost tired out with onsets and oppositions from their private let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and among the rest he minds them how he had once to do with a host of them <hi>viz. September</hi> the tenth 1649. in which conflict my self, who was more then an eye witnesse, though much inferior to a worthy brother then in presence also, <hi>viz. Mr. Blackwood,</hi> and therefore far from arrogating to my self the title of Champion, with which he smites me in his Margent, can testify how uncivilly and shamefully the man stormed against the truth, insomuch that unlesse he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of the mad-blind, hare-brained zeal he then expressed, many, if not most of that Auditory he then interrupted, whether he remember them of it or no, will surely never forget it while they live.</p>
               <p>In which book, I say as there is no new Argument, so to be sure there is this old Argument, as well as some more, translated out of Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> or some other, whereby to prove infants discipleship p. 20. because the false Teachers would have put the yoak of circumcision on them.</p>
               <p>But Sirs what though they would have put the yoak on the disciples necks, will it therefore follow that they were all disciples on whose necks they would have put the yoake? me thinks it should not, if you look well about you, any more then this, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> put the yoak of Tribute on all the Jewes, i. e. taxed all the Jewes,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ergo,</hi> all they were Jewes whom <hi>Augustus</hi> taxed.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Nay verily had it been said they would have put the yoake of circumcision on all the disciples, as it is not, yet would it not have held <hi>Retro</hi> that therefore all those on whom they would have put the yoak were disciples, but in very deed neither of those was true, for as it was not all the disciples on whom they would have put that yoake, for they did not teach that women should be circumcised, so all were not disciples on whom they would have put that yoak, for male infants not being capable to be taught cannot possibly be disciples at all, much lesse such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as are meant in that place, of whom it is most evident that they were taught <hi>verse</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Much more might be said in disproof of this foolish fancy but that enough is spoken to it before, yet this is the first <hi>Medium</hi> whereby Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> bends himself to make it good that some infants are disciples, and his other are as mean to the
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:109011:219"/>
full as this, he proves it next by a disjunctive thus,</p>
               <p>If infants be not disciples, it is either because they are uncapable so to be, or else because God will not shew them such a mercy.</p>
               <p>But neither of these can be the cause,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> some infants are disciples.</p>
               <p>To which I answer that tis not because God will not shew them so great a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, for most undoubtedly the Lord shewes far greater mercie then that, though not that to infants that dy in infancy, for he saves them and gives unto them ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life, and admits them into the Kingdome of Heaven, and as for that bare simple notion, outward account and denomination of disciples, what extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary great mercy is that I wonder if it be abstracted from the other? tis not so great a mercy but persons may have it, and yet be damned for all that, nor so great a mercy, but that the mercy of God may be as great to them without it, nor so great as that they are capable of any more benefit by it from the Church, or from their parents, then they are capable of if they have it not, they may be prayed for by the Church and by their parents full as much, and be brought up by them in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, not onely as well, but much better, when they are capable of being disciples, and instructed, though in infancy neither counted disciples, nor baptized, as if they were supposed to be disciples before they are taught,</p>
               <p>It is therefore because they are not capable to be discipled in their nonage, and the true reason why they are not capable, is that which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> alledged, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las that it should not satisfy Mr. <hi>Bax. viz.</hi> because they cannot learn what is taught them.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> knowing that, fetches a compasse about another way whereby to prove them capable to be disciples, <hi>viz.</hi> their being servants of Christ, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Christs Kingdome, and thirdly their belonging to Christ, but what a pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful piece of proof, what a messe of miserable mistake is this, as if to belong to Christ, to be Christs subject, Gods servant, and Christ disciple were convertible, and alltogether one and the same, wheras howbeit it cannot be denyed but that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very disciple of Christ belongs to Christ, and is his Subject, and Gods servant, yet that every one who may be said to belong to Christ, to be Gods servant, and his Subject, is Christs disciple cannot be asser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed without more absurdity, then Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> is willing to take notice of in himself, for Mr. <hi>T.</hi> gives him an <hi>Item</hi> of it plain enough, for any reasonable man to consider of, but he is deaf to it through a mind forestalld against the truth.</p>
               <p>He tells us that infants are capable to be Gods servants <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.41.42. and therefore consequently Christs disciples, and consequently to be baptized, for disciples and Gods servants signifie the same thing, denote the same persons, and that there is the same capacity requisite to both p. 18.19. yea if there be a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence saith he, there is more required to a servant then to a disciple, but what wretched evidence is here, when as theres nothing more clear, and palpably evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, then this, that more is required to make a disciple then a servant, yea veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the consequence holds sound from Christs disciple, to Gods servant, but from Gods servant to Christs disciple, which is his way of arguing a very novice may see it rotten, and invalid: there is enough in all the creatures, the earth and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, which as books, wherein we may read it, though not as men that make any verball narration of it, declare the glory of God <hi>Ps.</hi> 19.1. to denominate them Gods servants <hi>Psa.</hi> 119.91. <hi>Nebucad-Nezar</hi> had enough to denominate him Gods servant <hi>Ier</hi> 43.10. as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> truly tells him, but not enough to denominate him Christs disciple.</p>
               <p>Yea I appeal to Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> own conscience, whether at that time, when Christ exercised his ministry among the Iews, the whole Nation of the Iews as well as those he mentions out of Levit. 25.41. and in the self same sense with those, were
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:109011:220"/>
not, <hi>Iure Redemptionis</hi> by right of his Redemption of them from Egypt, the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, had relatively a peculiar people to himself, yet how few of them were Christs disciples <hi>viz.</hi> those onely that attended to his law, in which respect though he stile all Israel his servants, yet he distinguishes those few onely from the rest that harkned not to his law, by the denomination of his disciples <hi>Isaiah</hi> 8.16.</p>
               <p>And whereas he saies of infants may they not be called Gods servants from the meer interest of dominion that God hath to them? p. 20.</p>
               <p>I answer, who doubts of that? but may they thereupon be called disciples, and be baptized? if so then from the meer interest of dominion that God hath to all men, all men may be called Gods servants, as well as they, and so consequently be baptized as Christs disciples.</p>
               <p>He tells us further p. 21. <hi>that infants are capable of being subjects of Christs kingdome,</hi> taking kingdome not in the larger sense, as it contains all the world, nor in the strictest as it containeth onely his elect, but in a middle sense as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teins the visible Church, therefore consequently capable of being Christs dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and of baptizing; and to prove the antecedent <hi>viz.</hi> that they are subjects of Christs kindome i. e. members of the visible Church, he uses this <hi>medium,</hi> they are capable of being subjects in any kingdome on earth, and therefore why not of Christs kingdome saith he i. e. of the visible Church of Christ?</p>
               <p>Now if this be a good consequence, they are capable to be subjects in any Kingdom on earth and therefore to be subjects of Christs Kingdom i. e. his Church, then the infants of heathens as well as these, being capable to be subjects in any Kingdom on earth, are consequently as capable to be subjects of Christs Kingdom and Church, and consequently to be Christs disciples, and in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy to be baptized, but <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> himself will say <hi>non sequitur</hi> unto this.</p>
               <p>He tells us further that <hi>Christ would have some infants</hi> i. e. believers infants, for those he meanes, <hi>to be received as disciples, therefore some infants</hi> i. e. such <hi>are his disciples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To prove the antecedent he jumbles together a number of places out of <hi>Mat. Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> viz. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.5. the 10.42. <hi>Mark.</hi> 9.41. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.47.48. in one of which places because Christ saies of a child, who so shall receive this child in my name receiveth me, by comparing this place with the rest, where Christ saies to his disciples, and of them also, not of infants, whoso shall give to you a cup of water in my name, because you belong to Christ, or as <hi>Matthew</hi> hath it in the name of a disciple, he shall not loose his reward, he gathers that some i. e. believers infants are disciples, and to be received to baptism, as such, for saith he, in Christs name, and as Christs disciple, and as belonging to Christ are all one in Christs language.</p>
               <p>To which I answer,</p>
               <p>First, by denying that in <hi>Christs name, and as a disciple,</hi> and as <hi>belonging to Christ</hi> are all one: for in <hi>Christs name</hi> is a Term of larger extent and latitude then the rest, so that we may be said to do good in Christs name to some persons, whom yet we cannot do good to as belonging to him in that neer relation of his disciples: <hi>in the name of Christ,</hi> besides severall other significations, which the phrase hath, is as much sometimes as for Christs sake, who requires it, and to do good to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the name of Christ is to do good to them for Christs sake, and then we may be said to do good for his sake, not onely when we do good to them that are disciples of Christ, upon that account of their belonging to him as his, but also, when we do good to them that are none of his disciples, upon the meer account of his command, who injoines all persons as occasion is to do good to all, though especially to the houshold of faith: whereupon also I perswade my self verily, nor is it very unworthy of observation, that the spirit when it speaks of doing good
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:109011:220"/>
to profest disciples indeed <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.41. he incourages to receive them, not onely in the name i. e. for the sake of Christ so requiring, but as belonging to him also as his disciples, in the name of a Prophet, in the name of a righteous man, in the name of a disciple; but when he speaks of our doing good to that child <hi>Luke</hi> 9.48. he saies no more then barely <hi>in the name of Christ</hi> i. e. for the sake of Christ owning such an action, but expresses not the other notion, and account of discipleship, and Relation to him, as that on which he would have him to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
               <p>Moreover were it otherwise, it would make little to the purpose of Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> who brings it to prove some such sucking infants as men sprinkle, i. e. believers babes to be disciples, sith that it was a believers child of which Christ there speaks, or that he speaks of such children rather then of the children of other men, is much more then Mr. Ba. can ever clear, and that it was a child of such a stature as to come to Christ, when he cald him, and therefore no infant of a span long, nor such as is the subject of your sprinkling, is too clear for Mr. Ba. to gainsay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out clear contradiction of the Scripture <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.2.</p>
               <p>These are far fetcht faddles, whereby Mr. Ba. backs his people in the blind belief of his fond and false opinion that all believers infants are Christs disciples, and thereupon to be baptized.</p>
               <p>The <hi>mediums</hi> whereby he manifests their membership in the Gospel-church are many, more then a good many, and not more many then manifestly weak, and utterly unavailable to such a purpose.</p>

Rom.</hi> 11. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.36. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.15. partly also because I perceive a vain of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar contest with Mr. <hi>T.</hi> to run thorow the whole, which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> according to the particular interest he hath therein, hath already taken notice of in Print, so far as its worth an answer, partly also because I am not so happy as to have the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of many, scarce of any of the churches of Christ, whose servant I am, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering me hitherto, without such frequent avocations of me from this to ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of another nature abroad, as are inconsistent with my writing of much more at home.</p>
               <p>Neverthelesse besides some animadversion of as much of its absurdity as may be with conveniency, I shall take the sting out so clearly that it shall not hurt, and that by both a clear, though general disproof of it all, and as clear though gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

and brief demonstration of the contrary,</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> argues it was the Jewes own Olive tree or <hi>Church</hi> they were cut off from for unbelief, Therefore infants stand in it still, But thence I argue that our infants cannot stand therein, for if god spared not the Naturall Branches of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but broke them off their own root, their own father <hi>Abraham</hi> and his family, so as to be counted no longer his children, their own olive tree the church so as to abide no longer in it, because they believed not, the terms of standing church-members being now no fleshly descent but faith, then much lesse will he admit any Gentiles, that are not naturall branches of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to be grafted into the good olive tree without faith, and therefore no infants that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not.</p>
               <p>Mr Ba. tells us that some branches only were broken off, therfore not infants, It is true all were not broken off, and why? because some believed, and so abode in the family, others and those the most believe not when they should, others and those all infants nor believed, nor yet could, and therefore could not abide, nor have a visible being, a visible membership, a visible standing in
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:109011:222"/>
that visible church, the termes of standing in which is only and alone by faith.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> argues that Israel shall again be grafted into their own olive tree, and saved, even the children with the parents, and therefore infant-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in the Gospel church is not repealed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>I answer it is true that if they abide not still in unbelief; they shall be grafted into their own olive tree, the visible Church, and family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is so many as shall believe onely, this infants do not, but whether they believe or believe not, when the Redeemer, i. e. Christ Jesus shall come, all Israel shall be saved, and be owned, and made the most glorious people upon earth, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a flourishing state indeed, but not in this way of baptism, and member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> speaks of, who I perceive is not a little ignorant of this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery as yet, how long blindnesse shall happen unto Israel, and in what manner their calling shall be, of which I also have at this time as little list, as leasure to inform him.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> argues from the samenesse of the Olive tree the Jew was broken off from, and the Gentile was grafted into, that therefore as infants stood members then, so they must now.</p>
               <p>I answer it is true there is some kind of indentity between the Jewish, and the Gospel Church, but not such as concludes an indentity of membership for infants, they are the same <hi>ingenere visiblis Ecclesiae,</hi> they agree in the common name of Church, and visible Church, elected and segregated from the world, but there's little else that I know of wherin they are the same, they differ in circumstantials, in their accidental forms, in their officers, ordinances, customs, constitutions, subjects, members, that being constituted of one whole nation of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or fleshly seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> taken out from all other nations, this of a spiritual seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> i. e. believers scaterred here and there, taken out of any nation as they happen to be called, almost every nation some, the ceremony of inchurching <hi>Abrahams</hi> own, much more any other mans meer fleshly seed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ceased.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> peddles on apace, and brings a company of Scripures in proof of infants Church-membership and baptism, which though he stile them, as indeed his whole book, <hi>Plain Scripture proofs for those two,</hi> yet a man that is not min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to force the Scripture into the Service of his own fancy, because it does not serve it freely, may look till dooms day before he see in them any plain, perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous proof of either one of these or of the other.</p>
               <p>Christ saith he <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.37, would have gathered <hi>Ierusalem</hi> oft, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings but they would not, therefore sure he would not have put them, or their infants out of the Church, the strength of the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence lies here, saith he, he would have gathered whole <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and that into the visible Gospel Church, therefore infants also; Now that Christ does not speak of whole <hi>Ierusalem</hi> here, as he saith he does, both men and infants, the circumstances of the text do fully evince to us, for he speaks of the same persons he speaks to, and the same persons he complains of, saying <hi>ye would not,</hi> the same and no other are they to whom he speaks, when he saies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Oh <hi>Ierusalem</hi> how often would I have gathered &amp;c. but those were men and women only, whom he called to believed in him, and not infants.</p>
               <p>Again he gathered them by preaching of the word into baptism, and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership, and received all that came, and no more <hi>viz.</hi> sometimes the children and not the parents, sometimes the parents and not the children, so that a mans foes for the truths sake sometimes were they of his own family, his own flesh, therefore he offered not to gather infants, for he preacht not to them, nor called them at all, nor were any more baptized and added to the Church-fellowship in the Gospel, then they that gladly received the word, that did not infants, yea 3000 were
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:109011:222"/>
gathered into the first Gospel Church by preaching and baptism in one day, and never an infant among them all, for they surely did not continue in fellowship, in breaking of bread and prayers <hi>Acts</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>Therefore whereas Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> in his Epistle to the parish of <hi>Bewdley</hi> challenges Mr. <hi>T.</hi> to name him one particular Church since <hi>Adam</hi> either of Jewes or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, where infants were not Church-members, if they had any infants, till 200 years ago; I name him the first Gospel Church that ever was <hi>Act.</hi> 2. in which there was not one infant; yea there was three thousand baptized in one day, and it is a hazard but that those three thousand had many, perhaps no lesse than three thousand infants belonging to them all, and yet as Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> thinkes, so think I, that none of their infants were baptized with them, much lesse were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with them to the Church, or continued with them in fellowship, as the whole Gospel Church did, in breaking of bread and prayers; yea though there was no infants in that Church, which was gathered at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> it self, to which Christ saies how oft would I have gathered thy children, &amp;c. and therefore Mr. <hi>Baxs.</hi> sense is very sinister, so I challenge him again to shew me, not by such dubious, muddy, cloudy, circumlocutory, inconsequential consequences as he doth, but undeniable evidences any one of all the Gospel Churches of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, either of Jewes or Gentiles, which we are all to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>orm by <hi>viz. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, Rome, Corinth, Galatia, Philippi, Ephesus, Thessalonica,</hi> or any other to fellowship in which there was one infant baptized, added and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and I shall cry him mercy, and lay down the Cudgells at his feet, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge he hath broke my pate.</p>
               <p>The next Scripture he uses is more impertinent then this, yet Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> makes a certain shift to squeese an argument out of it, and to compel it <hi>invita minervâ</hi> not a little against its own intent, and meaning to corroborate his crooked cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie creed concerning the inchurching and cristening of infants <hi>viz. Rev.</hi> 11.15. whence he thus Syllogizes,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the kingdoms of this world either are or shall be the kingdomes of the Lord, and of his Christ, then infants also must be members of his kingdom</hi> i. e. the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, the Antecedent is the words of the text indeed, as he saies, but the sequel is so sure, and follows so firmly in his fancy, that he saies nothing can be said against it, that is sense or reason: but indeed it self is against both sense and reason.</p>
               <p>Who would ever think, if the word did not declare that the things of wisdome are hid from the wise and prudent, that such a disputer as Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> holds himself to be, should deduce the now membership of infants, from such a premise as this <hi>viz.</hi> because the kingdomes of this world are, or else shall be the kindomes of God and Christ? whats this I trow toward the eviction of the other? much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way saith Mr. Ba. yea so much, that for any thing he can see this text <hi>alone were sufficient to decide the whole controversie whether infants must be Church members,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Amen so beit say I, let this Scripture decide it, and let's see what Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> saies ont.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If they can say,</hi> quoth he, <hi>by kingdoms is meant here some part of the kingdom, excluding all infants, such men may make their own creed on those termes, let the Scripture say what it will, I know in some places the word kingdome, and Ierusalem &amp;c. is taken for a part, but if we must take words alwayes impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, because they are taken so sometimes</hi> saith he, <hi>then we shall not know how to understand any Scripture,</hi> so of necessity it must be understood properly i. e in its prime signification of the whole kingdoms, and whole <hi>Ierusalem</hi> with him, and not improperly for a part onely, though Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> to Mr. <hi>Black.</hi> saith upon occasion of our pleading for the proper signification of <hi>baptize, nothing more or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinary then to have words used out of their prime signification,</hi> whereby we may see
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:109011:223"/>
how these men wil needs have that signification that best serves their turnes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proper or improper, when the proper most fits them, then the improper cannot be meant there, when the proper makes against them, the improper is pleaded for as none more usual then that, thus the word houshold must include infants, when baptism is spoken of, but when the passover is spoken of then infants are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, because else we shall argue from thence to their eating the supper, as they from circumcision unto their baptism, but this by the way that it may be noted how the men will have things their own way, by hook or by crook, not that I deny the word kingdomes to be taken properly for all the whole kingdome here, yea I grant it, but let us see what of that? why even this, if the whole kingdom be the Lords, then infants must unavoidably be members of Christs Church, and if we ask how comes this about? he will tell you two wayes,
<list>
                     <item>First, as infants are all of the Kingdomes of this world, taken for the whole kingdom,</item>
                     <item>Secondly, as by the word kingdom of Christ is meant Christs church.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Now let us spell and put all together, and it is thus much,</p>
               <p>First, by Kingdomes of this world is here meant the whole Kingdome of this world, or Kingdome taken universally, not for some part of it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by Kingdomes of the Lord and his Christ is here meant Christs church onely.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, infants are a part of the Kingdomes of this world, and so consequently of Christs church, for the Kingdomes of this world are become the Kingdomes of the Lord and his Christ i. e. Christs church, oh brave and plain Scripture proof for infant church-membership and baptism.</p>
               <p>Let us examine what is true and what is false in this.</p>
               <p>First, as above, I grant that here the Kingdomes of this world signifie the whole Kingdome, as he pleads it, but that here the Kingdome of the Lord and his Christ signifies Christs church, I utterly deny it, and am amazed that a reasonable man should affirm it, and so consequently I deny that it appears from this place that infants are now members of Christs church.</p>
               <p>But he brings reason for it, such as tis, and that shall be a little exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>First, if they say saith he that the Kindome of Christ is not here meant Christs church, they speak against the constant phrase of Scripture, which calls Christs Kingdome his Church, <hi>et conversim, Christ</hi> is King and saviour of the same so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, what is <hi>Christs</hi> Kingdom but his church?</p>
               <p>To which I answer, Christs Kingdome is the whole world as well as his church. And</p>
               <p>Secondly that he is King and Saviour of all men in some sense as well as of that same society. And</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that it is not against the constant phrase of Scripture to say by <hi>Christs</hi> Kingdome here is not meant his church, for though it is true by his Kingdome is sometimes exprest his church, <hi>et retro</hi> by his church is meant his Kingdome in a special and restrictive sense, yet not constantly, there being many places where the word Kingdome of <hi>Christ</hi> is taken in a larger sense, as signifying not the church, but the whole world <hi>O bad.</hi> 21 the Kingdome i. e. <hi>Monarchy</hi> of the whole earth <hi>shall be the Lords</hi> i. e. <hi>Christs</hi> so <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. the <hi>Kingdome</hi> i. e. <hi>Dominion, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy and greatness of the Kingdome under the whole heaven is given to the son of man, and the Saints,</hi> yea his Kingdom is over all, he shall rule the Nations, govern and judge the whole world in righteousnesse;</p>
               <p>Oh saith Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> the Kingdome of <hi>Christ</hi> is more large, and more speciall; but here it cannot be meant of his kingdom in the larger sense, nor as he ruleth common societies, and things for so saith he the Kingdomes of this world were
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:109011:223"/>
ever the Lords and his Christs, and it could not be said that they are now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come so.</p>
               <p>To which I answer,</p>
               <p>First, that in granting what he here does, that Christs kingdome is taken some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in a larger sense, then for the church, he contradicts himself above, where he saies it is the constant phrase of Scripture to call Christs Kingdome his church, and what is Christs kingdome but his church?</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas he saies the Kingdomes of this world were ever the Lords and his Christs in the larger sense, as taken for his Government and Rule, I grant <hi>de jure</hi> Christ hath been Lord of the whole earth a long time, but <hi>de facto</hi> he is not King, so as actually to reign over the whole earth, as ere long he shall do i. e. at his appearing 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. to this very day, but in that indeed i. e. when he comes he shall be King, Monarch over all the earth, and rule with a rod of i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron over the Nations, and judge the world in righteousnesse together with his Saints, who hath been judged in unrighteousnesse by the Nations and Rulers hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto <hi>Zach.</hi> 14. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. <hi>Act.</hi> 17. <hi>P</hi> 2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. then he shall be in point of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, as before by commission, and really, and actually, as now intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally King of Kings, and Lord of Lords <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. but till then, as yet a little while, and his Kingdome comes to his hand, and the Kingdomes of the world do thus become his, for the work of recovery of his right is now very hot in <hi>fieri,</hi> and will not be long before it be in <hi>facto esse,</hi> till then he hath been an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and other Lords besides him have had dominion over him in his, and also o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the whole earth, which is his, and over the Kingdomes of this world, which <hi>de jure</hi> are his, but specially that <hi>servus servorum, dominus dominorum</hi> the Pope and CCClergy, that are the whore that hath reigned in three divisions over the earth, between whom and Christ the great justle now is in all christendome, whether he or they, that by permission have had it so long from Christ, who onely hath the commission for it, shall be King of Kings and Lord of Lords, hitherto Christ hath reigned in the world as <hi>Charles</hi> the second hath reigned in <hi>England,</hi> and no otherwise i. e. hath reigned in the hearts of a few of his friends and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
               <p>But I perceive the Gospel or good news of the Kingdome of Christ coming, which is to be preached more had more before the end, is yet a riddle to Mr. Ba. and though I hope it will be, if seeing he will see, yet tis not yet given him to know the mystery and manner of Christs Kindome.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whereas he saies that the Kingdom taken in the larger sense i. e. for the world cannot be meant here, but the church onely by this phrase the <hi>Kingdomes of the Lord and his Christ,</hi> I strongly assert that of all places in Scripture the word Kingdomes of Christ cannot here be construed for the church, that the church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meant in that phrase, but the Kingdomes in the largest sense i. e. the whole world, and directly oppositly to Mr. Ba. who saies it is the church, I disprove his opinion thus,</p>
               <p>First, If by the kingdomes of Christ be meant the Church, then it must be thus read, <hi>viz.</hi> the Kingdomes of this world are become Christs Church, but what an absurdity must that be, specially with Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> above all men, who so strenuously contends that by the word Kingdoms of this world is meant not in part only, but the whole kingdom? for to hold that by that phrase the Kingdomes of this world is meant all the kingdomes upon the earth, taken wholly, and not <hi>Synechdochically</hi> for a part of those kingdomes onely, and that by the kingdom of Christ the Church onely, is to make the sense thus, <hi>viz.</hi> the whole world is become Christs Church, therefore it cannot be so, but thus (and so all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the text do evince, for it is spoken of Christs raign over all the world in the latter daies, after the seventh Trumpet hath sounded, and not over all his Church onely, and of Christs taking to himself <hi>ver.</hi> 17. that great <hi>Monarchy,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:109011:224"/>
power,</hi> kingdome, or greatnesse and glory of his reign, which before he permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be in the hands of the Dragon, beast and whore, so that they reigned over the whole earth, and the saints too in rigour, and unrighteousnesse <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. <hi>ult.</hi> I say it must be thus <hi>viz.</hi> the Kingdomes of this world, the Kingdomes under the whole heaven, the Monarchy of the whole Earth is now come into Christs own hands, or the Government over all is now actually on his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
               <p>Besides what will Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> gain more by his sense of that Scripture towards the proof of his infant-membership then I for the membership of heathen infants, then for the Church membership of the whole world, if I were minded to plead for it, if the Kingdomes of this world wholly taken, none excluded, do become the Church of Christ then all men as well as infants must be Church-members on that account.</p>
               <p>Besides he speaks as <hi>de futuro</hi> what shall be under the seventh Trumpet, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if it were to be taken as Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> imagines that the Kingdomes of this world, infants as well as men, are now become Christs Church, then it would evince that it was not so from the beginning of the Gospel Church, for what effects are spoken of as falling out now newly under the seventh Trumoet, are things that never were in being before.</p>
               <p>Besides observe Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> how he pleads to have Kingdomes taken in the largest sense in the former part of the verse, and how angry he is if it be taken for lesser then all the whole kingdomes of the world, but in the latter part where Kingdomes must needs be, and is as largely to be taken (for it is the Kingdomes of the world are become Christs Kingdomes, i. e. dominion, not Christs churches) there he will needs lace it up into the narrowest acceptation that the word kingdom can possibly bear.</p>
               <p>Oh therefore the grosse pieces of ignorance, that are in that Argument of his for infants membership in the Church, which he grounds from a Scripture, that will as well prove all the world to be Gospel Church-members as believers infants, if his very own false sense of it should be admitted, but in truth proves not the one nor the other; thus he argues viz. the Kingdoms of this world, i. e. all, and all in them shall become Christs kingdomes, therefore infants of only believers, not heathens, are Church-members under the Gospel.</p>
               <p>He that saies this followes any better then the Pope follows <hi>Peter</hi> in the holy chaire shall never be counted, or voted <hi>mentis compos,</hi> whilest I am <hi>compos voti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> therefore had better have found 40 shillings, where he never looked for it, then have looked for infant-membership in this scripture, where he will never find it with his eyes open.</p>
               <p>His three next Arguments, <hi>viz.</hi> the ninth, tenth, and eleventh run all upon one strain, and therefore as he need not have made more then one of them, so I need not make more then one answer to them all, yea, I need make none at all, having spoken to that point sufficiently before, yet a hint of it here may do no hurt.</p>
               <p>They stand all upon one bottome, <hi>viz.</hi> the meliority of the times under the Gospel above the times of the Law, of this new covenant above the old, the summe of what he saies is this, if believers infants may not now be members of the visible Church, then both Jewes and Gentiles are in a worse condition now then before Christ, and Christ is come to be a destroyer, and not a Saviour, and to do hurt to all the world, the believing Jewes, and the Church; yea and the very Gentiles thereby, in regard of the happinesse of their children, are in a worse condition then of old, but this is a vile doctrine, saith he, for Jesus <hi>is a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of a better covenant established on better promises Heb.</hi> 8.6. <hi>where sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded grace much more abounded, Rom.</hi> 5.14, 15.20. and the love of
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:109011:224"/>
Christ love hath height, length, depth, breadth, and passeth knowledge <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>To which simple inconsequent conceits I answer by denying the consequence, it followes not that the world is in worse estate under Christ then before, because infants might be members of the Jewish church, but not now of any visible church of the Gospel, nay verily the world is in a far better condition then formerly, by how much they are under more clear, and plain promulgations, more fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="432" facs="tcp:109011:225"/>
mostly it did among the Iewes, that a lifting up to heaven in respect of partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of outward priviledges and ordinances, may prove an occasion unhappily through their abuse of it, of their sinking deeper into hell.</p>
               <p>His next Argument is drawn from Deut. 29, 10.11.12. a place that doth as well prove that all the wives and the servants, and the slaves, even all the hewers of wood and drawers of water are to be taken into Covenant with God, as his, and admitted into Church-membership upon the Membership of Masters, and Husbands, as little ones upon the membership of the Fathers; and so indeed it was in those daies, wherein the whole body of the Nation was inchurched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, though not so now, therefore though I might easily discover that (yea he is blind that sees it not in the same chapter, notwithstanding it is alledged in that allusion of <hi>Paul</hi> in the tenth chapter of the <hi>Romans</hi> to that place) to be no other then that covenant which was made with the nation in particular, which God brought out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> yet I shall trouble my self to say no more to it then so.</p>
               <p>His 13 Argument is from <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. where circumcision is said to be a seal of the righteousnesse of the faith which <hi>Abraham</hi> had, is answer'd above, where I have given out the genuine sense of that place, and disproved that crooked construction, which is by others aswell as him commonly made of it, therefore ile say no more to it here.</p>
               <p>His 14 Argument is also answered, but a little above, where I have shew'd the inchurching of that fleshly seed to be ceremonial, and also what it typed out, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no more of that also in this place.</p>
               <p>His 15. <hi>plain Scripture-lesse proof for infants present churchmembership and baptism is this</hi> viz.
<q>
                     <p>If all infants, who were members of any particular Church, were also Members of the Vniversall Visible Church, then certainly the Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of infants, <hi>he means by vertue of the membership of their parents,</hi> is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed.</p>
                     <p>But all infants who were &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Ergo.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The consequence saith he is beyond dispute, because the universal Church never ceaseth here, yea the whole Argument so clear, that were there no more it is sufficient.</p>
               <p>To which as unanswerable as he judges it, I answer first by denying the consequence of his <hi>Major,</hi> as most flatly false and inconsequent.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by saying as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> did, whose answer is both solid and sufficient <hi>viz.</hi> that infants membership in the universal visible church was only by reason of their then membership in that particular national church, neither can Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> while he breathes prove them to have bin members of that universal visible, as he calls it, but as they were members of that, and therefore when that particular, nationall church of the Jewes ceased, the standing of infants as members upon the meer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their parents membership ceased also therewith, as one of the things that were not essentiall to a church, but circumstantial onely to that church, as one of the particular accidental ceremonies pertaining onely to that individual nationall church; for accidental ceremonies Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> himself confesses, and must confesse did cease still with that particular church, to which particularly they related, otherwise he will be paid home with his own weapon, and in his own coin, yea if Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> consequence be true, and if it be not so as we say, that accidentall ceremonies, and so this accidental ceremony, and circumstance of infants being members upon the membership of their parents, did cease with that particular church of the Iews, twill passe all the braines Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> hath in his head to answer his own argument, if we retort it on him in proof of that which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as much as we do the inchurching of infants upon the fathers membership
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:109011:225"/>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> the inchurching of wives, and servants to this day upon the membership of their husbands and masters, for whereas he argues thus <hi>viz.</hi> if all infants who were members of any particular church were also members of the universal visible church, then certainly the membership of infants by vertue of their parents mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership is not repealed, but all &amp;c. Ergo</p>
               <p>What answer will he make, if we answer him by arguing back upon him thus <hi>viz.</hi> if all wives and servants, who were members by vertue of their husbands and masters membership of any particular visible church, were also members of the universall visible church, then certainly the membership of wives and servants, hewers of wood, and drawers of water, by vertue of their husbands and masters membership, is not repealed, but all &amp;c. Ergo.</p>
               <p>I leave it to wise men to consider and examine whether Mr. Bs. argument doth not as fully tend to the proof of it that the wives and servants ought, as of old, to stand members in the visible church now, upon the husbands and masters membership, as infants upon the membership of their parents.</p>
               <p>Several other palpable absurdities are obvious to every observant eye in his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification of this argument, which whoever notes, will take heed of pinning his faith implicitly on Mr. Bs. sleeve, and of listning to his Logick, so as to be led by it besides all sense and reason.</p>
               <p>To say nothing to his <hi>universall visible,</hi> which is little lesse then a <hi>visible bull,</hi> for <hi>sensus, adeoque visus est propriè solummodò singularium, intellectus universa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium,</hi> the proper object of sense, and so of sight is particulars onely, and universalls onely properly of the understanding, yet this universal visible church is the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal vision, and dream of the universal Clergy, but to bate them the baldnesse of that term, and grant that there is a Catholike visible church, is there any unver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal visible church, but what is existent in, and made up of all the particular visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble churches? I trow not: yea that was wont to be good Logick, and Theology too heretofore, to say that all the particulars make up the unversal, that the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall visible Church, and all the particular visible Churches are adaequate, and convertible, yea Dr. <hi>Featley</hi> p. 12. makes the universall visible church, and all the particular visible churches equivalent, the <hi>universal or formall church</hi> saith he i. e. <hi>all the assemblies of Christians in the world</hi>: the whole is not broader then all its parts collectively taken, nor without its parts, for <hi>omne totum ex suis partibus constituitur, ordinatur, mensuratur, determinatur,</hi> every whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of its parts, is measured and determined by its parts, and so the whole univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal visible Church, and all the homogeneall parts of it <hi>simul sumtae</hi> i. e. all the particular visible churches taken together, are of equall latitude; so that he that is of a any particular visible church must needs be of the who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, and he that is of the whole universall visible must needs be of some particular visible church, yea <hi>cui adimuntur omnes partes totius universalis, eidem etiam totum universale adimi necesse est,</hi> whoever is not a part of some part or other i. e. of some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular visible church, cannot be a part of the whole i. e. the universal visible: this I say is the Logick and Theology, which was wont to passe for currant among your selves, but Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> learnes men a new kind of Logick <hi>viz.</hi> that all the parts put together are not so big as the whole, that the universall visible church is larger then all the particular visible churches in the world, of which yet it consists, so that there is room enough for a person to stand a member in the universal visible church, though he be of no particular visible church at all; I ever understood yet that he, who is removed and cast out of all the particular visible churches of the Saints, is consequently cast out of the universal visible church, but he tells me a tale that to be removed out of every particular visible church, is consistent still with a standing in the universal visible: so that excomunication out of all the particular visible churches in the world, is not excomunication out of the whole visible church with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="434" facs="tcp:109011:226"/>Another thing worth noting, though worth nothing, is this, he tells us there that <hi>Keturahs</hi> children, when they left the family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that they <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued members of the universal visible church still,</hi> which compared with the clause above, where he tells us <hi>that it is a far higher priviledge to stand in the universal visible church then to stand in any particular whatsoever,</hi> amounts to thus much <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Midianites,</hi> for they were some of <hi>Keturahs</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, had far higher priviledges, then those that the Israelites had by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing members of that particular visible church of Israel, which if it were so, then we may say what advantage hath the Iew indeed, and what profit by circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by Gods commission of his oracles unto them? yea what necessity of circumcision of themselves, and their males at all for any strangers, or of joining themselves to that particular church of the Jewes, sith they might have had as high priviledges if they had joined themselves to the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Keturah,</hi> of whose posterity circumcision, nor the strict law it bound to was not required, and so consequently what need of baptism, if persons might be of the uniuersal visible, which is the greater, though not of the particular visible church of the Iews, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out circumcision and keeping the law?</p>
               <p>But it is a question with Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> whether <hi>Keturahs</hi> children must leave their seed uncircumcisied p. 60. yet I tell him it is out of question, that unlesse it were in order to joining, and inchurching themselves with that individual Church of of the Iewes, to which pertained peculiarly the adoption, and glory, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and law, and promises, and which was all the visible church, that I know God had then upon the earth, circumcision was not enjoined to any other of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> own posterity, not the <hi>Ishmalites,</hi> nor <hi>Midianites,</hi> but those onely that came of <hi>Sarah</hi> by <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> for the covenant, of which circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was a sign, was establisht with none of them, but with <hi>Isaac</hi> onely and with <hi>Iacob,</hi> and his seed after him, and so many as should join themselves unto them.</p>
               <p>Many more odd conceits about this universal visible church, Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> broaches, but I spare him, and hasten to what followes.</p>
               <p>His 16. plain <hi>Scripture-lesse</hi> proof for infants church-membership and baptism is from a clause in the second command<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ment <hi>viz. I will shew mercy to</hi> 1000<hi>s of them that love me, and keep my commandements,</hi> a phrase out of which a man may as easily prove the Pope to be head of the church, as prove either of those points in proof of which he doth produce it.</p>
               <p>Yet oh the miserable muddy, wretched, ragged, crooked, cloudy piece of disputation for infant baptism, which this man makes from that place!</p>
               <p>For my part I mean not to wander after him in that wildernesse of worthlesse discourse, that he vents about mercy, Church covenant, promises, nor am I so wise as to wot what he means, nor so foolish as to believe he knows well what he means himself by much of that he there utters, or else he would never say that wicked men in the church are within the covenant, and so have this mercy spoken of in the second commandement stated on them by promise; as if wicked men in the church were in some special wise beloved of God, when yet they are more hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him by far then heathens.</p>
               <p>It is enough to serve my present purpose, that what proof Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> pens in the head of this argumentation, his own pen dashes it all out again in the taile of it.</p>
               <p>For first after a great deal of wrestling to make the mercy here promised to thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of them that love God, necessarily to include church-membership, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses at last that it lies doubtful in the text what mercy in particular is there meant, which if he do, then tis not necessary that church-membership be implied in it, for there may be much mercy, yea special, yea eternal saving mercy shewed to
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:109011:226"/>
persons, to whom the mercy of membership in the visible church and baptism is not vouchsafed, or else what becomes of such infants, as notwithstanding your timely admittance, do yet dy without both membership and baptism? are they shut out of the kingdom of heaven?</p>
               <p>Secondly, he confesses it is doubtfull in the text to how many generations God shewes mercy to the children of parents that love him, whether it be to the remote or neerest progeny onely; and though he passe his judgement that it is onely to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate children of godly parents, that the promise in the commandment is made, yet thereby he contradicts his own sense of the place, and overthrowes all that he contends for, in that if the words were as he would have them read, <hi>viz.</hi> I shew mercy to a thousand Generations, or to the thousandth generation of them that love me, it were evident that he meant not the next generation only, for that to a thousand generation should signifie no more then one generation to come is most irrational, and plain brutish to imagine; and if he say tis to a thousand ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, if such children succeed their parents in godlynesse, that sense excludes infants quite from the mercy here promised, and extends it to such children onely as are at years, and that on condition of being godly themselves, and on that condition of being godly themselves God shewes mercy to the immediate seed of the very wickedest parents, as well as of the Godliest parents in the world.</p>
               <p>But in very deed to put him out of all his doubts at once about this place, <hi>viz.</hi> whether God mean the remote or immediate children, I desire Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that this promise is not made to any mans posterity at all, but only to all such individual persons as love him, and keep his commandements, for the words are not as he reads, and construes them, <hi>viz. I will shew mercy to a thousand gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of them, but to thousands of them that love me,</hi> i. e. to thousands of such people, such persons as love me and keep my Commandments; and so if the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy were that of membership, yet it were nothing concerning infants in their infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy at all, but concerning thousands of such individual persons as love him and keep his commandments, or else God must shew mercy to all infants in their infancy to this day, meerly for their father <hi>Noahs</hi> sake, though the immediate parents be wicked, and if he he do not he shewes not mercy to the thousandth generation of believers infants, there being not a thousand generations from <hi>Noah</hi> to this day.</p>
               <p>We may see what little plain proof these men can find for their false way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churching and baptizing of infants in the New Testament, in that they are faine to fetch it so far off as the old, thus doth not Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> onely but others also as well as he, who would certainly never look for it so far behind as he second comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if they could easily find it neerer hand: among the rest this mindes me of one of more then ordinary note, <hi>viz.</hi> Dr. <hi>Channell</hi> of <hi>Petworth</hi> in <hi>Sussex,</hi> who <hi>Ianuary</hi> the first 1651. in a publique discourse with my unworthy self, being desired to assign some particular place of Scripture, where Christ commands the practise of infant-baptism, assigned the second commandment, to whom as I said then before hundreds of people, so I testify here again before the whole world, that if any man see infants baptism commanded in the second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is because his eyes are out: for though he tell me that the generall scope of the second Commandment is to command all Gods people to observe all Gods institutions from time to time, yet I tell him again, as also I did then, that infant baptism is none of those institutions, yea I tell him yet further, and Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> also, that unlesse it can be made appear by plainer Scripture proofs then ever were yet brought by either of them, that Christ Jesus injoined the baptizing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churching of infants, or that its any other then a tradition of man, and an addition to the Gospel, which was not so from the beginning, and that is more then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them will ever make plainly to appear, the second Commandement doth
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:109011:227"/>
rather forbid them both, yea (<hi>Ah si fas dicere! sed fas</hi>) the second commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the general scope of which, as their own selves expound it, is to prohibit all will worship and superstition, all serving of God after our own invention, all customes, devices, innovations, Traditions of men, all addi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ion to and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Christs will and Testament, all teaching other doctrine then is contained in the word, doth forbid, it, and therefore as haled in by head and shoulders to serve the turn of these men, and to help to uphold them in their rantizing of infants in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same visible body with them, whom yet they deny to drink with them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same spirit, as all that are baptized into the same body are to do 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. which infellowshipping persons by the halves into Gospel participation, if it be of Christ, what else is of man I plainly know not.</p>
               <p>His 17 plain <hi>Scripture-lesse</hi> proof for infants Church-membership and baptism is drawn from <hi>Psalm.</hi> 37.26. where it is said that <hi>the seed of the Righteous are blessed,</hi> whence he argues as before, and therefore need not have made a distinct Argument of this, if God have pronounced the seed of the righteous blessed, then certainly they are members of his visible Church, its absurd once to imagine quoth he, that god should pronounce a society blessed, and take them for none of his visible Church.</p>
               <p>But I am ashamed of such trifling stuff, such straw, and stubble as he here builds upon, as if God himself can no way be said to blesse the seed of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, unlesse he require them to be baptized, and inchurched visibly in their infancy, as if God had but one blessing, even that of baptism and church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership, upon which all other blessings are so eternally intailed, even to infants, that such of them as attain not to an actual inrerest in these are <hi>ipso facto</hi> accursed in all respects else &amp; that for ever, wheras to say nothing how that phrase <hi>the seed of the righteous</hi> may be taken for the race of righteous ones, that succeed one another in righteousnesse, as well as a seed of evil doers <hi>Is.</hi> 1.4. for the whole race of evill do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that succeed their fore-fathers in evil doing, for these indeed I take to be the seed to which the Scripture oft pronounces blessing and cursing, and not alwayes the meer natural seed of good men and bad, for then there is manifest falsehood in many promises and threats, the natural seed of righteous men often perishing, and being not counted their own fathers children, unlesse they be like them in righteousnesse as <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.39. Christ denies <hi>Abrahams</hi> natural children to be <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> children, and blessed with him, because they did not as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, and contrary wise the natural seed of the wicked prospering, when they do well, contrary to <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.21.22. <hi>Is.</hi> 20.14. <hi>Ps.</hi> 37 20. if the word seed were there taken for the natural seed, where it is said the seed of evill doers shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be renowned;</p>
               <p>And so <hi>the seed of the serpent, and the children of the devil</hi> expresses those that do his works, to say nothing I say of this, which yet is enough to blunt the edge of Mr. <hi>Bas.</hi> argument, grant the word <hi>seed</hi> here to be taken for the natural seed of the righteous, even those in infancy may be many wayes blessed though they neither be baptized in infancy nor inchurched, yea they may be blessed with eternal sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, dying in infancy, without either baptism or membership in the visible Church, for I hope you will not say those 1000s. of Jewes and belieuers infants, that have died before circumcision, baptism, and visible admission, are damned without any more ado, because they fell short of your admired membership, and if these be blessed with salvation to whom you delay baptism, why not those to whom we deny it? doth our denying baptism to an infant before he dies send him to hell sooner then your delaying it till he be dead?</p>
               <p>But however the seed of the righteous may be blessed with many temporal bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, as provision, fruitfulnesse, multiplication, and yet not be taken into the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, and to say the truth if Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> had not been resolved to wrest this Scripture besides its true sense, to botch up his proofs into a multitude, he might
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:109011:227"/>
easily have seen by consultation with the verse before that it is not such a thing as membership, that is here meant by the word blessed, but meer matter of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward sustentation; <hi>I never saw the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread; he is ever merciful and lendeth and his seed is blessed</hi> i. e. provided for, and preserved from beggery, and considered by others in time of adversity, as he considered others in the like case.</p>
               <p>And lastly, whereas he challenges us to shew where ever God pronounced any blessed, and yet took them for none of his visible Church? saying tis absurd once to imagine it that he did, I assert it is most absurd in him to imagine the contrary, for God himself by promise pronounced <hi>Ishmael</hi> blessed, saying as <hi>for Ishmael be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I haved blessed him, and I will make him fruitful, and multiply him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, and make him a nation, because he is thy seed:</hi> and this at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same time when he denied to establish the Covenant with him, which he esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht with <hi>Isaac,</hi> and commanded that he should be cast out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily from sharing with <hi>Isaac</hi> in that very covenant, which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends with all his might p. 64 65. that whoever are not in it are not under the promise of the mercy, which Church-membership is with him a speciall part of.</p>
               <p>In proof of this consider and compare <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.18.19.20.21. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.10.11.12.13. as if there were no blessing but that of Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership, or at least no blessing without this of Church-membership, whereas, as admired a mercy as this meer membership is with Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> persons may be blessed without it, and also (witnesse the Jewish Nation, which for the most part were reprobates) they may have admission to the meer mercy, and bare bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of membership, and yet perish and be accursed for ever.</p>
               <p>The 18th. <hi>plain Scripture-less proof for infant Church-membership and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If infants were Church-members before circumcision was instituted, then certainly it was not proper to the Iews,</hi> and consequently is not ceased, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are, therefore. The <hi>Minor</hi> of which argument Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> endeavours to prove aswell as he can, and this he doth,</p>
               <p>First, partly by perverting the sense of the text <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.25. where it is said God made two one i. e. instituted the ordinance of marriage between man and woman, that he might seek a seed of God i. e. a legitimate Issue, for legitimacy onely in the issue is the result of marriage, and that among what parents soever, even heathens as well as others, for whom as well as others that state of marriage is sanctified, yet Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saies he made two one, or ordained marriage that he might seek a seed of God in another sense, that better serves his turn i. e. to seek Church-members, as if Church-membership in the seed, were the direct result of the state of matrimony in the parents, which every simpleton knowes to be false for marriage is honourable among all, and was ordained for all mankind as well as the Godly, and yet the seed are not therefore Church-members; besides marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was instituted in the state of innocency, to this end that mankind might be propagated in a more modest way then other creatures, and not that the seed so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated might be Church-members.</p>
               <p>Secondly, partly by a heap of frivolous conjectures of his own, in which a man may warrantably enough chuse whether he will believe him or no, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his <hi>Minor viz.</hi> that infants were Church-members before circumcision was instituted be true or false it makes nothing to his purpose unlesse he had made surer work in his <hi>Maior</hi>; for that is so inconsequent, and utterly unsound that had I happened to have heard his argument before it came in Print, I should have spared him all his paines about the <hi>Minor,</hi> and have put him to the proof of his <hi>Major,</hi> the consequence of which hee'l never make good by fair play while he breathes; for there were many things long before circumcision was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted,
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:109011:228"/>
which were proper, if not to the Jewes till the Jewes were in being, yet to the ceremoniall law that was after more clearly given to the Jewes, and to that old Testament of which <hi>Moses</hi> was the Mediator, and circumcision the sign, and the Jewes the subject, and yet were tipicall and ceremonial onely, and so ceased together with circumcision, as the keeping the seventh day, the sacrifices, the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and uncleannesse of certain creatures, and (if that were at all before circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, as Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> does not plainly prove it to be) among the rest the Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership of infants.</p>
               <p>His 19. <hi>plain Scripture-lesse proof is this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If God be not more prone to severity then to mercy, then he will admit of infants to be members of the visible Church but God &amp;c. therefore &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh the wit of this man how wonderfully doth it work, and wind to and fro, and wander far and neer to fetch in any manner of fewell, wherewith to feed that false faith men live in, concerning infant baptism, for fear it should be quite extinguished, and brought to nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ex nihilo nihil fit</hi> in an ordinary way, but such is the extraordinary eagerness of Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> to have the game go his way, by either fair play or foul, that he is wise to extract something out of any thing, and any thing out of just nothing to his purpose: this that God is not more prone to severity then mercy, may serve, and that soundly to make against those that say God is willing to save but a few, and did peremptorily determine to damn personally an 100 men to one before they were born, and that without reference to their soreseen rejection of his grace, but how it seems to make a jot against such as suppose the salvation of all dying infants, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying onely infants meer membership in meer gospell fellowship, I must professe my self too shallow to conceive, yea I am astonisht, saving that the word tells me the seers must be blinded for teaching Gods fear after mens precepts, that the the ministers should buzze such a businesse abroad in print <hi>viz.</hi> that if infants be not now Church-members, then God is more prone to severity then to mercy, and then back it so baldly too as Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> does: it is evident thus saith he <hi>God hath cut off multitudes of wicked mens infants both from the Church, and from life for the sins of their progenitors</hi> viz. Dathan <hi>and</hi> Abirams, Achans, Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecks, <hi>the</hi> Midianites, Daniels <hi>accusers, the</hi> Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perrezites, <hi>and</hi> Jebusites, <hi>therefore if he should not admit of some infants of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men so much as to the visible Church,</hi> then he <hi>should be more prone to seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity then to mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot but inwardly blush at Mr. <hi>Bas.</hi> blindnesse, as if God had no way whereby to vindicate the honour of his mercy, and clear himself from the censure of more severe then merciful, but one, that is by giving commission to us, which yet he no where gives us in any part of his will and Testament, to baptize and inchurch some infants: as if he had no way to recover to his credit again to his most merciful name of the <hi>Lord, mercifull, gracious, and slow to anger</hi> since his cutting off so many infants toge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her with their wicked parents by meer temporal death, and to make amends as it were for all the slaughters, that he made of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent infants, with their rebellious fathers in the daies of the law, unlesse in liew thereof he grant some infants of faithful men to be members of his visible Churches, and in visible fellowship with them in the daies and ages of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
               <p>Who sees not the weaknesse, the wretchednesse of this consequence? yet so it is with Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> that God is more prone to severity then mercy if he now admit no infants into the visible Church under the Gospel, except saith he, it be proved that God giveth them some greater mercy out of the Church. To which excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his I say thus.</p>
               <p>First, it need not be proved, and yet his consequence will prove false, for if the
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:109011:228"/>
meer admitting of some faithful mens infants into the visible Church will so make up the matter as to salve God from censure of pronesse to severity, rather then mercy, and magnifie his mercy so as to make it appear to be that he delights in more then judgement, notwithstanding his severity in slaying so many infants with the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, then God magnfied his mercy in that kind of way sufficiently to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for that severity in the very time of the law it self, forasmuch as then he did admit for 2000 years together not onely some infants of faithfull men, but in all that time innumerable infants of unfaithful and wicked men (for such were the Jewes for the most part in their several generations and yet such infants your selves would not now have admitted) to stand in the vrsible and national Church of the Jewes. And so there is no need of any admittance of infants now, in order to such an end as satisfaction for his severity to some infants of old, into visible fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with Gospel Churches.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to satisfie him further it may easily be proved that God giveth infants, if they die in their infancy unbaptized and not inchurched (for if they live to years they may be baptized all, and inchurched too, if they believe) a greater mercy then that of meer church-membership here on earth, for they having never committed any actuall sins whereby to deserve exemption, charity teaches us to believe, and hope thus much saies the <hi>Ashford</hi> Pamphlet of all such, that of <hi>such is the kindom of heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One thing more I cannot but take notice of in this passage not in way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> but in way of discovery how contradictory unto him some of his brethren are, who mannage the same cause with him, that they may either close more hand somely together, or else excuse us if we believe none of them till they be agreed more among themselves, for whereas Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> layes it down as the manner of old that when the parents sinned and broke Gods covenant so as to deserve to be discovenanted thereupon, the children that had right to stand by the <hi>Quondam</hi> membership of their parents, were wont to be discovenanted, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churched, and sometimes destroyed with them;</p>
               <p>I find the fornamed Dr. <hi>Channell</hi> of another mind, for when in a second pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique discourse with him at <hi>Petworth</hi> on <hi>Ianuary</hi> 5.1651. I asserted his practise to be contradictory to his own judgement, forasmuch as his judgement was that believers infants onely were in covenant with God, and in right to Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership and baptism, and yet his practise to baptize all or most of the infants in his parish, not one of many of whose parents he judged to be believers, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his refusing communion with them for many years together in the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</p>
               <p>He gave answer to this purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> that the parent, i. e. believing (or else the child hath no right <hi>secundum te</hi> O Presbyter) may sin himself out of covenant again, out of all communion in the Church, and be damned, and yet the child stand still in right to baptism and membership which he had by the faith of those parents; which as it thwarts the wonted way of discovenanting, dischurching of children with the parents, so it contradicts himself more another way, though he evade his first contradiction by it, to say that believing parents (for such one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say your selves give right to their infants to be baptized) may sinne themselves out of covenant, and be damned, for though as I then told him he preached it in saying thus, yet I am perswaded he holds no falling from grace.</p>
               <p>More things I take notice that that Dr. and Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> knock heads in, but I spare to do more then advise them to accord better with each other, but specially each of them with himself, or else as implicitly as men have believed them hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they will try them ere long, and scarce trust them any longer.</p>
               <p>His 20 <hi>Plain Scripture-lesse proof for infant churchmembership and baptism</hi> he <hi>drawes</hi> as he saies from Deut. 28.4.18 32.41. <hi>blessed shall they be in the
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:109011:229"/>
fruit of their body</hi> that keep the covenant, and <hi>cursed in the fruit of their body<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> i. e. that break the covenant <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he may well say he drawes it, for theres no such thing as he draws flowes freely from that or any other Scripture he produces, he drawes indeed, but at such a distance, that I see nothing followes from thence at all: he does not fall flatly upon it, nor deal down rightly with the text alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, nor doth he interpret the blessing and cursing to be membership, and non-membership, so as to say that by blessed shall be the fruit of thy body is meant thus, i. e. thy infants shall be inchurched, and by cursed shall be the fruit of thy body thus, i. e. thy infants shall be dischurched, for that had been too palpably to pervert it, but he keeps a loof off from it, and doth not draw neer to the heart and center of it, but syllogizes in a circumference, and fetches it from far for fear, I think, least it should fly in his face.</p>
               <p>The Argument that I fetch hence is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That doctrine, which maketh the children of the faithfull to be in a worse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or as bad, then the curse</hi> Deut. 28. <hi>maketh the children of covenant breakers to be in, is false doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the doctrine which denyeth the children of the faithfull to be visible Churchmembers, doth make them to be in as bad or worse condition then is threatned by the curse</hi> Deut. 28.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> of which Syllogism is most false, for infants may be both unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized and no visible Church members, and yet be in a better condition then such as are under the curse, and the captivity threatned <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. and so are all these to whom baptism and admittance into the visible Church is delayed by yourselves, who in the Church of <hi>England</hi> in old time were wont to defer the baptizing of all infants to two times in the year, <hi>viz. Easter</hi> and <hi>Whitsuntide,</hi> and so are all those also to whom we deny it, for both those to whom you delay it, and those to whom we deny it, dying in infancy without it, may be saved without it as well as if they had it.</p>
               <p>And at the same rates as they dispute them to be under cursing to whom we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny baptism, and visible Church-membership, and our doctrine to be false that denies it, may we dispute those infants to be under cursing, to whom they delay baptism and visible membership, though but for a week during the time of their delaying it, and their doctrine to be false that delaies it, if we retort the same Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument on themselves, which I shall do and leave it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That doctrine which makes the children of the faithful in as bad or worse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition then is threatned in that curse</hi> Deut. 28. <hi>is false.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But that doctrine which delaies baptism and visible Church-membership to the infants of the faithfull till the tenth, twelfth, or twentyeth day of their age,</hi> till Plumcake be made, maketh them during the time in which tis delayed in worse Condition then is threatned in that curse, <hi>Deuter.</hi> 28.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo</hi> tis false.</p>
               <p>Till then you have ingrafted your children into the Church by baptism they are it seems with you in worse state then if they were in captivity, and all the poor innocent infants of those parents that are in <hi>England,</hi> to which your selves (O <hi>Presbyters</hi>) deny baptism, unlesse the parent will confesse his faith before the Bason, are in worse and more cursed condition then if they were in captivity.</p>
               <p>And if an <hi>Indians</hi> infant should be born and bread up here in <hi>England,</hi> and be in never such a hopeful way of comming in time to the knowledge of the truth, yet all the time he remains unbaptiz'd, and not visibly added to your corrupt church of <hi>England,</hi> he is belike under a worse curse, and condition then if he were in sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very or captivity: I wonder where Christ or his disciples ever preached such kind of Gospel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="441" facs="tcp:109011:229"/>His 21 <hi>plain. Scripture-lesse proof for infant-Church membership and baptism runs</hi> upon this disjunction, viz. <hi>Either they are in the visible Church of Christ or in the visible kingdome of the Devil, for there is no third state,</hi> saith he, <hi>in which they are, but if they be not in Christs visible Church they are visibly out of it, and if they be visibly out of that visible Church then they are visibly in Satans Kingdome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the summe and substance of what he laies down, and the basis upon which he builds a necessity of admitting the children of the faithfull into, and reckoning upon them as in the visible Church of Christ, or else we must (saith he) say they are in the visible Kingdome of the Devill; which to say saith he is false doctrine; the rest is but amplification and augmentation rather then Argumentation of this position; now howbeit a wise body that is not resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to trouble himself, and fill the world with curious pryings, long proofs, and prolix prates about matters, which the wisdome of Christ in the word of his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, which was written to, for and concerning men and women, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, is pleased to be silent in, would surely have sat down satisfyed with that sober saying, which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> himself cotes out of Mr. <hi>T. Apol. p.</hi> 66. <hi>viz. that infants are neither in the Kingdom</hi> (i. e. visible church) <hi>of Christ, nor Satan vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly till profession.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For really so it is, and no otherwise properly, and <hi>quoad nos,</hi> who have no warrant to take cognizance of them as in either one or in the other visibly, but as at years they visibly appear to cleave to either, neither are these two, <hi>viz.</hi> the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Kingdome of Satan, and the visible Church of Christ the adaequate dividing members of the whole world, but (excepting infants) of the adult ones in it only, which visibly obey either Christ or Satan; neither doth Satans visible kingdome consist of any infants visibly at all, but of such as visibly are acted by him, even the children of disobedience, in whom he works <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.2. nor Christs visible Church of any infants visibly at all, save when some were inchurched and inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted as a type for a time, but of such onely as visibly obey him, these I say are visibly the subjects, servants, disciples and children of each <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ye are, i. e. visibly, to whom i. e. visibly ye obey, whether &amp;c. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.10. in this i. e. doing or not doing righteousnesse are manifest, i. e. visibly, the children of God, and of the devll so <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>They are visibly of their father the devil, who do the works of their father i. e. in Gospel account; for else in the lawes account they, as <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, were then the Churches children, howbeit I say any one that is not willing to be wise above what is written, and to have vision of more then is visible, would rest in this, yet sith Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will put us positivly to prove a third state, denying that theres any <hi>medium</hi> asserting that infants, if they be not in the visible Church of Christ in their infancy, are in the visible kingdome of the devil, which to say is false doctrine, I shall bring Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to stop the mouth of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and to convince him that either there is a third state, in which believers infants are in their infancy, which is neither of these two, or else to drive him to that <hi>Dilemma,</hi> to preach this false doctrine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self that believers infants are in the visible kingdome of the Devil.</p>
               <p>To this purpose I first demand of him, which of these two viz. the visible church of Christ or the visible kingdome of the devil believers infants are visibly in before baptism?</p>
               <p>First as for the visible kingdom of the devil he must say they are either visibly in it or out of it, if he say they are in it, then he himself preaches that false doctrine, which he saies is ours, and makes all infants, even of believers members of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible kingdom of the devil; if he say they are out, and not in the visible kingdom of the devil, then that doctrine, which teaches men to leave them unbaptized, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies them to be admitted members of the visible church of Christ till they come to age, is not guilty as he saies it is, of making them doctrinally members of the visible
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:109011:230"/>
kingdome of the devil, for it is but a delay indeed till they can do what is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to baptism.</p>
               <p>As for the visible Church of Christ he must say they are either visibly in it before baptism, or not in but out of it, if he say they are in the visible church of Christ vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly before baptism, then they cannot be said to be (as oh how oft ore and ore again are they said to be by Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> p. 24.25.?) admitted to be members, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, listed, added, initiated into it as into Christs School, and first stated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it by baptism, for to be first entered into it by baptism, and yet to be visibly in it before baptism, these two are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> utterly inconsistent each with other, as to be let into a room when, and while one is already in the room is impossible, yet with Mr. B. persons are let into the visible church after they are in it, yea they must be in it, saith he, before they may be admitted to be in it, nor will his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of a member compleat and incompleat p. 24. which he used before to the tearm disciple, which I know he will make, help him at all here, sith with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self an incompleat member is one that hath but <hi>jus adrem,</hi> not <hi>in re, ad Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siam,</hi> not <hi>in Ecclesia</hi> a right to onely, not a standing in the Church, a title to the relative change, and not a being yet in that relative change, that he saies passes upon him by baptism.</p>
               <p>Besides, to say the truth they are but incompleat members after baptism, whom you baptize, sith when baptized and in the church they have not present right to other ordinances of the church, for you admit not your infant members to the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: but if he say they are not visibly in the church of Christ before baptism, but out of it, as indeed they are, then either he must say they are in the visible King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the devil, which is false doctrine with himself to say of believers infants, or else say they are in some third or middle state, to the unsaying of what he said before by way of denial of such a third state, which let him say, and we will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with him, and such a third state there is, which all infants are in as well as some, whether he will deny himself so as to acknowledge it yea, or no.</p>
               <p>His 22. plain <hi>Scripture-less</hi> proof for infant Church-membership and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism is this <hi>viz. That doctrine which leaveth us no sound grounded hope of the justification or salvation of any dying infant in the world, is certainly false doctrine, but that doctrine which denieth any infants to be members of the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church doth leave us no &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>This argument I have spoken to sufficiently above, and thereupon might well passe it by here, and refer Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> thither for an answer, where in answer to the <hi>Ashford</hi> Disputants, that urge the same argument, enough to satisfie is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned;</p>
               <p>But finding this to be that which of all things most gravels Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and makes him stick so stiffly to his plea for the baptism, and Church-membership of infants, because unlesse that be owned he can find no good ground in all the word whereupon to hope or believe that any dying infant in all the world can be saved, which if he could find, he would find the vanity of his venting so much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a necessity of baptizing, and inchurching infants, and save himself a deal of puzzling himself about that, which the New Testament hath not one word of, and fearing lest I should be judged cowardly to slide by it, as if I saw Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> handled it more unanswerably then any other, and partly because Mr. <hi>Ts.</hi> suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his judgement concerning the future state of any infants is puft at by him, and uneffectual to his satisfaction, unlesse he could assure him of the salvation of some dying infants, at least of believing parents, which if he could assure him of out of the way of their church-membership and baptism, it should satisfie him sufficiently, I perceive, to censure all other infants to hell, and to say all those millions of poor innocents, I mean the dying infants of other men, in respect of which these he is so pittiful to are scarce one of a 100. are all damned for ever,
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:109011:230"/>
with which harsh, cruel, bloody and mercilesse censure of his I am much more, and more groundedly dissatisfied, then he is about the denial of meer outward member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and bare ordinance of baptism to those few, on whose behalf he pleads them, and lastly hoping the Lord may lend him some ligh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> whereby to see a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency between the non membership and baptism of believers infants, and the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the dying infants of, not believers onely, but all dying innocent infants in the world, I shall enter on an examination of what he saies to the contrary, and an explication of what apprehension in this particular I am begotten to by the word of truth, and though I shall decline <hi>sacerdotale delirium</hi> that common stock of divinity, which the Clergy have treasured up in their Theological Systems, out of which ocean of error, and dead sea of tradition the younger <hi>Rabbies</hi> use to draw into their common place books, and store themselves with arguments against Anabaptistical heresie, i. e. this troublesome truth, yet I trust I shall give a good account before all the world at the Tribunal of Christ Jesus.</p>
               <p>In order hereunto therefore I first flatly deny the <hi>Minor</hi> of Mr. <hi>Bas.</hi> above ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted syllogism, which by another Syllogism he proves viz. <hi>They that are not so much as seemingly or visibly in a state of salvation, of them so dying we can have no ground of Christian hope that they shall be saved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But they that are not so much as seemingly or visibly of the Church, are not so much as seemingly or visibly in a state of salvation, therefore of them so dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we can have no true ground of hope that they shall be saved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> of this second syllogism, which he sets himself to prove, I freely grant to be true.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> I have many things to say to;</p>
               <p>First, I take notice how he changes the termes from what they were in this pro-syllogism, which, had he been minded to deal fairly, and not to sophisticate and shuffle, I know not why he should do, and a sincere disputant whould not have done it.</p>
               <p>In the Minor of the former syllogism the terms were thus <hi>viz.</hi> that doctrine that denieth infants to be members of the <hi>visible</hi> church, but here he writes, leaving out the word <hi>visible,</hi> foisting in the word <hi>seemingly</hi> and <hi>visibly</hi> to fill up the room of it, that it might not be mist, they that are not <hi>seemingly</hi> or <hi>visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> of the Church, whereas he ought of right to have brought in the <hi>Minor,</hi> and conclusion thus <hi>viz.</hi> but they that are not members of the <hi>visible</hi> Church, are not so much as seemingly or visibly in a state of salvation, therefore of them <hi>viz.</hi> them that are not members of the <hi>visible</hi> Church, we can have no true ground of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian hope that they can be saved, I say he should have exprest it <hi>visible</hi> Church in both places, else the word <hi>Church</hi> being understood by Mr. <hi>Ba,</hi> for the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church sometimes, i, e. them that are not onely seemingly sincere, and in state of salvation, but as really and truly in state of salvation as they seem, by this variation of his from visible Church to Church without the term visible the state of the question may be changed: and howbeit he premises this and takes it for granted that to be a visible member of the church, and to be a member of the visible Church is all one, saying he that denies that will shew but his vanity, yet he takes it before it is granted him from me, who am one of those vain ones, that by his favour deny these to be all one, unlesse by the word Church in both places he means the <hi>visible</hi> Church, which though I do not say he doth not, yet I say if he do, he should by right have exprest it, or else there may be fallacy in it, for I aver to Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> and albeit I seem to him to speak paradoxes, and parables thorow the distance of our principles, yet I hope to make it clear to his conscience, that the visible Church doth not so contain the invisible in it, as he saies it doth p. 75. but that there are cases wherein persons may be both real and visible i. e. to us seeming members of the invisible Church, or mistical body of sincere ones, and in state of salvation, and yet not be real members of the visible Church; or else

               </p>
               <p>They that are not so much as seemingly or visibly in the state of salvation, of them so dying we can have no true ground of Christian hope that they shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>But they that are not members of the <hi>visible</hi> Church, are not so much as seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly or visibly in a state of salvation, therefore of them that are not members of the <hi>visible</hi> Church, so dying we can have no true ground of Christian hope that they shall be saved.</p>
               <p>In the second place I fault the Minor of this argument as most false and unsound in the matter of it, and therefore I lay down this for truth, which is directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to it <hi>viz.</hi> that they that are not members of the visible Church may be seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly and visibly in a state of salvation, and so consequently that of them that are not members of the visible Church so dying, we may have true ground of Christian hope that they shall be saved.</p>
               <p>These two positions with the consequence thereof are so contradictory each to other, that if this latter be truth then the former universally understood i. e. of all that are not of the visible Church, as it must be, or else it serves not Mr. <hi>Ba<hi rend="sup">s</hi>
                  </hi> purpose, must needs be false: whereupon I need do no more toward the disproof of his then to prove my own, in order to which I shall premise what the visible Church is, and then examine whether it be not possible for some persons as Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> it seems thinks it is not, to be seemingly and visibly in a state of salvation, and yet not be members of the visible Church.</p>
               <p>The true visible Church now in the times of the Gospel, and so onely it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns our purpose to consider of it, is <hi>all those severall particular visible assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and societies of persons in the world, or visible disciples collectively taken, which in all places and ages since Christ past, present and to come, being first separated, or called out of the world to personall prosession of repentance from dead works, and faith towards God, of remission of sins by Christ Iesus, of resurrection of the dead, and the eternall judgement, and baptized in water in the name of Christ for remission of sins, and together with imposition of hands, prayed for, that they may receive the holy spirit of promise, do afterward conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue stedfastly in the doctrine of the Apostles, and in fellowship, and in breaking
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:109011:231"/>
of bread and prayers</hi>: all the true universall visible Church that I know of, if you will needs have an universal visible is that which doth exist in these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular visible societies, and is neither narrower nor wider then these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p>Such was the visible Gospel Church in the primitive times, and the same and no other then that which was the visible Church then is the visible Church now, and in all times of the Gospell, wherein it is at all: the visible Church was that which did consist and was made up of all the particular Churches that then were <hi>viz. Rome, Corinth,</hi> and all the rest, which were societies and assemblies of persons thus called, gathered and built up an house unto God, upon the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the first principles of the doctrine of Christ, as the six above named are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. as they are also called <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20. the foundation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apostles i. e. that form of doctrine as tis called <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. which every beginner in Christ did own and obey, and which obeying he was fit matter for the visible church, and was after by mutual consent of the party offering himself, and their suffering him to join with them <hi>Acts</hi> 10.26. formally added, actually admitted to visible fellowship with them in breaking of bread and prayers, for that with freedome on both sides such persons as had thus far been taught, and had learned these principles, this <hi>a b c,</hi> and owned it i. e. professing to believe what of it was matter of faith, and visibly practising what of it was practical, were visible disciples, new born babes <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.13. and such babes being baptized, and, having laid this foundation as to fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship, were then accepted thereunto that they might grow up to perfection, in order whereunto unto this visible church <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.21. which though it exists in many several particular bodies, each of which is independent on any other head then Christ, and impowered from him to determine all its own affaires ultimately within it self, yet since it endeavours to keep the <hi>unity of the spirit in the bond of peace, is said to be but one body, because of one spirit, one call, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and father of them all, who is above all and through all, and in them all,</hi> God hath given officers gifted for its service, <hi>viz. some Apostles, some Prophets, some Pastors and teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Ministery, for the edifying of this visible body of Christ, till we all come to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fulnesse of Christ Eph.</hi> 4.3.4.5.6.11.12.13.</p>
               <p>As for that Catholique visible church, I mean that voluminous body or part of the world commonly called <hi>Christ'ndome,</hi> which was once all as it were of one language and one speech, and is now rather three in one or a Triune treader of the truth <hi>viz. Papall, Prelaticall, Presbyterial,</hi> yet to this day exists in those particular visibles as were never thus seperated, and called, and constituted upon the foundation of the doctrine of the Apostles, but conglomerated by the lump by the Apostle Peters supposed successor into <hi>Nationall, Provinciall, Parochiall,</hi> (to call a spade a spade) I can call it no other then the <hi>CCCatholique Beast,</hi> that bears now in three parts a <hi>BBBabilonish CCClergy Rev.</hi> 16.19. i. e. indeed the very <hi>CCCatholique</hi> whore <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>As for particular persons, though professing to be believers that yet are not baptized, and added to some such particular visible society or church, but are yet abiding in the capacity only of single though visible Saints, till they are both baptizd and added as members to walk in fellowship with some particular assembly, and congregation in breaking bread and prayers, as every such a one as supposes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be a saint ought to be, or else his saintship may be much suspected if he will not, they are no visible members of the visible church but onely fitter mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials then they were before their faith, and in a neerer right to be both baptized and admitted to be members, then when they had none: they are better matter for the visible church, but not yet formally of the visible church, have <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> not

                  <hi>in re, ad ecclesiam,</hi> not <hi>in Ecclesia</hi> a right to the church, but not actual standing in it till entered and admitted.</p>
               <p>Nor yet are they immediate matter for, or in immediate right to membership, though believing, till baptized, but <hi>materia remota,</hi> and <hi>in jure quodam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionali, &amp; remoto,</hi> a certain remote matter, though neerer then when meerly men, and in a conditional and remote right.</p>
               <p>For as believers are the immediate matter for, or in immediate right to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, so baptized believers after laying on of hands in prayer are the immediate subject, i. e. in immediate right to be admitted, yet neither are baptized believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers actuall members till admitted, the formality and most immediate entrance, and way of becoming a visible member of a particular visible Church, and so consequently of the generall visible (if I may so call it) which hath its existence in all the particular churches, which are the immediate matter, of which that is made up, being not simply the act of baptism, but the act of joining our selves after it <hi>Act</hi> 9.26. and the constitutive form of a visible Church is not their being all baptized, but their free falling into fellowship with each other, and though we are said to be all baptized into one body, tis an expression of the necessity only of every ones being baptized in order to a being in the visible Church, for none hath right to be of the visible body unbaptized, but though the baptized have imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate right to be of the body, yet are they not meerly of it because baptized, till added to it, and as one cannot be said to be actually under baptism, from an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate right to it by faith, till he have submitted, so neither can we be said to be actually in the body from our immediate right to it by baptism, till we are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>Self condemned sinners have a right to believe in Christ, believers a right to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, baptized believers a right to the spirit of promise, &amp; to have hands laid on with prayer, that they may receive it according to the promise <hi>Asts</hi> 2. <hi>Acts</hi> 8. <hi>Acts</hi> 19. such as these to fellowship in the visible Church, yet not in fellowship till, assaying to join themselves, they are accepted, and yet in a visible state of salvation too both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore baptized, as the thief, and after baptized before added to the Church visible, as the Eunuch, who both were seemingly members of the invisible Church, and yet then when converted and baptizd, neither one not the other as yet actual members of the visible: stones though never so unhewn and ragged are remote matter, hewn and polished stones immediate and fit matter for a building, yet not a building, till built together; many sheep are fit matter to make a flock, yet not formally a flock till they come neer together.</p>
               <p>Christs visible church is Christs flock, Gods house, Temple, building, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral sheep, and single disciples, that hear his voice, believe in him, and are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into his name for remission of sins, are pecious materials, and in <hi>potentiâ proximâ</hi> thereunto, yet be they never so many of them, not visibly, actually, nor formally a flock, an house, a Temple, a Building, his visible Church long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then imbodyed into fellowships, nor till fitly framed together they are builded an habitation of God through the spirit, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.20.21.22. any more then many sheep that never came neer each other, are a flock, and a multitude of fitted and squared stones, lying a long way a sunder each from other make a buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
               <p>Mr. B. shall be no Champion of my choosing to mannage the matter against the non-churchers of these times, for all he flourishes his sword so against them at the end of his book, if he plead the cause of them so, that sit down satisfyed in single fellowship between God and themselves onely, living up with him in the spirit, contenting themselves to believe onely, and renouncing all ordinances, forsak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the assembling of themselves together, and all fellowship in breaking of bread and prayers; if he grant the denomination of the true visible Church to such as these, as well as to those that continue stedfast in the Apostles doctrine, and in fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:109011:232"/>
in breaking bread and prayers: yet Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does not yet agree with me in this that the particular assemblies collectively taken are the only visible Church, for indeed he is aware that it overturns all his visibilities from the bottom, and layes this foundation of no salvation for infants without the visible Church, on which he frames his present Argument, flat on the ground, to allow the bounds of the visible Church to be no broader then all the particular visible societies that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually baptized, and in formal fellowship in breaking bread and prayers, so as to say he is no member of the visible Church, that is not actually entred, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly stated in some particular congregation or other; therefore being politick, he premises this among the rest.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>You must understand,</hi> saith he (but a man may understand a little better if he will) <hi>that to be a member of the visible Church is not to be a Member of any particular, or politick body or society.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay more to make his own matter good, and that he may find out a way of his own, whereby to hope well of all the infants of believers before baptism, that they may be saved (for let all other dying infants damn for him, he cares not for harbouring any hope of them) and finding no way but one, whereby to help himself to any hope of those, i. e. by feigning them to be of the visible church, he fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches the visible church so far, that he makes it larger then the number of visible baptized ones, and holds all believers infants to be in the visible Church from the womb, and though in the last page but two of his book he disputes against twice entring into the visible body; he feigns them to enter first into the visible church, when they first enter into the world, besides and before their second first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the visible Church by baptism: I wonder whether he hold those belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers infants to be of the visible Church or no, that were once alive yet dy again in the womb?</p>
               <p>But for all these flim-flames, Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> will once know I hope that the true visible church is no other, then all those particular politicall assemblies, in which baptized believers hold fellowship together, and that to be a member of the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble church is to be a member of some political society (or else how can such be ruld, admonisht, complained on to the church as <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. and excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if need be, in case of obstinacy, if under no Ecclesiasticall Government?) and yet to hope well of the salvation of all infants that dy in infancy too without either baptism or visible membership in those visible societies.</p>
               <p>And if he will not agree with me about it, that the visible church is all the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble assemblies of Christians onely, will he agree with Dr. <hi>Featley,</hi> who defines the true visible church to be <hi>where the word is truly taught, and the sacraments duly administred</hi>? where therefore neither word is taught, nor sacraments at all administred, as to unbaptized infants I judge they are not, nor baptized infants neither, theres no visible church;</p>
               <p>Again, the universal visible church, that is saith he, <hi>all the assemblies of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in the world,</hi> the visible church and all the assemblies are adaequate with him, at least therefore unbaptized infants cannot be of it, for they were never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the assemblies; but if Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> will agree with neither of us, we shall perswade him I hope to agree in this with Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> for howbeit Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> will needs reckon upon the very unbaptized infants of believers as not in right to the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble church onely, but of it, in it, visible members of it as as soon as born (for let him study his own book, how oft does he beat upon that, saying, there is but two states for them to be in, or members of the visible kingdome of the devil, or the visible church of Christ, but believers infants before baptism are not in the first, therefore in the visible church of Christ?) though I say he speak of them as in the visible church before baptism, as not knowing else how to hope their salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if they dy without it, yet if any man living do deny infants, or any other to be of or in the visible church before or without baptism, Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> denies it, with

whom how often is it exprest that baptism is the first visible entrance into it?</p>
               <p>Yea (to say nothing of his own definition of the visible church, p. 75. to be such as <hi>were baptized and continued together in fellowship in breaking bread and prayers,</hi> which ought to conclude the whole church so defined unlesse he have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined it by the halves) in his plea for the continuance of baptism against the seekers p. 342.343. he saies so, and saies moreover that we must not admit any to be of the body without it, that it is the <hi>appointed ordinary way of ingrafting all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the body that are ingrafted,</hi> and p. 24.25. he saies <hi>baptism still is to be at and not after persons are stated in the Church, at and not after our admission, at and not after our igraf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I would every one, and Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> himself would consider this grant of Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> for then, what ever necessity there may be of supposing them, as he doth, to be visible members in infancy, and even before they are baptized, we can suppose them in as good a state as he, yet at least there will be no need to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them, whereby to put us into more hopes of their salvation if they dy in infancy, for if I can hope the salvation of some believers infants that die without Baptism, upon that account, what ere tis, I may as well hope the salvation of them all dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without Baptism, and so save the frivolous pains of baptizing infants at all, he goes on thus, tis true saith he, that <hi>many unbaptized are in the Kingdome of Christ,</hi> meaning his visible church, but no man who is known to be out of Christs visible church ordinarily can be out of Satans visible kingdome: I say how do these things square? hear what he saies, no entring into or being in the visible Church, but by baptism, and yet many unbaptized are in the visible Church <hi>viz.</hi> all believers infants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before baptism <hi>viz.</hi> from the womb.</p>
               <p>Either Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> must hold two first entrances into the visible church <hi>viz.</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural birth and baptism, or else he must hold that baptism is not the first entrance, or else that believers infants are not entred, and if not so, not in the visible church before baptism, whether they have right to be so or no, which is another questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; if he chuse to say the first, then he contradicts what he saies of entring the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church p. 343. if the 2d. he contradicts all he saies of baptism being the onely entrance; if the 3d. that believers infants are not entred, and so not in nor visibly of the visible church before baptism, then of these two things he must say one <hi>viz.</hi> either that all the infants of believers that dy before their visible entrance into the visible church by baptism are damned without hope, which he neither will nor can say, or else say that there is hope of dying infants salvation, and that they may be seemingly and visibly in a state of saluation, and yet not be visible members of the visible church, and then what need any further witnesse or disproof? for heel confute the <hi>Minor</hi> out of his own mouth, which I am to disprove, and save me the labour.</p>
               <p>For if they may be in a visible state of salvation and yet not be visibly in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible church; then tis so, and theres an end.</p>
               <p>If to all this he saies that he meanes not more, but that believers infants before baptism have right to be baptized, and to be of it, and to deny them that right to it denies them salvation, I deny that infants dying without right to be of the visible Gospel church denies them to be in state of salvation, and shall shew

the contrary, neverthelesse Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> might have spoken more properly, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then to call a right to visible membership by the name of visible member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship it self, as he often, yea all along does, therefore we might wish him to mend his <hi>Minor</hi> before we meddle with it, and also he must confesse to the contradiction of himself, that there is a third state betwen the visible church of Christ, and the visible kingdom of the devil, in which infants must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be by himself <hi>viz.</hi> a right to the church, but not a present standing in it, which kind of right and middle state I acknowledge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Viz.</hi> That not only some men may be <hi>de facto</hi> no members, but all infants <hi>de jure</hi> in no right to membership in the visible Church of Christ under the Gospell, and yet both be possibly in state of salvation.</p>
               <p>Now how far forth <hi>de facto</hi> persons may be out of an actual standing in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible church, and yet in a visible state of salvation, ile not meddle much to examine, because the question is (though Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does not so fairly expresse it, but I take it in the way that is most to his advantage) whether denyal of the <hi>jus</hi> this imediate right to membership excludes them not from salvation? yet thus much I shall say to that <hi>viz.</hi> if persons must be seemingly, and visibly in state of salvation, before they are to be admitted members, they may be as yet no members of the visible church <hi>de facto,</hi> and yet in a visible state of salvation.</p>
               <p>This is evident not only by the singular case of the theif, who never was actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admitted into the visible Church, nor so much as baptized at all for want of opportunity, and yet in a visible state of salvation, but also if we instance in all others that ever we read were baptized in the primitive times, who were first seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly and visibly in a state of repentance, faith and disposition to obey Christ in all things, and therefore in a visible state of salvation <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. and then after this added to the church <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> or the Cart before the horse, they must be first supposed to be visibly members in the visible Church, before to be visibly in a state of salvation, but it is undeniably apparent they must have visible right to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and that by faith too, before visible right to membership in the visible church.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> supposes persons must be first supposed to be members of the visible Church <hi>a priori</hi> before they can be warrantably supposed to be of the invisible, i. e. to be such as shall be saved, for <hi>if a person be of the invisible Church he must be thought to be of the visible much more, for the visible containes the invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in it</hi> saith he p. 72. <hi>and ordinarily we may not judge any to be of the invisible Church,</hi> he means in real state of salvation, <hi>who are not,</hi> meaning first, <hi>of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi> p. 72.</p>
               <p>But now I say and suppose the clean contrary <hi>viz.</hi> that persons must be first sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be of the invisible Church <hi>a priori</hi> before they can be warrantably sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be of, yea or so much as to have right to be of the visible; who backs Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> in his sinister supposition I weigh not, let him chuse his second if he will, ile chuse Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> himself to back me, and to be witnesse to the truth of mine, whose words are altogether the same with mine p 73. viz. <hi>if we were fully certain by his own externall discourses that any man were not of the invisible Church, that man should not be taken to be of the visible.</hi> In order of time therefore persons were to seem to be members of the invisible church, and were visibly in a state of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion first before they could have any right at all so much as to be baptized, which with Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> himself was the first entrance into membership in the visible church, but with me is not so much as an immediate entrance into it, but that which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily to go before it, therefore persons may be seemingly in a state of salvation, and not yet in present right to membership in the visible Church, much lesse actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and visibly in it.</p>
               <p>And now concerning infants, of whom Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> asserts that they must be members of the visible Church, or else cannot be seemingly or visibly in a state of salvation, upon such slender grounds as these, he concludes it to be clear <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, because <hi>it is the body that Christ is the Saviour of, and his people that he redeemeth from their sins, and his sheep to whom he gives eternal life, and those that sleep in Iesus that God will bring with him, and the dead in Christ that shall rise to salvation, and those that die in the Lord that rest from their labours and the Church that Christ will present pure and unspotted,</hi> all which places I appeal to Mr. <hi>Bas.</hi> conscience whether they speak not of the misticall body, and invisible church of Christ, to which all and onely they square, and are adaequate, and not to the visible Church, which he was to speak to, or else speaks nothing to the purpose, to all which visible church, and to onely which these things agree not, for neither all those, that are of the visible church are saved, nor
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:109011:234"/>
onely those of the visible Church saved, witnesse many infants of believers whom Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> dares not say are damned, some never living to enter the visible Church so farre as to baptism, and some, once alive, coming dead out of the womb, which he is blind that ever saw to be in the visible church, so that he sits here beside the saddle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, and Thirdly, because there is no divine revelation for the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of any without the visible Church, that yields good ground of Christian faith, or hope that any such shall be saved,</hi> as notwithstanding he saies there is not, yet I shall shew there is by and by.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, because it is said Acts the</hi> 2.47. <hi>that God added to the visible church dayly such as should be saved,</hi> which though he did, yet twas not all nor onely such, but onely such men and women, not such infants, as should be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>Concerning infants in proof of the proposition above <hi>viz.</hi> that some infants may be in visible State of salvation, and yet not be in, nor yet in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent right to membership in the visible Church,</p>
               <p>I argue thus downrightly.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>if all infants are in infancy in a visible state of salvation, and no infants are members, or in any right to be members in their infancy of the visible church under the Gospel, then some infants may in infancy be in a visible state of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>But all infants &amp;c. and no infants &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ergo, some infants <hi>ut supra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first proposition is most undeniably clear, the <hi>Minor</hi> hath two parts, which I shall prove successively one ofter another, and then I have done with this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> Ile ptove the last first, and the first last, and here I dare say I might easily muster up scores, if not a century of solid arguments toward the fuller clearing of it, that no babes now, but the new born babes spoken of 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2.3.4.5. i. e. at least in appearance spiritually born babes, such as those 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.13. are to be baptized, and built upon the foundation i. e. doctrine of Christ and the Apostles, a spiritual house, a holy temple i. e. vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible church unto Iesus Christ now in these daies of the Gospel, and that no mans fleshly seed or natural posterity, no not <hi>Abrahams</hi> own barely on such an account as being his bodily seed, much lesse any believing Gentiles, who hath not more priviledge then his seed I think, but onely the (at least seeming) spiritual seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> i. e. those that are children of God, and <hi>Abrahams</hi> too by faith in Christ <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26.28. as no infant is, have right to dwell in this family, the babes, the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> circumcised in heart, the children of the heavenly promise pointed at, and typed out by the Iews babes, and that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised seed of <hi>Isaac,</hi> and those children of that earthly promise of the old <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> these are the true sons of the free woman, the Gospel visible church, before whom the bond woman, and her son i. e. <hi>Abrahams</hi> meer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But that were to begin the work again, which I have finisht above, where I
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:109011:235"/>
have given a touch of these things, and but a touch in comparison of what might be said; And of multiplying Arguments, and making many books there is no end.</p>
               <p>Therefore ile hint but a few, among which this shall be the first.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the standing upon the root Abraham, i. e. the family or visible Church of God since Christ be by faith in the person onely so standing, and not by faith in the parent, as of old, then infants cannot now stand therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But so tis,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The consequence is cleared by the consideration of the incapacity of infants to believe, faith being assent to something propounded to us, faith comming by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and hearing by the word <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. so that who so thinks it possible for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>credere</hi> when it is said how can they believe in him of whom they have not heard, is wretchedly inconsiderate.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is evident out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. where it is said the very natural branches of <hi>Abrahams</hi> body, that did on that account meerly as the fleshly seed of that father of the faithfull stand in the olive tree, the visible Church, before time, yet now could stand no longer on that old account, why? were they not the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> still, that stood without faith in the old visible Church to the very end of it? yes, but they believed not in their own persons, therefore could not stand in this house, but were cast out of their own olive, their own father <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> family, i. e. the visible Church, now Christ came in, because of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, and thou (saith <hi>Paul</hi> to the Gentile) standest, how? by fleshly descent? no, that standing is gone from such as come of <hi>Abrahams</hi> himself, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not to thee, nor to thine, but by faith, i. e. personal, and not pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentall.</p>
               <p>A Second this,
<q>
                     <p>If all they that are baptized into one visible body under the Gospell are made in the supper to drink into one spirit, then infants, who cannot drink into one spirit with the body, <hi>secundum te</hi> may not be baptized into that visible body.</p>
                     <p>But this is true <hi>1</hi> Cor. <hi>12.13.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore that.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So Col.</hi> 2.19. <hi>All the body is knit together, and by joints, and bands hath nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment ministred, and increaseth by that which every joint, and member sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth Eph.</hi> 4.16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But infants are not capable to have Spirituall nourishment Minstired, and to grow in grace, as all the body ought to do at least, and this in the use of the Supper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you say they are capable of spiritual nourishment, I say as capable I think as of the spiritual birth, for where theres a birth theres a growth, but then me thinks they should be as capable of the supper, which is the Sacrament of spirituall nourishment, being capable of that, as being capable of spiritual birth, they are of baptism the outward Sacrament of the same.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> denies that page 114.115. among other reasons for this, because <hi>though capable to be washed, yet not to eat bread, and drink wine in their first infancy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh strange! they may have it then as they can eat and drink.</p>
               <p>A third is this,
<q>
                     <p>If no infants were baptized and added to the first Gospell visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, then surely they had no right so to be, for the Apostles would not do them that wrong as not to add them that had right,</p>
                     <p>But this is true,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="453" facs="tcp:109011:235"/>Therefore that.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is plain out of <hi>Acts</hi> 2. where to the 120. men and women that without infants continued in fellowship <hi>Acts</hi> 1. there were added 3000. more in one day, and not one infant among them, but as many onely as gladly received the word, nor more nor lesse (for else <hi>Luke</hi> couzens us in his history) and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after their baptism in fellowship in breaking bread and prayers, which no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants did, and yet it is well nigh infallible, that those 3000 had some infants belonging to some of them, which would have been added with their parents, if <hi>the promise is to you, and to your children and them a far off, even as many as the Lord shall call</hi> would bear the sense divines drawes it to.</p>
               <p>Yea Master <hi>Cotton</hi> himself conceives that no infants were baptized at that time, and when else either these or any other were, neither I, not any one else ever found, since they began to read Christs Testament with their eyes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.</p>
               <p>Yea <hi>Peter</hi> commanded no more to be baptized but the same persons whom he speaks to also to repent, which me thinks he should have done, saying be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized every one of you, and baptize your children also, if any such thing had been intended, and Christians infants were to have been <hi>separated out of the world, and called to be saints, and baptized,</hi> as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> believes they are to be, but not I.</p>
               <p>For what saies <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> chapter 1. I suppose he wrote not to infants, yet to all the called Saints, to all that be in <hi>Rome</hi> called to be saints.</p>
               <p>So in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. the 23. <hi>If the whole Church come together, and all speak with tongues, and all Prophe-y.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So 26. <hi>Every one of you hath a Psalm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So 31. <hi>Ye may all prophecy one by ons that all may be edifyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He writes, and so surely he seems to me to do all his Epistles, to the whole church, and speaks to the whole body, yet I cannot conceive that to any infants, who are uncapable to be edifyed and comforted.</p>
               <p>Yea 1 Cor. 12.25.16. <hi>The Members of the visible body of Christ ought to have the same care one for another, so that if one Member suffer all the Members suffer with it, if one be honoured all rejoice with it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This cannot infants do,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore surely are not of this visible body of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another Argument which Master <hi>Baxter</hi> himself mentions, and slights, as simply supposing that it excludes infants from salvation, is that of Mr. <hi>Tombs viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the onely way now appointed by Christ to make visible church Members is by teaching the persons themselves, and that none else must be Members of the visible Church, but those that have learnt as infants have not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Argument is of great weight, and receives as trifling an answer from Mr. <hi>B</hi> for saith he, <hi>then it will much more follow that they are not, or at least that we may not judge them to be of the invisible Church at all i. e.</hi> to be such as so dying shall be saved.</p>
               <p>The contrary to which, and inconsequence of which I have shewed above and shall shew more by and by.</p>
               <p>Secondly (saith he) If <hi>they may argue from Matth. the</hi> 28.20. <hi>that none, but those that are taught are true Disciples, and are to be baptized, why may they not as well Argue from Mark the</hi> 16. <hi>chap.</hi> 16. <hi>verse, who ever believeth not shall be damned, that all infants are certainly damned</hi>?</p>

                  </gap> is teach them i. e. the Gospel, so none are here bid to be baptized, but the very same individual persons, that are bid also to be taught: first baptizing them, and after teaching them again, whom? those persons in the Nations whom they have taught onely, and not their infants; for we may as well say the men that they never taught, as them, since Christ hath <hi>in precepto</hi> conjoined teaching, or our discipling and baptizing together, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants cannot by our teaching of them be discipled visibly.</p>
               <p>The argument in its true form is this <hi>viz.</hi>

must not separate, i. e. in his practise.</p>
                     <p>But Christ hath conjoined our discipling persons and baptizing them in his commission, for baptizing, as a standing course to the end of the world as Mat. <hi>28.19.20.</hi> shews.</p>
                     <p>Ergo no man must separate these two in his practise.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>If Dr. <hi>Featley</hi> were alive to answer this he would happily say tis no Topical, but a Sophistical Syllogism, for when A. R. makes much what the like from <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16. <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <p>What God hath joined together no man ought to separate,</p>
                     <p>But faith and baptism God hath joined together Acts <hi>8.37.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ergo faith and baptism none ought to separate.</p>

               </p>
               <p>He saies theres a double falacy in it <hi>viz. homonimiae,</hi> or ambiguity in the premises i, e. in the termes <hi>joined together,</hi> for it may be meant saith he, either <hi>in precepto,</hi> and that no man denyeth, or <hi>insube<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ion must be true: but saith Dr. <hi>Feat.</hi> there is a fallacy called <hi>ignoratio elenchi</hi> in the conclusion i. e. it concludes not the thing in question, but that which is not denied by us, for they that are for baptizing of infants, do not separate faith and baptism, for they baptize children into their fathers faith saith he;</p>
               <p>Secondly they believe that infants of believers receive some hidden grace of faith in time of their baptizing, his followers say before baptism p. 3. of their pamphlet (oh how contrary are they each to other) therefore are to be baptized; but Mr. Ba. will say none of all this I hope, for he is against Baptismal regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, nor will he charge the syllogism with sophistry I hope, but deny either the <hi>Major,</hi> or the <hi>Minor,</hi> either of which if he do, he answers his own grand ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument against the seekers p. 341, where word for word (saving a term or two put in here for explication) this very syllogism is his own, or else he will grant both these, and consequently the conclusion to be true, and then why will he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense baptism to persons i. e. infants, before they so much as seem to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve?</p>
               <p>But it may be that which is a good syllogism, when used by himself, will be meer sophism with him too when urged by us:</p>
               <p>Secondly the reason why we may not argue that all infants are damned from <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. though they believe not, is this viz. because that place speaks of persons at years onely, to whom the Gospel is preached, and not of infants, that are not capable to believe.</p>
               <p>But then saies Mr. <hi>Ba. the same may be answered to the argument from Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>against infants being disciples, and to be baptized.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To whom I reply thus.</p>
               <p>First, if he saies (as we of <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16.) of <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>go teach all nations baptizing them,</hi> is meant of men at years onely, and not of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, then he grants as much as we desire, and confesses that Christ, in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to teach and baptize the nations, does not mean discipling and baptizing infants, but men, and if the commission to baptize extend not to infants, as the subject, then what warrant to baptize them?</p>
               <p>Secondly if that place be meant of men onely, and not of infants, then Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> was well busied the while, when he brings that very place in the very front of his plain Scripture proofs, for his infant membership and baptism, its ill stumbling at the very threshold.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="456" facs="tcp:109011:237"/>But I shall not multiply, nor improve as Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> hath done to the utmost, but give one argument more against infant membership, and so come to the other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <p>If all that can be said in proof of the visible Church-membership of infants may be disproved as weak, and inconsequent utterly to that purpose, then sure there is enough, if one would stand upon it, to be brought against it.</p>
                     <p>But all that is said by Mr. Ba. in his two dozen of arguments, who improves himself to the utmost to say as much as can be said in proof of the visible Church membership of infants, is well nigh already, and will be altogether by and by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved as weak and inconsequent.</p>
                     <p>Ergo there must needs be enough against it: for contradictoriorum uno nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to statuitur, probatur alterum.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>If all, that can be said on one side to the proof of this that infants ought to be members of the visible Church, will not avail to evince that to be the truth, then that infants ought not to be members of the visible Church of Christ is a thing will prove it self well enough.</p>
               <p>And so I have done with one member of my proposition, that I may say a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle also to the other, which is this viz.
<q>
                     <p>Though no infants have right in infancy to be baptized and joined to the visible Church, as I have already proved, yet all infants in their infancy are in a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble state of salvation.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> finds out or rather fancies to himself certain grounds whereupon to hope, that some dying infants are saved <hi>viz.</hi> some of the dying infants of the faithful, as in opposition to all the dying infants of the wicked, I say some of them, for he dares not say p. 78. that his own grounds yield a certainty, though a probability, of the salvation of all such neither, so doth he narrow up the grace of God to that innocent age of infancy, for all he would seem so merciful as to plead its cause against those cruel conceits which he conceives are conceived of it amongst us, yet he finds no good ground whereupon to hope the salvation of the dying infant of any godly man, but the same on which he conceives them of nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity to that salvation to have also a right to membership in the visible Church, but such a necessary dependance of them each on other, that suppose one to be no member, at least in no visible right to membership in the visible Church, of that person, so dying, there can be harboured no hope at all of his salvation: but what if I can make it good from one of those very grounds of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> own bringing that theres a ground to hope the salvation of one such dying infant, as of whom it is most palpably evident, that it was neither actually a member of the visible Church before it died, nor so much as in any visible right to membership in the visible Church if it had lived? Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> will then I hope let go his wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conceit of a necessity of dying infants membership in order to our having hopes of their salvation.</p>
               <p>And in order to the making good of this, I instance in the very same child, which himself brings in as his fifth ground page 77. and alludes to, as his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the contrary <hi>viz.</hi> the child that <hi>David</hi> had by <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> while she was yet the wife <hi>Vriah,</hi> of whom I testifie the very same that Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> does <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Davids</hi> comforting himself concerning his dead child, because he should go to the child, but the child not return to him, was an evident argument that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was confident that that child of his should not be damned, and yet he could not hope so upon any such account as his childs dying a member of the visible Church, for the child never lived so much as to the 8th day, nor to be circumcis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thereby entred into the visible Church, for its plain 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.18. that it died on the 7th. and if Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> say it was a member <hi>de jure,</hi> though not <hi>de facto</hi> i. e. in a right to have been a member had it lived, I deny that with as
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:109011:237"/>
much confidence as the other, for a bastard was not to be admitted into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the Lord unto the tenth generation, and its evident that that child was a bastard.</p>
               <p>I conclude therefore contrary to that round Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> runs about in like a horse in a mill, making a necessary concatenation between being in visible right to Church-membership, and in a visible state of salvation, proving the one by the other, concluding sometimes, that infants of believers are chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Gospel promise, &amp; so visibly in a state of salvation, &amp; therfore they must be baptized and in churcht, or else they could not, and others may not, sometimes that infants of believers are in visible right to be admitted into the visible Church, and therefore we may have sound ground to hope their salvation, so dying, as denying their right to membership we could not have, and of other infants we cannot, I conclude I say that there may be sound ground whereon to hope the salvation of some dying infants, that dye without actual membership in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, or visible Church of Christ, and without any right to it also in their infancy had they lived longer.</p>
               <p>And if we may hope well of some infants that dy without membership, and without right to it also, I know not why we may not hope the like of all, for all Mr. <hi>Baxs.</hi> impropriating the unlimited and boundlesse grace of God, and ingros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing all hope of the salvation of dying infants, to the dying infants of none but faithful parents, specially considering, besides what grounds more of my own I shall add in proof of it by and by, two more at least of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> own grounds whereon to hope the salvation of believers infants are grounds, whereon to hope the salvation of other dying infants as well as them, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures he refers to for them speaking, if of infants at all, then of the whole <hi>species,</hi> of the whole kind of that Stature called infants, and not of infants of one kind more then another.</p>
               <p>For first whereas his 6th ground for the salvation of believers dying infants, and of being without any fear of their damnation is this <hi>viz.</hi> because it is said <hi>Psal.</hi> 127.3.4.5. <hi>children are the heritage of the Lord, and the fruit of the womb his reward</hi> &amp;c. if that be spoken of infants at all, as it seems rather to be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of children that are grown up, that are the strength of their father and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, it is surely spoken of all infants as well as some, and he that particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes that indefinit term of children, and the fruit of the womb, where ever the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture speaks hopefully of such, so as to understand it universally to expresse, and sound forth no more then those individualls <hi>viz.</hi> the seed of believing parents (and yet thus Mr. <hi>B i.</hi> muzzles up all such Scriptures, and makes them sound no more then he would have them) doth little lesse then force the word to his own fancy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas his 13th ground is from <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.10. where he argues thus,</p>
               <p>If <hi>little ones have their angels beholding the face of God in heaven then they shall be saved, for that is a mercy peculiar to the people of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I argue that if little ones litterally taken (i. e. if infants be there meant, as he saies, but never shewes, they are (saving <hi>per alios</hi> and not <hi>per se</hi>) then surely all infants as well as some, for he speaks not there of the little ones of believing parents in special, but of what kind of little ones soever he speaks, he speaks of that kind of little ones in general without exception, whether it be of infants, or of his disciples, and if yet it must needs be understood of infants onely, that they shall be saved, it is understood universally of them, and so much Mr. Ba. might have seen, and would have said had he consulted the 14. verse, but just below where it is thus said of all little ones that are lost, and so of all as well as some, <hi>viz. it is not the will of your heavenly father that one of these little ones shall perish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And sith Mr. <hi>B.</hi> so <hi>suches</hi> it out below p. 104 105. &amp;c. from <hi>Mark</hi> 10.14.15. saying that of <hi>such is the kingdome of Heaven</hi> must needs be meant, <hi>viz. by kingdome of Heaven salvation,</hi> which I grant, and by such (as ile grant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:109011:238"/>
at this time however, sith thence I shall have another Argument <hi>ad hominem</hi> to give hope by of the salvation of all dying infants) not such as are like infants, but infants themselves, and that not of those individuals onely that were then brought, which whether they were children of believing parents or no too is more then Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ere can demonstrate, there being many that came to Christ for heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of themselves or theirs, as tis most evident that these did, of whom not more then one of ten were as they should be, for of 10 leapets clensed where were the nine?</p>
               <p>I say not of those individuals onely, but of the very <hi>species</hi> of infants, yea how oft ore and ore and ore again does he inculcate this upon us in that place, saying, it was the <hi>species</hi> of infants, the very <hi>species,</hi> infants in <hi>specie,</hi> and not those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, whom Christ saies the kingdome of heaven, i. e. salvation doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to, I appeal to Mr. <hi>Bs</hi>. own conscience, whether there be not out of his own mouth a strong Argument of hope, if not of assurance from Christ himself that the whole <hi>species</hi> of infants, so dying, i. e. all infants, and not some onely shall be saved: for the <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pecies</hi> of infants expresses not some infants onely but all infants, or infants <hi>quâ tales,</hi> so that <hi>quatenus ipsum</hi> evermore including <hi>de omni,</hi> whatever belongs to infants <hi>inspecie</hi> i. e. to the kind or to infants as such belongs to all infants, <hi>quod convenit homini,</hi> purely <hi>qua est homo, convenit omni homini</hi> and so what ever belongs to any thing, as tis such, belongs also to all that is such.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> teaches us the truth in this, that the kingdome of heaven and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion belongs by Revelation from Christ himself to infants, not in <hi>individuo</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, i. e. not to those infants onely that were then brought to Christ, nor any other, but to the kind, to infants <hi>in specie</hi> i. e. all infants as infants, therefore the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven and salvation belongs to them all, and so did that kind of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Christs person, while he was on earth, with infants, not for, nor by baptism, but for healing, belong to all infants that needed it as well as some, that were then on earth, as comming to Christ with infants by prayer to him to help and heal them, in whatever malady, since his person is absent, belongs to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants in the world, and not to believers infants onely; and yet not baptism, and a standing in fellowship in the visible Church, for they indeed are not fit for fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
               <p>Therefore though Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> contracts the grace of God to infants, as concerning their everlasting salvation into little a little corner, yea good lord how few dying infants does he hope shal be saved, that hath hope of none but of some i. e. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers infants, which are but one of many, and also not of all, but onely some of them? yet (to conclude this in a way of resemblance to Mr. B<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. conclusion of his Argument from <hi>Mark</hi> 10. p. 107.) I blesse the Lord Jesus Christ King of the Church, though he gave no order to baptize, and in church infants here on earth yet for having a greater tendernesse towards the eternal state of all dying infants, then Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is yet aware of, and towards all that live to years such a tendernesse as to invite them to himself universally, and bid them wel-come, and so great a care to inform his Church in his Word and Gospel concerning his good will to all men, and to all infants also in that particular, so as to speak it so plainly, that plain minded men, that are not minded never to change their minds, as I hope Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is not, may well see his mind in this case, even as if he had therefore done this, because he foresaw that some would arise so carnally, and so cruely conceited, as to suppose it impossible to be, and but in vain to hope it almost, that Gods saving mercy should extend to any more dying infants then those few, and not all those few neither, of their own: and for my part I gladly accept Christs information, and submit to his discovery, let them resist it that dare.</p>
               <p>And lastly, one more Argument of hope that I have within my self that all dying infants must needs be saved, is this yet, because I could never find since I lookt for it, as also none ever shall that look not without

their eyes, what should, nor what (save the Priesthoods divine kind of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine) does damn them, I mean any of them so dying, any more then one of them.</p>
               <p>First as for sin, which onely damnes, I know none they have of their own, and to say that any infant dyes eternally for theiniquity of his father only, makes the word of God, which is truth it self, no better then a flat falsehood to me, who read in <hi>Ieremy</hi> 31.29.30. <hi>&amp; Ezek.</hi> 18.3.4.19.20. <hi>&amp; Deut.</hi> 24.16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 14.16. that the waies of God who requires it strictly of man, not to put the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to death for the sins of the father, but every man only for his own sin, are so equal, for all the false accusation of him by the wicked Jewes, that seeing he both saies, and also swears it, that men shall never have occasion to say, the <hi>childs teeth are edged by the grapes the father only hath eaten,</hi> and in way of complaint for injustice, <hi>doth not the son bear the iniquity of the Father</hi>? but that every soul that dies shall dy for his own iniquity onely, and that individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al soul onely that sinneth shall dy, i. e. eternally, for temporally tis true we all dy in <hi>Adam,</hi> as far as a to temporal death, God may, and often doth visit the sins of the Father on the children to the third and fourth generation of such as hate him not onely when children inherit, so as to imitate their fathers hatred of God, in which case only tis a punishment to those children, but also on infants, so as to take them out of the world with the fathers: as in the case of <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biram, Amaleck, Hittites, Amorites &amp;c.</hi> yea <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and the old world, on which for ensamples sake to them that in after times should live ungodly, the flood, and the fire fell, not onely temporal but eternal to the adult ones that gave themselves over to fornication and followed strange flesh, though but temporal only to infants, who neither lived ungodly, nor gave themselves o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to fornication as the other did, and therefore though passing hence with the rest to a temporal death by that fire, yet are not set forth as an ensample with the rest to all that should live ungodly, by suffering the vengeance of eternal fire 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Iude</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>But the same temporal death that may be in fury to one, as tis a passage to worse, may be a mercy to another, and so to those infants a passage from worse to better, as good <hi>Iosiah</hi> was slain in battell, as well as wicked <hi>Ahab,</hi> and that for going on his own head to war as well he, yet was it in respect of that eternall state that followed, as well for him, as ill for <hi>Ahab.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sith therefore its said so plainly the son shall not die for the iniquity of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yet temporally they may be taken away with the father, it must needs be meant that eternally none die, nor lye for ever under wrath for no more then meerly the fathers fault, whereupon all dying infants having no trangression of their own, cannot be damned for their own, nor yet for their father <hi>Adams</hi> trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, and so are all, as well as those of believers, in a visible state of salvation, and while they live infants, unlesse hereafter they reject it, as <hi>Esau</hi> did the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> in visible right to so dying to the heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly as for righteousnesse theres enough in Christ to take away, it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, what ever unrighteousnesse is imputed for <hi>Adams</hi> sin, and why that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse should not be imputed, if the Scripture had not said it so plainly as it does <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19.21. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. to all poor dying innocent infants
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:109011:239"/>
as well as some, I cannot imagine, unlesse you say not God the fathers love to all, but man the fathers faith, is that thing that must save some of those infants of believers, that are savd, by interesting that fruit of his body in the righteousnesse of Christ, as well as himself, for the taking away the sin of his soul, which faith a father wanting, the child shall perish for ever in default out, and yet be in no fault in the world about it:</p>
               <p>Alas poor infants indeed, that descend from such parents as believe not, if it be so, that that the fathers faith onely does interest the infant in Christ, their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, the first <hi>Adam</hi> by his sin unawares to them damned them say they, and say I, if it did, theres righteousnesse enough in the heavenly father, and the second <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> to save them, but because not they themselves, for they have no more ability so to do then a new born infant hath to dresse its naked body, but their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers put it not on by faith for themselves, and theirs, which if the dying infants might live to years, as Christ said of <hi>Sodom,</hi> they happily would do, therefore mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of these poor innocents must perish: so then belike it is thus, and this is the covenant of the Gospel, the fathers faith saves him, and all his dying infants, and the fathers sin of unbelief damnes for ever not himself onely, but all his dying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants also.</p>
               <p>All infants that are damned then, are damned through the fault of two unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py fathers, a remote father for sinning, and and immediate father for not believing, between which two the love of the heavenly father cannot come at them: a wise man may spend all he hath with looking, but never find such as this in all the Scripture: earthly inheritances are oft stated, and removed to and from posterity for fathers faith, and faults, as all <hi>Abrahams</hi> posterity by <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> did enjoy <hi>Canaan,</hi> and <hi>Esaus</hi> lost it, but the eternal inheritance is neither won nor lost by the children, through the faith or unbelief of the parents: and besides if <hi>Adams</hi> sin, though a remote parent, doth so damnifie all infants, that the righteousnesse of Christ cannot save them, without the fathers faith, me thinks he being their great grand father, <hi>Adams</hi> faith should recover him and all his, at least from that guilt his sin brought upon them; by interessing them in Christs righteousnesse, as well as his single unbelief at first destroyed them, if any fathers faith shall entitle his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to salvation; or else God seems not to be so prone to mercy as severity, yea indeed he that saies God is not more prone to severity then to mercy, and shewes it no other way, as to his dealing with innocent infants, then by saying he saves no more dying of infants then those few, i. e. some of the dying infants of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and from the Mothers womb damns eternally all the rest, may say over that his creed in my hearing 500 times and ten, before I shall learn to believe it after him once.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as to threatnings of damnation I find none at all to infants in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>infancy, from one end of the book of God to the other, but all that ever is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as concerning eternal wrath, the second death, everlasting damnation, the Lake of fire, is declared as the portion of those onely that do, and do not that, which was never at all, much lesse in order to salvation, and on pain of eternal fire enjoined by infants either to be done, or forborn: yea this is the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and nothing else that I know of, that light more or lesse comes to persons, and they love darknesse more then light because their deeds are evil, those that Christ speaks nothing at all to, as he does to heathens themselves <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. but not to infants, that yet know not the right hand from the left, much lesse either good or evil, they have not sin, for sin is the transgression of that law, that is lent us to live by, whether a law within onely, or without also <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. but when he hath spoken and they obey not, when they know God, and glorify him not as God, then they are without excuse, and have no cloak at all for their sin: and the word he hath spoken to every one, being rejected that same word shall judge him at the last day.</p>

               <p>In a word the whole body of the new Testament or covenant in the promissory, praeceptory, and minatory parts of it (saving some two or three such gentle touches about infants, as those above named, whereby we may have hopes that none of them dying such, are for ever lost) was written and given to, and concerning men and women, and not infants, to declare unto them the way of everlasting salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in what wayes God would and would not accept of them, and he that with an unprejudiced spirit observes all this will trouble himself no more about his infants to in church and baptize them for remission of sins, which is the prime use of baptism to sinners, and utterly lost when di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As for <hi>Iacobs being Lovd before he was born</hi> (he means in contradistinction to <hi>Esau</hi>) <unclear>w <hi rend="sup">c</hi>h</unclear> is Mr. <hi>B<hi rend="sup">s</hi>.</hi> tenth ground of hope that believers infants are from the womb in a hopeful way, I suppose he takes it to be so declared, but is miserably mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, if he think the ninth of the <hi>Romans</hi> saies so, for tis true the elder shall serve the younger, which relates to the posterity of those two, and not their persons (for <hi>Esau</hi> was mostly Jacobs Lord) was said before they were born by God, who foreseeing it might easily foretell how it should be and did so too, but for the words <hi>Iacob have I loved, Esau have I hated,</hi> as they also were spoken of the two Nations, that came out of their loines viz. the <hi>Edomites</hi> and <hi>Israelites,</hi> and that not without respect to <hi>Edoms</hi> being the border of wickednesse, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But if it were just as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> understands it, that before they were born, and without any respect to their personal rebellion, and obedience in time it had been said <hi>Iacob</hi> have I loved, <hi>Esau</hi> have I hated, would it prove that article in Mr. B<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. creed that God hath promised to be merciful to Godly mens seed in general, in contradistinction to the seed of the wicked? in no wise, I suppose, since as god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as <hi>Isaac</hi> was, even one of his Sons was hated from the womb; if Mr. B. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit

were true, aswel as the other of them from the womb beloved: but surely had not <hi>Esau</hi> sinned and set so light by the heavenly blessing, he had not lost it, much less if he had dyed from the womb.</p>
               <p>Fourthly as for the universallity of redemption which is by Jesus Christs dying, as Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> saies t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And lastly to conclude my answer to this 22 Argument of Mr. B. which I have insisted the longer on, in much hope of helping him to a better hope of all dying infants, that neither are, nor are to be added to the visible church, whereas I was once set upon by a Gentleman with this objection, who if ever this book came to his hands, and this passage to his eye, will remember it, though I forbear to name him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Viz. Obj.</hi> If we may be assured of the salvation of all our dying infants, we may then in love to them knock them on the head in their infancy, and so be sure to prevent their perishing by condemnation.</p>
               <p>I intreat that Gentleman to beware of so much as saying, that we may do such gross evil that so great good may come thereof, least his damnation for it be just, and then what little benefit will accrue to him all men may judge, that to save his infant damnes himself.</p>
               <p>Theres but four Arguments of M.Bs. behind brought in proof of the right of membership to infants whereof two, <hi>viz.</hi> his 24th and 26th are the one from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. the other from <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.13.14.15. Two Scriptures that I have talkt on so much in the book above, and given the genuine sense of, that I shall but tautologize to speak particularly to them again, seeing I see nothing new taken notice of in them by Mr B. but what is abundantly answered in effect above, where I have shewed the abrogation in Christ of that birth holinesse he means, and the uncleannesse consequently opposite thereunto, so that theres no man however born, though a <hi>barbarian,</hi> can be called, in opposition to others, as by birth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by nature a sinner in that ceremonial sense, from <hi>Act</hi> 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. yea M.B. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses p. 81. the <hi>Common sense of holinesse was one and the same in all, i. e. Priests and Levites under the Law &amp;c. Temple, Altar, Sacrifices,</hi> children of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and believing yoak fellowes <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>separation to God,</hi> so then if that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse of Priests, Temple, &amp;c. was ceremonial, so this is, and if that holinesse is abolished in all other things, why abiding onely the seed?</p>
               <p>I have also proved that the other place, where it is not evident that the infants brought to Christ were ever baptized by his disciples, or any other, doth more deeply disprove infan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s-baptism and membership, then all the places ever brought by Mr. B. are capable to prove or make good either.</p>
               <p>Yea as good a man might have said, as send me to those two places for infant-baptism, you may find it if you look in the bible.</p>
               <p>Ile say no more therefore to them.</p>
               <p>His other two viz. the 23th and 25 hare both as he confesses but probable, and and by and by will appear not to be so much;</p>
               <p>His first is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If an Infant were head of the Church then infants may be members.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Christ an infant was head of the Church,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That cannot be half so much, as a probable Argument, whose premises are
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:109011:240"/>
neither of them true, yet such is the syllogism here brought by Mr. <hi>B.</hi> both the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of which I deny, his consequence is true indeed, that infants may be members, if an infant were the head, i. e<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are capable out, supposing Gods will that it should be so now in the Gospel, which a man may suppose if he will, but shall never find to be so in his word; nor does his curious crotchet out of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> that <hi>Christ went through every age to sanctify it unto us,</hi> prove the other to be a truth, for theres no truth at all in it self, yea tis <hi>falsum per falsius,</hi> for Christ did not passe through every age of man, that he might sanctify that age, for he lived not to any old age here, though now he that was dead is alive again for evermore, for his life was soon cut off from the earth.</p>
               <p>And as concerning his headship in his infancy, I admire a man of wisedome should assert it, for to say nothing how little this agrees with that above page 62. where he saies <hi>tis disputable whether ever Christ was a Churchmember proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or no,</hi> (as if the head, because the principal that rules the rest, were no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at all of the body) tis evident to me that as man he had not any of his Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives settled actually upon him, till after he had purchased them by his death; he was perfect first through sufferings <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. and after his death and resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction he was made Lord and Christ <hi>Acts.</hi> 2. And exalted highly above all <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. and set far above all principality, and given to be head over all things to his Church which is his body <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover to me there is as much force in it, if Christ had been head of the Church in his infancy, and much more then in Mr. <hi>Bs</hi>. to argue thus, if Christ the head of the Church, that was circumcised in his infancy, yet was not baptized till he came to years, then, though under the Law the circumcised were circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in their infancy, yet under the Gospel none are to be baptized till they come to years.</p>
               <p>His 25th runs thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the Scripture frequently, and plainly tell us of the ceasing of circumcision, but never at all of the Churchmembership of infants, then though circumcision be ceased, yet we are not to judge their membership to be ceased.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>but &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is so far from a demonstration, that its not a Topical but Sophistical Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logism, in which there is <hi>fallacia homonomiae,</hi> or ambiguity in the middle term <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Scripture tells us,</hi> which may be taken for an expresse, or for an implicit tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or having a word for a thing, yet one of his propositions will be false let him understand it how he will, for if by the Scripture telling us, and having a word for it, he means an expresse telling of the cessation of membership <hi>in totidem ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis,</hi> a <hi>Syllabical</hi> word given out of that particular by name, then his consequence is false, for it follows not because there is not an expresse particular prohibition in the New Testament for the cessation of things, that were under the old, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not ceased, for so we shall make most of the types and ceremonies, among which infant membership was one, as I have shewed, to remain in force still as well as that, as the dedication of the first born, and many others, the ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of which is not so syllabically spoken of.</p>
               <p>But if he mean an implicit prohibition, or word for the cessation of Churchmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bersh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>p of infants, which is enough, then there is prohibition enough, yea the very command for the cessation of circumcision of infants any more <hi>Act.</hi> 21.21. vertually is a command to cease inchurching of infants, for the very end and intent of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision was the inchurching of infants thereby, which thing was formally done then by circumcision, besides circumcision ceasing, the whole law ceased with it, the whole of which he was a debtor to keep that was circumcised, also <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.12. tis sayd summarily thus <hi>viz.</hi> that the priesthood i. e. of that testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being changed, there must be of necessity a change also of the law.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="464" facs="tcp:109011:241"/>And so I have done with all his arguments for the church-membership of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, which is the second <hi>medium,</hi> and next to that of discipleship, by which he would prove but cannot, infant baptism.</p>
               <p>His third <hi>medium</hi> which he onely names, and handles not, therefore I shall do the like in speaking to it, is drawn from the duty of parents to engage their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants solemnly to God in Covenant, and runs thus <hi>viz. if it be the duty of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian parents solemnly to devote their children to God in covenant, then they ought to do it in baptism, but &amp;c.</hi> therefore.</p>
               <p>He proves his <hi>Minor</hi> from the practise of the old Testament, from the duty of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents then, from which time, as to that particular of dedicating, and solemn enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of their children, it will not follow to our doing the like in all respects now as they did, for then we must thus dedicate our first born, and that doth of man and beast.</p>
               <p>His consequence is also false of his <hi>Major</hi> proposition, for I may devote my children in a gospel sense to God according to my duty, I mean ingage my self to the Lord to bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, and also devote them to him in prayer, i. e. give them up to him as his right, and to him to teach by his word, and his spirit, when they come to years, and sundry other wayes, and yet no necessity of doing any of this in baptism.</p>
               <p>But I shall make this as short as he does himself, and gather up the sum of what he hath said <hi>viz. infants are disciples, visible Church-members, and to be so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly engaged to God in Covenant as a holy seed &amp;c.</hi> therefore are to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, denying now the consequence, as to him, as I did the antecedent before, which I have been all this while in disproving.</p>
               <p>For, <hi>Ad hominem,</hi> so long as he argues for baptism to be after the manner of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, the consequence will not follow, if this were as true as tis false, that infants are now disciples, Church-members, and a holy seed, and in covenant, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they must be baptized; for women under the Covenant whereof circumcision was a sign, were both disciples, and visible Church-members, and a holy people in the sense of the Covenant, and dedicated to God in Covenant as well as males, and yet not then circumcised, and why? <hi>viz.</hi> for want of a commission to do it, and the like I say now of infants if they were, as twill never be proved while the world stands, that they are disciples, in right to visible membership, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his sense, and to be ingaged &amp;c. yet of necessity it followes not they must be baptized, unlesse there be some command or commission for it, which no man ever shall find in the word of Christ; all the rest of his arguments wherein he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to disprove the practise of baptizing naked, and baptizing children of Christians of age, as I have shewed above, are <hi>ignoratio elenchi</hi> a dispute besides our practise, for we do not so, therefore though I see some grosse absurdity in them all, yet Ile meddle no more with them here.</p>
               <p>Thus I have done with both that subject of rantizing, which partly at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of you <hi>Ashford</hi> disputants I was ingaged in at the end of your <hi>Review,</hi> and partly by that meer demi-reformation that is made in this point of baptism by a party of men in <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi> and elsewhere, (of whom I suppose there are several congregations) who having long since discovered the true way of baptism, as to the subject, <hi>viz.</hi> that professing believers onely, and not any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are to be baptized, but remaining ignorant of the true way and form of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of that ordinance are fallen into a frivolous way of sprinkling belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, which to do is as much no baptism at all, as to dip infants in no baptism of Christs ordaining: which people, for whose sakes as well as others I write this, will be perswaded I hope in time to be, as to the outward form, not almost onely, but altogether Christians, and rest no longer in that meer midway mongril reformation. I have done also with this book of Mr. <hi>Baxs</hi> for infant baptism, the weak argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of which for it were enough, if I had no more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to convince me of the error of

               </gap>nances of the Lord Jesus: and herein as I shall be plain, using no other form, method and order then what the Lord gives into me as I write, so I must be brief, the foregoing part of this volume having risen already unawares to a far greater magnitude then was meant to the whole, when I first cast the bulk of it in my mind, and there remaining also some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing yet to speak, and I know not well how much, to the Priests concerning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, in way of return to the last piece of that pedobaptistical pamphlet which was pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> forth by who knowes? or rather by who knows not whom? in order to the plainer disquisition of the truth in this question <hi>viz. whether the ordinances of Christ, that were in use of old, are of right to be practised still</hi>? as there are four services, then in use, the necessary use of which is now denied <hi>viz. baptism in water, laying on of hands, breaking of bread, and church-fellowship,</hi> so I shall addresse my self to prove the practise of these four severally to stand, even <hi>de jure</hi> till the second coming of Christ, which is yet to come.</p>
            <p>And because <hi>baptism in water,</hi> though most strenuously denyed by many to be so much as lawfull to be either dispensed, or submitted to, and by many even of those that have submitted to it to be necessary, or any other then a matter of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency, is yet the first in order to be practised, and that without, or before which we are not once to meddle with the other, I therfore propound it as the first in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be proved, and in order to the proof of at least the lawfulnesse thereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such as say its sinful (for this will be included in the other) I shall by the help of God prove a necessity of it, against such as judge it needlesse or superfluous, and by several Scriptures shew it to be such a service, the present performance of which is so far from being sinful, that it is no lesse then sin and rebellion against Christ himself to leave it unperformed.</p>
            <p>The Scripture which I shall most directly make use of to this purpose, and lay as the very <hi>basis,</hi> and foundation of this businesse, and make as a certain <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Topick <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>First, we find <hi>Christ</hi> pleading that absolute power, which was given him by the father to be the <hi>Soveraign Lord, and Supream Lawgiver</hi> to the whole world thorowout all nations and generations of it from thenceforth even to the end; in these words <hi>viz. All power is given unto me both in heaven and in earth</hi> i. e. I am he to whom this prerogative is granted to give out to all men what laws and rules they shall be guided, and governd by, what wayes they must walk in in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to that eternal salvation, which as a <hi>Priest</hi> I have purchased them to by my own blood, if ever they mean to attain it, I am that Prophet, <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts.</hi> 3.22.</note>which the Lord hath raised up unto all people now, instead of <hi>Moses,</hi> who was the faithful gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver out of Gods will, mind, or Testament to Israel of old, whose voice all must now hearken to in all things, what ever I say unto them, and whoever harkneth not to me, shall be cut off from among the people: <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Is.</hi> 55.4.</note> behold God hath given me for a witnesse to the people, a <hi>leader</hi> and <hi>commander</hi> unto the people.</p>
            <p>Secondly, After he had thus shewed his authority, and commission from God to be the only Lawgiver, whereby to summnon the sons of men to so much the strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er attention to him, he next begins to act according thereunto, to act like him self, to make out his mind to his disciples concerning them and all men most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely, and plainly about this matter of <hi>water baptism,</hi> and to give order to them both when, and to whom, both in what time and to what subjects they should dispense it, and likewise both how, and for how long he would have the nations (as by command from himself, commissionating his disciples so to teach them) to practise the same dispensation of <hi>water baptism</hi>; in the two following verses. <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out therefore teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son

                  </gap>o I am with you alwaies even to the end of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where note first in general three things.</p>
            <p>First, That he gives order to his disciples to teach the nations, and baptize them in <hi>water in his name</hi> ver. 19. <hi>going out teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father, son and holy spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, that whatever order is given out by Christ to his disciples, concerning this businesse of <hi>water baptism,</hi> as to the order of its administration, and the term of its continuance, the very same and no other doth Christen join his disciples to give out to the disciples, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat should be successively in all nations, to be observed as his will concerning them v. 20. <hi>teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, that what ever he gives out as his will concerning both them and the disciples in the nations that they should make, he gives out as his standing will and Testament to them, and their standing duty to him in all ages of the world as well as that, even to the very end thereof, in these words v. 20. <hi>and lo I am with you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies i. e.</hi> in the observation of these things I command you, <hi>to the end of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly more particularly yet, let it be observed what Arguments in particular do most naturaly arise hence in proof of the continuance of <hi>water baptism</hi> by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>command from Christ to this very day, and that from several clauses and passages of this Scripture severally considered.</p>
            <p>First from these words <hi>Go ye out therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name &amp;c.</hi> it is very evident to the utter confutation not onely of those who are for infant baptism, as is shewed above, but also of those that are now for no water baptism at all, that our lord Christ expressely enjoines these two things, <hi>viz</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That all those whom his disciples presume to baptize in his name shall be first taught by them or made disciples, i. e. preached to or instructed in the Gospel till they learn and believe it. <note n="*" place="margin">for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That all those whom his disciples do teach till they have learnt the Gospell, or by preaching to them have converted to faith in his name shall in his name like wise be baptized, so inseperable hath Christ made these two <hi>viz.</hi> discipling and baptizing, believing and baptizing in his will and Testament to us, that as he would have no creature in the nations be baptized without precedent teaching and believing, so he would have no creature that is instructed till he believes to go unbaptized; whereupon in one and the same word of command he requires both, neither can any one abstract either from the other (without such violation to the will and Testament of Christ, confirmd by his blood, which wo be to that man, or angel that disanulleth in the least particular) so as to take upon him to give a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration to persons either to be baptized before believing, or to content themselves with belief only without baptism.</p>
            <p>But first as expresse as tis the mind of Christ that one of these should be done so expresse it is that the other should be done, and each in its proper order.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as clear as it is that these are commanded to be done by the very persons he then spake to viz that they should teach and baptize, so clear it is that the very same is commanded to be done in all nations, and among all people by such persons as should be discipled by them in these words <hi>v.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, and as long as twas his mind the one should be used <hi>viz.</hi> teaching and believing, so long twas his mind that the other should continue, <hi>viz.</hi> baptizing and being baptized, and that was that they should all abide in force to the very end of the world.</p>

            <p>In this very manner and form of words, word for word (little heeding how while he declines the gulf of no-baptism, he runs against the rock, and makes shipwrack of his infant baptism by the shift, and at once breaks the neck of all his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for it) doth Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> argue against these new No-baptists in p. 341. of his <hi>Plain Scripture-lesse proofs for infants Church-membership and baptism</hi>: whereby verily as he wounds both himself to death, and all those that together with him do plead for the baptizing of such subjects, as they never teach <hi>viz.</hi> infants whom themselves must needs acknowledge to be uncapable of conversion by their instruction, so all those likewise that plead for the teaching of all nations still, and preaching of the Gosel to every creature, and yet plead against any more bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of them in water, who are converted to the faith by preaching; who tear the Testament of the Lord Christ to pieces, and take what of it will serve their own easie turnes, and reject what of it is more tedious to the flesh, as the way of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ordinances is, specially that ordinance of water baptism, as a businesse long since abolished and out of date, as being ended almost as soon as instituted, as bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, as meer bodily exercise, that profiteth little or nothing, as but indifferent at most, and so may be done, and yet as well be let alone, as a low weak thing, as a foolish matter to make such ado about, as needlesse for every one to submit to or make use of, as that which some can live as well without as with &amp;c. as if Christ Jesus was a fool (for so all those do say in figures, though not in words at length) to invent such foolish instruments, to appoint such simple tooles to be used in his house, such earthen vessels, such vessels as are not honourable enough, nor fit in their conceit for the masters use, or for any thing but to be thrown aside, as out of date, and not worthy to be now meddled with any more: to which high Notionists, who camaelion like live up aloft, and yet feed on nothing but the meer air of their own high flown fancies, I must needs say thus much here, before I come to the other argument <hi>viz.</hi> that as wise and strong as they reckon upon themselves to be, so that they can live to God and thrive toward salvation as well without baptism, or any other ordinance as those that use it, and as poor pieces of business as they deem these to be, and unworthy of their condescension to them, as smal, despis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, homely and earthen as they are in their eyes, <note n="d" place="margin">For these I speake to now and not to such as are shy of the use of Christs or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances on an other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>viz.</hi> a wretched con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of such worth and weightinesse in them, that no men in the world are now found fit to meddle with them, or are admitted by Christ to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strators of them, for both these wayes doth the devil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive men by to erre from the plain way of Christs truth.</note> yet they are of such precious and heavenly consequence as may well challenge a right of continuance to the end, yea they are no lesse then the power of God <note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 1.18.

            </p>
            <p>And to prove it to be no matter of meer indifferency, but of duty to all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, I argue yet further from the forenamed Scripture thus.</p>

               <hi>That which is positively commanded to be done, and dispenst to all persons, when once discipled, without exception of any, and without the least intimation of a dispensation from Christ to any to omit it, is not a matter of meer indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but of absolute duty among all those persons that are so discipled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But baptism is positively commanded to be dispensed to all persons when once discipled, without exception of any, and without the least intimation of a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation from Christ to any to omit it, yea I may say as positively commanded to be dispensed to disciples as persons are commanded to be taught, discipled or to repent and believe the Gospel, and that is so positively that he that knowing it to be Christs will concerning him submits not to it, obeyes not Christ in it, shall be damned. Ergo baptism is no matter of meer indifferency but of absolute du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to all believers, or disciples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is most undeniable: the <hi>Minor</hi> also is most expresse and obvious to every eye in the text it self, where its said (in one intire sentence by way of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive command concerning both these) <hi>teach all Nations baptizing them,</hi> i. e. all them that are taught and made disciples: and not onely in this Scripture but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in several other, which I may alledge very subservient unto this as to the proof of the second proposition. The first whereof is <hi>Act.</hi> 22.16. <hi>and row why tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riest thou? arise and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord,</hi> where it is not a little worth our noting in this case, that <hi>Ananias</hi> doth not onely in one and the same sentence command <hi>Paul</hi> to be baptized as stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly,
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:109011:244"/>
as to call on the name of the Lord, but also checks him in a certain round reproof, and angry expostulation, for his lingring, and delaying in this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which he could not rationally have done if it had been, no neglect of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in <hi>Paul</hi> to be tardy to it, and a matter of no necessity, but of such indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that twas, without danger of incurring divine dispeasure, at <hi>Pauls</hi> choice whether he would be baptized yea or no.</p>
            <p>The second is <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. the first place, wherein we read of any practising according to that commission that Christ gives out in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. that being indeed the first time of its beginning to be put in execution, by <hi>Peter</hi> and the rest, who, being impowred so to do, in obedience thereunto went forth and preached repentance, faith, and baptism for remission of sins among all nations (<hi>pro suo modulo</hi>) beginning at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as also they were required to do <hi>Luke</hi> 24.47. in which Scripture (I mean <hi>Acts</hi> 2.) to a people enquiring what they should do we find <hi>Peter</hi> preaching positively thus <hi>viz. repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Iesus Christ for remission of sins &amp;c.</hi> where note that as he joines repentance and water baptism together, so in one and the same precept and word of command he enjoines them both together to be practised as the mind of Christ, and that to every one then, and there present, that had not yet perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med these services, without exempting any one of all those thousands he then spake to one jot more from the practise of baptism, then of repentance it self, which phrase, <hi>viz. Repent, and be baptized every one of you &amp;c.</hi> he could not warrantably have delivered himself in unto them in the name of Christ, if he had not had clear commission from him by way of precept to impose baptism on all men as the mind of Christ concerning them, and a duty to be practised by them all as well as repentance, without holding any one excused.</p>
            <p>The third is <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>In which words I appeal to the conscience of every considerate man whether <hi>Peter</hi> doth not, not onely command all those persons, and that in Christs name, who were then and there converted, to be baptized in water, but also assert it to be beyond the power of the persons themselves, or any other to forbid it to be dispensed to them, or to g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> commanded them was no lesse then their duty and the positive will of God concerning them (for its said to <hi>Cornelius v.</hi> 6. that <hi>Peter</hi> should tell him what he ought to do) and also no lesse then what he was commissionated from Christ to impose upon them, or else <hi>Peter</hi> deluded them to whom he spake, for <hi>v.</hi> 39. he calls it the word of God sent to <hi>Israel,</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 33. they expected to hear not what he should please but what was commanded him of God) he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them I say <hi>nemine contradicente</hi> in the Lords name to be baptized; which <hi>Peter</hi> had no power to have done had it been by the Lord himself left <hi>ad libitum</hi> unto them, yea had it been a thing so needlesse, of such liberty, and such no-neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity as many make it now adaies, I would by <hi>Peters</hi> leave, had I been there, and been one of those that were so flatly commanded, have interposed, and forbid their bapt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sm, or at least my own, unlesse my flesh had had more mind to it then it had when I used it, and have pleaded, as our <hi>Genteel spiritualists</hi> do against us, in this wise against <hi>Peter, viz.</hi> you are much mistaken <hi>Peter</hi> in this matter, you go about to urge it as an absolute duty and matter of necessity for us to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in water, but alas its no such matter, tis but an external dispensation, that may be done indeed if any be not satisfyed without it, but else may full as well be let alone; we have the most substantiall baptism already, even that of the
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:109011:245"/>
spirit, in which case the other is but meer superfluity to be used afterward, you cannot make it such an absolute command from God to us as you seem to do, and therefore whereas you ask <hi>who can forbid</hi>? even I can forbid, why I should not be baptized as by positive precept from Christ, seeing I have received the holy spirit as well as you.</p>
            <p>Thus verily might one have cavilled against <hi>Peters</hi> command then, as the <hi>Ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> cavils against <hi>Peters</hi> command now, which is not out of date, nor hath lost any of its validity sure with lying so long unpractised, if baptism in water were such an indifferent thing as tis now made by the new <hi>Spirituallists,</hi> who little consider (but I assure them wise men will weigh it well though they do not) how little their Logick and <hi>Peters</hi> are like one another (whereby it may be gathered what contrary spirits be, and they speak by) for whereas he reasons thus, <hi>viz.</hi> these men have received the spirit, and have the most substantial baptism already, as well as those that are baptized in water, therefore who can forbid water why, or give any good reason to the contrary why these should not be baptized? and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly commanded them so to be.</p>
            <p>They contrary wise reason thus.</p>
            <p>Viz. These men have the spirit, the most substantial baptism already, as well as those that are baptized in water, Therefore who can command it as necessary or give any sound reason why these should be baptized in water? and accordingly forbid them so to be.</p>
            <p>But whether it be right in the sight of God to obey them foolishly forbidding it, as needlesse, at best but indifferency, or obey God by the mouth of <hi>Peter</hi> commanding it universally to all men as their duty judge ye.</p>
            <p>Tis clear therefore out of all these places that water baptism is so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sinfull that tis more then lawfull, more then indifferent, yea a matter of duty, and necessity, and such as it would become men to submit to as well as Christ, who needed it not, as we do, if there were no other end, nor use of it then to fulfill all the righteousnesse of his law, the <hi>least of whose commandements whoever shall break, and teach men so,</hi> i. e. that they need not keep them, the <hi>same shall be least in the kingdom of heaven, but who so shall do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and teach, the same shall be great in the kingdom of heaven</hi>

            <p>Yea verily tis very remarkable in my mind, and as well worth our heeding as any thing else in this case, that when <hi>Paul,</hi> in his trembling and astonished condition, enquired of the Lord what he would have him to do, the first thing and well nigh the onely thing that the word expresses that Christ by the mouth of <hi>Ananias</hi> declared to him as his will at that time, which was immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his conversion, was this duty of baptism: see <hi>Act.</hi> 6.9. <hi>and the trembling and astonished said Lord what wilt thou have me to do? and the Lord said unto him arise and go into the City, and it shall be told thee what thou must do,</hi> which passage <hi>Paul</hi> relating of himself <hi>Act.</hi> 22.10. expresses it thus <hi>viz. and I said what shall I do Lord? and the Lord said to me arise, and go into</hi> Damascus, <hi>and there it shall be told thee of all things, which are appointed for thee to do:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now when he was come into <hi>Damascus, Ananias</hi> speaks thus to him v. 14. <hi>the God of our fathers hath chosen thee that thou should know his will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what part of Christs will doth the word say <hi>Ananias</hi> there makes known to <hi>Paul</hi> in that place, as that which at that time he must do, and was appointed that he should do? no more then what is exprest in these words <hi>Act.</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 15.16. <hi>thou shalt be his witnesse unto all men of that thou hast seen and heard. And now why tarriest thou? arise and be baptized and wash away thy sins calling on the name of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as <hi>Peter</hi> in his first preaching the praeceptory part of Christs Gospel to the Jews, when they enquired what they should do? and to the company at <hi>Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us's</hi> house, and <hi>Ananias</hi> in his to <hi>Paul,</hi> when he quaeried what he should do? did preach baptism as the will of Christ concerning them as well as repentance, prayer and such like duties, so we shall find it was the constant course of all other primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive preachers in their preachings of Christ to any people, to hold forth baptism to them, as that which was to be submitted to by them out of hand, after faith and repentance professed, and also the constant course of persons converted to the faith without delay to submit to that dispensation accordingly, for howbeit the very form of words, wherein they spake to them concerning baptism, and prest it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on believers as their duty, is not set down syllabically in every place, where its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, yet most manifestly evident, and past all doubt it is to any, but such as seeing will not see, that in their doctrine, they delivered the mind of Christ to people in this point of baptism, and commanded it too, even in those places, where the Scripture doth not expresse what they said, or else how it came to passe that their converts were acquainted with it so as readily to imbrace it, and some of them to demand it, as we find they did, I know not, unless we shall imagine they knew and owned it by some divine immediate instinct. <hi>Acts</hi> 16.13.14.15. its said that the Lord opening the heart of <hi>Lydia so that she attended unto the things which were spoken by</hi> Paul, <hi>she was baptized and her houshold,</hi> who undoubtedly atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the things that <hi>Paul</hi> preached together with her, doth not this palpably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose that baptism was one of those things spoken by <hi>Paul,</hi> and prest upon that Auditory, or else how came she to know it? and also to what purpose did she perform it? likewise <hi>Act.</hi> 16.30.31.32.33. to the Jaylor asking Sirs what must I do to be saved? its said that <hi>Paul and Silas preached the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house</hi>: but what word of the Lord was it that they
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:109011:246"/>
spake to them? indeed the summe of their doctrine is not set down, but that the doctrine of baptism was some of it, as well as faith, which is expressely set down, as that which concerned them in the first place is clear, or else its a mystery to me how he and all his, who are said v. 34. to believe in the Lord together with him, should come to understand that they ought to be baptized, much more to submit to be baptized straightway: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that then were, or thereafter should be, whom, as they should successively arise, and grow into capacity for it, he would have to be in their several generation suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesively taught and baptized.</p>
            <p>Besides how plainly doth Christ expresse his meaning to be that this course of baptizing in wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, as nothing as circumcision, and uncircumcision, baptism or no baptism are with you, yet faith which worketh by love is something, as <hi>Paul</hi> himself also doth seem to hint, and the keeping of the commandements of God, which love to the Lord Jesus he that saies he can expresse without keeping his commandements, among which baptism in water is not the least, and without counting those commands of his not too grievous to submit to, makes either Christ a lyar, or elle himself, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.23. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.4.5. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.2.3.</p>

                  </note> in proof of this that laying on of hands was taught, I send such as doubt of it first to the name of <hi>doctrine of Christ,</hi> by which in common to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the other five principles of it, it is denominated <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1.2. leaving the principles of the <hi>doctrine</hi> of Christ, not laying again the foundation of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from dead works, and of faith towards God, and of the <hi>doctrine</hi> of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisms and of laying on of hands, which denomination of <hi>doctrine of Christ</hi> could not possibly belong to it properly, but that it was somewhere, or at sometime or other taught by either Christ or his Apostles or disciples, in the judgement of any that are but so far learned as to know whence the word <hi>doctrine</hi> is derived, which, as <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="494" facs="tcp:109011:256"/>
of the Hebrews or Iews the very platform to all the rest, which, (as to its more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat outward form and order, and that denomination of the Church, to which God added dayly such as should be saved,) had its first being, and beginning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Peters</hi> teaching <hi>Act.</hi> 2. tis said thus <hi>viz. whereas for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need to be taught again, which be the first principles of the oracles of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where note first from the words <hi>taught again,</hi> that they were taught once before all the principles of the doctrine of Christ, whereof this laying on of hands is said to be one: and not only so, but secondly, from these words <hi>you ought to be teachers,</hi> that by this time they should have been of ability to teach these principles to others, which also shews that these principles ought all along still to be taught:</p>
               <p>Moreover if it be queried where or by whom these Hebrewes were at first taught this A B C, these principles of the oracles of God there spoken of, is it not as clear as the sun to any serious, understanding, considerate spirit that it was by <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in his first preaching there in obedience to Christs commission, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. after power was come upon him from on high, in <hi>Act.</hi> 2. which I direct to as a second place wherein we may find it preached? did not <hi>Peter</hi> there lay this foundation of the principles of the doctrine of Christ among them in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, as they did themselves in practising, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. and howbeit the whole form of the doctrine he there delivered is not set down, as none of the doctrine that <hi>Philip</hi> preacht at <hi>Samaria</hi> is, nor of that <hi>Paul</hi> preacht at <hi>Philippi Act.</hi> 16.14. nor at <hi>Corinth Act.</hi> 18.8. yet is it not by sundry passages as evident that he taught that principle of laying on of hands among all the rest, as it is (and how evident that is, is shewed above) that they in those other places preached baptism? shall we think that <hi>Peter</hi> taught the principles of the doctrine of Christ, all which he was to lay as one foundation among them, by the halves? did he build them upon one part of the foundation, and not on the other part? did he consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute them partly upon it, and partly beside it? did he teach them all the rest of the principles (every of which its said <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. they had been taught) <hi>viz.</hi> faith, repentance, baptism, resurrection, and judgement, and did he leave out that one onely of laying on of hands, specially since its said that with many other words he exhorted that people, who are said there also to continue in the Apostles doctrine? what man that devotes himself to the comparing of Scripture with Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture can imagine it? and if not, why not be satisfied that it was preacht by some at least of Christs Apostles to all baptized believers? A third Scripture I direct the inquirers unto, is <hi>Act.</hi> 8.5.12.14.15.16.17. whence first its evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the Apostles administring, and the <hi>Samaritans</hi> submission to it, that the doctrine in the purport and tendency of it, was first declared, (unlesse we shall judge the Saints at <hi>Samaria</hi> were such idiots as to act by implicit faith, as men were not to do, but by comparison of what they said with the Scriptures, under the ministry of the Apostles themselves <hi>Act.</hi> 17.22. and to yield blind obedience to they knew not what, the Apostles also justifying them in it, which if they did, then you that professe your selves to be yet ignorant in that service, and that you know not the meaning of it may submit to it as safely, though as senslessely, as they, from the hands of such as do; which yet when all is done I am sure you may not: but</p>
               <p>Secondly, more evident yet if you weigh some passages of that text it self, the words whereof are on this wise <hi>viz. then went</hi> Philip <hi>down unto</hi> Samaria <hi>and preached Christ to them, v.</hi> 5. <hi>and when they believed the things spoken by</hi> Philip <hi>pertaining to the Kingdom of God, they were baptized both men and women, when they at Ierusalem heard that</hi> Samaria <hi>had received the word of God, they sent unto them</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> John, <hi>who when they were come, prayed for them that they might receive the holy spirit, for as yet he was fallen upon none of them, onely
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:109011:256"/>
they were baptized in the name of the Lord Iesus, then laid they their hands on them, and they received the holy spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Its said that <hi>Philip</hi> preached Christ, and spoke of the things pertaining to the the Kingdome of God, and that they received the word of God, which they did not surely, so much as to believe what was to be done, till he had preached it, now can any rationall man think, that he preached Christ and the things pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his kingdome, and the word of God, and not preach so much as all the principles of the oracles of God, not so much as all the first Rudiments or whole beginning word of Christ? but left out imposition of hands onely among all the rest, as none of the word of Christ, nor of the things pertaining to his kingdome as not to be preacht, no not in that juncture wherein immediately after it was to be, and accordingly was, so universally submitted to by them, and dispenst unto them? or if you say they received not that word of laying on of hands from <hi>Philip,</hi> but from <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, tis true practically from the hands of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> dispensing it, but by faith, so as to believe it to be a practicable doctrine that was their duty to own, from the mouth of <hi>Philip</hi> dispensing the doctrine, of it, or suppose that <hi>Philip</hi> spake nothing of it till <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> came, which is <hi>non supponendum,</hi> yet is it likely that the Apostles that were sent to them from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> though nothing is said of that they said, that therefore they said nothing to them at all? yea will right reason ever receive this for truth, that the Apostles were sent to <hi>Samaria</hi> upon the account of some service (whether solely that of prayer and laying on of hands it matters not so long as that was one part of it at least) and yet neither acquaint them (whether before acquainted with it or no) to what end and purpose they came, and what was the end and purport of that service they onely or mainly came for? he that can receive this let him receive it, for my part I professe I cannot.</p>
               <p>A fourth place from whence it is easily gathered that the doctrine of laying on of hands in order to their receiving the holy spirit, was wont to be preached to all baptized believers is <hi>Act.</hi> 19.1, 2.3. where <hi>Paul</hi> speaking to the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of disciples that he found at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> the number wherof were then but about twelve, among whom the doctrine of laying on of hands in order to the receiving the holy spirit had not been preached at the time of their baptism, seems to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and blame the neglect of it, enquiring whether they had not received the holy spirit, supposing surely at least that the promise of it had been to them, and prayer made for them in the usual way, with laying on of hands that they might receive it, but marveiling much that they, being baptized believers, had not been informed about these matters, nor had so much as heard of the holy spirit, <hi>have you received the holy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pirit</hi>? (saies he) <hi>no nor so much as heard of it,</hi> (say they) no? unto what then were you baptized (saies he) if at least you have not so much as heard of it? as who should say, who baptized you I wonder, and did not so much as instruct you about the spirit, nor, laying on their hands, pray for you that you might receive the spirit? this plainly shewes that by right they should all about the time of their baptism in water have heard of the holy spirit, and in what way it was to have been expected by them, even that of laying on of hands, none of all which they having so much as heard of as yet, <hi>Paul</hi> therefore after some words of fuller information to them, and such other passages as fell out thereupon laid his hands on them verse 6. in order to their receiving the holy spirit.</p>
               <p>These Scriptures (what they are to others I know not) are to me a cleer, and safe conduct into the belief of this truth, that the doctrine of laying on of hands with prayer in order to receiving the holy spirit, both was in the primitive times, and was to be preached to all baptized believers, as that which was no lesse then their duty to own and submit to have dispensed to them.</p>
               <p>And as it was so universally taught, and preached, so was it as universally
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:109011:257"/>
in those times practised, dispensed, submitted to, ownd and observed in all the churches, and among all baptized believers, even men and women without exception: This is evident out of the four forenamed places <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 5.12.6.1, 2. Act. 19 6. Act. 8.12.15.16, 17. Act. 2.40, 42.</note> in the first of which it is not only expresse that they, i. e. all that Jewish Church had been taught this principle among the rest, but also that it had been practically owned and observed among them as well as all the rest: for as its said there of all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples together that these Jewes had need to be taught them <hi>again,</hi> so that they should not now lay them <hi>again,</hi> but go on to perfection, which shews that as these principles had been all preacht to them all, so all these Jewes or Hebrews did once lay them all as a foundation at their first beginning to be a Church, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this of laying on of hands among the rest.</p>
               <p>In the second we read that <hi>Paul</hi> laid his hands on all the baptized believers that he found at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> being then no more in number then about 12. speaking (as it were) by way of blame, and reproof of those by whom they were baptized, that this was not also done by them at their baptism, in order to their receiving the holy spirit, much more in that they were not so much as informed that there was a holy spirit to be expected by them <hi>ver.</hi> 32.3. which may serve also as an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them, that say, as some of the inquirers do, that the reproof of the omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of any service doth evince that that service ought to have been performed, and as an answer also to the fourth question of the abovenamed enquirers with the ground thereof which is this <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <p>because ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny blame and reprove bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers because they do not practise, sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mit to, or come under laying on of hands.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Therefore we desire to know of them, if they can tell of any of the servants of Christ, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove or blame any sort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whether baptized or not, because lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of hands was not practised, or submitted to by them.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>In the third place we find it most expressely asserted that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them that they might receive the holy spirit, and laid their hands on them i. e. all those men and women (for thats the only substantive to this pronoun <hi>them</hi> in that place, of whom its said before that they <hi>were baptized in the name of the Lord Iesus</hi>: which word <hi>only they were baptized</hi> intimates to us thus much also, <hi>viz.</hi> that though they had submitted so far as to baptism, yet they had not practised all that was to be practised by them, but that some other service was yet behind, which ought to be performed towards them, <hi>viz.</hi> that of laying on of hands.</p>
               <p>In the fourth its asserted also most plainly that all the three thousand believers that were baptized did gladly receive the word, i. e. the word that Peter preacht to them, who exhorted them with many other words then those that are there spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, <hi>viz.</hi> repentance and baptism, and that they continued in the Apostles do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, of which word and doctrine, if we may judge the word or doctrine of Christ &amp; the Apostles to be one and the same) laying on of hands was part as well as faith, repentance, baptism, resurrection, and judgement, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1.2. besides, if the word and doctrine of Christ that was preacht and practised at Jerusalem was the self same word and doctrine, that was after preacht and practised at <hi>Samaria,</hi> then we may safely gather that whatever was preacht and practised by them at <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> had been preacht and practised by them at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> before, from whence they came immediately to <hi>Samaria,</hi> where its easie to be discerned by any but such as will bend their brains to multiply impertinencies, and to make blu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ies to themselves, and others in businesses that are beyond doubt to impartial inquirers, that they laid hands, praying for them that they might receive the holy spirit, on all those believers there that were baptized, whether men or women without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if we may as warrantably understand the men and women, that are said to be baptized v. 12. to be the same persons that are said to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus v. 16. and the same persons that are denoted by that pronoun them v. 14.15.16. as I am sure we cannot warrantably, because not congruously, do otherwise? for who else can be meant all along but the very same (and not some of them onely, but even all the same, even the men and women, that are related above to be baptized?) for whereas its said <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>when they believed, they were baptized both men and women,</hi> and v. 16. <hi>that the holy

               <p>Yet this cannot be digested for truth with some of the inquirers, for twas as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted as his opinion (the rest assenting to it by their silence) by one of those with whom we had some discourse at <hi>Ely house Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

(whether the same be the sense of all those that sent him I know not) that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> did not with prayer lay hands on all the baptized believers at <hi>Samaria,</hi> but on the men on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not on the women.<note n="*" place="margin">As if wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were not under the promise of the holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, repenting believing, and being baptized, as well as men: when as Peter saies Acts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>And whereas in proof of the contrary I asserted that the pronoun <hi>them</hi> in v. 14.15.16.17. doth relate to not the men onely, but the men and women, even all those that are said to be baptized, as the adaequate substantive with which it did agree: twas answered by him to this purpose (a pretty put off I confesse, but nothing to the purpose) <hi>viz.</hi> that the Scripture had expressions both particular, indefinite, and universal, that the word <hi>them</hi> here, as twas not a particular, so twas not an universal (for then it would have been said all them) but an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit expression, signifying some onely not all, whereby he bewrayed his too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle acquaintance with one received rule among the Rationallists, <hi>viz.</hi> that an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite proposition, or expression in a necessary matter is equivalent ever to an universal: howbeit my reply to him then was not so, but on this wise, <hi>viz.</hi> that if we must take <hi>them</hi> but indefinitely only, for some and not all the persons or things before spoken of, unlesse that particle <hi>all</hi> be added to it, then we had consequently no clear command from <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. to baptize all that are discipled, and converted to the faith, for by the pronoun them, that is there used also, we must not mean <hi>all them,</hi> but <hi>some of them</hi> onely in the nations that are discipled, because its not said <hi>all them,</hi> but meerly <hi>them,</hi> but I intreated him from his conscience to tell me whether he did think, that when Christ saies <hi>Go teach all nations baptizing them, teaching them,</hi> he meant that they should baptize <hi>all them,</hi> or but some <hi>of them</hi> only in the nations that were discipled, his return was that if there were not other places that did more clearly prove it that Christ commanded that all should be baptized then <hi>Matth</hi> 28. he could not see it fully commanded there: and being desired to assign any place, wherein Christ did more universally command baptism then there, he directs us to <hi>Luke</hi> 7.30. where its said the <hi>Pharisees rejected the Counsel of God against themselves in not being baptized</hi>: whence he gathered that baptism was the Councel, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the commandement of God to all men, because they are here reproved for rejecting it, which if it be a sound Argument to prove baptism to be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God to all men, because the pharisees in particular (for the <hi>Pharisees</hi> is but a particular expression indigitating one single sort of men among all the rest, and not so much as an indefinit, much lesse an universal) because I say the Pharisees in particular are reproved for refusing to obey it, how much better may we collect that both baptism, and laying on of hands with prayer for the spirit, are commanded by God to all men, because we find all those, save <hi>Simon,</hi> (witnesse his giving them his holy spirit) recorded as most highly approved of God, that at any

               <p>And now further to prove the <hi>Minor</hi> of the forecited syllogism in some other particulars of it that remain unproved, <hi>viz.</hi> that laying on of hands was not only taught, and practised, dispenst and submitted to, ownd and observed among all baptized believers in the primitive times, but all this as by command from God.</p>
               <p>I argue thus <hi>viz.</hi> Either by command from God or without it; But neither with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out nor against command from God, Ergo by it: the consequence of the first propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition is most clear, for whatever Gospel administration was never commanded by God to be dispensed, is practised (if practised at all) as a tradition of men, and without, nay against Gods command, whose command it is, <note n="*" place="margin">witness his reproving and threatning of lost labour to those that so do, Mat. 15.9.</note> that no man shall presume to teach for doctrines of his the traditions or commandments of men: the <hi>Minor</hi> is as clear that the Apostles did not teach for doctrines of Christ any tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of their own, for as <hi>Paul</hi> who was one of them that practised laying on of hands, saies of himself 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. that he received from Christ that which he delivered unto the <hi>Church</hi> at <hi>Corinth,</hi> so may we say on the behalf of all the rest, as concerning what doctrines they delivered, and dispensations they practised to the Churches: for surely as Christ the great, and immediate messenger from the father could do nothing of himself, was not to do his own will, but the will of his father which sent him, nor to speak or do any thing, but as the father gave him commandement, confessing that even his doctrine was not his own, but his that sent him, <note n="x" place="margin">John. 5.30.8.16.17.12<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Moreover, that laying on of hands was taught, and practised not of their own heads, but (as tis asserted in the argument) as a practical part of the Law, will, and Testament of Christ concerning baptized believers, as one of the ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles or holy things of God, as one of the very principles of the doctrine of Christ, as a part of the foundation, or beginning word of Christ (as well as baptism) or of the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles, on which the true visible Church is built as upon a certain <hi>basis,</hi> and from which the whole building growth up an holy temple in the Lord toward perfection, an habitation of God through the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, being first fitly framed together by a joint, uniform, visible obedience unto that one whole form of doctrine <note n="*" place="margin">For there was a certain form of Christs do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the Apostles to persons as from him, which they were to obey, and after obedience unto which (and not before) they were counted unto Christ, as now his servants, which till they had obeyed they were counted none of his, but unto sin, as its servants, standing in several particulars, whereof its most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that water baptism was one (for obedience in baptism, and obedience to that form of doctrine delivered are both urged as arguments and ingagements to the Romans now to reckon on themselves, or from thenceforth, i. e. their obedience thereunto as <hi>(in foro dei, hominum, et ecclesiae)</hi> Christs servants that had formally owned him) and whether the rest viz faith, repentance, laying on of hands, belief of a resurrection and judgement, which are Heb. 6. all called the foundation which was at first to be laid altogether with baptism, called by the name of the form of doctrine Rom. 6.17. which was at first to be obeyed by every beginner in Christs school, is worth our serious considerations.</note> whereof, I say this laying on of hands was a part, and was practised at their first beginning to be disciples at or about the time of their baptism, and before actual fellowship in the visible Church, this all is clear enough of it self to him that consults <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.2.6.1. considerately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them with <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20.21.22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42.8.12.14.15.16.17.19.2.6. out of all which places, at least collectively consulted with, we cannot but see that after baptism, and before fellowship in one body, or building in higher things there was this of laying on of hands, practised, owned, observed, as one of the first principles of Gods oracles, of Christs doctrine, Antecedent to fellowship, and laid as a part of that first form of doctrine that was delivered and obeyed (after obedience to the whole of which they were counted babes in Christ, new born, begotten to him, belonging to him, and in present capacity (as no fleshly babes are) to be added and admitted into his Church) and as one piece of that foundation or word of the beginning of Christ<note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>And because I have inserted and asserted no lesse in the <hi>Minor</hi> of the Argument I am yet in proving then this <hi>viz.</hi> that as theres no intimation of any cessation of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of hands on all baptized believers till such time as the work of baptizing all believers it self shall cease, but also a plain injunction from Christ for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the one of these as long as the other, and for a continual teaching and observation of both as well as either among all the disciples that should be in all nations to the worlds end, Ile direct the enquirers to a plain text of Scripture for it, <hi>viz. Matth.</hi> 28.20. whence <hi>suppositis supponendis</hi> taking it for granted, till I shall see more then ever I have yet seen from them, or I believe ever shall see from any to the contrary, that the dispensation, practise, use and observation of laying on of hands among the Apostles, and the primitive baptized believers, who expected that whatever the Apostles delivered to them was first commanded them of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.33. was no other then what God commanded then to them all, it is as plain as the high way that the very same is commanded to be continued downwards, even to be taught to, and observed by all that ever should be discipled in the nations to the worlds end; for on the very day in which Christ was taken up after that he through the holy spirit had given commandments to the Apostles, whom he had chosen, being seen of them four'y daies after his resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdome of God (among which I quaery, of the <hi>Enquirers</hi> whether laying on of hands were not one?) he expresly charges them, that whatever he had taught and enjoined them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve; they should teach all the nations, i. e. the disciples and baptized believers in all nations to observe the very same, promising his presence in the observation of the same among his disciples, not to the end of that generation, or age onely, but <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Finally that laying on of hands on baptizd believers hath the same ends, grounds and reasons why it was to be used, continuing still to this very day, as much as
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:109011:259"/>
as in the primitive times, is as evident as all the rest: for as the grounds and reasons why they observed such a service then were, and could be no other then the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation of it to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>gh as despicable a dispensation, and as weak, low, foolish, earthen, and empty a thing to see to as wash in <hi>Iordan,</hi> yet was to be done, sith the Lord had bidden it to be done, as well, yea rather then if it had been some greater matter, if to no other end, then meerly to testify their love to him, and themselves meerly to be his disciples, servants, and friends by observing whatever he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.15.21.23.15.14 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.3. how much more when it was a way, and order of his own appointment to be observed, and to wait upon him in, together with prayer and supplication, in order to such a glorious and profitable end, and purpose to themward, as this, viz. that they waiting on him in that his own way, might (as not onely they did, but all others shall, that wait on him in the same in sincerity according to their faith, or else its possible that we may fail of it as they also might and did) in his measure manner and time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his holy spirit.</p>
               <p>Now (I say) as these were the ends, grounds and reasons, why among baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed believers this of laying on of hands was observed then, so there are the same ends, grounds and reasons, why the same service should be observed now,</p>
               <p>For first we have it manifested as sufficiently to our Reason and understanding (unlesse we will darken the councell of God to our selves by a number of needless queries, superfluous scruples, and words without knowledge) either expressely or by infallible inferences, and undeceivable deductions in the word to be an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repealed, undisannulled dispensation and patt, and principle of Christs doctrine, will and Testament, as they had, and as baptism it self, which the Enquirers walk still in the practice of, is manifested so to be:</p>
               <p>Secondly, we are also as much required, and have as much reason as they to manifest our selves to be lovers of Christ, to be his disciples, servants, and friends by our readinesse to do whatsoever he hath commanded.</p>
               <p>Thirdly we are in as much liablenesse as they to be the least in the kingdome of heaven, if we break one of the least of Christ commandements, and teach men so i e. that they may do so too<note n="*" place="margin">&amp; so the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirers seem to me to do while they teach men that as yet have not, that they need or ought not to submit to prayer and laying the holy spirit, and unteach such again as have been targht it, till they disown that first principle of the doctrine of Christ after they had once, even practically owned it.</note>, and as much capablenesse of being greatest in the kingdom of heaven, if we do the least of Christs commandements, and teach men so i. e. that they must do so too.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we have as much need of the holy spirit now as they had to perform the same good offices for us as he did for them <hi>viz.</hi> to comfort and support under sufferings, to lust against our flesh, to lead us into all truth, to bring to our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance the things that were spoken by Christ, which many men would fain have to be forgotten, to help to mortifie the deeds of our bodies to seal us up to the day of redemption, to reveal unto us, that we may rejoice therein, the things which are freely given us of God, which are the same he gives to them, and to gift us likewise with such gifts as he, not as we shall please <note n="*" place="margin">who would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

particular of it, in which as neerly as I could well croud them together are coucht as many, if not all such particulars are needful to be proved to the evincing of the continuance of this doctrine and dispensation, of laying on of hands to the end,</p>
               <p>I shall hasten to an end both of this subject, and of this system also: but because I find some things put in by way of positive exception, and objection against this truth, from the mouthes of some, as well as something by way of query from the pens of others, who also in that way have appeared against it so newly at the the presse, <hi>viz.</hi> the late Enquirers above-named, a remnant of whose Questions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> from the way of truth in this particular, and so leave both it, and them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord.</p>
               <p>First then whereas by word of mouth some tell me, That <hi>Laying on of hands was a way peculiar to that juncture, designed of god to the time then being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wherein the Apostles</hi> (say some and othersome the Lord) <hi>gave the holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in some visible eminent, and extraordinary gifts thereof, as tongues prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, miracles, healing &amp;c. simply to this end that these might be a sign to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it visibly to the eyes of people, that the doctrine they taught and practised in the principles, and other parts of it was from above, and no other then the oracles of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, I grant that in the primitive times, there were, and that in the way of prayer, and laying on of hands, given (not by the Apostles, though, for (as is shewed above) they were not baptizers with the spirit) but by the Lord onely, whose onely prerogative that is to baptize with the holy spirit, sundry gifts, as healing, &amp;c. which may be called extraordinary, and rare respectively to these times, wherein they have bin seldome or never seen, or heard of, as I know not that that of tongues now adaies ever was, though as to that of healing, and that of discerning of spirits, and some other manifestations of the spirit given to profit withall, as a word of wisdome, and a word of knowledge, it is within a little of past doubt to some that such as these, as the Lord pleases, are some lesse, some more frequently given now among them that walk in truth (though what gifts some have seen and been sensible of in others or themselves, tis not so fit to boast of, as to be silent.)</p>
               <p>Secondly, I grant that many of this sort (and hapily many more then either are, or need to be, or shall be given now) were given then to confirm the New Testament doctrine in the first delivery of it to the world, in the room of the old one, to be of God, of some of which there maybe a cessation, the end they had such special respect to then being sufficiently accomplished, and the word being now committed unto writing <hi>Mark</hi> 16.17, 18, &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3, 4.</p>
               <p>But thirdly, that either such gifts of the spirit as these were either the onely or the chief kind of gifts of the spirit that were to be, and were expected, lookt after or given in that way of prayer and laying on of hands, as a service destinated <hi>pro tempore</hi> only in order to the receiving of such, or that these gifts were so extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in respect of the eminency or excellency of them (because more visible and <hi>ad extra</hi>) beyond such as may be warrantably by promise expected, and are in that way assuredly and ordinarily given at this day, these two I see no warrant to subscribe to: for as tis most sure that the promise was (so far as I find) <hi>in termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> nor onely, nor so oft of these things (though I deny not but these were at that time, for ends that concern not these times promised too) but of the spirit to seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other purposes (as above) the holy spirit, the spirit in the fruits, and graces, and comforts of it, the gift of the holy spirit we find it all along almost in no lesse then scores of Scriptures, whereof some few are more plain: so assuredly the

               <p>I say this only in short,<note place="margin">

                  </note> first their expectation that some men shall, and thoughts that of old some men did baptize with the spirit is a grosse mistake, for the most they could do was but to pray for it, and barely lay on their hands, Christ did the one and they the other.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if we must wait, as they did till the day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> then we must till that time forbear all baptizing in water, and suspend all preaching to the world aswel as laying on of hands, but this though the Apostles did so in that juncture, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertime between Christs ascension, and the descension of the holy spirit, yet our Enquirers, among whom some of eminency object as abovesaid, <note n="*" place="margin">which I much mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel at sith this objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on supposes a continuation, or resurrection of that same ordinance of laying on of hands in the last daies, after a whiles waiting for administrators: but the questions subscribed to, are all or most of them such as suppose the Enquirers to be much in the dark and in doubt about it, what kind of laying on of hands that is, thats called a doctrine of Christ <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. whether ever such a thing was, or is ever to be dispensed to all baptized believers &amp;c. as if they could not tell almost whether there be, at least appointed by Christ, such a manner of administration.</note> do in this time (I suppose) baptize, and increase their number by preaching the Gospel to the world.</p>
               <p>Thus far as to the objections: now as to what further obstructive interposal is made in way of question by the Enquirers, some of whose queries viz. the second fourth, seventh and eighth, I have taken notice of above, I shall now remove it by saying a little to the residue viz. the first, third, fifth, and sixth.</p>
               <p>The first which with the ground thereof is on this wise <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <p>
                        <hi>viz.</hi> See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we are denied communion by some of those Churches, or by some members thereof, who hold the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of all baptized believers to practise, submit to, or come under the laying on of hands.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Therefore we desire them to acquaint us what we are commanded to say, or do, that we may be found faithful in that point; or otherwise, to be discovered disobedient unto a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand by the Word of God, which is the onely director here, and that which shall be our judge at the last day.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </note> is rather a curious querk, then a solid question, so frivolous as is scarce fit to be answered with any thing, but not a word: yet a word neverthelesse even unto that.</p>
               <p>First, whereas they ground it upon our denial of communion with them, we desire them to know that we may more justly put the businesse of our <hi>non-commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> with them upon their score, and lay the deniall of it at their own doors as their doing, not ours.</p>
               <p>I say not ours, who earnestly desire to have communion even in one body with them, and all men in a way of conformity to the word of Christ, which gives neither example, nor toleration, so far as I know, for any mix<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, whereas tis askt what persons are to say or do, (at the administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of laying hands) that they may be found faithful in that point? I say that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Act.</hi> 8.15.17. the administrators are to pray for the baptized believers that they may, according to the promise <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. receive the holy spirit, and after that to lay their hands upon them, which is eas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>which is the wise query of some also, and as learned a question as if one should ask, whether at the supper we must put the elements to our mouths with the right hand or the left? or in baptism ask, how the baptizer must handle the person baptized, and where he must take hold on him, when he dips him? and if he have not expresse Scripture concerning such nicities and trifles as these, suspend the dispensation of both the supper &amp; baptism, because Christ is som<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>what short in his word, not expressing punctually enough, how his ordinances shall be dispensed, nor what is to be said and done by persons at the doing of them, so distinctly as they would have him.</p>

                  </note>? and (as at baptism the believer is without gain-saying it, to yield his body to be baptized so) at laying on of hands, the baptiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The 3d. question with the ground thereof, which runs thus, <note n="p" place="margin">Viz. Seeing there be ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny that do desire bapti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>zed believers to require that hands should be laid on them. <hi>Therefore we desire of them to shew us some place of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture (if they know of any) that doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse such a behaviour ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrator, or the person on whom hands were laid.</hi>
                  </note> is even as super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, impertinent, vain and frivolous as the former; for (howbeit neither am I one of those many that have ever yet formally, and in terms desired baptized be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to require that hands should be laid on them yet) laying on of hands on bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized believers either is Christs mind, or it is not, if it be not, and the Enquirers ever prove it is not, we will freely give them leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire us to let it alone, but if it be, (as tis proved to be above out of <hi>Act.</hi> 8.16. 17.19.1.2.3.6. where tis so plain as to need no deduction) then as I shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire them to have us excused <note n="*" place="margin">(for such a behaviour as to reprove their back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse, and summon men to shew their forwardnesse to own Christs wayes may become any administrator whatsoever Act. 22.16.)</note> if henceforward we desire baptized believers to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it to be dispenst to them, so I give them to understand that, it being the mind of Christ, though (as baptism also is) one of his too too dispised dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as stout, and loath to stoop to it as some baptized believers seem to be, tis no disparagement to the best of them, that are yet (as those <hi>Act.</hi> 8.16.) onely baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus, but a behaviour that may well enough beseem them to require it.</p>
               <p>The fifth question is ushered in by an introduction, consisting of nothing but division and subdivision of laying on of hands into different kinds, according to the difference of the administrators, of the persons to whom, of the accounts or ends upon which, and in order whereunto administred, as it followes in their own words thus viz <hi>we do or may read of laying on of hands upon severall occasions, differ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing one from the other,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, in the qualification of the administrator, as Luke</hi> 21.12. <hi>compared with Mark</hi> 16, 18. <hi>the one being wicked, the other Godly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, differing qualifications in persons on whom hands were laid, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times before baptized, and sometimes after baptism, Act.</hi> 9.17. <hi>and Acts</hi> 8.17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, hands were imposed upon several accounts (or ends;) sometimes to be brought before Rulers, as Luke</hi> 21.12. <hi>sometimes to heal the sick, Acts</hi> 28. 8. <hi>sometimes to cure the blind, Act.</hi> 9.17. <hi>sometimes to set men apart to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister temporall things Acts</hi> 6.6. <hi>sometimes to set men apart to administer

               <p>After which their question with its ground comes in thus.<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <p>Viz. Seeing many plead laying on of hands to be practised or submitted unto as a foundation, principle, or a beginning doctrine of Christ and that by all baptized believers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Therefore we desire to know, if any of them can inform us, which of all these layings on of hands forementioned is called by Christ, or his Apostles the foundation, principle, or beginning doctrine, by some text in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>

               <p>To all which <hi>viz.</hi> their introduction, ground, and question I answer as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <p>First, I deny not but that hands were laid on men then by several sorts of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrators, godly and wicked <note n="*" place="margin">if it be not somewhat an improper phrase to stile wicked men in their wrathful and cruel handlings of the Saints Administrators of any doctrine of Christ that is stiled imposition of hands, as to me it seems to be, unlesse weel allow the name of an Administrator also to the devil himself, when he tempts the Saints, and puts forth his hands against them to smite them with any mischiefs in either body or spirit, as by Gods permission he did Job, Job 1.12. Job 2.6.7.</note> in the several seasons of before and after baptism, to and upon several ends, purposes, and accounts, though all the several ends and cases you here distinguish by do not make so many several kinds of imposition of hands neither, so substantially distinct each from other as you would seem to make them; for imposition of hands on baptized believers before admission, and after that before ordination to office, were one and the same in kind, distinguished onely by the different capacities of membership, and ministership, eldership, messengership, to each of which laying on of hands was Antecedent, yea these were one, and the same kind of imposition of hands, used all in order to one and the same end in general <hi>viz.</hi> receiving the holy spirit, or, as occasion was, more and more of the spirit, in a measure answerable to their places, diversified onely by the different degrees or stations in the Church to which they were thereby visibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed: but what if there were never so many kinds of laying on of hands, is it therefore so impossible to determine (as by your query you seem to imagine) which among all the rest is meant in such or such a place? shall we think the Apostles meant to deliver the mind and doctrine of Christ, and that in the very principles or first rudiments of it too, which ought to be the plainest, in such obstruse, dark and ae igmatical wayes that men should scarcely be capable possibly to know what they meant? theres several sorts of baptism spoken of in the Scripture, is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so difficult (if men be not willing (as some are) to puzzle themselves besides the practise of water baptism) to know when he speaks of water, when of suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, when of the spirit?</p>
               <p>But to the question: sith some will needs, though needlesly, query which of all these layings on of lands the Scripture speaks of is called the foundation, principle or beginning doctrine?</p>
               <p>I answer that laying on of hands that twas dispensed with prayer on baptized believers, not as yet to be set apart to office, mentioned <hi>Act.</hi> 8.15 16.17. not in order to gifted mens giving it (for though you will mistake us do what we can, and bring us in as confessing it here, yet we ever utterly deny that any men were ever so gifted as that they could give it) but in order to Gods giving, and our receiving the holy spirit from the Lord, that laying on of hands I say is it which in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1.2. is called a principle, a part of that foundation of Christs doctrine on which the visible Church is built.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="508" facs="tcp:109011:263"/>In proof of which let this Argument be considered viz.</p>
               <p>Its none of all the other kinds of laying on of lands mentioned by you, that is meant <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. therefore it must necessarily be that.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, whatever doctrine is called a principle or part of the foundation of the doctrine of Christ <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. the same is called <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. one of the principles of the oracles or the holy things of God.</p>
               <p>But the laying on of violent hands on the saints in way of persecution, is one of the principles of the devils doctrine, and a principal part of the very foundation of his kingdome, yea one of the most wicked things that the devil does or delivers, as Christs doctrine, to his disciples.</p>
               <p>Nor was it a laying on of hands, (though such a one was used some times) in order to healing the sick or curing the blind, that was taught as a principle, and practically ownd, and laid as a part of the foundation among all the <hi>Hebrewes Heb.</hi> 5.12.6.1, 2. for they were neither all sick surely, nor all blind, when they past under this dispensation so as to have all need to have hands laid on them all upon such accounts, as healing or curing.</p>
               <p>Nor was it in order to ordination of them to offices, that they might be gifted, and fitted by the spirit thereunto, for the laying on of hands there spoken of, was laid as a principle, as a part of the foundation on which the Church stood, but the laying on of hands to set apart men to administer either temporal things, or spiritual things in the Church is no principle, nor beginning thing, nor foundation antecedent to the Church, as every foundation must be to the building, for the visible Church ever since the first Apostles, whose doctrine was the foundation to it, was antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to its officers, and not they to it: the churches were first collected, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted upon the foundation or first form of doctrine delivered by the Apostles, and then officers were ordained in every Church; for the true visible Church may be without officers, though not without ordinances, but Church officers cannot be chosen, nor ordained in it till there be a Church: besides this imposition <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. was learnt, owned and laid by the whole body of the Church, whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves, saying ye might have been teachers, but ye had need to be taught again, which be the first principles of the oracles of God, but they were not all at first surely by laying on of hands ordained to office.</p>
               <p>As to the sixth question of the <hi>Enquirers</hi> which is also the last that I am to speak to, having spoke to the seventh and eighth above, which with the ground thereof runs thus<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <p>Viz Seeing that Heb 6.2. speaks of the laying on of hands as plural, as the doctrine of baptisms, and doth not speak of any one laying on of hands fore-mentioned particularly, nor of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of any end, purpose, or event.</p>
                     <p>

                  </note> it is grounded upon such a grosse and grievous mistake, that I am almost

amazed that of the fifteen hands that subscribe to those Questions, not one of them did find occasion to subscribe his dissent to this, for whereas tis supposed, and proposed so publiquely for truth by the Enquirers, that <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. speaks not of any one laying on of hands onely, but plurally, as of the doctrine of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisms, its most palpably apparent to such as are not a sleep in their reading of that text, that it speaks in the singular number, of one laying on of hands alone, and not of layings on of hands, as it must have been expressed, for so you are fain to expresse it your selves, when you speak plurally of it in your fifth question, had he meant more kinds of imposition of hands then one; for though hands be the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall number, yet laying on, which is the phrase you speak to, or else you speak <hi>nihil ad Rhombum,</hi> is a substantive of the singular number, both in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, and in the Greek, and suppose the spirit had spoken plurally of more impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of hands then one? must that that was <hi>Act.</hi> 8.17-19.6. on baptized be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers be ever the more excluded, or the more incuded rather in all likelyhood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the rest?<note n="†" place="margin">See Mr <hi>Blackwoods</hi> last book newly extant even whilest I am writing to you on this subject stiled a soul-search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing catechism p. 58 in p. 54.55.56.57.58.59. of which he treats to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally of this subject.</note> and because the Apostle does not speak particularly enough, nor distinguish, nor expresse plainly enough what he means by shewing the end, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and event of the imposition here spoken of, therefore belike he meant that no body should ever own this principle at all: but the truth is he speaks of no more impositions then one, Therefore, to conclude with the Enquirers question pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded thus to themselves, we desire to know what safety it is for any man to conclude that question to be worthy of an answer, that is so falsely grounded as this of the Enquirers is, and to conclude that <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. is meant of more layings on of hands, when it expresly speaks but of one?</p>

               <p>Thus much concerning the continuation of that practise of laying on of hands: now as to the present use of the ordinances of breaking of bread, and church-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship, I shal speak but briefly to that forasmuch as these are services the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of which to the end is denied doctrinally by none (for ought I know) but the Ranter, that is run up above all, saving that the Rigid Presbyterians, though in words they own the supper, yet in works do deny it, for many if not most of them live in the neglect of that administration of the supper, in their parishes some four; some five, some six, seven, eight years without any use of it at all, as if there were no such matter as that now in being; for others, I mean a certain mixt sort of Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents that are rife in these dayes, they own and practise it and Church fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship too more then enough, unlesse more orderly in respect of that Antecedency to these of all the principles of the doctrine of Christ, which ought to be now as it was in the primitive times, which times they pretend to reform by, taking in <hi>Omnium generum,</hi> an Omnigatherum of persons, men and women, whom they take to be believers, into fellowship in one visible body in breaking of bread and prayers, some whereof, having renounced their Rantism as null, are truly baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; some as yet but meerly Rantized, yet supposing themselves sufficiently bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized because of that, which can be of no use to them as a sign, for they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it not; some hanging in the air between both, not satisfied, whether they were truly baptized in infancy yea or no; some doubting whether any water bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism at all be needful to be used in these times; some convinc't that they ought to be baptized, but not yet finding any Administrator, that fits their fancies; some resolved to be baptized, but Christ, who expects it from them, must wait their leasure, none reproving their procrastination, nor saying to them, as <hi>Ananias,</hi> to <hi>Paul, and now why tarriest thou? arise and be baptized, and wash away thy sins calling on the name of the Lord, or as Peter to the Iews repent and be baptized</hi>; Some resolving never to be baptized, but roundly renouncing all water baptism as nothing concerning them, yet leaving them at liberty to act according to their light, that have a mind to submit to it, and who see it their duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if the plain word of Christ in this point of baptism were such a nose of wax, as might be moulded, and metamorphosed into any model according to every mans mind and temper, or quite canceld, disanuld, melted into no word of Christ at all at every mans haughty humour, that is loath to debase himself so far as to submission to it, as if my Lord, and my Lady, and Sir such a one had more dispensation from Christ then every ordinary body, to shew for their non-obedience to that dispised dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation; some of them, that are baptized, under prayer and imposition of hands in order to their obtaining the spirit of promise; some not having faith in the thing, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that baptism with the spirit <hi>Peter</hi> speaks of <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. and <hi>Iohn</hi> baptist <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11. doth belong to them or no, though there promised to all that are, and shall be (repenting and believing) baptized in water, even as many as the Lord shall call, whereupon the fourth principle of Christs doctrine, will not down with them, but when they come to that lesson in Christs ABC they must skip it, and take forth, and, because it likes them not, turn ore a new leaf to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the supper, and Church fellowship before they are prefecty past their primmer: to all which confused <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> congregations, and mongrill kind of ministry, and people, that speak half in the language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and half of <hi>Ashdod,</hi> Ile here say no more but this <hi>viz. si eo quo caepistis pede perrexeritis</hi> &amp;c. proceeding as you begin, and thriving to the hight of your principle throw the nations, the body of Christendom, which was once an uniform, and more lately a triforme<note n="*" place="margin">consisting of 3 sorts of Christ'n crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, under a 3 sold CCCler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy viz. papal, prelatical, presbyterian.</note> may in time become that, which I judge also it must become for some small season before the end, <hi>viz.</hi> a monstrous multiform, and at last an omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form beast indeed.</p>

               <p>The first is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. <hi>for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup ye shew</hi> (or shew ye, for the word may be read imperatively, as well as indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively) <hi>the Lords death till he come,</hi> in which words tis so clearly supposed, that the ordinance of the supper is not according to Christs will to cease till the next ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of Christ, that it were to suppose a man to be void of sense, and reason to undertake to make it more evident to him by framing any formall argument from the place.</p>

            <p>I shall therefore in a serious survey and examine of what <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Schism</hi> is, discover plainly,</p>
            <p>First that the people whom you call <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> upon account of meer dissent and separation from you in the point of baptism, are no <hi>Hereticks</hi> nor <hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi>; but the truest visible Church that Christ hath upon the earth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that you the <hi>PPPriesthood</hi> of the Nations, who dissent from them in that point, are, as to that point at least, the veriest <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schismaticks</hi> your selves.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, after some pathetical expostulation with your selves, addresse my self, by way of Peraphrase upon your own pathetical and paraenetical passages, pathetically to exhort the true Pastors, and paraenetically to perswade all people (as you do yours to beware of us) to beware of you, the spirituallity, by whom the way of truth is dispited, who though you disguise your selves under the name of Gods <hi>Clergy</hi> or Heritage for a while, yet will appear to be but cruel crushers of his true Clergy in the end.</p>
            <p>First, then let us see what <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Schism</hi> is, and then who is a <hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Heretick</hi> in the doctrine of <hi>baptism, Heresie</hi> as to the Gospel is held (and that truly by all manner of men I think) the holding or maintaining any erroneous opinion in the faith and doctrine of the Gospel, contrary to that doctrine delivered by Christ and his Apostles in the primitive times, obstinately and pertinacously a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all meanes that can be used towards conviction of the truth, <hi>Schism</hi> is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,

            <p>Now whether it be you O PPPriests, who rantize infants or we, who baptize believers, that are thus gone off and divided from the primitive faith and practise, from the true head of that Church, from the true foundation i. e. the doctrine of the Apostles <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1.2. and from fellowship with, and conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the true Church in baptism and otherwise, is evident to him that is not blind or blear-eyed; for verily the water baptism which we dispense is abundantly shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above to be that one baptism <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. which was used in the primitive times, then which there is no other water baptism, enjoined or exemplified in the word as Christs ordinance to his disciples <hi>viz.</hi> the burying of new born babes i. e believers in water, and bringing them up again in token of Christs death, burial and resurrection, and of their dying to sin, and rising to newnesse of life, this I say is that one onely baptism the Churches then practised, and thus, and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise do we at this day, for which the word is our warrant; yea it is that faith which was once delivered unto the Saints, that we now contend for, and the words which were spoken before by the Apostles of the Lord, as we are specially injoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do in these latter daies by both <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iude,</hi> who foretold how they would be sleighted, as we see they now are, by the two Spiritualties <hi>viz.</hi> the Rantizer and the Ranter, the one Hereticizing in the excesse by adding a new thing, the other in the defect by owning nothing, both Schismatizing according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the way of truth; and howbeit after that way which you call Heresie, Schism, separation from the Church, and such like, so worship we God yet, as sure as the coats upon your back, you shall first or last, to your weal or wo, find that, as to the point of baptism, Churchfellowship and the supper also, it is no other then the way of truth we walk in: yea so far are we from erring, and Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matizing from the Church, that we of all men do stand for a full reformation in faith, practise, doctrine, discipline, worship, manners, government and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism according to the word of God, and the example of the best reformed Churches i. e. those mentioned in the word according to which we are all sworn to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to reform, as we will not be justly charged with Perjury, Perfidiousnesse, and Prevarication, the guilt of all which how little the Orthodox, protesting, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting Clergy are clear of in the sight of God and man, is good for them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider: yea conformity in all things to the primitive practise is that we plead for, presse after, and persue, and howbeit (to the shame of his ignorance be it spoken) Orthodox Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is pleased, among other sectaries, to charge the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists (so he calls us that baptize aright) as the Authors, and approvers of the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible wickednesse of these times, and speaks of us as dispappointing, and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hopes in point of reformation, to the grief of his heart, yet with grief of heart that the way of truth should be evil spoken of by him, by reason of such as do wickedly indeed, yet those lascivious waves, he laies to our score, are lesse approvvd on in our Churches, then in the purest Parish Church in all Christ'ndom, <hi>Kederminster</hi> not excepted; yea I tell him (and God I hope will one day seal it home upon his heart to the grief of it another way) that the power and purity of Christs ordinances are a 1000 fold more strictly stickled for, according to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,

            <p>And as in point of baptism you all erre, not knowing, or at least not doing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scriptures, all means used to reduce you thereunto notwithstanding, so in th supper, and many more matters pertaining to that visible Church order that was in those times, as namely impropriating to your selves sole power of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in your Churches, i. e. steeple-houses, so that your members may well say <hi>men mutire nefas</hi>? it is not for them to open their mouthes there, unlesse to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer when you catechise them; whereas then all the Church were to covet to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie i. e. to speak mutually to the exhortation, edification<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and comfort each of other, and being gifted, might all (women onely excepted) prophesie one by one, and every one minister as of the ability God gave them, great or small, that God in all things might be glorified, and all judge of the doctrine delivered; but with you what doctrine ere ye deliver, men may try it if they will, but must take it whether they will or no, the mouths of all must be muzzled up, save such as (in your sense) are ministers i. e. have some <hi>Parchment Preachment</hi> orders to shew from such, as can shew their orders from his Highnesse the head of the Church, not Christ but his Holinesse the <hi>Pope,</hi> who had his from the beast <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. who

Therefore although they pretend the Temple, the Priesthood, and other such out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shews, this vain glistering, wherewith the eyes of the simple be dazled ought nothing to move us to grant that there is a Church, where the Word of God doth not appear; for this is the perpetual mark wherewith God hath mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to be his. He that is of the truth (saith he) heareth my voice. Again, I am the good shepheard, and I know my sheep, and am known of them, my sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me, And a little before he had said, that the sheep follow their shepheard, because they know his voice: but they follow not a stranger, but run away from him because they know not the voice of strangers. Why are we therefore wilfully mad in judging the Church, whereas Christ hath marked it with an undoubtful sign, which wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it is seen cannot deceive, but that it certainly sheweth the Church to be there, but where it is not, there remaineth nothing that can give a true signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, for</hi> Paul <hi>rehearseth that the Church was builded, not upon the judgements of men, nor upon Priesthoods, but upon the doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets, but rather</hi> Jerusalem <hi>is to be severally known from</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon, <hi>and the Church of Christ from the conspiracy of Satan, by that difference
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:109011:274"/>
wherewith Christ hath made them different one from another. He that is of God (saith he) heareth the words of God, ye therefore hear not, because ye are not of God. In summe, forasmuch as the Church is the kingdom of Christ, and he reigneth not but by his word, can it be now doubtful to any man, but that those be the words of lying, by which Christs kingdome is feigned to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his scepter, that is to say without his holy word?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5 <hi>But now whereas they accuse us of Schism and Heresie, because we both teach a contrary doctrine to them, and obey not their lawes, and have our as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies to prayers, to baptism, to the ministration of the supper, and other holy doings, severally from them: it is indeed a very sore accusation, but such as needeth not a long or laborsome defence: they are called Hereticks and Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, which making a division, do break in sunder the communion of the Church. And this communion is holden together with true bounds, that is to say, the agreement of true doctrine, and brotherly charity, whereupon</hi> Augustine <hi>putteth this difference betwixt Hereticks and Schismaticks, that Hereticks indeed do with false doctrine corrupt the purenesse of faith, but the Schismaticks sometime even where there is like faith, do break the bond of fellowship. But this is also to be noted, that this conjoining of charity so hangeih upon the unity of Faith, that faith ought to be the beginning thereof, the end, and finally the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rule. Let us therefore remember that so oft as the unity of the Church is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended unto us, this is required, that while our minds agree in Christ, our wills also may be joined together with mutual well willing in Christ, Therefore</hi> Paul <hi>when he exhorteth us to that well willing, taketh for his foundation that there is one God, one Faith and one Baptism. Yea wheresoever he teacheth us to be of one mind, and of one will, he by and by addeth in Christ, or according to Christ, meaning, that it is a factions company of the wicked, and not agreement of the faithful which is without the word of the Lord.</hi>

Nothing could be said more fitly to expresse that undividual knitting together, which all the members of Christ have one with another; we see how he continually calleth us back to the very head. Whereupon he pronounceth that Heresies and Schismes do arise hereof, that men do not return to the original of truth, nor do seek that head, nor keep the doctrine of the heavenly master, Now let them go and cry that we be Hereticks that have departed from their Church: sith there hath been no cause of our estrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from them but this one, that they can in no wise abide the pure professing of the truth: but I tell not how they have driven us out with cursings and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el execrations, Which very self-doing doth abundantly enough acquit us, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they will also condemn the Apostles for Schismaticks, with whom we have all one cause. Christ I say did foresay to his Apostles, that the time should come when they should be cast out of the synagogues for his name sake. And those Synagogues of which he speaketh, were then accounted lawful Churches.

First, because the false wayes are many, and broad, and easie, and fine, and the true way but one, and that so streit and narrow, mean and base, that not many noble, and mighty, and men of power ever find it 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (as King <hi>Iames</hi> said) persecution is a certain note of a false Church) then truth is unavoidably smothered by them, and will first or last pull vengeance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that power, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.11.12. though it be under the name of <hi>Heresie</hi> onely that he suppresses it, and plucks it up under the name and notion of weeds and tares that would else choak the wheat: besides therefore a most strict charge that Christ gives <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. that in the world i. e. the civil States and Common-wealths of it the Tares should stand together among the wheat untill the harvest, which alone is an Argument putting all out of doubt in this controversie, he gives this good reason <hi>viz.</hi> least in plucking up the Tares, the wheat also chance to be rooted up with them, tis for the wheats good therefore for the Tares to stand, and for the wheats sake that Christ wills they should, though not in the Church yet in the world to the very end thereof.</p>
            <p>And because the <hi>Divine</hi> cannot yet divine that to be Christs meaning in that scripture, that <hi>false worshippers hereticks</hi> &amp;c. may lawfully (if not civil offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders) be licenced to live in civil States, let us consider how sinister his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures are upon it, I have met with some and some of chiefest note in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Ken,</hi> who have shifted it of thus, saying that by the <hi>Field</hi> is meant the <hi>Church,</hi> not the <hi>World</hi> as we say, and Christ himself interprets it in that place. Secondly, that the servants, who ask whether they should pluck up the <hi>Taris</hi> yea or no, and are bid to let them grow together with the <hi>Wheat,</hi> are not the <hi>Civil Magistrates,</hi> but Christs Disciples, who had nothing to doe to pluck them up, and so the <hi>civil Magistrate</hi> may do it no withstanding: to this purpose I have been answered when I have askt in way of querie the sense of that place. To which I say,</p>
            <p>First, that by the <hi>Field</hi> is most necessarily meant the <hi>World,</hi> and not the <hi>Church.</hi> First Christ so expounds it himself, <hi>the field</hi> (saith he) <hi>is the World</hi>: but, say they, the <hi>World</hi> is oft used to expresse the Church, and so may here. I reply, first, I deny that the word <hi>world</hi> in any one place of Scripture signifies the Church onely; it signifies sometimes the fabrick of the Universe. Secondly, it signifies all man kind good and bad collectively. Thirdly, sometimes the wicked onely that lie in wickednesse, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.13. <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. abstract and in contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction to the godly, and the Church, but never at all the Church, the godly, the Elect alone abstract, and as in contradistinction to the wicked: and though I know how far forth to maintain their absurd doctrines in other cases some <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi> divine such a matter, yet till they shew more for it then they have ever shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, or I am sure can shew out of the word (not denying but that there is a number <hi>electorum (i. e.)</hi> all that believe and obey Christ, <hi>exmundo electus</hi>) their <hi>Mundus electorum</hi> is <hi>haud mundus dialectus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, here it cannot be the Church however, because it is <hi>vox secundae intentionis,</hi> a speech that is expounded by Christ to be the sense of the other speech of <hi>field</hi> he used before, for if the word <hi>world</hi> were ever used for the <hi>Church,</hi> it must be by a figure <hi>synechdoche,</hi> whereby a smal snip of it is signified by the whole, and then Christ speaks figuratively again in his Exposition of the other figurative word <hi>field,</hi> which were <hi>incertum per incertum,</hi> to open one <hi>paraboricall</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pression by another as <hi>paraboricall</hi> as that, which who can think Christ did to his Disciples, to whom his intent was to speak more plain, that they might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand him, but understand him they could not well, if while he spake figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively at first, he did not speak properly at last however; for whereas he had told them the <hi>field</hi> was the <hi>World,</hi> they had as much need to have asked again what the <hi>world</hi> was, if they could not think he meant plainly as he said.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Church is exprest usually by the name of Christ's <hi>Garden, Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard</hi>
               <pb n="542" facs="tcp:109011:280"/>

            <p>Fourthly, if by <hi>Field</hi> and <hi>World</hi> here is meant the <hi>Church,</hi> then twill follow, that sith the <hi>Tares, i. e.</hi> false <hi>Worshippers, Hereticks, Antichristians</hi> are bid to be let alone untill the harvest, that such as these may be tolerated, not in the world or <hi>civil state</hi> onely with the <hi>Church,</hi> but also in the very Church it self, which toleration cannot be, for God chides that Church that suffers <hi>Iezebel</hi> to teach fornication in her; and if the <hi>P P Priesthood</hi> plead for such a Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as this (as he had need considering how his Church is filled with tares more then he is either able, or willing to root out) then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Ans.</hi>
               </note>Some who are those I trow? it must be then either the <hi>Ministry,</hi> or the <hi>Magistracy:</hi> not the <hi>Ministry,</hi> for it is far more cleer, that by the servants here, that took notice of the tares to the housholder, is meant the servants of Christ in the office of <hi>Ministers,</hi> that would fain have been meddling (as the false Ministry ever does) to root out all both out of <hi>Church,</hi> and world too, that is not of institution by Christ in their opinion, and such a spirit may too much shew it self in the true too, see the like Spirit in his own disciples the first <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters Luke</hi> 9.54.55. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.12.13.14. for which Christ gives them a check, and tells them they knew not what spirit they were of, and bids them let the false plants alone to the heavenly Father to pluck up in his time, saying <hi>let them alone they be blind leaders of the blind,</hi> and <hi>will both</hi> in due time <hi>fall into the ditch</hi>: tis far more clear I say that tis his <hi>Ministry</hi> he here forbids, then common disciples, for why should not their <hi>Ministry</hi> complain of them aswell as they? yet he bids these let them alone, which shewes too that tis the <hi>World,</hi> and not the <hi>Church</hi> they are to stand in, for it belongs properly enough, and primarily to the <hi>Ministers,</hi> with consent of the Church, executively to passe the censure of putting them out of the Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly not the Magistracy, for if it were the <hi>Church</hi> as they say it is, how miserably do they mope (and yet so the Priest does) that make him the highest officer in the Church to cast persons out of the Church, who is (though the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est officer over the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>World</hi> too, yet in truth) no <hi>Church</hi> officer, or <hi>Minister</hi> in the Church (<hi>qua</hi> Church) at all.</p>
            <p>Besides lastly, which puts all out of doubt, the prohibition is to all men as well as some, and sounds forth the mind of Christ to be, that the tares shall stand in the <hi>Field</hi> till the harvest, and not be pluckt up by any at all, but stand till the harvest they cannot according to his will, if according to his will either <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,</hi> or <hi>Minister</hi> might pluck them up, out of the field, what field ere tis that is here spoken of: his will is not only that such shall not pluck them up, but that they shall not be pluckt up until the <hi>harvest,</hi> i. e. the end of the world, till he sends his <hi>Angels</hi> to gather the <hi>tares,</hi> all things that offend, every plant, that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly father hath not planted, out of his Kingdome, which taken at large is the whole world, and to bundle them for the fire. To all these many more reasons may
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:109011:280"/>
be added why the Magistrate may not force men at all in matters of <hi>faith, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Religion,</hi> worship, see <hi>Barbers</hi> answer to the <hi>Essex watchmens watch-word,</hi> p. 7. &amp;c. the <hi>Magistrate</hi> receives no charge from God about Religion, neither is <hi>cura ammarum,</hi> but <hi>cura corporum</hi> onely committed to him. <hi>Luther</hi> himself was of this mind, that the Lawes of the <hi>Magistrate</hi> extended no further then to the bodies and goods, that which is external, and that God would have none to rule in the soul, but himself, therefore where the <hi>Magistrate</hi> goes about to govern in the conscience, he usurps that jurisdiction, which God reserves to himself, certainly this is that great arrogany in the <hi>Whore</hi> or <hi>Woman</hi> of sin, which God will severely punish, in that <hi>S S Shee</hi> gives lawes to the conscience, and sits in the Temple and Church of God as a God.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> in Parliament 1609 said, That <hi>it is a sure rule in Divinity that God never loves to plant his Church with violence and blood,</hi> and again in his <hi>Apology</hi> for the oath of <hi>Allegeance</hi> p. 4. speaking of the <hi>Papists</hi> that took the said oath, <hi>That he gave a good proof of it that he never intended persecution for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, but onely desired to be secured of them for civil abuses, that it was usually the condition of Christians to be persecuted, but not to persecute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, Faith and repentance to acknowledgement of the truth is Gods gift (and if wee'l believe our Clergy) no way in every mans power, no not by gift from God to perform, and so the Magistrate must punish men belike, because God, who gives where he lists, does not give them to believe &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Again Blasphemers, Persecutors, as <hi>Paul,</hi> Idolators, as the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> yea <hi>Iewes, Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> may be converted in time by the word, therefore are not to be plucked up out of the Earth, for then they can never possibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</p>
            <p>Again persecution was never taught by Christ nor practised by his Apostles, but arose among Heathens, and was continued by (the <hi>Roman</hi>) Antichrist, and his Ministers.<note n="*" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Yet theres one way more, whereby they evade all this, and that is by denying that by the <hi>Tares</hi> here are meant <hi>Hereticks, False Worshippers,</hi> and <hi>Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and asserting them to be <hi>Hypocrites</hi> in the Church; and this is the way of Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> (whereby you may see again how Divines are divided among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in all things almost, as well as some) which Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> in a book, which
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:109011:281"/>
the <hi>Bloody Tenet</hi> relates to gives out (as I remember) that by <hi>tares</hi> is meant <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites</hi> in the Church, who are so like the <hi>wheat,</hi> that they cannot well be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, nor discerned from it, and so must be let alone in the Church, by the Ministers of the Church, least they mistake and pluck up <hi>wheat</hi> instead of <hi>tares,</hi> and cast out men for <hi>hypocrites,</hi> who its possible may be sincere for ought we know.</p>
            <p>In answer to which I must confesse men that cast out persons for <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> had need be pretty wary, and not overhasty, yea better an inconvenience than a mischief; bet<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er erre in letting some <hi>Hypocrites</hi> stand in the Church, then for hast cast out one that seemes to be so to us, and yet is not.</p>
            <p>But this is not the sense of our Saviour in this place, for as it cannot be the Church that the <hi>Tares</hi> are here bid to be let alone in (as I have shewed above) so much lesse by the tares can be meant <hi>hypocrites,</hi> so neer the <hi>wheat,</hi> i. e. true Saints in shew, and likenesse, and pretence, as to be hardly discerned from them. For</p>
            <p>First, Though <hi>Hypocrites</hi> are like Saints, and appear so to be oft, it may be alwaies, to the deceiving of us, yet the Tares are not at all like the <hi>wheat,</hi> nor at all to any, but such as are stark blind, appearing to be wheat.</p>
            <p>Secondly, an <hi>Hypocrite</hi> in the Church (who is one that app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ars to be what he is not) must be supposed while he is in the Church, to be discovered, or not discovered so to be, when not discovered, he is no hypocrite to us, to whom things are, as they appear (what ere he may be to God) but as true a Saint as the rest; and when discovered (till when to us he is a Saint, and must stand under the notion of a Saint) then he must not stand in the Church, which is not to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor any that are palpably wicked, and who is so palpable as he, whose <hi>simulata sanctitas</hi> is <hi>dulplex iniquitas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now First, the tares hee spoken of are plainly <hi>said,</hi> and seen to be <hi>tares,</hi> and appeare to be <hi>tares,</hi> and a distinct stuff from the <hi>Wheat</hi>; and yet for all that they are bid to be let alone in the <hi>Field,</hi> as <hi>hypocrites</hi> must not be in the <hi>Church,</hi> when they appear to be such.</p>
            <p>But in the field, i. e: the world tis true enough that hypocrites may stand, even after they are cast out of the Church, unlesse they act any thing that civil justice will reach them for, and so also may Antichristians, and all false Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</p>
            <p>Tis evident then that in this place, as well as <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.13.14. that in the time of the Gospel Church, <hi>Tares that</hi> much hinder the wheat, that are min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in the same <hi>Field, world, Civil States, Countreyes, Common-wealths,</hi> of Satans sowing among the <hi>Wheat, Weeds, Nettles, Bryers, Thorns, Plants</hi> that are not of the heavenly Fathers planting, <hi>Fa<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

rooted out in hast by the civill power, before his time.</p>

I suppose not, but that he must have left all to their waies, and have practised it himself, and protected it from injury, and propounded it to all in way of preaching, but not prosecuting any by his civil power, if they would yet remain Jewes or heathens; and Christ might as easily have made Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors his Disciples had he meant that the Gospel should be established by civil power.</p>
            <p>And this is for the further safegard, and advantage to the <hi>wheat</hi> (as I sayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) for <hi>Christ</hi> gives this reas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n why he would have the tares to be let alone, least by rooting out the tares, the wheat be rooted out also: for if all religions may stand, then the true one may stand in quiet, without disturbance, if all people may <hi>walk every one in the name of his God, Mich.</hi> 4.5. then we may <hi>walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever,</hi> but if all be beaten down in a state, and but one stand, ten thousand to nothing it is not the truth that is there establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed: for truth may be trodden down, but treads not down others in a violent way of persecution.</p>
            <p>Besides if true Religion establish it self alone in some States, by forcing men to subject to it, its gives a bad example to false religions in other states, that think themselves in the right, to do the like, and force men that love the truth there, to submit to them, and so theres <hi>quit</hi> for <hi>quo,</hi> and no end of disturbances, they saying that we are <hi>Tares,</hi> we that they are, and so there is nothing but pulling up by the roots, if toleration be not tolerated, as the most peacemaking principle, and so in these bussles if the <hi>wheat</hi> grow alone some where, it must fall elsewhere, even every where, where the <hi>tares</hi> are resolved to stand alone, and so <hi>Homo Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni Lupus, Christianus Christiano Diabolus,</hi> men must be wolves and devils each to other throughout the world.</p>
            <p>Besides, if the power in any place be ignorant, and under an erring conscience that <hi>conscientia errans,</hi> will oblige him, seemingly to himself at least, to tread down truth, and set up false hood, and all this by a law, yea if the <hi>Magistrate</hi> take the part of any religion against all other, so as to establish it alone, and root out them, whether it be the true one or a false one that he sets up, not tolerating all others, but forcing them to submit to it, the mischief is in a manner intolerable, on either hand; for if false, have not we all felt the smart of being forc't to false wayes, <hi>Smectimnus</hi> as well as others? if he hath not forgotten the groans, that for liberty of conscience came once out of his own mouth, while he was crusht under him, that was crusht under the Popedom, but in the <hi>Marian</hi> dayes above: but if true the forcing men to own it before they see ground freely to receive it, makes a world of formalists, of nominal Christians, who had as good be nothing at all, as no better then they are, &amp; of hypocrites, which are worse then nought, the worst sinners
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:109011:282"/>
in the world: for is it not better for me to remain a Jew under a blind conscience, till I see the truth, then to turn Christian against my (though blinded conscience) for fear of men, before convinc't, or before I yet see it to be the truth? a forced feigned profession for fear of men, if it happen to be of the truth it self, is at best but <hi>splendidum peccatum a guilded sin.</hi> Besides tis to weave the spiders webbe as <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. to make laws and penalties to bind conscience, which brawny conscienc't men can creep ore, let them be what they will, as we see in <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> dayes, and in the Popes time, and ever since, all people for fear fall down and worship the golden image the King and Clergy sets up, save such as fear God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And if it be thought that if the civil power take not the part of truth (as I wonder where and when ever it did,</hi>

               <hi>at least since</hi> Constantines <hi>times, till of late) it will be lost more in the croud of errors and Heresies, that will ensue a general toleration, then any other way it can</hi>:</p>

            <p>Wherefore I again humbly represent that grave Councel of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> whose reason is good, to all the civil Magistrates throughout the earth, by whose subjects tis sharpely controverted, and zealously quaeried what is truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that they refrain from meddling more with men, though they seem mad men to the world, and besides themselves for the sake of truth in pretence, lest happily they be found fighters against God, for if any way be not of God, twill in Gods time come to nought of it self, and ye cannot establish it, if of God you cannot withstand it, but twill come on, in this juncture specially, wherein it dawns toward the great day, and God is about to pluck up every plant he hath not planted; And if men be in your apprehension blind leaders of the blind in things of God, yet let them alone, if they will not go to the right way when called to it, they will see, when they both fall into the ditch. And likewise I humbly beg that what is further and more clearly held forth concerning this subject of liberty of conscience by Mr. <hi>Blackwood,</hi> in the first part of his storming of Antichrist, may be well weighed by our Magistrates, together with the thirty quaeries presented to them lately by Mr. <hi>Iohn Goodwin,</hi> and his vindication of them against the <hi>Apologist,</hi> neither of which ever will be answered solidly by their parish Ministers.</p>
            <p>And as for the P P Priesthood it self (though I hope the night is too farre spent for any (save such as will be ignorant, and if any man will be ignorant, let him be ignorant saith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.28. and so say I) to doubt but that the day is dark over them and theirs) they are blind leaders of the blind in many things, which many others see, of whom yet they are asham'd to learn, and which is worse, such as stand not a little in their own light, by snuffing at it that the <hi>Rus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set Rabbies,</hi> and <hi>Clergy of Laicks</hi> should presume to instruct them more perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the way of God, which God in these daies (wherein the last must be first, and the first last) will subject the proudest spirited Priests in Christ'ndom to take from some illiterate, and perhaps, non-sensical, yet honest hearted Saints stammerers in speech, babes (with them bablers) as of old eloquent <hi>Apollos</hi> from <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla,</hi> or else it may be hid from their eyes.</p>
            <p>And though what they would not that others do to them, when they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derlings each to other, they have done unto all other professions, that were under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings to them in the day of their raign, hasting what they could to the hunting of the Sectaries out of their synagogues (or their native rights and enjoyments therein)
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:109011:283"/>
which they have subjugated to be their Synagogues, counting the compasse of whole Common-weals, and Kingdomes little enough for them to Lord it over, and set their several names of <hi>Papal, Prelatical,</hi> or <hi>Presbyterian</hi> there, confounding, and <hi>Babilonishly</hi> blending Church &amp; State Power together, so that twas hard for any token clearly which was which, or to know where to set the sole of his foot almost upon European ground in any Nation, but he and all (his conscience and all) must come under the command, and fall within the verge of some or other of their mercilesse Church Monarchies, yet neverthelesse my humble desire to the powers on their behalf is that they may be tolerated and protected in the practise of what profession, Religion, way of worship, doctrine, discipline, or Church-government soever they see occasion among themselves, and such as shall see occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to cleave to them, or any of them, to set up, so far as they shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to build their several BBBabels without that blood of souls and bodies of men, in which they have imbrued both their own, and the Princes hands of the Christian Nations in former dayes: I heartily plead for a toleration for them, if ever the power shall (as not a few people already do) discern them to be as <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,</hi> and <hi>Schismatical</hi> from the truth, as they have judged all others to be, such toleration I mean, as may not be inconsistent with the toleration of all other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and professions of Religion in the several nations in peace together with them, and in security from such searches as have been made by their Surrogates Paritors and Proctours &amp;c. after men as unsufferable <hi>Schismaticks</hi> that side not with them: but a toleration of them in that wonted Tyranny of treading all under their feet, and plucking up all plants by the roots that live beside them by the civil power, when they once have censured them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I wish well to the persons of the men called CCClergy (God is my witnesse) but I wish not so well to their way as to wish it up in the way wherein they would have had it: and yet I here wish they may have their way too, abating us no more of it then their unreasonable wonted wishes, that the state would allow no wayes but their own, let them pare off that knotty piece from off their principle, wherein they pray the Powers to beat all men into the belief of all they say by the sword, the belief of which they can never beat into them by the word, then let them and their party practise what they please: let their way be no way of civill violence to all other wayes and then in civil peace let them walk in it till they are weary: and let it stand till by the word it fall before the true one, if it be such a noun Adjective that it cannot stand by it self in Scripture, sense and Reason, without such a Substantive as the civil sword to support it, tis a sign that theres far more shew, then Substance in it: for verily that Gospel that will not stand not onely without, but against the edge of <hi>Caesars</hi> sword encountring with it, is Antichrists, but none of Christs Gospel to me: yet such it seems is the CCClergies Gospel, which freedom to set it up by other wayes leaves still as helplesse, as hopelesse, of ever standing, unlesse it may be stablisht against all other wayes, on the necks of all people by the carnal weapons of <hi>Caesars</hi> civil State; its very doubtful of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the feild with no other strength then its own Canons, unlesse the state lend it her ordinances to back them: but if <hi>Baal</hi> be a God, me thinks he might speak

for himself against them that throw down his Altars, without imploring all the Gods of the earth to speak for him; if the Multitude of his Priests cannot set up his worship, without the Magnitude of earthly Princes to relieve them, let it go, and a good riddance of it too, if Dagon <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Sam</hi> 5.24</note> cannot stand on his own legs, but must fall before the Ark, unlesse the benevolence of others lift him up, his PPPriests may set him up as much as they will for themselves, but they shall never set him up again for me. Neverthelesse I am as freely willing, sith tis the will of Christ, and his Testament, that even <hi>Baalitish, Romish</hi> worshippers should have a Room, and being in the world by the civil Magistrates permission, they yielding civil sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection <note n="*" place="margin">which he hath more faith then I that believes they ever will for surely the CCClergies <hi>Win all or lose all</hi> will pull them down at last.</note> even to the end thereof, as I am willing there should be a Room and being in it for the truth, for though the Prophets of <hi>Baal</hi> were put to death in reforming <hi>Elijahs</hi> time, in the old Church of Israel, which was the type, yet that pointed out no more then that spiritual execution, which is to be done on <hi>Iezebel,</hi> and her false worships in the true Church in these reforming times of the Gospel, not one of which may abide any more in the Gospel Israel; yea I here seriously sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate the civil Powers for them, that their consciences no more then ours may be forced by any forinsecal power to act in Church worships contrary to their conviction, but if nought will content the <hi>PPPriesthood</hi> at all (as of old it would not) but that all <hi>Hereticks,</hi> as they call them, that hearken not to their <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> must be clublawd into conformity to their parochial precepts, so far at least as to obey the <hi>Hue</hi> and <hi>Cry</hi> of their purses, without free leave from their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences so to do, then (protesting against the iniquity of their desires after the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of those, who desire the protection of them from persecution by the civill Power) my most humble suit to the supreme Powers is, that they will be pleased, as to let the <hi>PPPriesthood</hi> preach as much as they please (a little of which work serves the turns of some of them) and to let such as are satisfied in their Souls and spirits, that they ought to do both, to own and pay them, so to let such as seem to themselves on sufficient grounds to have clear cause to decline them, have the freedome of their consciences to be none of their flocks, and being none of their flocks, a freedom from being forcibly fleec'd by them any more; and if the CCClergy shall he Angry at this without a cause, to let them be pleased without amends, sith tis most evident, that as men ought not to be constrained against their wills, to be of Christs, much lesse of the <hi>CCClergies</hi> flock, so he that feedeth a flock may freely, and not by force, live of the milk of that flock he feeds, and may not of them that are forrainers to his flock, further then they are free to supply him: they went forth freely to preach the Gospel for his names sake, taking nothing, much lesse by force, of the Gentiles, that were Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters to the Church of old, <hi>Iohn Ep.</hi> 3. v. 7. and many heathenish Parishes here have the Gospell preacht freely to them when they accept on it by the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, that go forth of the true churches at this day, but many Parish Ministers will make all that live, or have to do within their line, buy their Sermons of them, and that at their own price too, whether they like them or no, and, which is worse, though they have sold them once, it may be often, ore already (and a dear penniworth too) yet as oft as they remove to other livings, they carry them away along with them in their papers from the people, that have already bought and paid for them, preach them ore again, and so sell them for as much more in other places: but I hope the civil power throughout <hi>Europe,</hi> as well as they do in the tenth part of it already, will take cognizance ere long, that it can be no great ease to truly tender consciences, who with the <hi>CCClergy</hi> are ever stiled <hi>Sectaries</hi> and <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> to lie under the lash of these Lords over Gods heritage, and in tender consideration thereof, and compassion to those righteous souls, who are vexed with their vanities, proclaim such a <hi>Iubilee</hi> that the true spouse of <hi>Christ,</hi> whom they made a keeper of their vineyard, shall have leave to keep her own vine yard, &amp; go forth from her Apprenticeship to these spiritual Task-masters, that their

            <p>Good Sirs, what mean you by this? shall the Parliament and their Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees never have their liberty to attend onely, and perfectly the true liberties of the subject? nor be at quiet from this wearisome work of approving, and setling of ministers, that are men mostly so unsetled in their minds that they'l never (if they have such liberty to leave, as you here allow them) settle longer in one place, then till they have more means, or be more to their minds in another? had this piece been propounded by parish ministers and people it had become them, as sounding somewhat sutable to their posture and principle, for tis the usual tone they talk in, when one Pastor having left them, to take up another call from Christ, or imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment somewhere else to his advantage, they addresse to the Committee for the approbation or settlement of such or such a godly <hi>Orthodox</hi> Divine among them, as they have agreed with (if they can get the Committees good will, for till then all parties are not agreed it seems among either you or them) to be their minister: but to see them, whom I suppose to be Independents (for I am sure they are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent men that propose the next parcel <hi>viz. Thomas Goodwin, Nye Simpson</hi> whose propositions these approve of) to see I say Independents flocks de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, it may be half a year, on Committees to have their Pastors approved on, and settled by the Committees among them me thinks is something shameful: I rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned that the Independent Churches had reckoned themselves to have had the sole power not onely of choosing, and presenting, but of approving, settling and ordaining their own Pastors among themselves (but I see I am deceived) and why may not the Church onely without the Committee approve of her own ministers, to be <hi>Orthodox,</hi> and be able to minister in their assemblies and meetings, as well as to approve of such of her members to be Orthodox, and allow them to speak
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:109011:297"/>
as she shall judge fit to speak, for in the next proposal but one or two, it appears you judge she (without the Committee) may approve of such.</p>
            <p>And what mean you by your <hi>Pastors leaving you to take up some other call or imployment</hi>? are your Pastors also such Idol shepheards, as it may be supposed now and then will leave their flocks for any other imployment? what imployment may they lawfully leave their flocks for, with whom they are in fellowship so as to stand Pastors no more among them? is their any worldly imployment to which the Pastors office must give way so to as to cease for its sake, when it comes in place? I know but one employment in honour, and excellency beyond that good work of a Bishop, or overseer among his flock, as namely that of <hi>Apostleship,</hi> or <hi>Messengership</hi> from the Church, to convert the world, if it be that you mean, Ile have you excused, in choosing you other <hi>Pastors</hi> to oversee you in the Lord, in your Messengers absence from you to preach to the world, but other imployment I know none more honourable then the <hi>Ministership,</hi> for which its worthy to be left by them that have food and raiment in it: neither count I it perferment, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy for a <hi>Minister</hi> to be removed from his <hi>Ministership,</hi> and <hi>Servant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> in feeding the sheep of Christ, over which the holy spirit makes him overseer, though it be to a <hi>Lordship,</hi> a <hi>Mastership,</hi> a <hi>Presidentship,</hi> a <hi>Deanship</hi> ore a colledg, whether that Colledge be Christs Church also, yea or no; specially if that fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Smite the Shepheard with some better employment, and then all his sheep that were gathered may be scattered, and separate themselves together into severall places: I like this but a little, and am confident Christ Jesus likes it lesse: if you can follow any manual imployment for your livings, as <hi>Paul</hi> and others did, and preach the Gospel too to make it as much as may be without charge, I like it well but I am jealous you'l make a trade too much of the Gospel too.</p>
            <p>You propound that <hi>none presume under a penalty to speak in any Assemblies, or meetings but ministers of the word, members of Churches approved, except meetings purposely for disputing, and that where meetings be kept up likewise, persons speak there that have Commission from some right constituted Church, or certificate from two or more able, godly, Orthodox ministers, of their suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency to speak, and soundnesse in the faith, except Masters to their families, Schoolmasters to their Schollars, or others to such, as by their callings fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their government or charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then at least civil Magistrates may speak any where within their verge, without certificate of their sufficiency so to do, to the people, that by reason of their call fall under their Government and charge, but others may not, though the spirit moves them, unlesse they can obtain a certificate from some Ministers.</p>
            <p>Sirs, what mean you to muzzle men up in this manner under penalties, from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening their mouths to speak, unlesse they bring testimonials, and certificates from men? if any man speak from God, God will give testimony to him by assisting him to speak honestly at least, though weakly and plainly; if God do not testifie to any man that speaks, so but that the hearers judge him insufficient, or that he speaks weakly, and sillily, and see that God leaves him to utter error, they may leave him too if they please, if it be free for men (as it never was under the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood) to refuse what they find not to be truth; and as they like it not to let it alone: them therefore that are weak in the faith receive, and entertain, though they have no pastport or orders from men to shew, you may sometimes entertain angels una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares: and what if God stop that mans mouth (as he may do when he pleases (the spirit blowing where it lists) who has mans testimony of sufficiency, &amp; from whom thers the greatest expectation, and does somtimes when men dote on men, yea and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens

            <p>Tis propounded by Mr. <hi>Owen,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Goodwin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Nye</hi> Mr. <hi>Sympson, that such as do not receive, but oppose those principles of Christian Religion, without the acknowledgement whereof the Scriptures do clearly and plainly affirm that Salvation is to be obtained, may not be suffered to preach or promulgate any thing in opposition unto such principles</hi>:</p>
            <p>But in this verily I am not satisfied at any hand, for not to acknowledge Iesus Christ to be the Christ, but to deny him to be the Son of God, when he is plainly preached is not to receive, but oppose those principles of Christian Religion, the non-acknowledgement of which, where Christ at least is made known, is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly inconsistent with salvation; yet thus did the Iews when Christ in person was among them, contradicting, blaspheming him, as also the <hi>Samaritans</hi> did not receive him, yet the civil powers of the world had no power from Christ to curb them, and not suffer them to say what they would against Christ sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and solely I say because of that: neither find I (as before) any warrant in the word for <hi>Caesar</hi> the civil powers of the world to prohibit, or <hi>sub paena</hi> any false Religions, from standing, growing, preaching, promulgating, practising their own principles, be they Jews, or Heathen Romans, or Dianitish Ephesians, in their several dominions under the Gospel any more then to prohibit the true Christian Religion it self: All Religions lived under <hi>Caesar</hi> in Christs and the Apostles dayes, and were not by him persecuted, nor constrained, either to be of his Religion, nor to say nothing against it, nor against any other: in after times indeed when the Emperours grew bloody against the Christians, all Religions li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved quietly under <hi>Caesar,</hi> but the Christian; that was worse then nought, and I think it not a little too bad, and not doing (as our duty is) to all men as we desire they should do to us, but the way back to Priestly blindnes, if we put <hi>Caesar</hi> on now, because he is a Christian, to let the Christian Religion live quietly under him, and none else: for my part I dare not desire that the Jews may not, not onely live, but till, they see better, serve, God in their wayes of worship in the State as well as others, for a being they must have somewhere, and may no where without sin, if not here, for is it more sin for one Common-wealth to let false worshippers live in it, till they see the truth, then for another? yea and let them and others too preach and promulgate even all that ere they can for their way.</p>

            <p>So I have done with you my dear friends of the Independent way, and shall wait and pray that you may first laying, as your foundation, &amp; then leaving, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the doctrine of Christ, go on unto perfection.</p>

            <p>I do not speak this to excite men to make such a bone fire of all books, but the bible, as Dr. <hi>Featley</hi> saies <hi>Iohn Matthias</hi> made p. 165. and yet (by the Clergies leave) I dare not say as Dr. <hi>Featly</hi> there saies, that <hi>twere better all those who</hi> (in his sense) <hi>are obstinate Sectaries</hi> (for many such are pretious Saints) <hi>were burnt at a stake, then that such a bone fire were made,</hi> for I know no absolute necessity to the salvation of men, of the being of any book in the world but the bible; which as it was once alsufficient to make men wise to salvation, without looking into any other, and before there were many other besides it, so I know not (sith we have them in such plainness as now we have (maugre all the malice of the Pope and Clergy, who would once have made a bone fire of the Scriptures) why it is not as alsufficient as heretofore, whilst yet there was no more Gospel Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then in self: but I speak it to excite the CCClergy (for whom I have great sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of heart to see their miserable neglect of, &amp; wretched ignorance in the Scriptures) to give more attendance to the reading of them, as which are alsufficient, and onely necessary to a Minister, if there were no other books at all besides them; &amp; to fix them that have been erratical in the misty moon shine of mens inventions, under the sun shine of that unspeakably glorious Orb, I mean the Scripture, which many Clergy men in Christndom have been so far from being skild in, that we may well conceive, that they never so much as look into it at all. Sure <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and <hi>Clement</hi> and the Ministry that was Coetaneons, and immediately succedane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto them, were more pretious Ministers then any are now adaies, and yet they never read Sainr <hi>Origen,</hi> nor Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> nor any of those millions of Rabbies, Schoolmen, and Scribes that have scribled since, having learn't no more Gospel then what the Scriptures learnt them, for I do not think they had
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:109011:309"/>
such libraries of books as are now pleaded for, which Scripture we have as free accesse to as they then had; and have time enough to read, and preach, and do somewhat else toward an honest livelihood too, as well as they, if we be not idle, and sith its pleaded that their prophecying was an extraordinary gift, of the holy spirit, but preaching now is a special faculty attained not without many years stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the constant course of it maintained by constant study: I say our prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyings in the Church, and preachings to the world too, either are or ought to be all one with theirs, or else we are not as we should be: and as no man was a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister then, but by a gift from above, so I know no man (though Dr. <hi>Featly</hi> knew so many, that not one among an 100 of the Country Clergy, had any tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gift of <hi>extempore</hi> prayer) that is a Minister of Christ, but the same way as they then were <hi>viz.</hi> by a gift in some fort to make out the mind of men to God in prayers, and the mind of God to men in preaching, whether to the Church in way of exhortarion, edification, and comfort (for that was Prophecie 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.1.) or to the world in publishing the glad tidings of Gods love to it, which is more properly preaching: I know no new way that Christ hath chosen to make Ministers in, since the primitive times, he did not make his Ministers then by gifts, and now by no gifts, nor yet by new gifts, he did not make Ministers then by gifts given, and now by gifts gotten, then from above, and now from beneath, then from heaven; and now from the universities, then from meer knowledge of the Scriptures, and now from a muddy minglement, and mixt messe of science falsely so called, or skill in his Scriptures, and mens Scriptures together; then by a simple spiritual Donation, and now by a simple fleshly Dronation in the Hive of such humane preparatives, as the Clergy conceive the spirit to be in a manner so concerned to blow upon, as if he could scarce have their free leave to breath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides them, but as he gave then, and powred out his spirit as he saw good, and more ordinarily upon men that were not learned, and wise with the wisdome of this world then on those that were, so he does now in these latter daies, not tying himself to men, whose education is at universities, more then to others, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more frequently filling men illiterate, as to such science, and secular Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans then such as those.</p>
            <p>I confesse the CCClergies preaching is a faculty attained by many years study, and yet when they have been seven years, and oftentimes seven more, Apprentices in the Universities, they are fitter for a living then for preaching too<note n="*" place="margin">

               </note>, but the preaching of the true Ministers is no such thing.</p>
            <p>Nor am I against any mans studying in order to the receiving of any good, or gift, from Christ, and his spirit, and in order to increase, and growth in any spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual gift, that Christ hath freely bestowed upon them <note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15.16.</note>, so their study be that of <hi>Timothy,</hi> who from a child was verst in the holy Scriptures, yea I wish to the Lord our men in order to the Ministry would meddle more there then they do, for school students are too great strangers to the study thereof, whilst they surfeit on Logical and Theological systems so much, as to suffer themselves implicitely to be sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned besides the true sense of Scripture thereby: but I hope the study of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which may fully fit a man for good a improvement of himself in the Gospel, need not claim so much honourable maintenance, but that a man may maintain himself by some other calling, and treasure them up in his spirit too in good time, by his dayly commerce with them, so as out of that good treasury of his heart to bring forth good things without much a do, and such a do as Clergy men make about a text and sermon, dividing, devising, and inventing, more then free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly venting the word from the richnesse of its dwelling in them, yea and so as to be like a good Scribe throughly instructed to the Kingdom of God, and bringing out of his treasury <hi>extempore</hi> upon all accasions, things new and old, and not be like a narrow mouthed bottle long in filling, and as long in flowing out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="602" facs="tcp:109011:310"/>Though therefore there is a power to take pay in some cases for the work of preaching, yet first its good that power be not used without necessity, but you O PPPriests, through covetuousnesse do much abuse that power, by using it to the utmost when yet you need not, yea though many of you have means enough of your own, and may live fully and preach freely too.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It must be upon the Church only, upon the brethren, on believers, and not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the world, nor the Gentiles or unbelievers, that the Church-ministers must<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, for that will hinder the receipt of the Gospel very much among them, if they find it a chargeable Gospel before they own it, therefore those that preached to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers and infidels to convert them to the faith, went forth at first freely, for the name sake of Christ, taking nothing of the Gentiles 2. <hi>Ep. Iohn</hi> 7.8. But you O PPPriests receive pay from any men, all men of whom you any can way have it, as well infidels, or unbelievers, as such as are obedient to the faith, for in your national and parochial Churches, there are not half, nor a tenth part of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, by your own confession, yea your Ministry supposes them to be infidells as yet, why else do you preach to convert them to the faith, and cry out there is few of them have the knowledge of God, that they are in a damnable state, and such like? or if you say these are not your Church, then it confirmes what I am saying, <hi>viz.</hi> that you expect pay from men, whether in church or out, whether Gentiles or Church-members, contrary to the primitive times, wherein the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Christ were not maintained by the nations.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It must be every Minister upon the particular flock he Ministers too, and feeds, and not another flock, that are fed by other Pastors, and do not chuse, nor own them to be their Ministers at all, for though the Messengers, whose mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry lay mostly in preaching to the world, and assisting all the Churches where they came, might and did as occasion was, not otherwise, take wages of more Churches then one, and sometimes of some churches (that might be richer and more free) to do other Churches service, that might happily be neither so full, nor forward, as see 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.8. yet the Scripture speaks thus, that such should eat of the flock that feed it 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. much lesse did the Pastor of one Church e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver take pay of the Pastor of another in the primitive times. But you parish Priests claim pay often of other flocks then your own; of the people of other parishes, that you never preach to, of the gathered Churches, and their Ministers too, as they happen to live, or to have or use houses or lands within such or such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts, that never own you nor never will do, to be their Pastors.</p>
            <p>Yea so it falls out sometimes, when one man occupies several pieces of land in so many several parishes, that if not seven, yet four or five Priests take hold on the skirt of one poor sheep of Christ, that belongs to some seperated congregation or other, and ownes never a one of them all to be his Pastor, saying we must have so much of thee for such land that lyes in such a place; and so you shall have several sheepheards at once at sharing time upon the back of one sheep, every one of them pretending to have some right or other to share him, when none of them all have any interest in him at all as his sheep, whilest he stands in relation to some other pastor: yea the true church may say of the Clergy constreining her to pay to them, and so to serve their false church and Ministry, as the spouse saith <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. <hi>they made me keeper of their vineyard,</hi> paymaster to their Priests, <hi>but my own vineyard have I not kept</hi> nor paid to my own pastors, for indeed how can they pay to these and them too?</p>
            <p n="4">4. This is to be done <hi>gratis</hi> willingly and freely to, by the church, but not wickedly to be forced from them by a foraneous power, and by other weapons then those of the Churches warfare, which are not guns, prisons; summons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Committees, strainings, trebble dammages, nor taxes from the civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, in whose nations the churches live, for no minister of <hi>Christs</hi> flock did ever run to beg of the civil Magistrate to force his flock to feed him, and to flea
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:109011:310"/>
his flock for him with his cutlash, if he could not constrain him by the consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of his love, and service, and freenes, and forwardnesse of his own accord for their good, as freely again to consider the necessity of his condition, and that is no wise in the way of tithes neither.</p>
            <p>But the parish Priest will not be contented with what is freely given him by them that own him, nor them that own him not, and are none of his neither, but he will have it whether they will or no, and be his own carver too, and have the tith, which Christ never alloted him to take, or rather the sixt, if it be of corn, considering the Husbandmans charges of plowing, sowing, reaping, binding, and standing to all hazard; for the Parson takes no paines, but to take the cleare tenth when its ready shockt to his hands, and is at no charges at all, save bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what it costs him to carry into his barn: and this he will have by fair meanes or foul, it matters not in what ravenous, hasty, trebble dammaging, forcible, shameful, scraping, ridiculous way, so he have it. <hi>Populus me sibilet at mihi plando</hi> &amp;c. I blush to see their basenesse in this particular.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Tis the Ministers duty to preach constanly, to be instant in season and out of season, to do his work as an Evangelist, and fulfil his ministry, and that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether the Church do their work, their duty to him, yea or no: yea, if from the world he be rewarded with naught but stripes, mocks, fcosss, and all the base usage that may be, yea the spoiling of his goods, yet must he preach, if he be a messenger to them: and if his flock be so poor that they cannot, or so hard hearted that they will not minister to his necessities, yet necessity lyes on him, and wo to him if he preach not, and, if he be able, help not those that are poor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them too.</p>
            <p>But many of you Priests if ye have never so much meanes of your own beside, whereby you are called to relieve such poor people as you rather peel, if it be but two pence almost that you say is due from them, will have your pay, or else it may chance to cost them three times three pence, and a better penny before you have done with them, you know no more necessitie lying on you to feed them, then lies upon the people to feed you, though they be far poorer then your selves, and you better fed then they taught; no pay no preach is your principle, so far at least that if one people give better pay, and one flock better milk then another, you are not onely under a liberty, but under a clear call also to leave one and cleave to the other.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Tis the Gospel he is to preach too, or else he can claim nothing at all by any order of Christ, the Church is not bound to maintain men, though in the name of ministers, that preach down, that preach against the Gospel.</p>
            <p>But the Lord will maintain a poor people in these latter daies that shall main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it to the faces of you PPPriesthood of the Nations, that you have been, and still are, till you repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus for remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sins, the most inveterate enemies the pure primitive Gospel hath, or ever had, since you reigned, to this very day, yet for all this you must be maintained, under the notion of the ministers of the Gospel, and that too in part by them that preach the Gospel freely, and a thousand fold more truely, purely, perfectly, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then your selves do; whether you do the work or no, yea though you work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Gospel, yet you must have Gospel wages, thus run greedily after the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of <hi>Balaam</hi> for reward, though you have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray from the Gospel, and are found defying, and some of you cursing, rather then building up, and blessing the true Israel of God that do his will, yet following the way of <hi>Balaam</hi> the son of <hi>Bosor,</hi> you love, and look to have wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and that of Israel too for this unrighteousnesse 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 15. <hi>Iude</hi> 11. But <hi>the love of the wages of Balaam St. Iude</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> too <hi>makes the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of false teachers, cursed speakers</hi>: Thus though you do not what is your duty to the people, which if you did Christs people at least (and from none
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:109011:311"/>
else are his ministers to require and expect maintenance, how far they may accept it is good to query) would be free to theirs, yet you'l force the people to do that which is more then their duty to you, and if men put not into your mouths, which are more open to call in tith then give out truth, you prepare war: and if any say unto you or your Assassinated Assigns, which you send for your tith, as some said of old to the Priests servants, when they came to take the Priests due, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more then their due out of the sacrifice, before they had offered, or done their part of service, let them do their duty first, and then take for them as much as thy soul desires, but we desire them to stay, and forbear to take the wages before they have done their work, or preacht the Gospel, which they pretend to take pay for, but for ought we find they preach against it, then these hasty hirelings, or the hirelings they hire to help them, like the rude servants of those wicked sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> the sons of <hi>Eli</hi> the Priests, who made themselves vile in this kind of fatting themselves, and many more (whose sin was therefore very great before the Lord, insomuch that the name of a Priest flunk, and was odious unto the people, and men abhorred the offering of the Lord for their sakes) make answer, nay but thou shalt give it me now, and if not I will take it by force, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 212. ad 30.7. Tis but a Ministration of meer necessaries, and meerly to necessities of Ministers that the Church is bound to Minister, even of them that do preach the Gospel, and not to Minister such superfluities as shall sink themselves, and hoise their Minister up to be a son of <hi>Anack,</hi> and themselves grashoppers, worth more then almost all the flock besides him, see <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.10.11.12.13: ad 17. so that he shall think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self too good to lay his hands to any labour.</p>

            <p>If all this treasuring up of trash be not covetousnesse, excuse me if I know not what else to make of it: it would make me laugh (as sorry as I am, for all such hereticizing and Schismatizing among the Ministers from primitive plainnesse, as hath been) to see a <hi>Clergy</hi> man stand up and tell me now, that much maintenance is a necessary means, whereby to enable ministers of <hi>Christ</hi> to promote the Gospell, specially if they consider how this covetousnesse hath caused the <hi>CCClergy</hi> in all <hi>CCChristendome</hi> to erre so miserably from the truth thereof after the traditions of one another, that some of the great Ghostly Fathers that had the greatest mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, if that could have maintained them in, or had not rather bewitcht them from it, did not onely turn rank <hi>Hereticks</hi> but stark <hi>Atheists</hi> by their sin of covetousnesse, when maintenance increased so much upon them: if either lucre or learning could prevent the corruption, or cure the ignorance of the Ministry, the Popes had not proved such incarnate devills as the richest, and the learnedst of them did.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth was indeed a great favourer of learning, and layer up of wealth, but so little favoured he of Religion, that he was oft times heard to say <hi>Quantas nobis divitias comparavit ista fabula Christi,</hi> a speech, saith <hi>Helin</hi> so blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, that <hi>Lucian, Porphirie,</hi> or <hi>Iulian</hi> the <hi>Apostate</hi> could never match it: in his time began the reformation by <hi>Luther,</hi> and twas but high time for thee Lord to begin, who wilt make an end also in thine own time, for men, yea thy ministers (for so they all call themselves) have throw covetousnesse utterly erred, and universally made void thy law.</p>

men the generation whose great and general displeasure I expect to fall under, and for this present works sake, to become your enemy more universally then ever yet, because I here tell you the truth: but (as little hope as I have to be heeded by you in what I say) I must tell you (and the Lord judge between you and me whether I speak the truth or not) I am so far from desiring the temporal, much more the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal destruction of any one of you, that as far as tis possible I would prevent both: yea if by the publication of all this I seek any thing next to Gods glory, more then the salvation as well of your own souls, as of such as are seduced and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snared by your spiritual sorceries in wayes of false worship, heresie, and Schism from the primitive truth will not the Lord at last find me out? nay verily I love the persons of you all as well as other mens; indeed I love you too well to spare sharpness toward you, or in silence suffer you to perish, as I verily believe (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore speak the more plainly to you, that by any means I may save some of you) without remedy you will do, persisting in your wonted obstinacy against the Gospel: this being the faith which God hath begotten me to, by a serious search and observation of the word and world together, the faith which he hath for some years made me to live in, and will (I trust if he call me to it) strengthen me to die in, rather then deny one jot of it to please men, good or bad, friend, or foe, unlesse it be discovered to me to be a false one, I must not be ashamed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse it for fear of them that kill the body, for then wo unto me from him that is able to destroy both soul and body in hell, and should I be altogether silent, as my fearful flesh would fain be, least I should prove an intollerable offence to my friends, and seem to be (as O my God thou knowest how far I am not) a self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger on my foes, and expose my self (as at no hand I desire to do, might it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided) to the hatred and hard censure of you all, the light of this truth would arise many other wayes, yea the Lord pleadeth it before you day by day by the tongues and pens of others besides my self, but I neverthelesse might be destroyed: I had at first illumination, and strong impulsions of spirit, not perceiving (like <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> who thought it had been <hi>Eli</hi> that called him, and not the Lord) whether it were the suggestion of Gods spirit or my own, and when at last I understood clearly that twas the Lord himself, that told me he would do such a thing to the house of <hi>Eli</hi> i. e. the Generation of the Priesthood as should cause the eares of all that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ear it to tingle, I feared likewise to shew <hi>Eli</hi> the vision, and was as loath to declare, as you OPPPriests are to hear the things concerning you here declared; I was ready to say to the Lord, send this message by the hand of him by whom thou wilt send, but necessity was upon me, yea wo unto me, my God had been a terrible one to me had I refused it, yea I may say as <hi>Ieremy Ier.</hi> 20.7.9. O Lord thou hast deceived me, and art stronger then I and hast prevailed, for I said I will not make mention of this, nor speak it in thy name, but his word was within me as fire in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay; he whose face onely I seek, that I may not be deceived, the light or louring of whose countenance is more to me then the favours or frowns of all faces, hath prest me in spirit to tell that on the house tops which he hath told me in the ear in a closet: what shall befal me in so doing I know not, save that the spirit witnesseth that affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions do every where abide me, and all those that will live godly in Christ Jesus, yet none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto me, that I may finish my race, and the ministry I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testifie the Gospel of the grace of God <hi>Act.</hi> 20.24. if your Ministry, Gospel, doctrine, Baptism be right, then ours is wrong, and if ever it appear we shall come back to you, if ours be right then yours is wrong, and must be declared that you may return to the truth. I know there are many things you will question (not to say quarrel with) me about,</p>
            <p>First, you'l ask me <hi>why I do not for the peace sake of the Church forbear, and keep my opinions in these points to myself, rather then publish them so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in print, as well as by word and penne, to the disturbance thereof</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="625" facs="tcp:109011:321"/>To which I say, if it be the truth I hold, and matter of weight withall, it wil excuse the promoting of it self, if it were to the distraction of the Church (which is to be subject to the truth, and not the truth to her) &amp; also to the distruction of the world, <hi>fiat justitia, aut pere at mundus,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the matters held forth here by me, which are mainly the falsness of your Ministry and baptism, are, as truth, so of such consequence as to be well worth discovering, if either <hi>Luther</hi> did well to declare against the Pope and Clergy of <hi>Rome,</hi> or your selves O Presbyters against Prelates, Deans and Chapters &amp;c. without regard to the several disturbances that were like to be consecutive there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: yea the true subject and manner of administration of baptism, which (when it serves your turn so to do) you call a circumstantial matter, a ceremony for which (if you should erre therein) none but weak &amp; querulous consciences will complain and separate, an indifferent thing for which why should we make so much ado? a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at, not to be streind at and such like, <hi>is so necessary a matter, one of the most necessary points of Religion, which those that erre in do most fearfully erre, and are totally deserted by the spirit of God,</hi> these are your own words.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, you talk much (and tis the language of the Pope to your selves since you rent from his Church) of the Church, and our holy mother the Church, and Ghostly fathers of the Church, and good and true tempered sons of the Church, and the peace of the Church, and Schismaticks in the Church, &amp;c. wherewith you astonish the vulgar, but I protest this day before God, and men, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against him, against whom you are Protestants also, but against your selves also his Schismatical sons, who own his ordinations, and still walk in some of his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, <hi>viz. Rantism, Parochial posture</hi> &amp;c. as those that are little lesse igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant then he, and his good sons, of both the true Church, and true peace thereof, whilst the truth, to which she should submit, is not regarded by you, and the very things that make a true visible Church, and are <hi>de esse</hi> and <hi>constitutive</hi> of it, so that abstract them, and you null it <hi>viz.</hi> true matter i. e. believers baptized, and true form i. e. free and not forced fellowship, both which are so in the Churches of <hi>England, Scotland, Italy, France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> are not onely wanting, but also trodden under your feet.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the peaceable way wherein we propagate these opinions, were you as sure they are erroneous, as I am that you'l once find them to be truth, will yet excuse, and acquit us from all guilt of disturbing the peace of either the world, or your Church, which is the world in reference to the true one; and unlesse you can say the Gospel of peace, which where ere it comes, occasions dissentions, is the cause of them, as in no wise it is, but mens lusts rather that rage, and take on against it, you cannot say our Gospel is; for it propounds them to the world in no other way then that, and that way was no other then bare propounding them: and as Christ and his disciples did not judge them here, though they will judge them most severely hereafter, who reject their words, by the power of the Magistrate, by the civil sword, by nailing to pillories, cutting off ears, slitting noses, whippings, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ines, confiscations, prisons, bonds, banishments, fightings, fire, and fagot, the bloody wayes whereby BBBabilon hath edified it self to that height of abomination, the Arguments whereby the CCClergy were wont to convert Hereticks quickly from all error to dust, and ashes; so if any man hear our words and reject them, well may we rebuke him sharply, as they also did, but we judge him not, in that way whereby the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> that hath levied war for his lusts sake against the whole earth, hath bereft all men of peace: neverthelesse the words that we speak to him, being those that Christ and his disciples have spoken in the world, the same will judge him at the last day.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>why</hi> (sith it must needs be supposed there be many Godly men among the Ministers of the Nations, though the most of them be wicked yet) <hi>I do not except, and exempt them, when I inveigh so heavily against the CCClergy? or

            </p>
            <p>To which I say,</p>
            <p>First, that <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Yet not denying but that there is a sprinkling of honest hearts <hi>quorum meliori luto finxit praecordia Titan,</hi> whom the sun of righteousnesse, as he lightens every man that cometh into the world, hath hatcht up into a higher predicament of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse then their fellowees, who are drawn up into some higher streins of devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then the rest, I adde further.</p>
            <p>Secondly, what are these littles to the lump? what is the gleaning to the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage? here and there one good man to the whole corrupt crue of them, that like Locusts, and Caterpillars have spread themselves together with the smoak of errors over the earth in three several swarms or armies? can some scores of well meaning Priests give the denomination of an holy <hi>PPriesthood,</hi> godly Ministry to those legions of them that lie in wickednesse? you may as well say theres a million of Saints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the men of the world, therefore reprove not the world for their sakes: such as these, who out of meer simple honestly, rather then sinful sophistry and mystical iniquity do stand, and act, and argue against the true way as they do, are <hi>Rarae aves,</hi> very few to the multitude of humanists, and sensual ones, and subtle subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Gospel (which yet they would seem to be Ministers of) for their own ends; by whom they are commonly so hated too so far as they have any more stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctnesse and sincerity then ordinary, that they are among the other of their brethren (as I was for querying after truth while I stood among them) as owles and bats baited by other birds: which few good grapes were they better then they are, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not denominate the whole vintage, as <hi>una hirundo non facit ver</hi>: BBBabilon is BBBabilon still, and SSSodom is SSSodom, and must be called so, though <hi>Lot</hi> live in it, and he called out of it too, unlesse he mean mean to perish with it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, those good men that are there (the mores the pitty that they are so) ought not to be suffered nor spared, but spoke to the rather themselves, and that very roundly too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for being and abiding in a bad way, and not the way it self, and those many bad men that are in it scape declaring against, as bad, because of them: there must be down-right dealing with upright men, when they are in a wrong way, and that indeed is the most upright dealing with them of all: yea <hi>Sirs,</hi> you that are upon the Account of these times for godly Ministers, let me say this to you, for verily I have sorrow of heart for some of you of my old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, my own flesh and blood, for whose sakes f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="627" facs="tcp:109011:322"/>
and protestations to go quite home with them, that are resolved for Sion? what mean you to stand so neer in affinity as to make one spiritualty, one spiritual fraternity with such fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>shly minded men, as the main body of the national mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry consists of in all Europe? for tis evident you'l enter into the lists, and make head with the worst of them, even with the Pope himself, against any further dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of truth, then will stand with your standing among them, though the Lord makes out the truth more clear, and you seem in your prayers to desire him so to do: yea I am almost ashamed to utter what I see, I see preciseness and propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness go hand in hand to keep out the true Righteousness indeed.</p>
            <p>So that if I speak to the whole body of the CCClergy throughout the earth, as very often I do, yet I bespeak you no otherwise then I find you <hi>viz.</hi> whether for this or for that in particular, yet all banded in one general body against the truth; for as <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> though at enmity could yet agree as friends against Jesus, so you though of never so different complexions, and constitutions, lives, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations, doctrines, and disciplines, forms and fashions, and goverments and Gospels, yet are all friends to Christs crucifying in his disciples: yea how implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly are you at odds among your selves, one sort of you being for the suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Pope, another for the Super-intendeny of the Bishop, a third for the superstitions of the Synods, others for they scarce know which, and they care not what, but as the temper of the times doth dispose them; some Rantizing infants from one ground <hi>viz.</hi> because its a tradition, some denying that, and disclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as both a rotten and false one, yet <hi>Romanizing</hi> still from some other, some, and those the most, more loose, a few more strict in their manners, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all which variety, you are at unity still, i. e. at emnity against the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Christ.</p>
            <p>But should you help the ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord? surely wrath will be upon you with them from the Lord: If you <hi>Iehosophats</hi> i. e. the honest Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in whom good things are found, who have taken away the groves, and much more of that Romish rubbish then your father <hi>Asa</hi> i. e. the good old, Bishops did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, if you good <hi>Iehosaphats I</hi> say, will after all this join with the wicked <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habs</hi> that trouble Israel, in imprisoning the <hi>Michaiahs,</hi> at least by a silent assent, and with the <hi>Ahaziahs</hi> that do wickedly, so as to lay your heads together for ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loads of Gold, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.31.19.2.20.35.26.38. for more means and maintenance, saying to them, we are in this point as you are, our people as your peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, our parishes as your parishes, our Articles of faith herein as your Articles of faith, our way of maintenance as yours, and we will be with you in the warre to reduce the <hi>Giliadites,</hi> the sectaries, that should be subject to us, to our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: your ships and all your projects, works and councels will be broken, and disappointed as the others, what ever may become of your persons: true men in a false way are out of Gods protection, as well as hypocrites in a true.</p>
            <p>Therefore depart ye from the tents of those ungodly men, yea arise and depart from that Papistical posture of parish Churches, and Pastoral relation to such as are not sheep, which not Christ Iesus, but the Pope stated men in at first, for this is not your rest because it is polluted, it will destroy you with a sore destruction; whereupon come out from them and be ye seperate, yea come out of her come out of her, ye that are Christs people (for Christs Ministers you are not, though never so good men, by Antichrists orders) and partake no longer with her in her sins, least ye partake also of her plagues.</p>

            <p>To which I say, first that, though some of you would have muzzled me up then, by an Article, from that which you call reviling, least happily I should have unmaskt you too much, yet, in your sense, that Article shall not bind me at this time (with your leave) for you call that reviling that is not so: would you set your selves soberly once to reason things out, i. e. to discern them properly as they are, you would find, that no man is reviled that is seasonably and soberly declared, and denominated to be but what he is: for be the titles we note men by never so grosse, yet are they but their proper names, if in all things suitable to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: hence (though I can excuse your ignorance in terming me Anabaptist, for thats impropriation indeed) yet Ile more then pardon you, print me out how you will, so you print me no worse then you prove me: and as for me whatever stile I put upon you, as I do it in a serious and not lusory way, so I make it out to be your due: as also what you Presbyters put upon the Prelates, and you Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates upon the Popedome, <hi>viz.</hi> the denomination of Antichristian, Strumpet, <hi>Babylon,</hi> and such like, you make plainly enough appear to be their due, and therefore I cannot possibly be said properly to revile you, forasmuch as upon the self same Account as you cry out upon each other and use these disgracefull and opprobious termes (as you term them) towards one another, I (as justly) cry out in the same language against you all; unlesse you will yield to it, as I know you will not, that you are Revilers your selves.</p>
            <p>If what I say of you be indeed more then the truth, Ile not onely expect your contradiction, but accept thankfully your correction of me from the word; but if you cannot from thence deny but that I call you what you are, then as you will not be guilty of overcharging your selves as well as me, you must acquit me from the guilt of reviling, for as I lend you no worse language then you lend one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the like cases, so as I plead my innocency in it, must you plead your own else can you be held guiltlesse no more then I, but we must all be revilers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
