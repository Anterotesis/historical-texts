         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

you; and that your ſelves, men and creatures can do

on earth.</p>
               <p>The excellency of Chriſts ſpirit in his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>Chriſt was not compelled by humane autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
to bear teſtimony of his Fathers Councell;
but he did it willingly. The Saints are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled,

by the power of the ſame Anointing.
Gentile Saints are Gods Witneſſes, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie
in ſackcloth 42. months.</p>
               <p>What is meant by two Candleſticks. And by
one golden Candleſtick, and two Olive-Trees
of each ſide of it. And by two Olive-bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
Jeſus Chriſt was the firſt that went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

firſt that came out. Chriſt laid the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

The two witneſſes kill enemies by fire
that proceeds out of their mouth: and how.
What it is to hurt the two witneſſes. What
<hi>Antichriſt</hi> is. What is meant by Heaven. The
witneſſes have power to ſhut Heaven, that it
rain not: and how. What is meant by rain.
The witneſſes have power over waters, to turn

               <p>What is meant by propheſie: and to prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
in ſack-cloth. And by 1260. dayes in a literall
ſence. And by ſilence in heaven for the ſpace
of half an hour. And by wilderneſs into which
the woman fled. The wilderneſs is a ſafe hiding
place (in Gods hand) from the face of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.
The earth helped the woman. What is
meant by 1260. dayes in a myſtical ſenſe. And
by 3. dayes and half, by 42. months, or by time,

are to lie under the captivity of myſtery <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi>

               <p>What it is to ſpeak like the Dragon. The Saints
rejoyce when Chriſt reigns. What the ſeaventh

concerning Gods two witneſſes, ſpoken of by

many dear ſervants of God have writ
very largely, which I ſhall neither contradict

            <p>Some by theſe two Witneſſes, do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,

this is power,<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 16.</note> when the holy Spirit deſcended like
a Dove upon Chriſt Jeſus, when he was baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and came ſtraight-way out of the water.
This power God gives to both his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes:
but to his humane body firſt.</p>
            <p>If you look into the Evangeliſt <hi>Iohn,</hi> you ſhall
find that one of the Souldiers with a ſpear pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Chriſts ſide,<note place="margin">John 19. 35.</note> and forthwith there came out
water and blood: now the water and blood de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
Jeſus Chriſt to be a true and reall man,
the ſeed of the Woman, according to the word
and Councell of God; and ſo the VVord was
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108220:17"/>
made fleſh, and dwelt among us and we ſaw
the glory thereof, as the glory of the onely
begotten Son of God, full of grace and
truth.</p>
            <p>Now Phyſitians ſay,<note place="margin">John 1. 14.</note> and it is a truth, that
the heart of man hath adjoyning to it a blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
or skin of water, which cools the heat of
the bloud; Which they call the Pericardium.
And the Spear piercing Chriſt to the heart did
break that skin of water, and ſo there came
out that water and blood that was in his
heart; this ſhews he was a man, the ſeed of the
Woman.</p>
            <p>And then for the ſpirit or power that was
in Jeſus Chriſt declares him to be one faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
witneſſe;<note place="margin">I Pet. 2 23.</note> for though hisfufferings were
ſo great that he ſweat drops of blood, yet
there was no ſin, or murmerings againſt God
found in him; but he was ſtill full of the ſpr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint
of humility and patience, of love, and of
faithfulneſſe to God his Father, who had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
him that cup to drink.</p>
            <p>And likewiſe was ſtill full of the ſpirit of
love to poor loſt ſinners, that ſlood in need of
this his death, or elſe they could not have bin
reconciled to God: and this unbſameable ſpirit
of his, gives teſtimony to Heaven and Earth,
that Chriſtis the great power of God, and ſo
the world, to the councel of his Father: For
indeed no ſon of man beſindes him, could be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108220:18"/>
found to ſuffer the like intolerable burden of
wrath, and yet beare it, with ſuch a patient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
loving,<note place="margin">Iſa. 55. 5, 6.</note> faithful, and pittiful ſpirit
towards others, as Chriſt did.</p>
            <p>Now this humane body of Chriſt, is an
active and loving witneſs, bearing record of
the Father wish courage; and he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
his teſtimony from any creature; but
from the Father. For the Son can do nothing
of himſelf,. but what he ſeeth the Father do;
and whatſoever he doth,<note place="margin">John 5. 19.</note> the Son doth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
            <p>Jeſus Chriſt was not compelled to bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to the Father, as a malefactor is compelled
to bear the ſentence of juſtice, but he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
to bruiſe the Serpents head voluntarily:
he ſuffered freely, and dyed freely, ſeeing it
was the will of his Father: he took up death
(which was the deſert of our ſins) willingly
and voluntarily; as ſoone as the Father had
declared his councel concerning him, Behold
(ſaith Chriſt) I come to do thy will O God;<note place="margin">John. 10. 17. 18.</note>
And no man takes away my life; for I lay it
down of my ſelf: I have power to lay it down.
and I have power to take it up again. New if
the blood of Buls and Goats, and the aſhes of
an Heifer, ſprinckling the unclean, ſanctifyeth
to the purifying of the fleſh, how much more
ſhall the bloud of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 13. 14.</note> who through his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
ſpirit, offered himſe;f without ſpot to
God, purge our Conſciences from dead works
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108220:18"/>
(of humane formes and fleſhly actings) to
ſerve the living God, in ſpirit and truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Scriptures are plentifull to prove this,
In the</hi> Evangeliſt,<note place="margin">John 8. 13. 14. 18.</note> 
               <hi>we ſee Chriſt beares witnes
of himſelf,</hi> That he is the Son of God: and told
the Jewes, that unleſſe they believed that he was
He, they ſhould die in their ſins: The Phariſees
told him, his record Was not true, becauſe he bare
record of himſelf: but ſaith he, My record is
true; and I am one that bear record of my ſelf, and
my Father that ſent me beareth witneſs of me. I
have many things to ſay and judge of you:<note place="margin">John 8. 26. 28.</note> but he
that ſent me is true, and I ſpeak unto the world
thoſe things which I have heard of him: And
when ye have lifted up the Son of man, then ye
ſhall know that I am he, and that I do nothing of

            <p>Now this ſecond witneſs, is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to Magiſtrates, Miniſters, particular
men or women; but to all the body, conſiſting
of learned,<note place="margin">Rev. 1. 1.</note> unlearned, poor and rich, men and
women, in whom the ſpirit of the Son dwells
and from whom they receive their teſtimony:
neither are they compelled to bear witneſs, but
through the ſame anointing, they profeſſe God
willingly; and they finde it is pleaſing to them
to acknowledg the Father, as to take their
meat and drink: therefore certainly thoſe that
have neither will nor skill to bear witneſs to
the Father, unleſſe they have a directory from
men, and thoſe that never worſhip God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a humane power to encourage them. Yea,
☜rather, they that would fain have a humane

               <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 27.</note>
three dayes and an half, as I ſhall declare how
I conceive it, if God pleaſe: Now theſe Saints
are not only learned Schollers in humane wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,

are they Gods witneſſes that are compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

is there here and there one Saint that are
called Gods witneſſes,<note place="margin">Pſal, 110. 3.</note> but all the Saints in one
body, three in one water, bloud and ſpirit,
make up one witneſs.</p>
            <p>Now this ſpirit, or this anointing that is in
Saints, which indeed is Chriſt the Lord their
righteouſneſs, is a faithfull witneſs likewiſe:
This is he that came by water and bloud, and
not by water only,<note place="margin">Jer. 23. 5. 6.</note> but by water and bloud;
and this Chriſt came not only in himſelf, but
in his Saints,<note place="margin">I John 5. 6.</note> whom he ſanctifies and waſheth

that thoſe that live in the time of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,

God (though I mention three names,<note place="margin">Dan. 7. 35.</note> yet
they are all one enemy to Chriſt) I conceive
(I ſay) that theſe are they to whom God
hath given power to propheſie in ſack-cloth
one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes.</p>
            <p>And theſe are they that are ſlain in the
ſtreets of the great City <hi>Babylon,</hi> that is, by the
power of the Beaſt: Yet the Saints of old, are
to take part of this honour, &amp; ſtand in this lot,
becauſe they &amp; theſe have all one ſpirit; and if
<hi>God</hi> had appointed them this ſackcloth honor,
they would have been faithfull witneſſes of
God, as well as theſe: Nay, in their time, they
bore witneſs to God, againſt the ſame ſpirit of
the beaſt; though he had not the ſame power
as he hath now: <hi>Mordecai, Heſter,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Jews,</hi>
gave a faithfull teſtimony to God, againſt
proud, hypocritical, and bloudy <hi>Hamon:</hi> And
likewiſe <hi>Daniel</hi> &amp; the three Children did bear
witneſe to God Faithfully, againſt the hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
and bloudy practices of <hi>Darius</hi> councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108220:20"/>
which ſufferings of them then, did
but type out the ſackcloth-profeſſion of Saints
in the dayes of the little horne, the Beaſt and
whoriſh ſpirit, or as I may ſay, <hi>Judas</hi> ſpirit of
ſelf-love and hypocriſie, that muſt reign in the
world for a time.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee it is Jeſus Chriſt after the <hi>fleſh,</hi>
and his ſpirit ruling in the fleſh of Saints, which
are Gods two Witneſſes: The ſpirit of Chriſt
ſent down into Saints, or rather the Saints ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up into fellowſhip with that ſpirit, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Fathers promiſe, and love to his
Sons and Daughters in the latter dayes, which
muſt propheſie in ſack-cloth, one thouſand
two hundred and ſixty dayes; and it can be no
other but theſe in whom the power of God
dwels and rules.</p>
            <p>And there are divers diſcoveries of this
truth laid down by God himſelf, as a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
from him that theſe two are his Witneſſes,
in the four, five, and ſix verſes of that ſeventh
chapter of the <hi>Revelations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the fourth verſe, Theſe two witneſſes are
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aid to be the two Olive Trees, and the two
Candle-ſticks, ſtanding before the God of the
whole Earth. Now I conceive that theſe two
Olive-trees, and two Candleſticks, can be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lyed
to no other, but to the two appearances
of the Anointing.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In the body or fleſh of Chriſt.
Secondly, In the fleſh of Saints, that is to ſay,
Chriſt and his ſpirit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:108220:21"/>
And marvel not that I ſay, Chriſt and his ſpirit
are the two Candle-ſticks,<note place="margin">Rev. 1. 20.</note> becauſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in other places, call Chriſt and his ſpirit
the lights of God, as indeed they are, and by
Candleſticks, are properly meant the Churches,
or particular ſocieties of Saints, as St. <hi>John</hi> writes.</p>
            <p>But in this place,<note place="margin">Acts 4. 12.</note> the light that is held forth,
is this eternal councel of God, That Jeſus Chriſt
is this Son, by whom he will bruiſe the Serpents
head, and reconcile ſinners to himſelf, and by
no other name or power whatſoever.</p>
            <p>So that when Chriſt was viſibly ſeen upon
the earth, in the day and hour of his ſufferings,
or time of his ſack-cloth propheſying; he and
his ſpirit in one perſon were the Candle-ſtick,
in whom this myſtery of God, and truth of his
councel did burn and ſhine forth to the world;
and therein they were a certain witnes of the
Father. But ſet that day and houre aſide, and
then properly the Churches are called Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks,
in whom Chriſt and his Spirit burnes
bright, and ſhines gloriouſly.</p>
            <p>Men or Women, Magiſtrates or Miniſters, or
churches,<note place="margin">1 Iſa. 19.</note> cannot be called theſe two Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks:
becauſe the churches ate taken up and
moved by Chriſt, and ſuch as were un-wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
are made willing to beare the teſtimony
of God, by the almighty working of Chriſt in
them that beleeve.</p>
            <p>But now chriſt and his ſpirit, was never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to bear witneſs to this purpoſe of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:108220:21"/>
the Father; for as ſoon as ever the Father had
declared his will;<note place="margin">Pſa. 40. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Loe, I come,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>to
doe thy will, O God.</hi> And therefore the Father
glories in Chriſt, and makes proclamation to
all the World,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 7, 9.</note> That he will have all men ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
the Son, as they honour the Father.</p>
            <p>Then again, they are called <hi>two Olive-Trees;</hi>
and theſe cannot be Men and Women, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
or Miniſters: but onely Chriſt and his
Spirit. If you looke into the fourth chapter
of <hi>Zechariah,</hi> there is mention of one <hi>Golden
Candleſtick,</hi> which I conceive is the generall
Church of Chriſt, or the <hi>great Congregation,</hi> as
<hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, the myſticall body of Chriſt, the
<hi>Saints,</hi> or City <hi>Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, then there is mention of two <hi>Olive
Trees</hi> by the <hi>Candleſtick,</hi> one upon the right ſide
of the Bowle, and the other upon the left
ſide thereof.</p>
            <p>Now theſe two <hi>Olive-Trees</hi> are Ieſus Chriſt☜
and his Spirit, the one being under, the other
over the Church: which are the two Armes of
God, imbracing the Church in love.</p>
            <p>For firſt, God ſent the humane Body of
Chriſt, to teſtifie his love to the Church, and to
comfort her in all her aſſlictions: Becauſe he
was afflicted for them, and with them,<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 18.</note> and
therofore, in that he himſelf hath ſuffered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that
are tempted: and this is the <hi>Olive-Tree</hi> upon
the left ſide of the <hi>Candleſtick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:108220:22"/>
Then ſecondly, God ſent his Spirit the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter,
to teſtifie his unchangeable love to the
Church, and to lead her into all truth; becauſe
he is the Spirit of truth: And ſo in the bodily
abſence of Chriſt, the Spirit, which is the <hi>Lord
our Righteouſneſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 14. 19. 26.</note> ruling
as a King in love in
them, doth counſell, comfort, ſanctifie, and
remaines with the Church for ever; and ſo
doth eſtabliſh the covenant of Grace to them
to be an everlaſting Covenant. And this is
the Olive Tree upon the right ſide of the
Candleſtick.</p>
            <p>And further,<note place="margin">Ezek. 37 26.</note> 
               <hi>Zechariah</hi> goeth on, making
mention of <hi>two Olive Branches,</hi> which through
the <hi>two golden p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pes</hi> empty the <hi>golden Oyle out
of themſelves.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zech. 4. 12.</note> And the Angel ſaid to <hi>Zecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah,
Knoweſt thou not what theſe be? And he
ſaid, No, my Lord. Then he ſaid, Theſe are two
Anointed ones, that ſtand before the Lord of the
whole earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now theſe two Olive Trees, and theſe two
Branches, that thus empty themſelves with
conſtant running, and ſo feed the Church
with life and light, which is that golden Oyle
that they empty out of themſelves, and which
the Angel likewiſe called <hi>the two Anointed ones,</hi>
they cannot be meant of any other but Ieſus
Chriſt in his own particular perſon in the fleſh;
and he ſpiritually in his Saints.</p>
            <p>For there is none that hath the ſeven pipes,
the ſeven Lamps, and the ſeven eyes, which are
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:108220:22"/>
the ſeven ſpiritual power of God in his hand,
but onely Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Rev. 5. 6.</note> for the <hi>Spirit deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and reſted upon him:</hi> And <hi>in him dwelleth
the fulneſſe of the God-head bodily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then ſecondly, becauſe none ſtands by
the Lord of the whole earth,<note place="margin">Cor 2. 9.</note> as the Angel told
<hi>Zechariah,</hi> but onely Jeſus Chriſt and his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Spirit, who is both the outward and the
inward Lord and King of Saints. And this is
cleared by Gods own word to <hi>Daniel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 10. 21.</note> when
God ſhewed to him, what was written in the
Scriptures of truth, <hi>There is none,</hi> ſaith God,
holdeth or ſtandeth with me in theſe things, but
Michael <hi>your Prince,</hi> that is, Ieſus Chriſt, in his
two-fold diſcoveries, in the fleſh of the Man
Ieſus, and in the fleſh of Saints by the ſame
Spirit: and the great promiſe of the Goſpel, for
the exalting of Ieſus Chriſt, the Anointed, and
the Anointing is this,<note place="margin">Pſa. 110. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Sit thou,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>on my
right hand,</hi> (or ſtand by me) <hi>untill I make thine
enemies thy foot-ſtool.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now brethren you know, that the Church
and Sainrs doe not receive light, life &amp; grace,
from any other but from Chriſt; <hi>Of his fulneſſe
we receive grace for grace:</hi> Therefore theſe two
<hi>Olive-trees,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 1. 16.</note> theſe two <hi>Candleſtickes</hi> which
<hi>John</hi> ſpeakes of, and theſe two <hi>Witneſſes</hi> which

muſt needs be meant Chriſt and his Spirit, or
the two appearances of God in Ieſus, and in his
Saints.</p>

               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:108220:23"/>
               <hi>There is one phraſe moſe in that fourth

            <p>And theſe two witneſles <hi>ſtand by the God of

this to be a truth; that <hi>the ſeed of the

others wander after the Beaſt, Fleſh, &amp; ſelf. But
theſe only <hi>whoſe names are written in the Book

               <hi>The Father that dwelleh in me,</hi> ſaith
Chriſt, <hi>he doth the works;</hi> and the Saints they
beare witneſſe by the power of Chriſt, Which is
the Father likewiſe that is in them, as in him.
But the Saints receive this power at the ſecond
hand; for the anointing that Was powred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the head of Chriſt Ieſus, fell down to the
skirts of his garments,<note place="margin">Pſa. 133. 2.</note> and ſo his meaneſt mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Partakes of that anointing, and by his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
the Saints doe all things, and without him
they can doe nothing.</p>
            <p>The Spirit of God gives a ſecond teſtimony,
that the two witneſſes are Ieſus Chriſt in his
fleſh: and Ieſus Chriſt ſpiritually in the fleſh
of Saints, and can be no other. For ſaith he,

            <p>Therefore if any will hurt Gods two faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

            <p>He that denies the Anointing to be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt

            <p>Then farther, God proves Chriſt in his two-fold
appearance, that is, in his own perſon, and
in fleſh, or perſons of his Saints, to be his two
witneſſes; for ſaith he in the 6. verſe of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leventh
chapter of the <hi>Revelations.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Theſe have
power to ſhut Heaven, that it raine not in the

to turn them into bloud; and to ſmite the
Earth with all plagues as oft as they will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By Heaven, I conceive may be underſtood
either God himſelf or his Church: If we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
God to be that Heaven, that the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
have power to ſhut that it rain not in
the dayes of their Propheſies; then I conceive
the meaning is two-fold, thus, firſt, they have
power to ſtay the hand of God from raining
and powring down deſtruction upon the Beaſt
all the dayes of their propheſie, becauſe God
hath ſaid, they ſhall propheſie in Sackcloth one
thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes. So that
God hath given the power of deſtroying the
Beaſt out of his hand; or hath tyed up his
power till that time be accompliſhed; for it is
their time of propheſying in ſackcloth: it is
not Gods time of raining down wrath as yet:
becauſe God by his word hath limitted himſelf
to ſuch a time.</p>
            <p>And truly here our God points out ſuch a
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:108220:28"/>
ſpring as may refreſh his people in all their
ſuflerings. To conſider the ſufferings of the
Saints, and the enemies cruelty; is not acted
according to the will of the enemy, but ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
and Saints, and troubles; are all in Gods
hand, and enemies ſhall dye, the Saints ſhall
be comforted, and all teares wiped from their
eyes, when Gods appointed time is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed,
and not till then. ſurely this gives
much ſtrength of peace and patience, to poor
children of God, in their ſufferings.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, They have power to ſhut
Heaven, or to ſtay Gods hand from raining
down judgement upon the Beaſt, all the dayes
of their propheſies; as ſometimes God rained
down a deluge of water to drown the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
World: and ſometimes he rained a deluge
Of fire. as a plague to deſtroy thoſe wicked
people in <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorah.</hi> And this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is in the hand of the Anointed Ieſus Chriſt;<note place="margin">Rev. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>8.</note>
for he hath the power of hell and death.</p>
            <p>And the reaſon is this,<note place="margin">☜</note> Ieſus Chriſt hath
bought out this power by his bloud, out of
the hands of offended juſtice: For now as
God ſhewes no mercy out of Chriſt,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 20.</note> ſo he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutes
no act of wrath or juſtice, but by the
hand of Chriſt: for the Father hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all judgment to the Son; and Chriſt is all,
and in all. Chriſt hath the Key of life and
death, he can either bind or looſe; deſtroy or
ſave: Therefore it is ſaid, That the Witneſſes
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:108220:28"/>
have power to ſhut Heaven, or the hand of
offended juſtice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it rain not down plagues:
And they have power to open Heaven, and to
ſmite the earth with plagues as oft as they
will.</p>
            <p>Or ſecondly, If by Heaven we underſtand

I conceive the meaning is this.<note place="margin">Rev. 11. 6.</note> The Witneſſes
have power from God to propheſie in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth

with all her fleſhly deceits ſhall be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By Raine, I underſtand the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Saints that ſhall increaſe and ſpread like
the multitude of drops in a ſhowre of raine, <hi>or
like ſands upon the Sea ſhoar, ſo that their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
ſhall over-top the number of Babylons Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioſ. 1. 10.</note>
And ſo the Church being full of the
righteouſnes of God, and diſcoveries of
Chriſt, ſhall ſweep away the City <hi>Babylon,</hi>
with all her beaſtly practices, and fleſhly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:108220:29"/>
And hereby the Beaſt ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</p>
            <p>For whereas all the dayes of the Witneſſes
ſack-cloth-propheſying, and death, The earth
(that is the fleſh of men, and converſation of
men) was full of drineſſe and unfruitfulneſſe
before God, in every thought, word, &amp; Work,
by reaſon of the Beaſt, or wiſdom of the fleſh
that ruled in them, and promoted Self.</p>
            <p>Now by this Rain, the earth or fleſh of man,
is filled with fruits of righteouſneſs and truth.
I mean, by the plentifull diſcoveries of truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or brightneſs of Chriſt; and by the plentiful1
increaſe of the Saints, the deſtruction of the
Beaſt, or the Serpents head in fleſh is broken
and conſumed. And that there ſhall be ſuch
increaſe of Saints in the latter dayes, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie
of <hi>Hoſea</hi> makes it manifeſt; for when
God caſt off literal <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hoſ. i. 10.</note> He promiſed the
large increaſe of ſpiritual <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which are <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving</hi>
Iewes and Gentiles that ſhall be like
the ſands of the Sea ſhoar in the day of
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But the Witneſſes have a power to ſhut the
Church, or Heaven, from raining in this kind,
till their Propheſie be ended, as God appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
And then (I believe) there ſhall appear
plentifull manifeſtations of Gods love in the
Church, to the increaſe of their number, and
to the increaſe of their ſpiritual enjoyment of
God.<note place="margin">Iſa. 28. 2. 17.</note> And likewiſe there ſhall appear here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108220:30"/>
even plentifull manifeſtation of juſtice and
wrath upon the beaſt and wiſdom of the fleſh
to its utter overthrow. And theſe manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of love &amp; juſtice, ſhal appear like a ſhowr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And yet further in that ſixt verſe, They

when the ſeventh Angel had powred out his

power, got from the Kings of the Earth,
when they and ſhe committed ſpiritual forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation

came a great voice out of the Temple of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:

<hi>And in that day,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>I will make a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

            <p>But ſecondly, when theſe waters are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied

Then they point out unto us thoſe people,
men and women, in whom the fleſh rules, in
all her ſelf-actings and inventions againſt
Chriſt, and in either of theſe ſenſes, that is, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the multitude of fleſhly inventions ariſing

            <p>And when the waters are thus turned into

then it is manifeſt, That the ſeed of
the woman, Chriſt the anointed, hath broken
the Serpents head.</p>
            <p>I heard the Angel of the waters ſay, Thou
art righteous,<note place="margin">Rev. 16. 5. 6.</note> O Lord, which art, which waſt,

And by theſe phraſes thus made manifeſt, it

            <p>AND now I come to the third particular
to be minded: that is, to ſhew the meaning
of the thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes,
which is the time given them of God to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie

who it is that ſlayeth them.</p>
            <p>In handling of this, I ſhall obſerve three

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:108220:33"/>
that is 1260 dayes.</p>
            <p>The number of 1260 dayes is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
as I conceive, in a two-fold ſenſe, yet
both pointing out the myſtery of God: the
firſt, more Literall, the ſecond more Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.</p>
            <p>As firſt,<note place="margin">☜</note> I conceive, that theſe, 1260 dayes,
are reckoned according to the dayes of a
Week, that our Saviour Chriſt Jeſus did beare
witneſſe to his Father from the time of his
Baptiſme, and deſcending of the Spirit upon
him, to the day that he was crucified.</p>
            <p>For he began his viſible teſtimony, that he
was the Son of God,<note place="margin">Luke, 2. 23.</note> when he was ſuppoſed to
be about 30 years of age, as <hi>Luke</hi> ſpeaks, &amp; we
read not of any thing that he did till this time
that he was baptized, and the Spirit deſcended
upon him.</p>
            <p>And from that time, till he was crucified, as
I have gathered by books, it was ſuppoſed to
be about three years &amp; a half, which is about
this account, which the Spirit calls 1260 days,
according to the days of a week: it is but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
17 dayes difference.</p>
            <p>The like number of dayes is ſpoken of, <hi>Rev.
12.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 12. 6.</note> 
               <hi>And the woman fled into the Wilderneſſe,
where ſhe hath a place prepared of God</hi> 1260
<hi>dyes.</hi> This I conceive was the ſame tearm of
dayes, according to the number of the dayes
in a week, that one Saviour did propheſie here
in the world among men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:108220:33"/>
And this points out unto us the time of the
battell that was fought between <hi>Michael</hi> our
Prince,<note place="margin">Rev. 12. 7, 8, 9.</note> the ſeed of the woman; and the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,
or the power of darkneſſe ruling in the
corrupt poſterity of <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For if the Serpent and his ſeed,<note place="margin">Joh. 19. 35.</note> could have
made Jeſus Chriſt to have ſinned by their
temptations, then the Serpent had conquered
him, and had broken Gods head. But Jeſus

ſo that this <hi>Wilderneſſe</hi> ſpoke of, is a very ſafe

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:108220:35"/>
wherein the ſoul is fed and nouriſhed by <hi>God,</hi>
and not by any creature, <hi>for a lime, times, and

The Beaſt,<note place="margin">Luke, 12. 32.</note> as hath been ſhewed.</p>
            <p>And here I ſhall mind two things,
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, what this Wilderneſſe is not.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, what it is.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, ☞ when men are in a good conceir of
their own Wiſdome, Learning, and Strength,
as the Jewes were, that thought they had all
knowledge to diſcerne Truth from Errour;
and therefore when <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is <hi>Truth</hi> it
ſelfe,<note place="margin">John 7.</note> came to them, they called him a <hi>Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi>
and a man of <hi>Errors,</hi> and ſought to kill
him, through that conceit of theirs. But <hi>Chriſt</hi>
told them, that of all men, though they were
the chiefe in humane learning in thoſe dayes,
they were the deepeſt in ſin and errors, and
the furtheſt from truth,<note place="margin">John 9. 41.</note> becauſe you ſay, <hi>Wee
ſee</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to them) <hi>therefore your ſin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains.</hi>
Now this good conceit of a mans ſelf is
not the wilderneſſe-condition, it is not a ſafe
hiding-place from the Serpent, but it is before
his face, or in his hand.</p>
            <p>Or again, when Men ſuck content from crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
as from mens Learning, gifts, cuſtoms,
prayers, or formes of worſhip, and think
they ſhall never have comfort umleſſe they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
theſe outward helps; this is to preferre the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:108220:36"/>
broken Ciſternes before the fountains. And
this is not the Wilderneſſe-condition neither:
for ſtill the poor man is before the face of the
Serpent, and in his hand; for he ſeekes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
from creatures, and not from God
onely, by reſting upon outward helps.</p>
            <p>But now ſecondly, when a ſoule is driven or
called into the wilderneſſe, where ſhe is fed
by Gods ſpeciall and loving care, from the face
of the Serpent, we are to mind two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">☜</note> it is ſuch a condition, wherein a man
is dead to all his owne wiſdome, memory,
ſtrength,<note place="margin">Eſay 32. 12, &amp;c.</note> learning, actings, and lookes upon
all as priviledges of no gain, but of weakneſſe
and of droſſe; without the <hi>Anointing,</hi> he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
meditate, nor underſtand; till God come
into him; he cannot ſpeak, till God give ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance;
he feeles his heart barren of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
of love, of peace, he feeles and ſees
nothing in him, but onely a thirſting ſoul after
God, whom his ſecret thoughts tell him, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ſatisfie him, if he pleaſe but to manifeſt
himſelfe.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, as the ſoul ſees a barrenneſſe
and death within it ſelf, ſo likewiſe is ſhe dead
to every thing without, ſhe finds no comfort
or ſtrength from any man or creature; preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
praying, and all outward forms, are barren
actions to this poor ſoul, becauſe ſhe ſees the
Spirit abſent. And therefore ſhe cries, <hi>Saw yee
not my beloved,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cant. 3. 3.</note> him whoſe enjoyment I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:108220:36"/>
after; I can take no delight in your company
and ſocieties, and in your actings, unleſſe my
God whom my ſoul loves, did manifeſt himſelf
to me there. The experiences and writings of
Prophets, Apoſtles, and Saints, are dry ſhels to
me,<note place="margin">1 John 1. 4.</note> and cannot comfort, unleſſe God whom
my ſoule breathes after, give to me likewiſe
ſome experience of his love, as he gave to
them, and then I ſhall have joy; yea, and my
joy then will be fulfilled, and not till then.</p>
            <p>And here alſo the ſoule ſees and feels a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſſe,
as if ſhe were in the midſt of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull
and dry wilderneſſe, where ſhe ſees
nothing within, but a hunger-ſtarving ſoule,
nor any thing without round about, but bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
trees, as our Saviour ſought for Figs from
the tree, but found none. Now this poor man
ſees nothing in others and nothing in himſelf
to nouriſh him; but onely a ſecret hope of
relief from God, Waiting upon him with tears
in his eyes till God come, longing to ſee him,
mourning in his abſence; for the ſoule hath
no ſenſible manifeſtation as yet.</p>
            <p>And this, I conceive, is the wilderneſſe into
which the woman fled, &amp; in which the Lamb
feeds her: and this is a ſure hiding-place from
the face of the Serpent, and a very ſafe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in two reſpects.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe God is now ingaged to take
care of this ſoule (for by Woman, in that
place, I conceive is pointed out the Church in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:108220:37"/>
generall,<note place="margin">Eſay. 32. 12, 15.</note> and every particular beleever, and
what is made good to one ſoule is true in all
<hi>Sion</hi>) ſhe is now dead to all other protectore;
but alive to God, ſhe waits, ſhe ſighes, ſhe
breathes after him. O. when ſhall I ſee my
God, when ſhall I be ſatisfied with the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noe</hi>
Which is from heaven, even the ſweet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
Of the <hi>Anointed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, it is a ſafe condition becauſe the
ſoule is now in a way of nouriſhment before
God, from the face of the Serpent; God never
manifeſts himſelſe to a ſoule, till he hath firſt
emptied her of her-ſelfe, and drawn her off
from ſucking milk from the teats of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
For ſaith God, whom ſhall I give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
to? and to whom ſhall I teach
doctrine, but to them that are drawne from
the milk,<note place="margin">Eſay 28. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>9.</note> and are weaned from the teats of a
mans own ſelf-conceit, and ſucking content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from mens learning and inventions? And
ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>You are dead to all things
below God;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 3. 3.</note> 
               <hi>but your life is hid with GOD in Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a very ſafe condition for a poor ſoul
(though ſhe thinkes not ſo; for ſhe is now in
Gods way that leads to true reſt. And when
God is pleaſed not onely to allure her, and
bring her into this wilderneſſe,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 2, 14</note> but begins
likewiſe to ſpeake kindly to her,<note place="margin">Joh. 1. 4.</note> and to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
his love in lively and ſweet diſcoveries,<note place="margin">John 2. 1.</note>
then the writings and experiences of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:108220:37"/>
Apoſtles and Saints, do fulfill his joy;
and he now ſees there is no lie of the truth;
that is, of the <hi>Anointing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this woman, ſay ſome, cannot point out
a partioular Beloever, but ſome thing more
generall, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>That the Earth
helped the woman,</hi> as you may read, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.
15, 16.</p>
            <p>I conceive there is no ſcruple in this obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
I will anſwer it briefly: Firſt, if the
Magiſtrates, or common people, be this <hi>Earth,</hi>
as ſome think, then it followes, that if they
help the Church in generall, they help every
particular believer alſo. But I conceive that
interpretation is too far below the ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of this myſtery,<note place="margin">Asts 5. 34.</note> though there may be a
truth in it notwithſtanding. For God makes
uſe of Magiſtrates and common people to
help his Church and Saints againſt the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
flood of mallcious temptaitons.</p>
            <p>But by <hi>Earth</hi> I rather conceive is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
the humane body of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Rev. 12.</note> which is
made of the ſame earth that our Bodies are,
and this helps the Church; for by the blood
of this Lamb, they overcome the Serpent, and
by this Lamb they are fed, as you may read
more fully <hi>Rev,</hi> 7. 9. 17.</p>
            <p>Now in the ſecond place we are to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the myſticall meaning of this number 1260
dayes.</p>
            <p>And I conceive,<note place="margin">Dan. 7. 21.</note> they point out the length
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:108220:38"/>
of time that the Church of Chriſt is to lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the captivitie of the little Horn, or Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian
power, which are called <hi>Gentiles;</hi>
for they are not in covenant with God. The
time of the battell, as I ſhewed, was 126<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
dayes, according to ſingle dayes in a Weeke
And the holy City ſhall be trod under the
feet of the Gentiles almoſt ſo many yeares, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the yeares in a mans life: This
conceive is one myſtery of God, I ſay, almoſt,
doe not ſay altogether ſo many yeares as. the
beattell was dayes.</p>
            <p>For Chriſt will not have them to hold. an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
proportion of years to thoſe 1260 dayes
but hath ſhortned the dayes of their captivity
for the elects ſake.<note place="margin">Mat. 24. 22.</note> And therefore, ſaith God
the witneſſes ſhall propheſie 1260 dayes, and
the Gentiles ſhall tread under foot the holy
City 42 moneths.<note place="margin">Rev 11. 2, 3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now theſe 42 moneths being juſt 3 ſingle
yeares and halfe,<note place="margin">Rev. 11. 9.</note> beare a proportion of time
with the 3 dayes and halfe, that the witneſſes
muſt lie dead: but I pray mark, we are not to
reckon the fourty two moneths, nor the three
dayes and halfe, to point out no longer time
then barely three ſingle years and half, as ſome
think.</p>
            <p>But I conceive, that God by theſe
tearmes of time,<note place="margin">Dan. 11. 36.</note> points at a higher myſtery:
That is, points out to us 3 ages and a halfe,
or 3 degrees of time and a halfe, that he hath
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:108220:38"/>
determined for the Beaſt to tread the holy Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
under foot.</p>

            <p>Secondly, Jeſus Chriſt, breaks the Serpents
head in the Saints, when he makes them able
to ſpeak out of experience, I was proud (ſaith
the ſoul) now God hath made me humble: I
was envious, now God hath made me love, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
my enemies; I loved and acted injuſtice,
now God hath made me to hate injuſtice, and
to love truth in my heart, and to act righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes
chearfully. The flesh and the luſts of
it ruled ſtrongly in me, now holines rules in
me, ſo that I can look back and ſee my ſtrong
ſins and luſts lie like dead enemies before me;
and my heart rejoyceth in the Anointing, who
hath given me the victory.</p>
            <p>And now I ſee,<note place="margin">Col. 1. 27.</note> That the love, the ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial,
the inward rejoycing of my heart to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
God above all things, is Chriſt, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing
in me, the hope of my future eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
enjoyment of God.</p>
            <p>And this is my life, and this my life is hid
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:108220:43"/>
with God in the Anointed, &amp; in this glory of
Chriſt, thus revealed in me,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 13.</note> and to my ſight &amp;
feeling, that the Serpents head is broken in me,
in part,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 26.</note> and shall be quite broken at the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
at the day that my body is raiſed out
of the duſt; In this I rejoyce with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable.</p>
            <p>Formerly my life and joy was bound up in
creatures, in riches, in friends, in ſelf-ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
in my pride, covetouſnes, and contents
of the flesh.<note place="margin">Job 42. 5.</note> Ah but now my life is the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of my God; His wiſdom I glory in, His
will, His love, His ſpirit of truth I glory in.
Not only to heare of theſe without, by the
voice of others, but to feel the working, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and ruling in me.</p>
            <p>To hear that Chriſt was raiſed from death,
and from the grave,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 11.</note> is joy. But to ſee and feel
Chriſt the Anointing, raiſed upon me; and to
feel him who is the ſpring of life, to be opened
in me,<note place="margin">John 11. 35</note> and to ſend forth ſweet manifeſtations
of God to my ſoul, this is much more joyous,
and full of abundance of inward refreshments.</p>
            <p>But the foul ſees and feeles more of this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

And when once the Saints can ſpeak this in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,<note place="margin">Rev. 2. 17.</note>
then the Serpents head is broke in

            <p>Now here mind firſt,<note place="margin">☜</note> what is the bottomles

And when they had finiſhed their teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
the Beaſt ſhall make War againſt them, and
ſhall overcome them, and kill them.</p>
            <p>Before I proceed, it is needfull to clear one
Scripture of <hi>Daniel,</hi> that may raiſe a ſcruple:
In that which I have already writ, it appeares
that God ſaid, the Witneſſes ſhould prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
in ſack-cloth 1260. dayes.</p>
            <p>But when one Saint ſpake to another Saint,
and asked,<note place="margin">Dan. 8. 13. 14.</note> how long ſhall be the viſion of the daily
ſacrifice, and the tranſgreſſion of deſolation, to
give both the Sanctuary and the Hoſt to be
troden under foot? <hi>The Angel anſwered, unto
2300. dayes.</hi> Then ſhall the Sanctuary be
clenſed.</p>
            <p>Now this time of <hi>Daniels</hi> viſion was 14. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations,
(except the 70. years captivity) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Chriſt came: therefore I conceive, that
this 2300. dayes, doth point out ſo many full
years, that the Church partly of the Jews, and
partly of the Gentiles, ſhall lie under the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
of the blaſpheming horne, in his ſeverall
ſhapes.</p>
            <p>And ſo points out the oppreſſions of the
Church of the Jews, the deſtruction of the
City Jeruſalem, and the deſtroying of the
Temple, and all thoſe waſtings of the Church
(both before Chriſt came) among the Jews,
(and ſince Chriſt came) among the Gentiles,
and ſo comprehends the Tyranny both of the
Dragon (corrupt Magiſtracy,) And the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:108220:46"/>
of the Beaſt (the Antichriſtian ſhapes)
over the holy City,<note place="margin">Dan. 8. 17. 19. 20. &amp;c.</note> from the end of the 70.
years captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> to the time of the
end, that the Beaſt ſhall reigne no longer.</p>
            <p>And I believe that this 2300. dayes are a
full number of years, that the Church of the
Jews and Gentiles,<note place="margin">Dan. 12. 9.</note> have ſuffered and muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
under the Serpents power, till the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

years captivity; for when <hi>Daniel</hi> asked the

<hi>he ſaid, go thy way Daniel, for the words are clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
up and ſealed, till the time of the end,</hi> poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out to us that the Jews were yet to ſuffer
many things before the Gentiles be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>But when God ſpeaks, that his Witneſſes
ſhall propheſie 1260. dayes, and that the holy
City or the Hoſt, ſhall be trod under foot, 42.
months, which are one and the ſame tearm of
time as hath been ſhewed; I believe he points
out the very direct time of captivity that the
Church of the Gentiles ſhall undergo under
myſtery <hi>Babylon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 22. 10.</note> or the blaſpheming horn.
And therefore when the Angel was ſhewing
the viſion of theſe things to <hi>John.</hi> Saith he,
ſeale not the ſayings of this Propheſie, for the
time is at hand; or the time of the 1260. dayes,
are upon the beginning, and the time of the
<hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church is come to a period.</p>
            <p>And as God was pleaſed to ſhew unto

               <hi>John</hi> the beginning of thoſe 1260. dayes capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
ſo I believe, God is pleaſed to ſhew his
Servants now,<note place="margin">Rev. 11. 15.</note> that theſe 1260. dayes, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
near an end. <hi>And that the Kingdoms of this
world ſhall become the Kingdoms of Chriſt, and
he ſhall take to him his own power, and reign for
ever and ever.</hi> Even ſo come Lord Ieſus.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed; hither to we ſee who it
is that kills Gods two Witneſſes, Even the
wiſdom and envious power and policy of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
fleſh: that would be as God, and ſit in
Gods Temple, and rule over all that is called
God.</p>
            <p>The corrupt wiſdom, blind zeal, and meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
actings, is forcibly preſſed upon the
Saints, by the fleſh; before the believing in the
free grace and love, and gift of God, yea, the
fleſh honours it ſelf and diſhonours God,<note place="margin">Rev. 13. 5. 6.</note> and
all that worſhip God, or that live in him, yea,
the fleſh rules and ſtrives mightily, and hath a
great prevailing power to enforce men to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
upon her preparative uſe of means, which
ſhe calls means, and ſelf-actings; to get know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
comfort, life, and will not ſuffer men,
nay, nor the Saints ſome-times to honour God
by waiting upon him, and whereſoever you
ſee the fleſh active, if God be pleaſed to teach,
you ſhall ſee the fleſh both in your ſelf and in
others, to ſlight, deſpiſe, and undervalue God,
though to your preſent apprehenſion,<note place="margin">Pſal. 106. 29.</note> you
think you honour God; but truly we diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:108220:47"/>
God when we would worſhip him in the
way of the fleſh; and will not wait upon him
in his own way.</p>
            <p>It remaines now to ſhew how the Beaſt (or
fleſh) doth kill the two Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>And this phraſe killing,<note place="margin">Rev. 11. 2. 3, 9.</note> is but a fuller de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of that compleat captivity under the
blaſpheming horn in his ſeverall ſhapes, for
the ſpace of 42. months, or three dayes and
half, or 1260. dayes, which are all one; and
then that God that gave his witneſſes into
the hands of the Beaſt to be killed, raiſes them
up to life again: and as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid, <hi>the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
is delivered,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev. 11. Dan.</hi> 7. 27.</note> 
               <hi>and the wicked falls into his
place;</hi> for upon their riſing, the Beaſt is kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and he dies for ever; but the killing of the
witneſſes is not everlaſting, neither is their
death eternall; for God will raiſe them up
from death, and of the life and Kingdom of
the two witneſſes, there ſhall be no end.</p>
            <p>But how are the Witneſſes ſlain? why tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when the wiſdom and powers of the Beaſt
rules in full ſtrength, then the Father hath ſo.
determined, that the witneſſes ſhall be trod
under foot and killed, but this killing is but in
the eye of the world, not in the eye of God
and Saints; for becauſe I live (ſaith Chriſt)
therefore you live, and the world ſees me no
more, but you ſee me. And there are three
diſpoſitions of the Beaſt, to be conſidered in
killing Gods witneſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Firſt, conſider the ſpirit of envy and heart-burning
that is in the fleſh againſt Gods Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</p>
            <p>As firſt, the fleſh of every man within,<note place="margin">John 16. 12.</note> in the<note place="margin">☜</note>
ſecret of his own heart, doth riſe and fret a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
any truth which doth principally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
God, and deny ſelf: we cannot bear the
truths of God at firſt hearing, nor ever, till
God make us able: I ſpeak in experience, my
own fleſh declared its rebellion againſt God
in this particular. Tell a man that he hath <hi>no
knowledge, &amp;</hi> no faith in <hi>God,</hi> and his heart ſwels
preſently,<note place="margin">Eſay 1. 11, 12, 13.</note> and thinks you wrong him; tell him

by our waiting, then by the multitude of our

that humane Schollars that are not ſo taught

God ſend them,</hi> though they have the ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

ſhould teach any but ſchollars, that any ſhould

ſomething in it ſelfe, it hath a ſecret grudging
to acknowledge all wiſdom, faith and life muſt
be given of God, and that his actings can get
nothing.</p>
            <p>And if there were not an <hi>inward root of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes</hi>
in every mans heart againſt truth,<note place="margin">John 4. 1.</note> there
would not be ſuch ſtrivings and wars amongſt

would caſt God out; not under the

               </hi>
For truly our fleſh will envy <hi>Truth,</hi> it will not

is put to death under the name of a <hi>Deceiver,

            </p>
            <p>And thus the <hi>Fleſh</hi> in every man labours to

truth within it ſelfe, by grudging, becauſe he
cannot beare it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this ſpirit of envie which ariſeth in

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:108220:48"/>
in the ſenſible feeling of a mans owne
corruptions, when God begins to teach him,

               <note place="margin">Dan. 8. 23.</note> is, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of <hi>ſubtill policy and hypocriticall craft,</hi> that
laies wait to enſnare <hi>Gods witneſſes,</hi> and makes
his mountain ſtrong againſt God. And this
<hi>crafty hypocriſie</hi> appears in every man likewiſe:
for when God hath found out a mans iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and begins to ſhame the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> that he may
ſave the <hi>Soul;</hi> the heart wil not with humility
acknowledge it ſelf ſinfull;<note place="margin">Ezek. 28 15.</note> but will have many
turnings, ſhifts, and policies to juſtifie himſelf;
though his conſcience tell him he is guilty.</p>
            <p>So while the <hi>Witneſſes of God</hi> prove the man
a ſinner, his fleſh ſtill would fain be eſteemed
righteous, and labours to kill the <hi>Witneſſes.</hi> If
the heart be found guilty of pride,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 12</note> coveteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
envie, unfaithfulneſſe, or any unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
it hath many winding pretences to cleare
himſelf, and ſo prove God the liar.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:108220:49"/>
But well, though the fleſhly conſcience ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and kill <hi>Gods Witneſſes</hi> within it ſelfe, and
by his ſhifts avoids ſhame, and ſo rejoyceth
in his innocency got by lying craft; yea, and
rejoyces over that teſtimony from God, that
bore witneſſe againſt his conſcience. As when
the witneſſes were ſlain in in that 11. <hi>Revel.</hi> all
that dwelt upon the earth, that were tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by them, rejoyced at their death.</p>
            <p>Even ſo all the wiſdom, love, joy, and peace
in ſin, that were tormented in a man by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
of truth againſt them; now they all
rejoyce by the loud out-cries of the fleſh,
(God ſuffering it) the truth is ſlighted, and
the conſcience quieted upon <hi>carnall</hi> grounds,
through <hi>carnall</hi> policy.</p>
            <p>But when the determined time is accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">Eſay 32. 15.</note>
that <hi>God will raiſe up the ſpirit of his Son in
thee,</hi> who is killed by, and lies buried under thy
corruptions,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 15.</note> then <hi>God</hi> will deſtroy thy fleſh, &amp;
all thy <hi>carnall joy &amp; peace,</hi> and all thy own ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works
ſhall be burned,<note place="margin">Luke 18. 13.</note> and he will make thee
confeſſe thy ſelfe a ſinner, and a wicked man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When God hath given thee experience that
he hath</hi> broke the Serpents head <hi>in thee, and ſo
hath</hi> revealed his Son in thee, and filled thee with
joy and peace of himſelf,<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 15 1 Pet. 4. 13.</note> taking thee into his reſt,
into his kingdome and glory, by the riſing of the
bright morning Star, and the reſurrection of Gods
truth,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 10.</note> the Anointing within thee; <hi>then the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
policy, and all the wickedneſſe of the fleſh
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:108220:49"/>
acting againſt God, ſhall be deſtroyed.<note place="margin">1 John 27.</note> And
the</hi> Anointing, <hi>which is</hi> the Lord our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
ſhall dwel and rule in thee for thee for ever,
<hi>which is thy redemption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſecondly, this <hi>ſpirit of hypocriticall craft
againſt truth,</hi> appeares in others likewiſe, to
the view one of another; by ſlighting the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
of God by a two-fold policy: firſt, by
deviſing <hi>carnall cuſtomes,</hi> and <hi>falſe formes of
worſhip,</hi> which are pleaſing to the fleſh, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the command and example of
Scriptures, which the flesh pretends to follow,
and yet doth not. Here is truth killed by the
ſubtill inventions of the fleſh, which are cried
up for ſound learning.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>Fleſh</hi> kils <hi>Truth,</hi> by working
ſubtilly with the higher powers of the earth,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 1.</note>
the Magiſtracy, which God hath ſet in the
world, by which he preſerves peace,<note place="margin">Rev. 17. 2.</note> and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
puniſhes them that doe evil. I ſay, the
fleſh works ſubtilly to deceive this, and gets
an Authority here-from to make <hi>Lawes,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And this we have experience of, that the

the Saints, that worſhip the Lamb, that is,
<hi>God in Man:</hi> or the <hi>holy breathing in mans fleſh.</hi>
And this is the ſecond on-ſet the Beaſt makes
to kill <hi>Gods witneſſe.</hi> As <hi>Darius</hi> his crafty coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors

of what they have heard and ſeen of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling

they have ſeen and heard from Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,

pretend love to God by outward profeſſion,
will not onely oppreſſe and kill deſpiteful ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,

they cannot conform to her principles and

a whole Pariſh, a whole kingdome, and ſo the
whole world to be his Church in her time, or

            <p>5. Ieſus Chriſt ſpeakes honourably of the
Saints,<note place="margin">John 4. 23.</note> and calls them, <hi>his ſheep, his little flocke,

of them, evill intreats them, priſons, whips, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes

we ſee the Beaſt hath killed one of <hi>Gods Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> both in his humane Body,

a dead body under the power of the Beaſt,

            <p>NOw conſider that this ſlaying of the two
Witneſſes is paſt long agoe,<note place="margin">Rev. 11. 8.</note> and they are
lying in the ſtreet of the great City like dead
bodies three dayes and an half, but I believe
they have lien dead, well nigh their full time,
if not compleat; for I believe they are upon
their riſing.</p>
            <p>But are the Witneſſes then ſlain for certain,
I anſwer, by the experience that we have of
the fulfilling of <hi>Johns</hi> Viſion and Propheſie, it
appears clear to me, that they are ſlain: And
that the troubles of the world at this very day
is but the Cloud in which the Witneſſes doth
aſcend up to God, after that the ſpirit of life
from God was entered into them. This is
partly ſeen by ſome already; but for the time
and ſeaſon when God will make this manifeſt
to the view of the world,<note place="margin">Rev. 11. 11. 13. 18.</note> I am ſilent; God
hath the times and ſeaſons in his own power,
yet I have perſwaſions in me from experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
grounds of Gods own working, that ere
long within few years, God will make this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:108220:55"/>
to the world, but they ſhall be filled with
great feare, and be offended at it.</p>
            <p>A mans own ſight and perſwaſion will not
ſatisfie others; therefore I ſhall add a few
things more that lies in my ſpirit to confirm
this, grounded upon <hi>Johns</hi> Viſion, for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
of a Propheſie, ſhews the meaning of a
Propheſie.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Revel.</hi> 8. 13. There are three woes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
to the Inhabitants of the earth: the
firſt woe is paſt already, and I have nothing to
ſpeak of it but only this:<note place="margin">Rev. 9. 2.</note> 
               <hi>That when the bottomleſſe
pit or corrupt fleſh was opened, made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,
and had a liberty to act it ſelf, it brought
forth woe and ſorrow to the Inhabitants of the
earth;</hi> that is, to ſuch as lived below God,
meerly in the uſe of creatures of this world;
ſuch as lived ſeemingly a little higher,<note place="margin">Eſay 32. 9.</note> and yet
below God too, in the uſe of Gods Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
but in an outward profeſſion to the fleſh,
living by ſenſe, (through a meer form and cuſtome,
and humane.) Theſe meet with woe &amp;
ſorrow, for a literall profeſſion expoſed them
to the laſh, but to worſhip God in ſpirit, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
away the ſmart, when the fleſh is let looſe
it prepares miſery to it ſelf and to all that live
after the fleſh.</p>
            <p>The third woe is yet to come, and I have
nothing to ſay of it, only I greatly rejoyce in
expectation of that univerſall glory which
God will reveal to his Saints, and into which
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:108220:56"/>
they ſhal be taken up when thoſe dayes come.</p>
            <p>But the middle woe,<note place="margin">Rev. 9. 12</note> or the ſecond in courſe,
is now in being; And there are great troubles
to be acted in the world, but yet for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of the Saints, two things are to be noted.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Dan. 12. 7.</note> that under the ſound of the ſixth An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
that pronounces the woe, The death of the
Beaſt is declared,<note place="margin">Rev. 13. 6. 7.</note> and that his determinate time
is quite finiſhed, and though he ſtrive mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
like a dying hog for life at the laſt gaſpe,<note place="margin">Rev. 10. 6. 7.</note> yet
he ſhall never reign again in Majeſty, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
by an uſurped Law,<note place="margin">Dan. 2. 44.</note> over Chriſt and his
Saints, as he hath done; for his time, times,
and dividing of a time,<note place="margin">Dan. 7. 26. 27.</note> his 42. months, and his
three dayes and half, are upon the point of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring.
And the Lord Chriſt is beginning,<note place="margin">Rev. 11. 15. 17.</note> nay
hath begun to take the Kingdom, and to reign;
of whoſe Kingdom there ſhall be no end.</p>
            <p>Secondly, note that under the ſound of the
ſixth Angel, the Witneſſes are to be killed, but
to ariſe from death, and aſcend up to God, in
the Cloud: And their riſing is the Inhabitant;
of the earths woe, even to ſuch as have no
hope, but in this life, it will be, and it begins
to be a time of woe to them; for all creature
comforts, helps and communion, ſhall be taken
away and dead to them. And I believe we are
under that ſound; oppreſſion, and injuſtice,
doth ſo mightily abound in the Kingdoms and
Magiſtracy of the world, for when the ſeventh
Angel ſounds, then Chriſt, or the Anointing,

thouſand years, as the Scripture ſpeaks: which
yet generally doth not appear, though this
Kingdom of Chriſt doth begin to appear, in &amp;
among the Saints that are ſcattered abroad.</p>
            <p>The Beaſt is giving up his laſt breath, and his
violent kicking and ſprawling, troubles the
whole world for a little time; for the ſpirit of
the Beaſt is the life of the Inhabitants of the
Earth: therefore I believe the Witneſſes are
not in killing,<note place="margin">Jer. 30, 17.</note> but in riſing from death, and
that the world muſt ſee ere long; which will
be a third woe to them, when they ſhall ſee
poor deſpiſed Saints whom no man regards,<note place="margin">Rev. 21. 8</note> to
partake of the glory of the City of God, and
they themſelves put by.</p>
            <p>There is one paſſage of <hi>Johns</hi> Viſion; while

<hi>And the four Angels were looſed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Theſe are four evill Angels as I conceive,
which ſtir up the four quarters of the Earth
to enmity againſt every appearance of God, ſo
that there ſhall be riſings up of much bitternes
in the <hi>Eaſt, Weſt, North,</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> among the

think their oppreſſing, impriſoning &amp; murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Saints, under the name of erroneous
Round-heads, doth God good ſervice.</p>
            <p>And it appears they are four evill Angels,

ſo bad a place, as in the River <hi>Euphrates:</hi> and
they were prepared for this time, that is, <hi>For

            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> It appears they are four evill Angels, if we
conſider, firſt, what the great River <hi>Euphrates</hi>
is: I believe this <hi>Euphrates</hi> is the ſpirit of the

of the Earth might be prepared.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The meaning to me is this; That when this
ſpirit of the Beaſt,<note place="margin">Dan. 7. 27.</note> is dried up, deſtroyed and
ſubdued, then the Kings of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> or ſuch,
in and upon whom the Son of righteouſnes

reigns in the earth, that is, in mankind,
forever and ever.</p>
            <p>The ſpirit of the Beaſt or Serpent is called
<hi>Euphrates,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 14.</note> becauſe as the River <hi>Euphrates</hi> in
the Hiſtory, overflowed a great part of the
Earth. So this ſpirit of darknes overflowes
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:108220:57"/>
man-kind, and drownes them in ignorance, pride,
covetouſnes, malice, diſobedience, diſcontent, &amp;
deceived zeale; but when this is dryed up, as it
muſt be when the ſeaventh Angel ſounds, then
the Nations appeare for God.</p>
            <p>And the Saints are called Kings of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi>
for their knowledg,<note place="margin">Mat. 2.</note> and for their faithfulnes to

found out where Jeſus Chriſt lay, when he was

them all things, and they have experience of the
love, ſincerity, humility, peace, and the like, which
are the Laws and walls of that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And likewiſe they know that the ſpiritual
powers of darknes, as ignorance, pride, envy,
diſcontent, hypocriſie, ſelf-love, and the like, is
the Serpent, that would deſtroy Chriſt or the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing:
for if pride ruled which is the Serpent
in the Children of diſobedience, then humility
which is Chriſt in the Saints, muſt be deſtroyed:
And if malice reign, then love which is Chriſt in
the Saints, muſt die. And ſo of all the reſt.
And the Saints knowes this: therefore in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
place they are called Kings of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they do not betray Chriſt into the hands
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:108220:58"/>
of <hi>Herod</hi> the Serpent;<note place="margin">John 5. 4.</note> but they hold forth the

            <p>Now when pride, covetouſnes, injuſtice, envy,

and theſe four Angels were bound up in this
River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and were not ſuffered to act in
their full ſtrength, or appear out of that curſed

            <p>

in Armies to kill and ſlay. But whom do they
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:108220:58"/>
ſlay? Not the witneſſes,<note place="margin">Ez. 38. 10. 11. &amp;c.</note> though they think ſo
in their heart: as it is ſpoke of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog;</hi>
but thoſe men only who have not the Seal of
God in their forehead,<note place="margin">Rev. 4.</note> or as it is ſaid before, the
Inhabitants of the Earth.</p>
            <p>And truly the ſtrong ſubtil craft, unparalleld
hypocriſie, extream envy, and inbred cruelty,
that is expreſſed in the four quarters of the land
of the world too, againſt the Saints, that are
branded <hi>Sectaries, Schiſmaticks, Anabaptiſts,
Round-heads,</hi> doth appear plain to me, to be
thoſe three powerfull Angels of darknes, which
are let looſe in the ſpirits of men, even in that
ſpirit of darknes that hath overſpread the Earth,
man-kind; like the over-flowing River <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> therefore they are evil Angels.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, conſider, how doe theſe Angels
ſlay, the third part of men? Why truly I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it is not their killing of their bodies only,
though it may be in theſe great troubles, many
are, and doubtles ſhall be killed in that ſenſe;
but it points out a worſer death then that of the
body; for they kill the very minds and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of men. And it is thus.</p>
            <p>Theſe four Angels ſhall be ſo powerfull in
mens ſpirits,<note place="margin">Eſa. 25. 13.</note> and ſpread ſo univerſally over the
earth of man-kind,<note place="margin">John 9. 22.</note> That many that are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of a falſe worſhip, and unjuſt wayes that

of men, and out of ſhame to own God, his
wayes at this time are ſo contemptible, and ſo
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:108220:59"/>
generally reproached, ſlandered, and hated, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
a third part of men ſhall turn Hypocrites, and
practice wayes contrary to their knowledg, and
will ſay, do, ſubſcribe and fight, laugh, ſcoſſe,
reproach and kill the Saints, yea do any thing;
ſo they may have the flattering word of their
carnall Neighbours, and not be called <hi>Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads,
Anabaptiſts,</hi> or <hi>Independants,</hi> theſe names
whereby the Saints are branded are ſo odious.</p>
            <p>And truly theſe men are ſlain, for the fearfull
and unbelieving ſhall have their part in the lake,<note place="margin">Rev. 21. 8.</note>
which is the ſecond death. And every Pariſh
through this Kingdom and the World too, at
this very day, are full of theſe dead men and
women.</p>
            <p>But theſe four Angels are ſpiritual powers of
darknes, which do not appear in apparitions
and viſions; but being let looſe in mens ſpirits,
they rule and work there; And the multitudes
of men whom they violently ſtir up are called
Armies of horſe-men, as you may read,<note place="margin">Rev. 9. 6. 17. 18 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

declares their ſtrength and their ſwiftnes to do
hurt, pointed out by the ſtrength and ſwiftnes
of horſes.</p>
            <p>Now theſe Armies of horſe-men, or multitudes
of men, put upon violent and unreaſonable acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
by theſe four evil Angels, are the appearing
cauſe that doth hurt and kill weak ſpirited men
and women, by over-awing them.</p>
            <p>And out of the mouthes of thoſe Armies, thus
ſet on fire; there proceeded fire, ſmoak, and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:108220:59"/>
by which the third part of men were kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
By ſmoak is betokened falſe Doctrines,
threatnings, reproaches, ſcoffes, oppreſſions, and
bitter provocations. Brimſtone betokens, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
whips, plunderings, priſons. And fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokens,
fire and faggot, hanging, murdering, or
putting them to death in any kind, that do
not ſubmit to the wayes of theſe four Angels.</p>
            <p>And this is further cleared by the 19.<note place="margin">Rev. 9. 19.</note> verſ. The
power of this Army whereby they do hurt, is in
their mouths and in their tails.<note place="margin">Mat. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>.</note> That is, they
call their own inventions and lies, the Doctrines
of God; and againſt them that do not ſubmit
thereunto. Firſt, they give out bitter reviling
language, and threatning ſpeeches, to plunder,
impriſon, and kill. And thereby over-aw men, and
make them afraid and aſhamed to own God,
and ſo kill them.</p>
            <p>And if this doth not do,<note place="margin">Rev. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> then their power is
in their tails; when by the Authority of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil

deceived, they over-awe men by puniſhments,
whips, priſons, plunderings, and death; for this
followes the other, as the tail follows the head.</p>
            <p>And therefore mind, That when threatnings,
reproaches, and bitter language goes before;
priſons and death followes,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 2.</note> if they can but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

It is ſaid, <hi>That they of the Nations, Kinred, Tongues,

            <p>Theſe two appearances of God in fleſh, which
teſtifie of God: that is. The appearance of God
in the man Jeſus; and the appearance of God

to God; but theſe Offices of Chriſt have
been trampled upon by the Lawes, Canons,

of the Father in Jeſus and the Saints, have been
like dead bodies, in reſpect of ſuch operations,
and have not acted publikely like themſelves;
but have lain all the time of the Beaſt, dead in
the eye of the unbelieving world, who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
them and ſtumbled at them, till the ſpirit
of life from God, rayſes them up, and ſets
them upon their feet; that is, till God ſubdue

            </p>
            <p>But though the Beaſt have allowed Chriſt the
name of King,<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2. 5.</note> Prieſt and Prophet, yet he hath
denied Chriſt both the operation and honour of
theſe three Offices, and hath ſet the Crown of
theſe upon his own head.</p>
            <p>For whiles the Beaſt declares himſelf to be ſo
quick-ſighted,<note place="margin">John 9. 24.</note> that he can preſently diſcerne,
what is truth and what is errour;<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> and take upon
him, by his uſurped power, to puniſh errours,
with plundering, priſons, and death. Does he
not thereby declare himſelf to be as God in
knowledg, knowing good and evil. And as God
likewiſe in Majeſty, by puniſhing every one that
oppoſes his beaſtly being: and ſo he declares
himſelf to be an abſolute infallible prophet to
teach men, A King to rule and puniſh men, and
a Prieſt to ſave men from death by his skil and
operation.</p>
            <p>And thus the Beaſt hath a long time acted
theſe three Offices of Chriſt,<note place="margin">1 John 20<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thirdly, The time and age of the Beaſt with

And this is that we call reformed Epiſcopacy,
which was of the ſame nature; and had the ſame

theſe two ſhapes of Popery and Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
are called times, becauſe they are two

ſo that here is time, the <hi>Dragon;</hi> and times,

            <p>And this halfe day, or this dividing of time, is
the age of the Beaſt, under which <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

be a very hot time for the length of it; but it
will be but ſhort. And I have ſome hopes that
God will make this three-fold kingdome,<note place="margin">Rev. 11. 13.</note> being
under one Magiſtracy, the tenth part of the City
<hi>Babylon</hi> that ſhall fall off firſt from the Beaſt.</p>
            <p>And this is called <hi>the dividing of time,</hi> becauſe
the witneſſes are neither under an abſolute bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
by Eccleſiaſticall Lawes,<note place="margin">Luk. 21. 17.</note> as formerly; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

power of diſcontent, both of out-ſide profeſſing

               </hi>
but this will not laſt long: for the ſincere-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that <hi>worſhip God in ſpirit and truth,</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
thereby, and are not much viſible in
the eye of the world.</p>
            <p>And then again it is called <hi>the halfe-day,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the ſhortneſſe of it; and when it ſhall
end our God onely knowes: but there are two
things that give me great perſwaſion that this
<hi>halfe-day</hi> is neer an end.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe our Lord Jeſus the <hi>Anointed,</hi>
told us by his own mouth,<note place="margin">Mat. 24. 22.</note> that <hi>theſe days ſhould
be ſhortned for the elects ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>the rejoycing in hope</hi> which <hi>God</hi> hath
put into my heart, grounded upon experience
of his love which I ſee in my ſelf; and in others
of his ſervants; and of his power in ſhaking
Kingdomes, and things in the world, agreeable
to the propheſy of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek 38 19. 20.</note> which was fore-told
to be in the latter dayes, gives me great perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
that this <hi>halfe-day</hi> is neer an end.</p>
            <p>Now it is clear to me, that <hi>the time, times,</hi> or
the <hi>three dayes,</hi> which are but one and the ſame
thing, are already paſt, and therefore I beleeve,
that the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> are not in killing, but are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

to act like themſelves by the Eccleſiaſticall Laws
and Canons of the Beaſt. And theſe <hi>three dayes
and a halfe</hi> cannot be three ſingle dayes, nor
three ſingle yeares and half, according to mens
account of dayes and yeares, as ſome think; for
then the Saints that were ſcattered in all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
kinreds, tongues &amp; people, could not have
ſeen them lie dead in regard of the ſhortneſſe of
time, and the great difficulty of travell to ſee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.
But in the three ages and halfe of the
Beaſt, all the Saints of God through the whole
dominions of the Beaſt, have ſuffered more or
leſſe by the Beaſt, and have ſeen, doe ſee, and
ſhall ſee the captivity end. The teſtimony of
God in thoſe two-fold appearances to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
and not ſuffered to act viſibly in the
world, but to lie like a patient long-ſufferer, till
Chriſt come and <hi>deſtroy his enemies by the word</hi>

               <hi>of his mouth, and by the brightneſſe of his coming.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another thing mind, that though theſe of the
nations, kinreds, tongues and people, do ſee the
dead bodies of the two <hi>Witneſſes</hi> ſo lie in the
ſtreet,<note place="margin">Rev. 11. 9.</note> yet they will not ſuffer them to be put in

Jeſus,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> and in the fleſh of the Saints, as two dead

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:108220:64"/>
looks upon them with pretious thoughts. And
though the City <hi>Babylon</hi> would have theſe two

and put out of memory, by their ſharp

            <p>But there is one clauſe may raiſe a ſcruple: It
is ſaid, <hi>they lie in the ſtreet of the great City, where also</hi>
(where alſo) <hi>our Lord was ſlain.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 11. 8.</note> This implies,
may ſome ſay, that Ieſus Chriſt was neither of
the two witneſſes; but that they were to be
ſlain a long time after his departure hence, and
in the ſame City where alſo he was ſlain.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, when I ſay, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is one
of Gods witneſſes,</hi> I doe not look upon the body
of his fleſh onely,<note place="margin">I Pet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:108220:65"/>
of God in that fleſh of his. And the witneſſes.
If you obſerve all along, I judge them to be
theſe two: Firſt, the manifeſtation of God in
the man Chriſt Ieſus. And ſecondly, the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation
of God in the fleſh of Saints; for
hereby God makes good his ancient word of,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15</note>
promiſe, <hi>That the ſeed of the woman ſhall breake
the Serpents head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore though the fleſh of Chriſt was
killed in that City <hi>Babylon,</hi> (or by the ſpirit of
<hi>Babylon,</hi> which is indeed the meaning) yet the
manifeſtation of God in the fleſh; was not kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by the <hi>Dragon and Leopard,</hi> till divers yeares
after Ieſus Chriſt was crucified.</p>
            <p>For the Saints had a liberty to acknowledge
and profeſſe God openly, and to practice what
<hi>God in Chriſt</hi> had made known to them, for a
long time after Chriſt was departed, and their
teſtimony was not ſuppreſſed by any humane

this Beaſt (or Eccleſiaſticall power) to kill and
ſuppreſſe, not men and women ſimply, but the
manifeſt appearance of God in them,</p>
            <p>And then the purity of the Scriptures of the
Goſpel was corrupted,<note place="margin">Act. 5. Amos 10, &amp;c.</note> and the practice of it
quite altered, and the invention of ſelfe-ſeeking

               </gap>d up in humane letters, ſhould onely do that
work.</p>
            <p>So that the manifeſt appearance of God in
the man Chriſt Ieſus, as it was left in writing,
had a dark veil of humane inferences, and ſelfiſh
concluſions drawn over it: and ever after the
manifeſt appearance of God in the Saints, was
ſuppreſſed likewiſe. For the Beaſt which hath
a limited time and power to reigne,<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2. 4.</note> by God,
will not ſuffer God to reigne by him;<note place="margin">Luke 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 28.</note> but takes
away his liberty, and would deſtroy Gods Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and will not ſuffer God to reveale himſelfe
any more in fleſh and this is called <hi>the time of
Gods patience and long-ſuffering:</hi> ſo that the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
or the manifeſtations of God in fleſh,
were ſlain in that Citie <hi>Babylon,</hi> and lie dead in

            <p>But that ſlaying was but the hiſtory, and God

knowledge, to ſpirituall aud divine knowledge,
and that crucifying is nothing in reſpect of the
other. For to ſuppreſſe the appearance of God
in fleſh, is the main buſineſſe the Serpent aimes

            <p>
               <hi>And in the ſame hour there was an Earthquake.</hi>
By <hi>Earthquake</hi> mind two things: Firſt, when
God ſhakes down all the corrupt fleſh in a
Saint,<note place="margin">Eſay 66. 1.</note> and treads it under his feet, making that
ſubtile, proud, coveteous, envious, and unclean
Serpent his foot-ſtoole,<note place="margin">Prov. 1. 22.</note> ſhaking down, either
more viſible, or leſſe viſible in the eye of the
world, old <hi>Adams</hi> building, that he may ſet up
his own new building, the <hi>Anointing.</hi> And this
ſhaking is that which vnbelievers ſcoff &amp; make a
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:108220:70"/>
laughing-ſtock at in theſe dayes: but they can
do no otherwiſe, for they are ſlaves to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and he makes them do ſo, and they will do
ſo till God pul them out of that power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
But this is not the ſhaking onely which is
pointed out by <hi>Johns viſion,</hi> though without this
the other that follows cannot be done. Therfore</p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>Earthquake</hi> here pointed at, is
this: When God ſhakes down corruption in
Magiſtracy,<note place="margin">Eze. 38. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that he may advance himſel to be the onely tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher

            <p>And in the effecting of this great work, God

ſtands in his way oppoſing him in his work. And
this is the earthquake here ſpoken of, which is
the hiſtory of things, which followes the other
which is the myſtery. For as all outward abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
<note place="margin">☞</note> in mens practiſes came from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling
of the Beaſt in every mans heart: ſo
when God firſt ſhakes down and caſts out the
Beaſt out of mens hearts, the outward abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
and unjuſt practiſes in church and State,
ſhake together and fall preſently.</p>
            <p>And truly this is one main teſtimony that
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:108220:70"/>
God is ſhaking down the corrupt fleſh in many,
and is in rayſing of his Witneſſes, in regard we
ſee ſo much ſhakings of Kingdoms, Aſſemblies,
Churches, and corruptions out of them, which
have been brought in and upheld by the Beaſt,
all the time of his Reign.</p>

Nations of the world,<note place="margin">Rev. 17. 2. 16. 17</note> that have been deceived
by the Beaſt, and that have acted for the Beaſt,

            <p>And there is ſome good hopes, that theſe three

a ſhowre of Hayl,<note place="margin">Eſa. 28. 7.</note> that ſhall ſweepe away all the
refuge of lies before it.</p>
            <p>But if this threefold Kingdom, be not the
tenth part, nor the Land which God will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
the firſt of Nations, in raiſing up his Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
in, and in caſting off their Sack-cloth here,
The Saints muſt wait but a little longer with

and filled with a ſweet joy in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of it, That there is a tenth part of the
City <hi>Babylon,</hi> falling off from the Beaſt; and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:108220:71"/>
ſtriving to ſet the Crown with ſhouting upon

the two witneſſes muſt firſt throw off their

it ſhall be theſe three united Kingdoms or
no, I leave that to our Father and ſubmit to
him; wiſhing in my heart that <hi>England, Scotland,</hi>

I rejoyce inwardly that this ſhall be the

it, I have ſtrong perſwaſions in my ſpirit,
that it ſhall be; I greatly deſire in my ſoul, that
this Land may be the tenth part. Yet not my

            <p>And as there fell in the Earth-quake,<note place="margin">Rev. 13. 11. &amp;c.</note> the tenth
part of the City: ſo in the ſame Earth-quake

            <p>By ſeaven thouſand, I conceive are pointed

(for ſeaven, implies a perfect number)
whereby the Beaſt hath deceived the people; ſo
that all falſe Prophets, falſe Miniſters, either of
Juſtice of Divinity,<note place="margin">Rev. 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19. &amp;c.</note> which have reigned with the

in that great battel of God-Almighty; the beaſt
was taken and with him the falſe Prophet, that
wrought miracles before him: with which he
deceived them that had the marke of the Beaſt,

            <p>When this <hi>Son of righteouſneſſe and love</hi> ariſes
in Magiſtrates and people, one to another, then
theſe tumultuous Nationall ſtormes will ceaſe,
and not till then. This Son is riſen in ſome, or

higher, and the bright ſhining of it will be
<hi>Englands</hi> liberty. Well, I am confident, that
thoſe that are very violent in ſpirit, without
double-dealing, acting outwardly what meerly
is in their hearts and knowledge, though for
the preſent they are tormented even in Hell
night and day by that unquiet Spirit; yet theſe

work God manieſts in ſome, that are ſcattered
up and down, like a few drops of haile before
the ſhowre fall in force. And when he workes
in generall, then the ſhowre of haile ſhall fall in
force, and ſweep away all the refuge of lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it; that is, plentifull diſcoveries of God in
every man, burns up the droſſe of the fleſh, and
plentifull increaſe of Saints in a Kingdome, is
like a ſhowre of haile, that ſweeps away all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations

a time as this is coming on, when the ſeventh
Angel ſounds. And I ſhall leave with you one
Scripture, with which I will conclude.</p>
            <p>And the Temple of God was opened in Heaven,
and there was ſeen in his Temple the Arke of his
Teſtament, and there were lightnings, and voyces,
and thundrings, and an earth-quake, and great
haile.</p>
