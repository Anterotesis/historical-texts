         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

hath bin an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertunity
of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching
and
aggrundizing
themselves; Was to the Author
of this discourse the occasion of
his Meditation: Who though he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb facs="tcp:37537:3"/>
boast the improvement of his
Fortunes, yet thinks he hath gain'd
som<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>thing by the Disasters of the
Times, in that acquaintance they
have brought his thoughts with Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
And if he have herein walkt
Antipodie to the humor of his Age,
and in a time when the thoughts of
others were most studious and intent
upon their gain and interest, and flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on the golden sands of Pactolus;
he hath imployed his another way, he
hopes it is without offence. And
that (in an Age fuller of VVolves
than Men, more fruitful in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of Monsters than Animals,
and Prodigies than Births: in which
not only Government, but every
thing else, both Civil and Divine,
hath been exposed to violence, and
the violent taken it by force: In
which men live more by spoyl and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine,
than according to the Rules of
Law, or Dictates of Reason) a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
of this Nature will not seem
<pb facs="tcp:37537:3"/>
impertinent or unseasonable: espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to such, who either through Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
or modesty are ill adapted to
jostle in a turbulent and tumultuous
World, that had rather sequester
themselves than others, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their thoughts with the felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of an innocent and Happy <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,</hi>
than Projects of waxing rich
by wrongs and injuries.</p>
            <p>That the Author came too late in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the World to obtain a Part in the
late Tragedies, or was too young to
Espouse a faction in the late unhappy
Quarrels, he is thankful unto Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence:
But that the date of his
Nativity was so timed, as to render
him a Spectator, though not a Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
to give him an opportunity of
improving his Reason, though not
Estate; and gathering Experience
though not Riches, from the bitter
root of our Publick Evils, he num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
not amongst his Misfortunes:
not that he took delight in beholding
<pb facs="tcp:37537:4"/>
the Tragedies of his Country, or was
pleased to see the place of his Birth
become a Cock-pit of strife, a Scene
of Blood, or Shambles of Slaughters
and Villanies: But for that as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
hath said, its better going to
the house of mourning than rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.
He supposes it may in a like
sense, be more advantagious to be
born in a time of affliction than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity.
And if something either of
Ingenuity or Honesty excluded him
from dividing the spoil, and sharing
the Prey with the Nimrods and
mighty Hunters of the Age, he hopes
he shall not be envyed the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his <hi>Poverty,</hi> by those who
without his Envy possess the good
things of the Earth, it being the only
and best advantage he was able to
make of the worst of times.</p>
            <p>And if any be offended at either
the Luxuriancy of Stile, or Loosnesse
of Method in this Discourse, as judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them unsutable to the gravity of
<pb facs="tcp:37537:4"/>
its Subject; they are desired to take
notice, that it is not a Sermon but
Meditation, and therefore speak not
the Dialect of the Pulpit, but Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity,
as being pen'd not by an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Theologue, but young Disciple;
who though he made use of a Text of
Scripture as a Clue to guide his
thoughts, through the Labyrinth of
his Discourse, the better to avoid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion:
yet intended not to betray
himself to the bondage of any Laws
that should abridg the liberty of using
such stile and method as should best
correspond to the humor of his Fancy,
and sute with the Nature of an Essay
or loose Discourse. If therefore
maturer Judgments shall discover a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Lapses or Errata's, as may not be
difficult, in a work that pretends as
little to perfection, as its Author to
Infallibility, he hopes they may be
look'd upon as the more veneal, by
reason immaturity of years may be
some Apology for the same in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb facs="tcp:37537:5"/>
The Heavens are not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
free from Corruption, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Curiosity hath discovered spots
in the Sun; and therefore it were the
highest arrogance Worms are capable
to be guilty of, to undertake the proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of any thing should vye perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with those Coelestial bodies, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
exemption from all manner of
Deficiency: it being the sole Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
of the inerring Councils of a
Deity to put forth Editions without
Errata's, or become the Author of
what can boast an absolute perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and immunity from all flaws and
wrinkles that may stain the beauty
and symmetry of its proportions. I
shall not longer detain you in the
Threshold, only give me leave to tell
you, That Poverty is a better Guest
to a Mans thoughts than House, and
is more comfortably entertain'd in a
Meditation than Family; and am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
were it oftner so treated, we
should seldomer be necessitated to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb facs="tcp:37537:5"/>
it in the quality of a Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick:
But the unhappiness of most is
to have no other acquaintance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
than what's acquired by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Experience: and never
to spend thought thereon, till it comes
upon them liks an armed man, till it
comes to quarter and take up its a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode
with them, to be their Inmate,
and familier Companion. Which is
but just on those that would never
know it as the Object of their Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
towards others, while the day of
their prosperity lasted. Now to such
who through the injury either of past
or future times must expect the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of this unwelcom Guest to lodg
and quarter with them, is this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
more especially addressed; that
they may know how to entertain, how
to welcom, how to improve and make
good use of the worst of Evils: that
they may be able to deceive their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
to supplant their misfortune, to
thrive by their losses, and turn their
<pb facs="tcp:37537:6"/>
Crosses into Crowns. All which is
to be obtain'd by that Poverty of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
this Discourse recommends, that
will fully compensate and make
amends for the injuries of Fortune,
together with all other Afflictions
that may befal them while Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
continues their Pilgrimage in
this Vale of Tears.</p>

            </p>
            <p>1 The Preacher, and seeing the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
he went up into a Mountain,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is Christ, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 1.
<hi>God, who at sundry times, and in divers
manners spake in times past unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
by the Prophets, ver. 2. hath in
these last daies spoken unto us by his Son,
whom he hath appointed Heir of all things,
and by whom also he hath made the World.</hi>
Should God send us Heavenly Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in Earthly Vessels, we ought not
to refuse it: Should God speak to us
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37537:7"/>
from the mouth of a Babe, or Suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
we ought not to despise it, for
out of the mouths of such he hath
sometimes ordained praise: And
therefore we are not so much to look
at the Messenger, as the message; it
matters not much through what pipes,
or of what mettal the Waters of Life
are conveyed to us, though through
leaden pipes, the basest and most ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble
of all mettals. If God send us
a message (as he sometime did <hi>Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>)
by the mouth of an Ass, we are
bound to receive it, to lend a willing
and obedient ear unto it; with how
much more attention then ought we
attend unto the preachings of the
Son of God? It's said the Queen of
<hi>Sheba</hi> came from far to hear the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>Solomon,</hi> to sit under the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
of the King of <hi>Israel,</hi> to sit
under the droppings and teachings
of that wise Kings lips.</p>
            <p>Loe! here's one greater then <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi>
one greater then an Angel,
not the wisest of Kings, but the King
of Wisdome, the Wisdome of God,
the Fountain of which, the wisdome
of <hi>Solomon</hi> was but as a small drop,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37537:8"/>
the Ocean of which, his was but a
shallow stream, or small rivelet; the
Sun of which, his was but as a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
spark, or a faint and glimmering
beam; the sum and substance of
which, his was but a dark type, and
gloomy shadow; the consideration
whereof should quicken up our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
for shall God bow the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
to speak unto us, and shall not
we lift up our hearts unto him? Shall
Christ take so long a journey, as to
descend from heaven, and come of an
Embassie from the Father to us, an
Embassie of Grace and Peace, and
shall we not give him audience? shall
Wisdome it self charm us, and we
like the deaf Adder stop our ears?
Shall the Eternal Son of God turn
Divine, and become a Preacher to the
sons of men, and not obtain an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory?
Shall Christ call unto us, and
we not answer? Rather let us say
with <hi>Samuel, Speak Lord, for thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
hear:</hi> And as it is in the parable
of the Vineyard, though we have buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feted
the servants, and stoned those
that were sent unto us, yet let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
the Son, least we be cast out
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37537:8"/>
into that place of torment we read
those unworthy servants deservedly
were.</p>
            <p>Thus much concerning the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher;
I thought not impertinent to
premise, for the better quickning and
awakening of attention to what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
            <p>2 The occasion, and that was
Christs seeing the multitude. Christ
sometime said he had meat the world
knew not of, <hi>for it was his meat and
his drink to do the will of him that sent
him.</hi> He went up and down seeking
occasion, and arresting all opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of doing good: He could not
see poor souls wandring like sheep
without a Shepherd, but the bowels
of his compassion yerns towards
them, but his soul melts and dissolves
in pity to them.</p>
            <p>And herein he hath set a Copy for
our imitation; thus should we way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
(as I may so say) occasions, and
even court opportunities of doing
good: Thus should we endeavour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that hid <hi>Manna,</hi> making it our
meat and drink to do the Will of
God: Thus should the bowels of our
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37537:9"/>
love yern towards our Brethren, and
whensoever we see poor souls wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
like lost sheep, straying after
their own inventions, and wilderd
in their own imaginations, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to set them right, and bring
them back to the Fold of Christ.</p>
            <p>In cases of necessity every man is
to be a Physitian, so may I say in
some; yea, in any cases, every man is
to be a Divine, not that I would lay
waste the profession of the <hi>Ministery,</hi>
by treading down any hedge, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Divine Right, or Humane Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
hath made to fence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close
it: or incourage any one rashly,
and without a Call from God, to
intrude and break into that Divine
and Sacred Function; no, I would
not willingly prompt any to lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallowed
hands upon the Ark of
God; as if the Ark of Religion could
not stand, unless prop'd up by irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
presumption, or that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
of Christianity were in danger
to fall, unless some profane and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
<hi>Herculesses</hi> put under their
shoulders to bear them up, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the <hi>Atlas,</hi> or Pillars, to support
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37537:9"/>
them: No, I know its a dangerous
thing to offer strange fire to the Lord,
all are not to meddle with the holy
things of the Altar, least the fire of
Gods Wrath break forth upon them,
as we read it sometime did not those
that too rashly and unadvisedly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surp'd
the Priests Office, so dangerous
a thing it is to be too busie and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous:
There is a <hi>Sanctum Sancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi>
of some Ordinances, into which
all must not enter, with which it
may not be safe for every one to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle:
But thus far we may safely go and
own, as the duty of every one that is
called to be a Christian, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
exhorting and admonishing
one another: I say, whosoever hath
a gift, or talent from God, ought to
improve it to the utmost he can for
Gods Glory: Let no man therefore
be asham'd to exhort his Brother, to
preach unto his Neighbour, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
his Family, for every one
ought to be a King, Priest, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
to himself, and his own Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and with <hi>Iob,</hi> offer Sacrifice for
his own house.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomon,</hi> who best knew how to put
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37537:10"/>
a right and true estimate on Honor,
triumph'd more in the single Epethite
of the Preacher, than all his swell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
titles, as King of <hi>Israel,</hi> and
therefore prefixes that before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to imbellish and inrich his
Name. It was a good custome of the
best Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> to read the Law
unto the people; and it is well known,
that the Imperial Purple of Great
<hi>Constantine</hi> never blush'd to see him
preach unto his Subjects: Let no man
therefore be asham'd of the Gospel,
as he would not have Christ asham'd
of him at the great Assizes of the
world.</p>
            <p>God under the Law required the
first fruits, and the first-born to be
dedicated to him, but its the custom
of our Age to offer their youngest
sons to the service of the Altar; and
do we not herein, like blind <hi>Isaac,</hi>
give the blessing to the youngest?
And may we not say to our great
Gentlemen, and Elder Brethren, that
wholly sequester themselves to any
imployment or profession, rather than
the Ministery, that like <hi>Esau,</hi> they
sell their birth-right for a mess of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37537:10"/>
pottage; or as Christ said to <hi>Martha,</hi>
Martha, Martha, <hi>thy Sister hath chosen
the better part:</hi> So may we not say to
these Gallants, Your younger Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
have chosen, or rather gotten
the better part; that <hi>Iacob</hi> hath sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted
<hi>Esau,</hi> and is gone away with
the blessing.</p>
            <p>In the Primitive and Virgin Age
of the World, before it was deflowred
and debauch'd by ill customes, and
therefore celebrated by the wanton
pens of Poets, under the name of the
<hi>Golden Age;</hi> the Heads of Families
both taught and govern'd the rest of
their Brethren, which as it was the
first &amp; original Copy of Government,
so may rationally be presum'd the
fairest, and less blur'd with Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
than those more imperfect mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Transcripts that latter Ages
have drawn in lines of blood.</p>
            <p>It was a custome among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
if any Souldier had sav'd the
life of a Citizen, to reward his val or
with their <hi>Corona Civica,</hi> to bestow
some special mark of Honor on him:
Of how great honor then may he be
thought worthy, that reprieves the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37537:11"/>
life of a Citizen of the <hi>New Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
that saves a soul, not from a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
a temporal, but an eternal
death?</p>
            <p>The gratitude of <hi>Alexander,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
himself no less beholding
to his Master <hi>Aristotle,</hi> than to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Philip,</hi> as having receiv'd from
him nothing but his being, and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to live, whereas from <hi>Aristotle</hi> he
had receiv'd his well-being, and how
to live well: I am sure we are more
indebted to our Spiritual Parents that
have begotten us unto the Lord, that
have been the means and instruments
of Regeneration, of forming the
New-birth, and bringing forth Christ
in us, than we are to our Natural
Parents, that brought us into the
world, into this vale of tears and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery.</p>
            <p>Oh! its a glorious thing to save
Souls, to snatch poor Souls like
brands out of the fire of Hell, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scue
a soul from the jaws of Eternal
Death, to be an <hi>Index Mercurius,</hi> to
direct and shew men the way to <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a holy ambition, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37537:11"/>
of the bravest spirit, to save one
soul, being more glorious than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
a thousand worlds.</p>
            <p>The profane adulation of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
Deified their Emperours, and
there being a new Star discovered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the time of <hi>Iulius</hi> his death, the
credulity of their Superstition
prompted them to believe it <hi>Caesars</hi>
Soul: But we may without either
flattery, or Superstition, safely believe,
that such Souls shall shine as bright
and resplendent Stars in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Glory, the light of whose
Life and Doctrine, while here on
earth, lead many to Christ. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
were the Conversion of a Soul
a slight business, there would not be
such solemn Triumphs in Heaven,
such shoutings and rejoycings among
the Angels, at the Conversion of one
sinner.</p>
            <p>And that this may fall with more
weight, and leave the greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
on our spirits, it may be
worth our while to consider, that
whensoever we loose, or let slip an
opportunity of doing good, whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we neglect reclaiming any poor
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:37537:12"/>
wildred soul, that is lost and intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in his own inventions, and stray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after his own imaginations, if he
die in his sins, and perish from the
way of Life; how if God should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
his Soul at our hands.</p>
            <p>Its said in the Law, <hi>By whosoevers
hands mans blood is shed, his blood shall
be shed.</hi> Now if they that prevent
not Murder, when its in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
contract much of the guilt, and
become accessary to the crime, shall
not we be stain'd with the guilt, and
become accessary to the Eternal death
of our Brother, if we put not forth
our endeavours to convert and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
him, especially of such as the
hand of Providence hath deliver'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to our care, and as it were, put
under the wing of our protection?
May not God thus require of Masters
of Families the blood of many that
have perish'd, that have miscarried
under their charge; and of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
the blood of the People, and
their Subjects? It will not excuse us
to say, that we are no <hi>Divines, Divinity</hi>
is none of our profession: Is it not
enough that we pretend to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37537:12"/>
that we wear the Livery of
Christs Name, that we make professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Gospel, ought not then
Divinity to be every one of our Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
every one of our professions?</p>
            <p>Did God require under the Law,
that if our enemies sheep fell into a
pit, we should help it out? And will
he not require, that if our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
our friend fall, we should be
so unchristian, so unnatural, so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane,
as not to put forth our
hand to help him up? Can we do
one another a more friendly office,
a greater kindness, a more rich, a
more Noble, a more obliging favour
than (like the good <hi>Samaritan</hi>) to
poure Wine and Oyl into one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
wounds, than to wash, dress,
and cleanse the spiritual soars of one
anothers Souls? Can we any way do
a more charitable and Christian Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice?</p>
            <p>Its reported of a good <hi>Heathen,</hi>
that whensoever he had not gain'd a
new friend, or by some Noble Office
of Love or Friendship, oblig'd some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one
or other to him, so great was the
generosity of his mind, he us'd to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:37537:13"/>
say at night, <hi>diem perdidi,</hi> alas I have
lost a day, as counting that day un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
to be numbered and reckon'd
to the Calender of his life, in which
he had done no good: And shall not
we Christians sit down every evening,
and take account of our selves, what
good we have done each day, and
with <hi>Iob,</hi> curse that day, and account
it as altogether lost, and unworthy
to be numbred, in which we have
gain'd no opportunity of doing
good.</p>
            <p>Doth God require we should honor
him with our substance, and will he
not likewise expect we should honor
him with our parts and faculties?
Will he not expect that all our ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
should be put forth to use, that
our whole stock should be laid out
and improved for bringing in some
Revenue, some tribute of honor to
the Exchequer of his Name and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?
though it be as small as the Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
mite, it will be accepted.</p>
            <p>Let every one therefore take heed
of hiding his Talent, of laying it up
in a Napkin, of burying it under
ground, least it be taken from him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:37537:13"/>
Doth God require the seventh part
of our time, and the tenth part of
our estates? and will he not likewise
require some tythe of our gifts and
faculties? Hath God opened to any
one a door of utterance, given him
the Tongue of the Learned, bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on him the gift of Eloquence, let
him not think he may do therewith
as he pleaseth, or that he can make a
better use thereof, than by becoming
an Orator for God, to court and
woe men to come in unto the Lord
Jesus, and accept of the offers and
tenders of Love, Mercy, and Grace,
that are made unto them in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
as God shall put opportunities
into his hand; for is it not a Noble
thing to be imploy'd as a Labourer in
Gods Vineyard, to be a builder of the
Church of God? which honor if any
one refuse or despise, let him know
that God who at first open'd, can
as easily shut, and bar again the door
of his utterance, and give him a
stammering tongue, in stead of the
lips of knowledge.</p>
            <p>So if God hath given to any man
the illumination of his Spirit, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:37537:14"/>
hath caused his Face to shine upon
him, hath given him any taste and
experience of his love, let him not
think scorn to communicate of what
he hath received, and help build up
the walls of <hi>Sion,</hi> least God rob and
plunder him of his enjoyments, and
eclipse the light of his countenance
from him.</p>
            <p>Will God require of us an account
of our Stewardship in the outward
things of this life? Will God require
of us his Flax, and his Wine, and his
Oyl, if we waste, and abuse them?
And will he not require a more exact
and severer account of all the gifts
and Intellectual Endowments his
Mercy hath bestowed upon us? Will
he not much more require them at
our hands, if we honor him not with
them?</p>
            <p>Hath God promised the encrease of
his blessing, and the blessing of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
on our outward mundane en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments,
if we lay them out for his
Glory? Hath he been pleased to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
himself our Debtor, for
our charity to the poor, and said, <hi>He
that gives unto the poor, lends unto the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37537:14"/>
Lord?</hi> Hath he been pleased to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
our Surety, to enter into Bonds
and Covenants, to pawn his Word,
and ingage his Promise, that if we
<hi>cast our bread upon the Waters, after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
dayes we shall find it?</hi> And will he
not become much more our Debtor
for our Spiritual Alms, for our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Charity, if we cast (as I may so
say) the Bread of Life upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
if we deal to the poor of our
Spiritual Food, of our Spiritual <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
if we relieve the hunger of poor
starved souls? Shall not he loose his
Reward that gives a cup of cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to a Disciple? and shall he think
you be without reward, that refreshes
the poor, dry, and parched soul with
the Waters of Life, that draws wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
out of the Wells of Salvation for
poor souls? Is our liberality of the
things of this life so acceptable to
God? and will not our Spiritual
Charity be much more?</p>
            <p>Moreover, Is our Charity to the
poor, and lending to the Lord of
these outward things, the best and
greatest Usury, the best and greatest
way and means of improvement, God
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:37537:15"/>
having promised to return an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
fold? And is it not as good hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry,
as good a way of improving
the treasures of the mind, the talents
of Wisdome and Knowledge? If any
have rob'd the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> have stoln
from the <hi>Heathen</hi> any Earings or Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
of Humane Learning, any Pearls
of Knowledge or Science, can he
better imploy them, than to adorn
the Truths of the Gospel with them,
than to have them sanctified by the
Altar? Is there any better way to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
the stock of our Learning, to
inrich the treasures of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing?</p>
            <p>But if this consideration seem
slight, or will not prevail with us;
however, let the fear of loosing them,
the fear that God may blow upon
them, and cause them to blast and
wither; for, as was observed before,
how justly may God strip, rob, and
spoil us of them, if we refuse to
glorifie him with them? How justly
may he eclipse all the light of our
Knowledge, by infatuating our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings,
and confounding our
memories? How justly may he turn
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:37537:15"/>
our Sun into Darkness, and our Moon
into Blood? How justly may he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
all our faculties with igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
or cause them to set in a cloud
of dotage and folly before the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
nay, in the very morning of
our age? How justly may he turn our
wisdome into folly, and our pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
into madness? Oh! how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
great Wits have on this account
been blasted, that might otherwayes
have been bright Stars, Stars of the
first Magnitude in the Firmament of
Knowledge, and glorious Lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in the Orbs of Learning, who
through the just Curse of God upon
their parts, have either prov'd bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
Meteors, or flaming Comets,
to fill the World with wonder and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement,
and then extinguish'd in
smoak and ashes, or gone out like the
snuff of a Candle, leaving nothing
but the memory of their wickedness
to stink in the Nostrils both of God
and man.</p>
            <p>Let this consideration at least pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with us, to write after this Copy,
Christ hath set us, of arresting all
opportunities of doing good, and to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:37537:16"/>
honor God with all the faculties of
our Souls, with all the gifts and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
of our minds, least he
plunder and strip us of them, least he
dethrone our Reasons, and turn us a
grazing with the Beasts of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
as he sometime did <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi>
and make us to eat thistles with
the Ass.</p>
            <p>I confess I have dwelt something
too long on this particular, <hi>viz.</hi>
The occasion, but it yeelded so fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
an Harvest to my thoughts, that
I knew not how to crowd them into
less room, or gather them into fewer
periods.</p>
            <p>The third particular is the Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and that was mixt, consisting of
the multitude, and Christs Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
            <p>During the time of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
under the Law, God had a
peculiar people, the Nation of the
<hi>Iews,</hi> whom his Favour was pleas'd
to pick and cull, as a precious Jewel
from the dross and rubbish of the rest
of mankind, to whom alone, of all
the Families of the earth, the Oracles
of God were committed; to whom
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:37537:16"/>
alone the Law and the Prophets were
given: They only of the Sons of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
had the priviledge to wear the
Livery of Gods Name, to be called
the people of the Lord; they alone
were permitted to tread the Courts of
Gods House, to have access to his
Sanctuary, to approach his Altars,
when as all the rest of the World were
prohibited under the dreadful penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of an <hi>Anathema,</hi> with a <hi>procul ite
hinc, procul ite profani;</hi> time was, when
they only were accounted the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the Kingdome, and all the
rest of the World as Aliens, and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casts,
as dogs unworthy of the very
crums that fell from their table; as
Swine, to whom the precious Pearls of
the Gospel might not be cast; time
was, when they only were accounted
within the pale of the Church, the
only place wherein God was pleas'd
to plant the Vineyard of his Church,
the only spot of ground his love had
taken in and inclos'd from the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
of the World, wherein to
plant his fear, and the knowledge of
his Name, while the rest of the Earth
lay neglected, as a rude Barren, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:37537:17"/>
uncultivated Desert, ore-grown with
Atheisme and Barbarisme.</p>
            <p>They were the <hi>Eden,</hi> the <hi>Garden,</hi> the
<hi>Paradise</hi> of God, the Land flowing
with milk and honey, the place where
God was pleas'd to make known the
greatness of his Name, when as all
the rest of the miserable Off spring
and Posterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> liv'd as
without God in the world; time
was, when they were the only Sons
of Light, and when <hi>Palestine,</hi> or the
Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> was the only <hi>Goshan,</hi>
on which God caus'd the light of his
Countenance to shine, when as all
the rest of the World, all the rest of
the Nations of the Earth sate in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
in <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkness, and as in
the vale and shadow of death, when
as all the rest of mankind lay under
an eclipse, and dark night of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>But now blessed be God, the Scene
of things are changed, the Partition
Wall of Separation is now broken
down, the Vale of the Temple is now
rent, and its door set open to all the
Nations and Kindreds of the Earth:
The borders of the Church are now
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:37537:17"/>
inlarg'd, and God <hi>hath given to his
Son the Heathen for his Inheritance, and
the uttermost parts of the Earth for his
Possession;</hi> the Bread of Life is now
dealt to all: The King, as it is in
the parable, hath now sent his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
into the midst of the streets, to
invite all to the Marriage Feast:
Time was, when <hi>Canaan</hi> was the Land
flowing with milk and hone, but
now every one is invited to buy
Wine, and Milk, and Honey, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
money, and without price: time
was, when only the <hi>Iewes</hi> were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Table of Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
but now there is a Feast pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
of fat things, of Wine well
refined from the <hi>Lees,</hi> and Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made, <hi>That every one that hungreth
after righteousness, may come eat, and be
satisfied; and every one that thirsteth, is
invited to drink of the Waters of Life
freely;</hi> For God is pleas'd now, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Gospel, to keep open House,
as I may so say, and to give enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
to all comers, to make wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
all that come unto him, and
puts none by, refuses none that offer
themselves by Faith unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:37537:18"/>
The time is now come, in which
the Son of Righteousness is to arise
with healing under his wings, and
shine upon the whole earth, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
all the dark corners thereof,
that the whole world may become a
<hi>Goshan,</hi> a Land of Light, in which
the Saints are to be gathered from
the four Corners, and the four
Winds, in which the fear of the Lord
is to fall on all hearts, and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of his Name to abound, and
cover the face of the Earth, as the
waters cover the Sea.</p>
            <p>God hath now set open the door
of his Mercy, and holds forth the
Golden Scepter of his love to all:
He doth now open wide, and stretch
forth the Arms of his Love, that he
may receive the whole World into his
Imbraces: He hath now, as it were,
pull'd up the Sluces, and open'd
(as I may so say) the Flood-gates of
his Mercy, that every one may drink
thereof, and taste that the Lord is
gracious, that he may bathe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh
every dry and parched Soul:
He doth now open the Treasures of
his Grace, and bring forth the riches,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:37537:18"/>
the exceeding great riches of his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
In brief, the Gospel is now ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
to both <hi>Iew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> and
the doors of the Sanctuary stand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
unto all, so that they are inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable
that neglect, despise, or contemn
the means of so great Salvation, the
offers and tenders of so great Love
and Mercy. So much for the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
I now come to</p>
            <p>4 The place; and that was a
Mountain, not Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> on
which God appear'd cloath'd with
Thunder, and incompass'd with
flames of fire, and Clouds of smoak,
the Mountain on which God appear'd
in the Majesty of a great Dictator, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Laws to the Children of <hi>Israel;</hi>
the Mountain which trembled with
the presence of the Lord, and before
which the hearts of the people of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
quak'd, fearing they should be
consum'd from before the presence of
the great <hi>Iehovah:</hi> This was not the
Mountain, on which God gave the
Law in a voice of thunder, when the
Sons of <hi>Iacob</hi> desir'd the Lord might
not speak unto them, but by his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
<hi>Moses:</hi> No, this was Mount <hi>Sion,</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:37537:19"/>
the Mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> the Mount of
Peace: When <hi>Moses</hi> had been awhile
with God in the Mount, his Face had
so great a lustre, that the <hi>Israelites</hi>
were not able to behold it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
desir'd him to put a vail there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
And when <hi>Paul</hi> was caught up
into the third Heavens, he was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
beyond himself; <hi>Whether in
the body, or out of the body, he could not
tell:</hi> He then saw Visions, and had
Revelations, which were unutterable.
So likewise our Saviour, so soon as he
came into the Mount, began to preach,
and bless the people; his lips began
then to melt, and drop sweetness, to
let fall blessings on the people:
Whence, by the way, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that they only are fit to preach,
who have seen God in the Mount,
who have had some rapture and exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
of spirit, who have had their
hearts elevated, and lifted up to God,
whose affections have taken flight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Region of earthly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and had some experience of
the goodness of God upon their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits:
then they will be able to speak
feelingly, then they will speak experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37537:19"/>
and say not <hi>the things we
have heard,</hi> that we have received
from the hand of Fame, but what
<hi>we have seen &amp; handled of the Word of
Life, declare we unto you:</hi> Then they
will be able with our Saviour to say,
<hi>Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is
the Kingdome of Heaven;</hi> and so we are
at length arriv'd at the subject of our
Discourse: &amp; am sorry we have been
so long detain'd in the Porch, view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the coherence and structure of the
context; but I hope we have not
much wandered from the road of
our Text, or at least kept within view
thereof.</p>
            <p>The text is the first words of our
Saviours Sermon on the Mount,
whose mouth was no sooner opened,
but his lips drop'd like the honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb:
This is not the language of
the <hi>Law, Do this and live:</hi> This is not
the Dialect spoken on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi>
but this is the Language of the Lamb,
the sweet and still voice of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel;
<hi>The Law was given by</hi> Moses, <hi>but
Grace and Truth came by Iesus Christ.</hi>
Oh! how beautiful should his feet be
in our eyes, that hath brought these
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:37537:20"/>
glad tydings of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Blessed are the poor in spirit:</hi> Oh!
these are comfortable words, these are
refreshing words, these speak Peace,
these speak Life to a poor soul, these
drop oyl and gladness into a wounded
spirit, these are words able to rebuke
an inraged Sea, and calm the billows
of a troubled Conscience, to restore
brightness and serenity to a clouded
spirit, to a soul full of storms, clouds,
and tempests.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Blessed are the poor:</hi> Oh! how much
doth Christs Dialect differ from that
of the World; we say, Blessed are the
rich, blessed are the full, blessed are
those who know no want, whose Barns
are full of corn, whose houses are full of
wealth, that can say with the rich glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
in the Gospel, <hi>Soul, eat and drink,
and take thy case, for thou hast much goods
laid up in store:</hi> We say, Blessed are those
on whom a Sun of Prosperity shines, on
whom the favour of the world smiles:
But Oh how far, and how high, are
Gods thoughts above ours! even as
high as the heavens are above the
earth, so far are his thoughts, and
his wayes above ours. I know this
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37537:20"/>
is a great Paradox to the Learning,
a dark riddle to the wisdome of the
World: What, are the poor blessed?
they that lye in the dust, on whom
all men trample, that are contemn'd,
despis'd, and made (as it were) the
very off-scouring of the earth? But
God sees not as the World sees, the
byes of his Omnisciency see farther
then the dark Opticks of our flesh are
able to look: He sees thorow things,
to the very pith and marrow of them,
whereas we see only the husks, the
shells of things; we are able to look
no farther than outward appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
than the Varnish Paint, and
Gilt the World hath set on things;
our eyes are detain'd on the superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of things, being able to comment
on nothing but light and colours;
whereas the Eyes of the Almighty pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate
to the very heart and core of
things, He looks to the farthest end
of them, and discerns whats behind
the Curtain; <hi>Exitus actum probat;</hi> its
the End and <hi>Catastrophe</hi> of a thing
that denominates it either good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
that's well, that ends well, that
is crowned with a good event, or is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:37537:21"/>
as the Proverb saith, <hi>Ante abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
nemo suprema<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> funera faelix,</hi> Could
the Heathenish Poet sing; it is our
short-sightedness, the dulness of our
understandings Opticks, that makes
us often judge &amp; envy those as happy,
who are the most miserable, poor, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
creatures in the world, and
such, as if we knew them aright, we
should look on, rather as objects of
our pity, than our envy. Our eyes
being dazled by the outward pomp
and splendor of this life, which is
nothing but a meer Pageantry of gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
shews, judge those often the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors
of the greatest felicity, who
inherit nothing but misery.</p>
            <p>But could we see those things (we
so often make the objects of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
the idols of our desires) to
the core, and within the inmost r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>nd,
we should find they were but like the
Apples of <hi>Sodom,</hi> beautiful to the
eye, but such as being toucht, drop
to ashes; or like the <hi>Fairies</hi> money,
that turns to dust; or those beautiful
Sepulchres, of which our Saviour
speaks in the Gospel, that are <hi>full of
nothing but rotteness, and dead mens
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:37537:21"/>
bones.</hi> This is a truth so legible, that
many of the <hi>Heathen Phylosophers,</hi> by
the dark twi-light of their natural
reason, were able to spell it out; <hi>viz.</hi>
that mans happiness consists not in
the enjoyment of these outward
things, witness the Doctrine of the
<hi>Stoicks,</hi> who plac'd the Spring of
their Felicity in nothing without
themselves, who though they built
not their Felicity on Christ, of whom
it was their happiness to be ignorant,
yet were not so foolish, as to place it
in riches, or any of the other fading,
withering, perishing enjoyments of
this Life, but on Virtue: And though
<hi>Aristotle</hi> and the <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> whose
weaker eyes were something more
dazled with the pomp and splendor of
<hi>Alexanders</hi> Court, and the Varnish of
the World, were content to admit
these outward enjoyments, as Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids
to wait and attend on Virtue;
yet did not like the bruitish <hi>Epicures,</hi>
that Phylosophical Herd of Swine,
place their Felicity in them, though
they acknowledg'd they might confer
some ornament and lustre, and it
might receive some beauty and splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
from them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:37537:22"/>
But we are here taught another do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
by Christ, another Lesson in
the Gospel; <hi>Blessed are the poor in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
In the words, there is first a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
or an Assertion laid down,
<hi>Blessed are the poor in spirit,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>
of which a pregnant
ground, or reason, follows in the
next words; <hi>For theirs is the Kingdome
of Heaven:</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>
As if Christ by his Divine Logick had
thus argued, for the words do carry
in their womb this Syllogism of which
without violence they may be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd;
they are blessed, whose is the
Kingdom of heaven, that are the Heirs
of Salvation, that are the Sons of
God, the Seed of the most High, the
Bloud-Royal of Heaven, on whom
Heaven, Happiness, and Eternal Life
is intail'd; but such are the poor in
spirit, they are the Heirs of Life, of
Heaven, of Happiness, which is the
<hi>minor;</hi> therefore they are blessed.</p>
            <p>I shall speak to the Proposition, and
its Reason, severally: And first to
the Proposition, or Assertion, <hi>blessed
are the poor in spirit;</hi> in which we shall
consider: First, the subject, <hi>Poor in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:37537:22"/>
spirit:</hi> Secondly, the predicate,
<hi>Blessed.</hi> And first for the subject, <hi>Poor
in spirit,</hi> in the Original, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>
saith <hi>Beza, Est proprie
mendicus i. e. ad extreman inopiam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dactus;
qui nil habet nisi quod ostiatim ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceperit,</hi>
saith <hi>Stephanus;</hi> the word sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth,
one reduced to extreme Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
or one that hath nothing but
what he begs from door to door. But
for the better and more methodical
assoiling this Question, what is here
meant by <hi>poor in spirit,</hi> we shall first
shew negatively who these poor in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
are not, and then give the true
Criterion, or Character, whereby
to discover who they are; therefore
by <hi>poor in spirit,</hi> we are not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,</p>
            <p>1 They that are poor, in respect of
the fortunes of this life; for in respect
of this Poverty, it is said by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>David</hi> in <hi>Psalm 37. 25. I have been
young, and now am old, yet have I not
seen the righteous forsaken, or his Seed
begging Bread.</hi> For these outward en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments
are also the gifts and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
of God, which he seldome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
his own people, in such a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:37537:23"/>
as may relieve the necessities
of nature, and render their lives com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable:
And though these outward
blessings, these common favours, these
mercies of the left hand, are no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing
Characteristical marks of
Gods special grace and favour, though
they are not the special pledges and
Criteria of his Love, for that the
Sun of these common favours his
goodness causes to shine <hi>upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just,
as well as just, and the rain</hi> of
these vulgar mercies <hi>to fall upon the
wicked, as well as the good,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
in a more plentiful manner, in
more large and plentiful showres up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the wicked, then on the good, for
their portion is not in the things of
this life, God reserves more rich,
more choice mercies for them, their
happiness not consisting in having the
Sun of an outward prosperity shine
upon them, but in the shining forth
of the light of Gods countenance:
But however, he doth not usually al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
with-hold these outward en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments
from them, though he
commonly doth not see it good for
them to riot in the like excess, as he
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:37537:23"/>
often permits the wicked, least too
rank a fortune might cause their
hearts to wax fat, and forget God;
yet he usually denies them not food
and rayment, yea, he fills their hearts
with food and gladness, by blessing
their small estates unto them, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them a contented mind, which
is a continual feast.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is not the poverty of
Fortune here meant, whether volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
or through the tyranny of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
and it is not that poverty of
Fortunes that is upon compulsion and
necessi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>y, by reason such poverty is
commonly the Judgement of God,
and produc't of some enormous
crimes.</p>
            <p>1 As first, Poverty is usually the
Daughter of Pride; its a common
saying, that Pride goes before a fall,
that Pride brings men to a morsel of
bread, is the Usher and Beedle to
beggery and misery. Thus God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times suffers mens tables to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
their suares, when their hearts
wax fat that they forget him, then
he suffers their spirits to be elated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
measure, to swell with Pride
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:37537:24"/>
(like the Toad in the Fable) into a
bigness or grandure disproportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the model of their Fortunes,
till they burst the Nerves of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
and at length expire in begge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and misery.</p>
            <p>2 But secondly, Poverty is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the daughter of vanity, which
betrays it self sometimes in costly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel,
sometimes in sumptuous build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
some wear all their estates on
their backs, and may say with the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher,
though in a far worse sense,
<hi>Omnia mea mecum porto;</hi> It is the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of some, that the non-reviving
the ancient wholesome Statutes of
this Land, for moderating the excess
of apparel, is a great cause of that
poverty and penury that hath crept
into many Gentlemens Families, and
brought their posterity to want and
beggery.</p>
            <p>Others bury their Estates under
the walls of stately Fabricks, under
the foundations of sumptuous Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
The <hi>Italians</hi> count nothing a
greater curse, then a profuse humor
of building; and therefore impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
it to their greatest enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:37537:24"/>
Now is it not just for God to
stain the pride of such as are given to
these vanities, that are more studious
of erecting for themselves stately hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and beautiful structures, then
to do any thing for God; that more
willingly lay out their estates on walls
and buildings, than the living stones
of Gods Church; Is it not just he
should bring confusion on the estates
of such, for the pride and vanity of
their Babel structures? that he should
humble them, and cause them to sit
in the dust, that would build their
nests in heaven; that the towring
pride, and foolish imaginations of
such as would hide their heads a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Clouds, and fix their names
among the Stars, should bring ruine
to their estates, and bury their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
under dirt and rubbish. Thus
through the just Judgement of God,
doth pride and vanity not un-often
trip up the heels (as I may so say) of
many mens fortunes, and cast them
into penury and misery, whose fond
ambition flatter'd them they should
make their nests on high, and not be
moved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:37537:25"/>
3 Poverty is sometimes the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of oppression, covetousness and
idleness are said to be the root of
all evil; when men wax covetous, and
fall to grinding the face of the poor,
and to prey upon their neighbour,
when they shut up the bowels of their
mercy from the necessities of their
poor brother, and stop the ears of
their charity to the clamorous cryes
and importunities of those that are
in want, then God often blows upon
their estates, and blasts their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
sends the moth and canker in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their wealth, causes the rust to
prey upon their gold, and devoure
their silver, causing their wealth to
moulder, and their treasure turn to
dust.</p>
            <p>Its reported of the Eagles Feathers,
that being put among those of other
Fowls, whether by heat, or what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
occult quality, they prey and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure
the rest, causing them to moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and consume to dust. The same
truly may be said of wealth gotten by
oppression and extortion, by any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
or indirect means; it is like the
Eagles Feathers, or rather <hi>Pharoahs</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:37537:25"/>
lean Kine, that will eat and devoure
all their fat and plentiful Revenues,
by drawing down the Curse of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
on their wealth and substance.</p>
            <p>4 Poverty is often the Daughter of
Luxury, some bury their Patrimonies
in their bellies, drink down whole
Farms, and Lordships, or perhaps
the price of Kingdomes (like that
voluptuous Queen of <hi>Egypt, Cleopatra</hi>)
at one draught.</p>
            <p>Some drown their estates, together
with all their parts and faculties, in a
deluge of Wine and strong liquor, and
so swim down a torrent of filthy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to the Infernal Lake.</p>
            <p>Others sacrifice their estates in the
fire and flames of lust, at the Altars
of base and filthy concupiscence, till
rottenness enters into their bones,
and their bodies be fill'd with sores
and putrified boils.</p>
            <p>Others suffer themselves (as it is
in the Fable) like <hi>Lycaon,</hi> to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
by their dogs, that is, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a miserable prey to their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and inordinate desires, unra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
the whole clew of their estates
in a pleasing maze, or labyrinth of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:37537:26"/>
pleasure and voluptuousness, until
they have left themselves nothing but
Poverty for an inheritance, and a
stock of misery for their possession, till
they have intail'd penury on their
Families, and bequeath'd a name of
obloquy and ignominy to their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Poverty is the Daughter of
Ease and Idleness; its not enough to
be born to great Revenues, to make
out a good title, or give a just claim
to what the love and providence of
our Ancestors hath bequeath'd unto
us, unless we make them ours by our
industry and diligence, in some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
or honest vocation, we are
to eat our bread in the sweat of our
brows, that's the sawce we ought
mix with all our dishes: God is said
to hate an idle person; for that, as I
said before, idleness is the root and
seeds of all evil.</p>
            <p>Its a good custome of a wicked Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I mean the <hi>Turks,</hi> and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
the imitation of Ghristians, for
every man, to the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> to
make profession of some trade or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
so that their very Palace, or
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:37537:26"/>
               <hi>Seruglio,</hi> is like a <hi>Shop,</hi> or <hi>Exchange.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was a custome among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
for all the Citizens, on some
certain times, to wear the badg of
their trade, or profession, and if any
were found without his badge, or
that could show the Livery of no
trade, he was severely punish'd by
the Censors. If the like custome
were set a foot among us, I wonder
what badge or mark our <hi>Trepans,</hi> rant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Hectors, Kinghts of the Post,</hi> with
many other of that sort of Vermine,
together with other Caterpillers, who
may without a metaphor be term'd
the very Pest and Plague of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth;
I wonder, I say, what
badge they would assume, as the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of their Company and Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Its reported by Naturalists, that
no creature can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap> upon the ayr;
and therefore what the credulity of
Antiquity hath delivered, as a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical
truth, concerning the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melion,</hi>
is now exploded as a vulgar
and fabulous error: But I am sure
many of these live, if not on ayr,
yet by a worse merchandise of Wind,
then that of the <hi>Laplanders,</hi> that are
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:37537:27"/>
reported to befriend Marriners with
Gales tyed up in Napkins; for
whereas these traffick with the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
they put to sale the wind of
their oaths, as if they were no more
then small puffs of ayr, yet such by
which many are, in a trice, blown
out of all their Estates and Fortunes,
into a gulph of poverty and misery;
and these are those <hi>Camelions</hi> that can
cast themselves into all shapes and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
and witness <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>con</hi> to any
business.</p>
            <p>But to balance this custome of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
our modern Ages delight ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to show their Coats of Arms, and
Atchievements, taken out of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds
Office,</hi> than the base badges of
Mechanick Trades, and beggarly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions,
as if nothing would so

Gentleman, as an honest imployment.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, there is the sweat
of the mind, as well as the body;
and to speak truth of all labours, that
of the mind is far the greatest, and
of all travel, that of the Soul is the
sorest under the Sun; and therefore
it is, that <hi>Solomon</hi> so often lets fall such
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:37537:27"/>
expressions as these; <hi>Of writing books
there is no end, and much reading or stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

he sayes, <hi>He that encreases knowledge,
encreaseth sorrow,</hi> and the like; but as
it is the sorest travel, so it is the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest
<hi>difficilia quae pulchra;</hi> the wayes
that lead to Eminence are not strewd
with Roses: Now its fit, that every
one should have his share and portion
of the one or the other, of the sweat
of the body, or the travel of the
mind, for <hi>man is born to labour,</hi> and
travel, <hi>as the sparks fly upward, Iob</hi>
5. 7. And God hath forbidden him
to eat, that will not labour; and
therefore I wonder how such dare
eat, the sweat of whose brows, in
some lawful imployment, hath not
given them a right and title to what
their plentiful Fortunes hath furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
forth unto their tables. Its a lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
custome of some Countryes, to
make their children by some exercise
of either body or mind, to deserve,
and as it were earn their meat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they give it them, whereby
from their very Infancy and Cradles
they are inur'd to labour, and made
familiar with industry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:37537:28"/>
To conclude, no Patrimony, no
Revenues, no Fortunes, are large e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;
the riches of the <hi>Indies,</hi> the
wealth of Kingdomes, nay, the price
of Worlds, would fall short, and
not be able to supply or recruit the
Exchequer of such persons expences,
as have no other imployment their
devise how to spend: which renders
industry no less our interest, than du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
business being no less the food
and entertainment of the mind, than
meat is of the body: And as idleness
is said to be the Devils Pillow, and
therefore none may expect Gods
blessing that sleeps upon it, so I am
confident it is as uneasie, as unsafe and
dangerous.</p>
            <p>Now when men refuse all labour,
and become unprofitable burdens to
the earth; when men live to eat, when
as they should only eat to live; when
men think they are born wholly for
themselves, to eat, and drink, and
rise up to play; is it not just with God
to blast their Estates, and to send the
Gout, the Dropsie, or the judgement
of some more sore disease upon the
bodies of these <hi>Pigri ventri,</hi> these slow
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:37537:28"/>
bellies, that are good for nothing
but to feed and pamper a rotten car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kass,
that must after a while be a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet
for worms, that are good for
nothing, but like vermine, to devoure
the fruits of the earth, that live, as if
they had their Souls given them (as
its commonly said of Swines) only
as salt to keep the flesh of their bodies
from putrifying and stinking.</p>
            <p>To conclude this particular, I am
perswaded if greater entertainment
and incouragement were given to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
and diligence, it might prove
the most effectual means to croud out
that penury and poverty that hath so
long dwelt amongst us, of which we
need not look far for a President, so
long as <hi>Holland</hi> is so nigh a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
whose small spot of earth, did
it not lye so low, and in the midst of
waters, I should liken to a <hi>Mole-Hill,</hi>
the Inhabitants being those <hi>Pismires,</hi>
from whom all the world might take
lessons of industry and diligence.</p>
            <p>Now upon the account of all these
reasons, from whence this poverty of
necessity usually springs, I am induc'd
to believe this is not the poverty here
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:37537:29"/>
meant but that this is rather a Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
than a Blessing of God; for were
this the poverty that gave men title to
the Kingdome of Heaven, none could
make a better claim, or produce fairer
evidence, then a Prodigal Son that
hath wasted and spent his Estate on
Whores and Parasites, or some Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
person, that hath split his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
and ship-wrack'd his Estate by
ill husbandry, gaming, or the like;
no, Whoremongers, Adulterers, and
dissolute persons, must not enter into
the Kingdome of Heaven: We ought
to be diligent and faithful Stewards,
even of these talents, for of these also
must we give an account; if therefore
God hath trusted any one with a fair
estate, a large and plentiful Fortune,
let him not think to spend it upon his
lusts, but so demean himself in his
Stewardship, that he may give a good
account in the day of his Audit, that
so he may reap comfort, &amp; not shame,
when the Harvest of the World shall
approach: Moreover, our English
Proverb saith, <hi>That God never sends
mouths, but he also sends meat;</hi> and
that no man is so unfortunate, but at
one time or other hath been courted
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:37537:29"/>
by an opportunity of growing rich,
at least in a competency: God feeds
the very crows and Ravens, and
cloaths the very grass and Lillies of
the fields in so rich Liveries, that they
may vye with <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his glory,
and make the purple of our bravest
Princes blush, to see their gallantry
so much out-stript by the native
beauty of so contemptible a creature;
and shall we think that God, who is
thus bountiful to the Lillies of the
field, will deny his own people food
and rayment? But I would not have
this interpreted, to lock up the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
of compassion, and bar the door
of our charity against such poor
wretches that daily cry in our streets;
for though I think their poverty is
commonly a Judgement of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them for some of the fore-cited
sins, yet this excuses not our charity
and compassion; for since we are all
sinners, as Christ said of the woman
taken in Adultery, who shall presume
to fling the first stone at them? should
we not rather imitate the goodness of
God, that causes his Sun to shine,
and his Rain fall upon the wicked,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:37537:30"/>
as well as the righteous. Our English
Proverb saith, <hi>The Crows must live;</hi>
shall not then our poor Brother? And
the Scripture saith, <hi>A righteous man is
merciful to his Beast,</hi> then much more
to those that are flesh of his flesh, and
bone of his bone. I am perswaded,
when the sins of this Nation shall
come to be audited, and enquir'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
our neglect of, and uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
to the poor, will make a
great part of the Indictment against
us. We have been so long disputing
about forms of Government in the
State, and of Divine Worship in the
Church, that the noyse of our jang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
about these things hath quite
drown'd the cryes of the poor, whose
necessities should have been first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd,
had we commenc'd our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
a right: and till this error
be rectified, I know little ground we
have to expecta settlement, or that
God will in the least own and bless
our Government, whatever we may
set up and establish.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, though it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
thus, that mens poverty and
misery is &amp; proceeds from themselves,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:37537:30"/>
as being the Product of either pride,
ease, or luxury, as hath been largely
demonstrated; yet sometimes through
the rapine and oppression of the
wicked, the righteous are stript of
all their enjoyments, turned out of
their possessions, and exposed as
Pentioners to the cold charity of the
world: It is sometimes known, as in
the Parable, that a poor and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Lazarus,</hi> whose Soul shall have a
Legion of Angels, as his Convoy, or
Life-guard, to carry him into <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
Bosom, begs an alms at <hi>Dives</hi>
Gates, at the hands of a rich and
wicked Miser, and hath his sores
lick'd by dogs; and therefore, though
we ought to do good to all, <hi>yet more
especially to those of the boushold of F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ith,</hi>
if any such objects of our charity are
known unto us.</p>
            <p>And although God can and often
doth interrupt the course of Nature,
and work Miracles for supplying the
necessities of his Saints; though God
sometime fed <hi>Eliah</hi> by the Ministry of
Ravens, and can cloath his Prophets
as he doth the Lillies of the Field,
yet that is no excuse, no Apology, for
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:37537:31"/>
our with-holding any thing from
them they stand in need of, or that
their necessities call for at our hands,
though we have never so little,
though our estate be but as the Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
Cruse of Oyl, God requires
our mite, if we can do no more, we
must cast it in, if we expect to find
that acceptance with God the Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
did, or desire that blessing of
encrease on our estates, as fell on the
Cruse of Oyl, whereby the Prophet
was fed in a time of famine.</p>
            <p>2 But secondly, by poverty of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
is not here meant (as the <hi>Papists</hi>
would have it) a voluntary poverty,
or of vow, as when men for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
sake, or Righteousness sake, as
they are pleas'd to guild it, do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the world, and strip them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of all their outward enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
when men cast their whole
estates into the treasury of the
Church, and intail their Revenues
on the Altar, when for the better
disburthening themselves of the cares
of this life, and of this world, and
that they may the better sequester
themselves unto the Lord, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:37537:31"/>
themselves unto his service, they
part with all for the Cross of Christ,
and wholly cast themselves upon the
Providence of God.</p>
            <p>Truly the taking root of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
hath brought forth much fruit,
much profit to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
many of whose voluntary Votaries,
that under a pretence of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
devotion, and Holiness, seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
themselves from the world, do
but renounce those smaller Fortunes
Providence hath given them better ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to, in expectation of, and on de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to inherit far greater riches, and
reap a more plentiful crop of gain
from that blind charity, Superstition
hath cheated the greater part of the
World into an opinion of; and of
these there are several Forms and
Classes in the Man of Sins School, as
your <hi>Hermites, Fryer Mendicants,</hi> with
divers others, who instead of account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(with the Apostle) <hi>godliness great
gain,</hi> do reap great gains from a
counterfeit and feigned godliness:
These therefore are not the
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, on which the Kingdome of
Heaven is intail'd, but rather swarms
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:37537:32"/>
of Locusts and Caterpillers, that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the face of too great a part of the
earth.</p>
            <p>But this Opinion of Poverty (as I
said) hath been a rich Revenue to
the Popish Church, and wonderfully
improv'd the Patrimony of St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
hath much encreas'd the Revenue of
the Man of Sin, and intail'd much
Land upon his Altars; this is a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
devise to sell the Kingdome of
Heaven to those will bid most for it;
and the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Cardinal</hi> may well
confer notes, as sometime on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
occasion, <hi>Quantum nobis Lucri
peperit haec fabula de Christo:</hi> So, <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
nobis Lucri peperit haec fabula seu Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrina
de paupertate:</hi> What gain hath
this fable of poverty brought into
us: This is that hath so much in rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Coffers of the <hi>Pope,</hi> that hath
fill'd the fat bellies of the Priests,
and cloath'd the Whore in Scarlet:
Truly, I cannot but commend the
zeal and devotion of all such poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
souls, as out of a principle of
Sincerity, strip themselves of these
outward enjoyments, thinking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to render themselves more quick
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:37537:32"/>
and less cumbersome in their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
towards Heaven; but I cannot
but therewithal pity their ignorance,
and great pity it is so great a heat of
zeal should be without the light of
Knowledge to direct it, that so great
Devotion should be the Daughter of
Ignorance and Superstition.</p>
            <p>No, this is not the poverty of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
recommended to us by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our;
and therefore to the Proselites
of this Opinion, we may say what
is commonly said of self-Murther, it
is not lawful to quit our stations, for
our souls to break the prison of the
Body, to anticipate our deliverance
from the captivity of our flesh, by a
voluntary or violent dissolution: We
may with the Apostle sue out our <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beas
Corpus,</hi> by sending up our sighs
and desires to be dissolved, but to
break prison is Felony; we may say,
<hi>Demittas <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> but we must expect
till God sends the Serjeant Death to
bring us our Writ of Ease, our <hi>bene
decessit,</hi> and to knock off the Fetters
of our body: for our life is a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
and we are here Militant in a
Vale of Tears; and therefore may not
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:37537:33"/>
desert our Colours, till we are <hi>rude
donati,</hi> and <hi>Milites Emeriti,</hi> till we
have finish'd our warfare, and are
legally dismiss'd the Camp: Our
Souls are plac'd as Centinels in the
Body, and may not go off the guard
till they are reliev'd, or the Captain
of our Salvation calls them off.</p>
            <p>So may I say in this case, our wealth
is not our own, but the Lords, and
therefore it is not lawful for us to
quit, or resign our trusts, before the
day of our Audit; for we are Gods
Stewards, and he will require an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
at our hands; our estates are
the Lords, and we must be faithful
in our office, and distribute of our
bread to the poor.</p>
            <p>Christianity does not forfeit our right
to the creatures, but rather inlarge &amp;
strengthen it: It hath been the custom
in some places, when any <hi>Iew</hi> turns
<hi>Christian,</hi> to forfeit or s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ester his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state;
but this is no condition of the
Gospel, this is not a Law that hath any
force or obligation in <hi>foro conscientiae,</hi> in
the court of conscience for our right,
as I said, to the things of this world,
is rather commenc'd, than extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:37537:33"/>
by our adoption and new-birth;
for whose is the earth, and
the fulness thereof, but the Lords?
and who then have better right unto
it then the Sons of God? Or who
may more truly be call'd the Lords
and Princes of the Creation, then
they for whom the world was made,
and yet is not worthy of them?
though I must confess it is most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
seen here, that servants ride
on horseback, and the Princes go on
foot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, This poverty is not any
low and base abjectness of spirit, no
sordidness or despondency of mind;
to be poor in spirit, is not to have
little, poor, narrow, and contracted
souls, to have creeping and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
spirits, that are alwayes grovel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in the dust, that according to the
curse of the Serpent, creep on their
bellies, and lick the dust of the earth,
that are meer muck, or dung-hill
worms, that have their heads and
hearts bow'd down to the earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Os homini sublime dedit,</hi> saith the
Poet. This therefore is unworthy,
and below the generosity of a man,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:37537:34"/>
much more a Christian. Religion
doth not make men fools &amp; sheepish,
but admirably blends the innocency
of the Dove, together with the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and prudence of the Serpent:
Religion is not that that clouds the
mind with black melancholick and sad
apprehensions; if any think thus,
they seem guilty of the same absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with those Heathen, that Deified
their diseases, and erected Altars un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Feavours; or admit the like abuse
that <hi>Mahomets</hi> Disciples did, when
they believ'd their Prophets Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
to be Extasies, and Divine Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
this is to intitle our melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Religion, and guild ore the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers
and infirmities of Nature
with the title of Grace; which is
something like the humour of the
<hi>Negroes,</hi> who paint their gods black,
and the Devil white; whereas Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is so far from being any morose,
sower, or tettrick thing, that what
the Philosopher said of virtue, may
with advantage be affirm'd of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>viz.</hi> that could it assume Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reity,
or render it self visible, it
would appear so lovely, so amiable,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:37537:34"/>
that it would at once both enamour
and ravish the Whole world into the
admiration of her Features, and by
the sole attractives of her transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Beauty, and the powerful
Charms of its comely Graces, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
and captivate the hearts of all
men, and command both homage
and affection from all that should
behold her; she would then need no
other Eloquence than the silent Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
of her own beauty to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
her, and invite the whole
world unto her imbraces. For is good
nature a lovely thing? there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more improves, and meliorates
mens natures, than the ingrafting
Religion therein: there's nothing
more inlarges the spirit, and gives
it a more just and Noble Elevation,
then that: there's nothing fills the
mind with a more Noble, with a
more generous scorn and contempt of
low, base, and abject things than
that; that's it that raises a mans
thoughts from the earth, on which
they are naturally so apt to grovel
and be bowed down unto, that's it
that spirits and enobles a Soul, that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:37537:35"/>
emancipates it from base slavish, and
pusillanimous fears, and fills it
with a high and Princely ambition,
and ambition more Noble and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
then that of <hi>Alexanders,</hi> that so
inlarges the heart, that not only one
earth, but the whole world is too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
for it, is not able to fill or satisfie
it; this is that refines the affections,
and causes them to fly a higher pitch,
than to be decoy'd by any thing here
below, than to stoop to any thing on
this side immortality and life, that
causes the Soul to soare aloft and
mount up, as with Eagles wings, till
it makes its nest in the very bosom of
God. They therefore disparage Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and cast a blot and scandal on
the Profession of the Gospel, who go
all the day drooping and holding
down their Heads like a bulrush, there
being none who have so much reason
to be cheerful, to have a merry heart
and a cheerful countenance as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
There is no reason why any
ones face should shine so much as
theirs who like <hi>Moses</hi> have seen God
in the Mount.</p>
            <p>4 We are therefore by this pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:37537:35"/>
of spirit to understand something
beyond anything that hath been yet
mentioned; And without doubt its
to be taken in a like sense, as that
place where Christ saith, <hi>its harder
for a Camel,</hi> or Cable rope, as some
interpret it, (for the same word in
the Original signifies both) <hi>to passe
thorow the eye of a needle, then for a rich
man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi>
Now we shall be best able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
what is meant by these Riches
that bar our entrance into blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and this Poverty on which it
is intail'd, by comparing these with
other places, one Scripture being the
best Key to unlock the sence of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Our Saviour saith, <hi>Matt.</hi> 9. 13.
<hi>That he came not to call the Righteous but
sinners to Repentance,</hi> and in another
place, <hi>the whole need not the Physitian
but those that are sick:</hi> So likewise
where he saith <hi>He came to seek the lost
sheep of the house of Israel:</hi> So likewise
that Parable of the Pharisee that
made so nigh and familiar approach
to the Altar, and blessed God he was
not as the Publicane that stood aloof,
afar off, and cried <hi>Lord be merciful to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:37537:36"/>
me a sinner,</hi> and yet according to the
virdict of Truth it self, went away
more justified than the Pharisee that
was so pure and righteous in his own
eyes. I say this Parable may lend
some light to the understanding of it.
Also when our Saviour took a little
Child, and setting him in the midst
of his Disciples, said <hi>unlesse ye be as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
children ye cannot enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
Heaven:</hi> he seems to have given
a clear Comment on this Text: Also
when he said <hi>Suffer little children to
come unto me, for of such is the Kingdom
of Heaven;</hi> he seems to Paraphrase on
the same Doctrine: From all which
put together, I think we may safely
collect and spell out this or the like
sence from the words, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That poverty of spirit is a being
little, mean, vile and contemptible
in our own eyes, to become as little
children, without strength and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
courage, helplesse and shiftlesse,
without counsel and without advice,
having neither wisdom, prudence,
discretion, nor understanding in
our selves; they therefore are the
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> the poor in spirit that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:37537:36"/>
are arrived at this resigned state or
condition, that have parted with
their own strength, their own wisdom,
their own Councils, and their own
Righteousnesse too, and are become
sensible of their own baseness, their
own unworthinesse, their own no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingness,
that see and acknowledge
the sinfulnesse of their natures, the
miserablenesse of their conditions,
how that they have no righteousnesse
of their own, no holiness, no purity,
no Sanctity of their own, these I
take to be the poor in Spirit here
meant.</p>
            <p>Having thus discoursed on the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the Proposition, we are by the
course of our method arrived at the
predicate, <hi>viz. Blessed;</hi> The word in

so we have finished the proposition,
and shall now hasten to the ground or

in the book of Life, that your
names are enrolled and registred in
the Archives of Heaven. Now from
the words thus anatomized and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowelled,
there seem naturally to
spring these propositions.</p>
            <p>1 That Poverty of Spirit is a roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
and blessed state or condition, or
in the <hi>concrete,</hi> that the poor in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
are blessed.</p>
            <p>2 That the ground or reason of
all true happinesse or blessednesse is
founded in an interest in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of heaven, or that they onely
may be truly and without <hi>Ironie</hi>
termed happy, or accounted the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
proprietors of all felicity, whose is
the Kingdom of heaven, on whom
heaven and happinesse is intail'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:37537:37"/>
1 Poverty of spirit is a blessed state
and happy condition. I should rather
darken than illustrate the meridian
brightnesse of this Truth, that is wrot
as with a sun-beam; should I bring a
cloud of witnesses for its confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it needing no other proof than
the Authority of him that spake it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
proceeded from the lips of him
that is Truth it self, that cannot lye.
But that no truth, though of never so
great evidence, might be without wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
the whole scope and tenour of
the Gospel seems to bear its testimony,
and give in evidence to the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hereof; How frequent is it said in
<hi>Proverbs,</hi> besides other places, <hi>That pride
is an abomination to the Lord;</hi> is not this
the language and dialect of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
throughout that <hi>the Lord will dwel
with an humble and contrite heart that
trembleth at his Word,</hi> but that he <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
and resisteth the proud?</hi> Doth not
almost every page and Chapter tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout
the whole Book of God speak
in the same Key? Doth not God all
along turn the edge of his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
against high things, and high
thoughts, against proud and towring
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:37537:38"/>
imaginations that exalt and lift up
themselves, hath he not denounced
enmity against proud and high things?
hath he not threatened to level and
bring down every high Hill, till he
make it become a plain? Is not the
quarrel of the Almighty with the
great things of the Earth? And hath
he not on the other side pawned his
Word and ingaged his promise to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt
the humble, to give grace to the
humble, to lift up every valley, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hath he not invited all those that
hunger and thrust, all those that are
weary and heavy leaden, promising
that he will feed them, that he will
satisfie them, that he will ease them,
that they shall finde rest unto their
souls? What are all these expressions
but as so many proofs and confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of this Proposition; it were end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
to quote and cite places, and
therefore shall hasten to the Reasons,
whereof.</p>
            <p>1. The first is borrowed from a
rule among Physitians, with whom it
is received as a Maxim, that <hi>primus
gradus sumitatis est nosse morbum,</hi> the first
degree of health is to know the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:37537:38"/>
for as our Proverb hath it, a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
that is known, is half cured. Now
this poverty of Spirit, is a reflex act
of the Soule, discovering to men their
wants, that they may go to Christ
to be supplied of his fulnesse, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
of his fulnesse; Grace for Grace:
It discovers to men their own naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that they may go to Christ to
be clothed with the white robes of his
Righteousnesse, till <hi>Adams</hi> eyes were
opened, that he saw his nakednesse
and his sin; He had no shame nor
sence of his guilt, but so soon as his
eyes were opened, he began to sow
fig leaves together, to cover his sin
and hide his shame. This is the usual
Method and progresse of God in the
work of conversion; first to alarm
and awaken the Soul by a clap
of Thunder, so to rouse him from
the Lethergie and sleep of sin, to
prick them to the quick, and make
them cry out like the Jaylor in the
<hi>Acts,</hi> men and brethren what shall
we do to be saved; This causes the
scales to fall from off their eyes, those
scales of Ignorance with which their
eyes were seal'd, and then they see
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:37537:39"/>
their sin and their shame, and begin
to loath and abhor themselves, to
cloath themselves with sackcloth and
ashes, and sit down in the dust: Now
when a soul hath thus seen its naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
it begins to think of a covering,
of a mantle, or a cloak to hide its sin,
and begins first to sow together the
Fig leaves of its own Righteousnesse,
of its own performances, and so long
as it thinks they will serve its turn, it
looks no further, till at length a flash
of lightening comes and smutes all
their righteousnesse, blacks all their
beauty, scorches their leaves, and
burns up all their Hay and Stuble, and
discovers a new light unto them, that
make they the borders of their own
righteousnesse never so broad, and let
them with the <hi>Pharisees</hi> inlarge their
<hi>Phylacteries</hi> never so wide, yet they
shall finde the skirts thereof too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
too shallow to cover them; then
they begin to be out of conceit with
themselves, to fall in disesteem and
disreputation with themselves, then
they begin to let fall those plumes
and specious train that before they so
much pleased and prided themselves
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:37537:39"/>
in. And indeed men will never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to put on the Lord jesus, till they
have thus seen their own poverty, that
their own righteousnesse is but as dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and menstruous rags; till they are
thus come acquainted with their own
wants, how empty their own exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
is, how low their own treasures
run, they will never desire to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
out of those treasures of Grace,
God hath laid up in Christ for poor
sinners; till men look up and discern
the sword of vengeance hanging by a
small hair over their heads ready to
drop upon them, they'l not be sencible
of the desperate peril and danger of
their naturall state and condition: till
they see the filthinesse, pollution and
corruption of their Natures, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie
of sin that cleaves to them,
they'l never desire the Angel may
move the waters, or go unto the pool
of <hi>Bethesda</hi> to the fountaine of Christs
blood, to wash and bathe their souls
in <hi>Iordan:</hi> till they finde and feel their
souls stung by the fiery Serpents of sin,
till they feel the sting of the guilt of
sin stick in their souls and conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
they'l never by the eye of Faith
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:37537:40"/>
look up to the brazen Serpent, Christ
Jesus that was lifted up upon the
Crosse, that they may receive health
and healing to their souls. Till they
are sencible of those breaches and
ruines, the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> hath made
in their natures, till they are sencible
of those wounds and bruises, those
mortall wounds sin hath given them,
they will never go to the Physitian of
souls for cure, to have the balm of
<hi>Gilead</hi> applyed to their wounds, to
have oyl and wine poured into them.
Till they are sencible of that issue of
blood that is upon them, and have in
vain spent all their substance on other
Physitians and fruitless remedies,
they will not presse after Christ to
touch the hem of his Garment, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
vertue and healing from Him.
Till they are sencible of the misery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which they are fallen, and the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverablenesse
of their estate, they
will never beg the putting forth of the
hand of Gods mercy, and the arm
of his Almighty Power for their rescue
and deliverance.</p>
            <p>Till men are sensible of their blood-guiltiness,
they'l never fly to the City
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:37537:40"/>
of Refuge, to avoid the pursuit of
Gods Vengeance, the pursuit of the
Avenger of Blood: Till they are sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of their own vileness, they'l
not fly to the Ark of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
to be preserv'd from that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
of wrath that is to come upon
the workers of iniquity. Till men are
sensible of their own barrenness, and
unfruitfulness in all the works of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
and righteousness, and that
the Axe of Gods Judgements is laid
to the root of every tree that bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not forth fruits worthy of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and newness of life, and
that it shall be hewn down, and cast
into the flames of Gods Vengeance,
and become the fuel of eternal fire,
the fuel of his Eternal Wrath and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure;
I say, till by the Eye of
Faith they discern and believe this,
they'l never desire to be grafted into
the true Vine, Christ Jesus, that they
may receive sap and influence from
him, and so become fruitful, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
in the works of righteousness:
till we are sensible that we are dead in
trespasses and sins, we shall never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
the quicknings and enlivenings of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:37537:41"/>
Gods Spirit: till we are sensible of, and
groan under the burden and weight
of the guilt of sin, we shall never
desire ease of Christ: till we are sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of that body of death we carry
about with us, of that Law in our
members, rebelling against the Law
of our minds, of that power, domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
rule and tyranny that sin hath
obtained over us, captivating us into
the obedience of the Law of sin and
death, we shall never groan to be
deliver'd into the liberty of the Sons
of God, that we may serve him
without fear, and be able to lead cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
captive.</p>
            <p>For so long as men are of opinion
with the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> that
they think they abound, are rich and
full, they will never acknowledge,
that they are poor, blind, and naked,
and by consequence become Suitors
at the Throne of Grace, that they
may receive Crowns and Thrones of
Glory.</p>
            <p>To conclude this particular, so long
as men have any reeds of their own
righteousness to lean unto, though
but broken reeds, and such as will
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:37537:41"/>
rather wound and pierce their sides,
than yeeld any strength or support
unto them; they'l never build their
Faith on the Rock of Ages, Christ
Jesus. So long as they can fit and
please themselves under the gourds of
their own righteousness, under the
shadows of their own performances,
so long as they have any thing to
skreen them from the heat, and
scorchings of an inkindled consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
I say, till the Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
be arisen, and hath scorched
their Gourds, and burnt up all their
pleasant Bowers, they will very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be perswaded to take shelter under
the Cross of Jesus. And therefore
upon this account, poverty of spirit
is a blessed and happy condition, for
that it is an awakened state, and gives
men a true prospect and discovery of
their estate and condition, for that
it brings them acquainted with their
wants, with what they stand in need
of.</p>
            <p>2 Poverty of spirit is a fruitful state,
your low and humble valleys are
crowned with the greatest plenty, are
most rich and fruitful; the lowest
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:37537:42"/>
trees, and meanest shrubs have their
boughs laded with the greatest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
as appears in the Vine, and
other trees; whereas high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
tall trees, and stately Cedars
are commonly steril and barren, and
their great bulk but a burden to the
earth: No man plants a Vineyard on
the top of an hill, they are the low
and humble souls in which God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
in whose hearts he plants his
fear, and ingrafts the Graces of his
Holy Spirit, on whom he causes the
influences and Dews of Heaven to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend,
and bestows the Watrings and
Sanctifications of his Spirit: These
are those blessed Souls that the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist</hi>
resembles to Trees planted in
the Garden of God by the rivers of
water, which bring forth their fruits
in season, and whose leaves shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
wither, never fade, shall know no
Autumn, no Winter, but alwayes
thrive and prosper; God hath chosen
the mean, the weak, and base things
of this world, to confound the wise
and mighty, that so no flesh might
glory in his presence; that the wise
man may not glory in his wisdome,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:37537:42"/>
least it be turned into folly, nor the
strong man in his strength, least it be
turned into weaknesse, nor the rich
man in his riches, least they be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into poverty and penury, but
that who so glories may Glory in the
Lord.</p>
            <p>And this is that makes the Gospel
such a Riddle, such a Mysterie to the
World, that God raises a Worm, the
Worm <hi>Iacob</hi> to thresh the Mountains,
a little <hi>David,</hi> a small young Strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to discomfit a great <hi>Goliah, Goli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>
the Champion of the <hi>Philistims;</hi> a
small Rod to cleave in sunder a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Rock, as sometimes <hi>Moses</hi> did in
the Wildernesse: to smite an Host of
<hi>Philistims</hi> with the jaw bone of an Ass:
to cause the proud and stately Walls
of <hi>Iericho</hi> to tremble and shake for
fear, and at length drop down to
Rubbish at the blast of a few Rams<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horns.
Now if you ask the reason
of this, why God hath chosen such
weak contemptible means, such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicable
and despised instruments to
accomplish and bring about the great
designs and purposes of his will, the
grand Councils of his Mind? It is
his jealousie of his honour, that none
may rob him of his Glory, that all
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:37537:43"/>
may acknowledge as sometimes the
Magicians of <hi>Pharaoh, hic est digitus
Dei,</hi> this was the finger, this was the
Hand of God; For by how much less
of the Wisdom, Power and Policy of
man appears, by so much the more is
God manifested.</p>
            <p>3. A third Reason why poverty of
spirit is so blessed a condition, may
be this, For that it is a sure estate; for
according to that of the Poet, <hi>cui ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet
in terram non habet unde cadat,</hi> your
highest Towers and tallest Cedars, are
most often smote with lightning, are
most exposed to the Injuries and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clemencies
of weather, to the rage
and fury of Storms and Tempests;
We have often known a great and
mighty Oak torn in pieces by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
of a storm, and made a trophy
of the Winds fury, when as lessertrees
and smaller shrubs have Surviv'd the
Tempest and remained untouch'd.</p>
            <p>Hills are precipices, and high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
slippery and dangerous, on
high places our heads are apt to wax
giddy; When Satan tempted our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
he took him, and set him on a
Pinacle of the Temple.</p>
            <p>High places are full of temptations,
they command too far a prospect of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:37537:43"/>
this Worlds glory, of the glory of
this Creation, thus when the spirit of
a man is elated and raised, he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to more danger, to more temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
than the humble soul.</p>
            <p>Many other Reasons might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
as that axiom in Philosophy,
which holds true also in Divinity, that
privation praeceeds habits, emptiness
preceds fulnesse; Its a common say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That the way to heaven lies by
the Gates of Hell, and therefore this
poverty is but as it were the taking of
our Fees in order to preferment, to
the end we may take the higher, the
farther leap, we must be emptied of
our selves, that is, of all vain and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
conceit of our selves, before we can
be fil'd with the graces of Gods Spirit.</p>
            <p>It is the Devils policy to blow, and
puff us up like bladers with the Wind
of pride and self-conceit, that we may
not be capable of receiving the new
wine of the spirit; Now these bladers
of pride must be prick'd, this swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
wind of conceit, this ventosity
must be let out: &amp; therefore it is, Christ
calls so often to us, to sell all, to part
with all, if we will become wise Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceants,
and traffique for eternal life;
if we will purchase that Pearl of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:37537:44"/>
price, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> that inestimable Pearl
mentioued in the Gospel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 6.
We must part with all and follow
Christ if we will have him, or render
our selves worthy of him; This made
the young man in the Gospel depart
sorrowful, full of sorrow, he had a
good mind to Christ, but was very
rich, had much wealth, was full of
substance, and had kept the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
from his youth upwards.
This is that makes it so difficult for
a rich man to be saved: Oh how dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
a thing it is to stand still and see
the Salvation of God, as the <hi>Israelites</hi>
were commanded at the red Sea, and
as all Christians are now, that will
pass through the red Sea of Christs
Blood; this is that makes it easier for
Publicans and sinners to enter into
the Kingdom of Heaven, then the
<hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> that are cumbred
with a great deal of Righteousnesse of
their own, with a multitude of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
duties and performances; What
must they part with all, cast all over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board,
make shipwrack of their Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
too? This is a hard Chapter,
<hi>durus sermo,</hi> a hard saying, who can
bear it? but I would ask such souls whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:37537:44"/>
they think it a fitting thing that
they should enter into the Kings feast,
to the Marriage of his Son, in the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
menstruous raggs of their own
Righteousnesse, and without the
wedding Garment; Would it not be
construed an affront, would they not
be thought to disgrace, reproach and
defile the Marriage, by so rude, so
uncivil an Action? Would you sit
down with Princes, being cloathed
with nothing but durt and raggs, and
yet be so morose as not to accept of a
Robe out of the Kings Wardrope,
since it is his Royal pleasure, to put so
great an honour on you? Would you
be Courtiers to the King of Heaven,
and refuse to wear his Livery; Let's
remember the end of him in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
the Catastrophe of his presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that intruded into the Nupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
without a wedding Garment.</p>
            <p>Moreover the way to Heaven is a
narrow way, and the Gate that leads
to Eternal Life is a strait passage; we
must not thinktherefore to carry our
Lumber with us, that will but clog
and retard our speed, that will but
cumber and trouble us, and render
our passage more difficult and unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:37537:45"/>
It was a fond and ridiculous cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,
ignorance and serperstition had
introduced among some of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
That when any person of
High rank or great quality amongst
them dyed, to sacrifice many of his
Servants, and great store of Cattel,
to the end they might wait and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
on him in the other world; But
I presume we who have the Light of
Christianity are better inform'd,
then to expect to carry a crowd with
us, or togo in pomp &amp; state with a train
at our heels; and therefore what
seoffing <hi>Lucian</hi> hath said merrily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Charons</hi> Boat, how the passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
were prohibited to bring any
thing in with them, &amp; commanded to
strip themselves stark naked, and leave
all on the other side the bank, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their riches, Honours, Wisdom,
Phylosophie or the like, may be seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
said to those that would enter
into the ark of the new Covenant,
they must carry nothing with them,
if they would have a safe and a quick
passage, a prosperous voyage to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
if they would shoot the Gulph &amp;
arrive safe in the other World, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:37537:45"/>
what Christ said to the Apostles,
when he sent them forth to preach the
Gospel throughout the whole World,
when he made them Catholick and
Universal Bishops of the Earth, to
Preach and Teach all Nations, they
were to take no money in their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
they might take no wealth with
them, not so much as to be cumbred
with two Coats; So may we say to all
those that would go unto Christ, that
would Learn the way to Sion; we need
not meet God as <hi>Iacob</hi> went to meet
his iucensed Brother <hi>Esau,</hi> after he
had supplanted and beguiled him of
the blessing; with great heards and
flocks of Cattel before us, to be our
peace offerings, the price of our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement,
and to appease his wrath,
for that is pacified already, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
found out himself a Sacrifice,
we must not therefore go unto God
with gifts, with Sumpter Horses
of rich and costly presents, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to gratifie him for the redemption
of our Captivity, for he wil say as
sometime <hi>Abraham</hi> said to the Kings
he had delivered when he rescu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Brother Lot, it shall not be
said you have made <hi>Abraham</hi> rich; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lack,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:37537:46"/>
what can we give unto God,
are not the Cattel on a Thousand
Hills the Lords? Is not the Earth and
the fulnesse thereof his, what shall we
then do? Shall we marshal up our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances
and Duties, and set them
in order to commend us to God, to
procure admission &amp; acceptance with
God. Will he be any better pleased
therewith, then he was with those
Cattel <hi>Saul</hi> reserved for Sacrifice?
Will he not say as <hi>Samuel</hi> did, <hi>What
means the bleatings of these Cattel?</hi> God
takes no Bribes, no, we may not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
so much as a <hi>Peter</hi> pence in our
Mouths (as is the absurde practice of
some Papists) for Heavens Porter,
for <hi>Peter</hi> to open the door to us.
No, there are none that take bribes
in Heaven, there are no Courtiers
that expect Fees, no Orators that
have <hi>manus occulatas,</hi> or <hi>bovem in lingua</hi>
as we say. And therefore hence
it is, that we are invited to buy Wine,
and Milk, and Honey without Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and without price; they that
would drink of the Waters of Life,
must not think to purchase them, for
they are no more to be sold then
that gift of the Holy Ghost. We
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:37537:46"/>
know what was replyed to <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi>
that would needs have bought
it, that would needs be cheapning
and bidding money for it, <hi>thy money
perish with thee.</hi> This is the highest, the
rankest, the grossest degree of <hi>Simony,</hi>
to think of purchasing Salvation; for
what shall we give the Lord, should
we give our Bodies to be burned for
the sin of our Souls, should we give
our Bodies a Sacrifice, a burnt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it profits nothing, merits no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and God might cast back the
dung thereof into the faces of our
Souls. <hi>The gift is of Gods free grace,</hi>
Did not Christ overturn the Table of
the Money-changers, and whip the
buyers and sellers out of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?
And shall we presume to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them again.</p>
            <p>I have read that the Kingdom of
Heaven is to suffer violence, is to be
taken by force; but never that it
was to be bought and sold. This
was the stone of stumbling at which
the faith of the Pharisees fell; the
Rock of offence on which the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Jews split themselves, and rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
their Salvation; they would
needs lean to the broken reeds of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:37537:47"/>
their own righteousnesse, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
wounded and pierc'd themselves:
they thought to have purchas'd Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
by their Alms, by their fasts, by
their long prayers, by the tythe of
their Mint and Annis. And do not the
Papists at this day run into the same
Errour, dos not their Doctrine of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
of Pardons, of Indulgences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
set up the Tables of the money<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changers
in the Temple of God?
Have they not introduced a Mart or
Fair into Religion, and turn'd the
Temple into a Shop or Exchance, in
which things spiritual are bartered
for Temporal, and things incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
for silver and gold that is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible.

Have they not done by
Heaven, as <hi>Hanibal</hi> is reported to
have sometime done by old <hi>Rome?
viz.</hi> exposed it to sale; but we know
he paid dear for his presumption, it
cost him the losse of his Camp. And
I would advise these to have a care,
that make so bold with Heaven; that
are so rich in works of supererogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that have merits not onely for
themselves, but others; that are so
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:37537:47"/>
rich they can purchase Mansions and
Crowns of Glory, not only for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but others: That are able to
purchase large Patrimonies, and
whole Provinces in Heaven: Nay,
that can sell Heaven, Reversions of
Glory, to purchase vast Territories
here upon earth. No, to entertain
such thoughts as these, so high an
esteem of our own works, our own
merits is no lesse than madnesse and
folly; Or to think that we shall not
be welcom to God, unlesse we bring
our own entertainment with us: no,
they that are invited to the marriage
Supper, to the kings feast must not
bring their entertainment with them.</p>
            <p>They that will be sav'd must suffer
losse, the hay and the stubble of their
own righteousnesse, of their own
works must be destroy'd, consum'd
and burnt up: We must not build
our Faith and expectations of Heaven
upon the old, rotten, crazy, tottering
foundations of our own performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
for this is but sand: If we would
have our foundation stand sure, if
we desire the Pillars of our Salvation
should stand fast and not be moved.</p>
            <p>But the last Reason, and that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:37537:48"/>
which leads us to the other part of
the verse, to the remaining words,
and which are the Reason laid down
in the Text, is this, <hi>for theirs is the
Kingdom of Heaven</hi> Their happiness
doth not consist in their poverty, but
in the Right and Title they have to
the Kingdom, for that they are the
heirs apparent to the Crown of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
for that they are of the blood
Royal of Heaven, the most high born
Seed of God.</p>
            <p>Oh most blessed, most happy, most
fortunate and Royal Poverty, on
which is intayl'd a Kingdom, that
hath the reversion of a Crown and
Scepter. This life is the nonage of
a Saint, we are here under pupillage
and wardship, under Guardians and
Tutors, the first Epistle of <hi>John</hi> 3. 2.
<hi>Now are ye the Sons of God, but it doth
not yet appear what ye shall be.</hi> A Saints
portion is not in this life, his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is not of this world; his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is in reversion. Oh<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> who would
not part with all he hath for a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
Its reported that when <hi>Cesars</hi>
ambition courted the <hi>Romans</hi> monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
and began to bid for the Empire
of the whole Earth, that he left him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:37537:48"/>
nothing but hope. Oh who
would not part with all he hath for a
Kingdom, so he may but retain not a
bare uncertain hope, but the sure
reversion of a Kingdom. What, shall
<hi>Cesar</hi> bid more for the bare naked
hopes of an earthly. Empire, than
Christians for not the hopes, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of a spiritual a Heavenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?
Shall <hi>Cesar</hi> venture more for
a temporal Crown, than Christians
for an eternal weight of Glory? Is
he accounted unworthy of terrestrial
empire, that will not venture his life
for it, &amp; is not he much more unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of a Caelestial Throne, that will
not adventure and part with his all
for it.</p>
            <p>It is reported of a fortunate King,
that he accounted it his sole misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
that he never had misfortune:
and therefore being minded industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to seek and court that which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men endeavour most to shun and
avoid, he cast a Ring of great value
into the Sea: and after a while found
it in the belly of a fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>h, served up to
his table. I am sure it is the greatest
the sadest misfortune of the greater
part of the World, that they have not
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:37537:49"/>
this misfortune, to fall into this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
of spirit. And they that have
it may justly take up the words of
him that said <hi>periissem nisi periissem,</hi> I
had been eternally unfortunate and
miserable, had it not been for this
misfortune. I know this hath been an
age too skilful and ingenious in sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting
one another, in raysing
themselves by the falls of others, in
building their fortunes on the ruins
of other mens: But this is a far more
ingenious thing to be able to supplant
a mans own misfortune, to raise him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by his own fall, to find a crown
in his own ruins; we know <hi>Saul</hi> found
a Kingdom, as he was seeking his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
asses, and this is to find a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in seeking poverty and want,
this is to convert by an excellent kind
of Chymistry poysons into Cordials,
losses into gaines, crosses into crowns,
and the wounds and injuries of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
into blessings and favours: it is
a being (in truth what the Phyloso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
so much talked of) beyond the
reach of fortune, and above the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
of Chance. I believe during the
time of our late unhappy wars ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that were skilfull at fishing in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:37537:49"/>
waters, have with good success
experimented the truth of this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
in the letter.</p>
            <p>How many a poor broken trades man
with others of ship-wrack't and ruin'd
fortunes, who being quite bankrupt
and reduced to the extremity of want
and misery; Have by betaking
themselves to the wars, thriven bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and rais'd themselves to far
greater and fairer fortunes than ever
they could have expected, with out a
miracle in the way of their former
vocations. I am sure its no lesse
true, but more safe in the spirit. For
there was never any poor broken spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that being ship-strack't and bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
in himself, that being lost and
ruined in himself, that being undone
and beggard, that being naked, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
&amp; poor in spirit, betook himself to
this spiritual warfare, &amp; entered into
the Camp of the Saints militant: that
lifted his name under the Captaine
of our Salvation Christ Jesus, and
served under the banner of the Cross,
but he was a gainer by it, but he
thrive better, &amp; rais'd his fortunes to
a higher pitch, than if he had grasp'd
the Scepters, and possest the Empires
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:37537:50"/>
of the whole Earth, so thriving a
thing is this poverty, so great
the advantages that are to be
reap'd by it, so great the honour
and dignities to which it leads. For
to speak truth they are our riches that
ruin and undo us, what we account
our riches is our poverty, and our
cloathing is our shame, of which till
we are strip'd its impossible for us to
be either fortunate or truly happy.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, how much have
many done &amp; suffered upon the single
account of gratifying their ambition?
with the expence of how much sweat
and travail, at the losse of how many
nights sleep and repose, at the cost
of how many cares and sorrows, are
men content to purchase a small Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
a little province of rule and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion?
Whereas it were but a poor,
low and groveling ambition, did they
with <hi>Ceser</hi> grasp at the whole Earth,
or with <hi>Alexander</hi> mourn, for that
there is but one? For what is it that
we should either with the one prize
it so much, or with the other grieve
there are no more? Is it any other
than a mole hill, or any better than
the dreges and sidency of the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:37537:50"/>
or is it not infinitely below the
worth &amp; dignity of the least celestial
body of the least star that twinkles
in the great vault of heaven? Is it not
then to play at small game a meer
childish push-pin sport to contend for
it?</p>
            <p>Or can the great conflicts and
struglings managed with so much pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and animosity about it, amount
to more or seem other in the eye of a
truly soaring and rais'd ambition,
than a cock-fight or contest of fowls
for the Empire of a dunghill, or the
bul rush encounter we meet with in
the fable between the Frog and the
Mouse, or rather the stivings of those
little animals we sometimes observe
in mole hills, so eagerly to contend
for a grain of corn? For is not the
ambiency and circumference of the
whole earth (which is so noble a prize
in the eyes of the sons of men, and so
great a ball of contention among
them) but as a <hi>punctum</hi> a small point
or <hi>atomes,</hi> in comparison of the demen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the first and lowest Heavens;
And yet how much sweat, how much
oyl is dispended in the quest and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition
of a small particle thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:37537:51"/>
There are others that will suffer
much upon the account of love and
friendship, that can freely espouse
poverty, and court misery for the
love and company of a friend, that
can sacrifice their lives, their honours
their crowns at the Altar, and feet
of friendship: Can bid defiance unto
Death, the King of terrors, in honour
of their friend. And to speak truth,
since friendship in the highest and
most heroik degree thereof, is so strict
a League and Union of Souls that
friends become a second self to each
other: I know not whether he may be
thought worthy the title, or not to
profane the name by his pretensions
thereto, that cannot pawn his life
for the honour and safety of his
friend. Shall now a rash and blinde
passion, boast greater trophies, and be
honoured with more victims than
God? Shall the Martyrologies of
love and friendship be fuller than
those of Saints? Shall the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
of <hi>Cupid</hi> be more numerous
than those of Heaven? Shall men
do more upon a principle of good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and on the account of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
passion of love and friendship to a
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:37537:51"/>
creature, than those that pretend to
be saints by a principle of Grace, and
on the account of a Divine and Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick
love to the Creator? Shall the
flames of love kindled by concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence
and lust, have more heat and
burn brighter than those lighted by
a beam of Heaven, and kindled at
the Altar? Shall more boast the
wounds they have received in the lists
of friendship, than those of piety?
for the love of a woman, than of God?
for the sake of a friend, than of
Jesus.</p>
            <p>Others are very passionate in the
quest of honour, and zealous of their
reputations, being willinger to loose
their lives than the least punctilio of
credit. How many Gentlemen have
sacrificed their lives on this score, and
offer'd up themselves, as victims at
the Altars of this chimerical and
feigned Diety? How great a spur to
valour is this notion of Honour; How
great flames of courage will the least
spark thereof kindle in a valiant
breast? With how great resolution
will it steel a souldiers heart, making
him proof against the greatest perils?
What dangers will he not confront?
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:37537:52"/>
What hazards will he not attempt, if
his honour, if his reputation be at
stake? And how many of these can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates
of fame, these sons of renown
do watch with more jealousie ore their
honour, than their souls? And are
carefuller not to fully their reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
then defile their consciences;
Now shall any one be willinger to sell
his life, to redeem his own honour,
than Gods, to vindicate his own
reputation, than the Gospels? In
defence of his Princes standard, than
the banner of the Crosse, or to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
the name of a valiant man, than
that of a couragious Christian.</p>
            <p>Again many have suffered much
for the love of wisdom in the quest
and pursuit of knowledge. With how
much hunger and cold, with the
losse of how many nights rest and sleep
do men hunt after learning, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
to themselves a few flight noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of things? How will men rack
and serue their thoughts, torture,
and distresse their apprehentions,
with a problem or theorem in Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy?
How will many macerate
and consume their bodies, spend and
wast the taper of their lives in watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
abstinencies, and a thousand
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:37537:52"/>
other austerities to gain a superficial
inspection into the secrets of Nature,
into the nature of things? How will
many rob and defraud nature of its
due, and pine away their bodies to
satiate their thirst after knowledge,
to feed and gratifie the inquisitive
searching humor of their mindes?
How hath the eagernesse of some mens
thirst after learning, drunk up their
strength and the very marrow of their
souls? How hath the fiery spirit and
activity of their mindes, fretted, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd
and eaten up the flesh of their
bodies, reduc'd them to Anotomies,
and living Skellitons, looking more
like spectres Ghosts or walking shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
than men? Some mens souls
being like a sword too sharp and keen
for the scabbard of their bodies, in
which they are sheath'd: Or like
Mercury or Quicksilver, so penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and acture, that nothing can
contain them: And all this upon the
sole account of knowledge, to which
their affections are kindled with such
ardent desires, and have conceiv'd
such sprightly flames as commonly
soon reduces their bodies to ashes,
and rendes them the victims of their
desires, causing them to expire like the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:37537:53"/>
               <hi>Phenix,</hi> in their own flames. Its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
of (as I take it) <hi>Cleanthes</hi> a
poor Phylosopher, that he pawned his
nights rest, to purchase his dayes stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
that he drew water by night to
earn a small pension to maintain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the muses service by day, to
maintain himself in the study of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy.
And of another it is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that having quitted and forsaken
his honse and possessions, to take a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage
for the better improvement
of his stock of knowledge; and finding
at his return all things thorow the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
of time gone to decay, and his
house almost buried under its own ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins,
brake forth into these expressions,
<hi>sihaec non paeriissent ego paeriissem,</hi> had not
these perish'd I had perish'd, had I not
made Ship-wrack of my estate, I had
shipwrack'd and lost my self.</p>
            <p>Now shall the sons of humane wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
the candidates of a little natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
knowledge, that but puffeth up,
and profiteth not, except sanctifi'd
by grace, which will be but as a torch
to light men to Hell. I say, shall men
for the love of what the Apostle cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
vain Phylosophy, be content to
welcome poverty, and entertaine
penury, without any assurance of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:37537:53"/>
better estate in revertion, or future
happinesse to compensate and reward
their former miseries: And shall we
grudge to do that for the wisdom wch
is from above, for a Crown of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which they do for the shaddow
of wisdom, for a wreath of withering
and fading palms, to obtain a name
among the learned; Shall not we do
that to be made partakers of those
Eternal fountains of wisdom and
knowledge, that the Heathen did,
for the adorning their understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
with a little dark fading coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
knowledge?</p>
            <p>To conclude, the lower the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
is laid, the higher the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structure
may be raised. We have
received on the credit of naturalists
and those that are best read in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
of nature, that your tallest
trees shoot their roots deepest into
the Earth, and commonly as far
downwards towards the Center, as
their tops reach upwards towards
Heaven: As if nature would teach
us, that the foundation of the best
and surest fortune is laid low, is laid
in the dust, and the Scripture teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
us, that poverty is the way to a
Crown, beggery to a Kingdom. So
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:37537:54"/>
that we see here the harmony and
consent thats between the Book of
God, and that of nature, between
the Scriptures and the greater vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn
of the World: And both of
them giving in their evidence to this
Truth, bearing testimony to this
Doctrine, commending and reading
lectures to us of this poverty of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
Shall we now be so childish, as
not part with our counters for gold?
With the menstruous rags of our own
righteousnesse, for the glorious
princely robes of Christs? Shall we
prefer our coats of fig leaves, before
the righteousnesse of God?</p>
            <p>And that this way and method of salvation
may not seem strange to us, Christ the Lord
and Captain of our Salvation hath trod it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us. For was not he humbled, before he
was exalted? Was not he poor not having
where to lay his head, before he receiv'd the
Kingdom of his Father? Was not he crownd
with thorns, before he was crownd with Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?
Finally, was not he crucifi'd before he
was Glorified? Shall we now refuse to drink
of the same cup that he hath drunk before us?
Do we who are but the children of Adoption
expect a Kingdom, a Crown, a Scepter, a
Throne of Glory, on easier terms than the
Heire, the son by nature, and the first begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
than Chrrist our Elder brother receiv'd
them on, should we not rather rejoyce and
glory in our poverty, for that we are poor in
Spirit, because to such is given the Kingdom of
Heaven.</p>
