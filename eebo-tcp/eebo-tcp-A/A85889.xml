         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hriſtian Reader, I received in <hi>January</hi> laſt this <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer</hi>
to my Treatiſe, and I preſently addreſſed my
ſelfe to a <hi>Reply,</hi> which I finiſhed (notwithſtanding
other buſineſſe) in the ſpace of a <hi>moneth,</hi> as ſome of
<hi>Mr. Bartons</hi> acquaintance can teſtifie; and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tooke care for the <hi>Printing,</hi> but being certified that
his Booke was little regarded but kept Shop at <hi>London</hi> diligently, and
ſeldome went abroad, I was the more careleſſe of ſetting it forth. But
perceiving that <hi>Mr. Bartons</hi> admirers tooke advantage by my <hi>neglect,</hi>
boaſting that I was not able to make any <hi>anſwer;</hi> to the end that <hi>truth</hi>
may not be foyled, and <hi>errour</hi> wax proud, I have here preſented it to thy
view.</p>
            <p>It is the manner of <hi>Erroneous Teachers,</hi> what they cannot doe by
<hi>Reaſon,</hi> to endeavour by <hi>railing</hi> to trample <hi>truth</hi> under their feete.
Thus doth this <hi>Anſwerer,</hi> then whom a more <hi>ſcoffing Iſmaelite,</hi> or a
more <hi>rayling Rabſhakeh,</hi> I deeme never came in Print; If to call me
<hi>Arian, Socinian, Triformian, Anabaptiſt,</hi> and I know not what
beſides, will carry the <hi>cauſe</hi> at his ſide, he will ſurely winne the <hi>victory.</hi>
This is one of his fetches to endeavour by barbarous ſlighting of my <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
to diſcredit my <hi>booke.</hi> Another of his policies is to encounter mee
with a <hi>great volume,</hi> and a great ſhew of <hi>learning.</hi> It is poſſible he
may thus prevaile with <hi>ignorants,</hi> that underſtand him not, and with
ſuch as are carried with <hi>prejudice,</hi> but I am confident that he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

them, though it goe in a narrow roome, will bee more precious than a

his <hi>preface,</hi> I did in the <hi>ſinceritie</hi> of my heart preferre before the other,
for I could never perceive, (nor I thinke <hi>Mr. Barton</hi> himſelfe, when hee
is ſerious) how any can maintaine this opinion from the Text, upon his
reaſons, and yet ever judge it lawfull to lay it downe; therefore I did
not intend to rubbe his backe, I ſuppoſe if it lacke rubbing, himſelfe hath
made a deviſe to allay the itch of it. That I had good cauſe to publiſh my
booke, I have ſhewed <hi>ſufficiently.</hi> That I received a ſenſeleſſe rayling
anſwer to my <hi>foure arguments</hi> from him, I have to ſhew from his owne
<hi>hand;</hi> for he did but onely take my <hi>propoſitions,</hi> contradicting my
<hi>aſſumptions,</hi> and gave me not one word of <hi>reaſon,</hi> notwithſtanding
accuſing me of <hi>blaſphemy, contradictions, inconſequences,</hi> and
more then <hi>Semi-Arrian Socinianiſme.</hi> If this bee not unreaſonable
rayling I referre my ſelfe to any to judge: As for his anſwer, neere the one
halfe is impertinent ſtuffe, and meere barbarous <hi>ſcurrilitie,</hi> which I
have paſſed by, and have reſolved not to returne reviling for reviling.
But if my <hi>ſpirit</hi> be moved in behalfe of thoſe three <hi>worthies,</hi> whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
ſufferings he ſcoffes at Page 2. I truſt the <hi>Reader</hi> will not blame
me. There be ſundry things in my booke which are moſt <hi>materiall,</hi> that
he hath not ſo much as touched with one of his <hi>fingers;</hi> for my part I
have laboured in this my Reply for brevitie to the utmoſt of my power, yet
I know not any thing fit to be anſwered that I have paſſed by. Thoſe his
conceited ſtrong holds in his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. and ſome other things urged, though
when firſt mentioned, they are not anſwered in every place, yet they are
anſwered in other places more convenient as thou ſhalt finde. Thoſe
tales which he layes to my charge that I ſhould ſpeake, are all falſe,
where I anſwer nothing. If there bee any, that are ſo wedded to the
learned opinion of <hi>Maſter Barton,</hi> that they affect it and owne it,
and will not be perſwaded to the contrary, for my part I leave them to
all the comfort that this opinion will afford them; but withall, I wiſh
them to put it in <hi>practiſe,</hi> for I know ſome that hugge his <hi>booke</hi> that

he be not obeyed, his correction is no leſſe then eternall damnation. Thus,

               </gap> reades a Lecture of humilitie,
but in his <hi>Epiſtle Dedicatory,</hi> before his
anſwer, he beginneth with a proud brag,
wherein he ſhewes how well hee puts in
practiſe his owne doctrine. He ſaith he
anſwered my Treatiſe in 10. dayes of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi>
laſt: Now this is to let the world un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
that many of my bookes were
in the Country on the 19. of <hi>July,</hi> 1642. and I can prove that
he had one of them amongſt the firſt, and it cannot be thought
that he would be idle altogether til the buſie time of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> but
I wonder that he would take ſo much time about it, ſeeing hee
boaſted after he had ſent me that ſcurrilous anſwer to my <hi>foure
Arguments</hi> in <hi>Aprill</hi> before, that he had overthrowne my whole
Treatiſe in halfe an houre: a ſtrange dull fit came upon him, as
it ſeemes to take but halfe an houre then, but now ten dayes.
Now to ſhew the impudency of this bragge, I will declare the
truth of all: Almoſt two yeares agone hee being at my houſe,
I read into him my whole opening of the Text. In the <hi>Spring,</hi>
1642. meeting him by occaſion in the preſence of a <hi>Gentleman,</hi>
and others, he ſeemed to be very faire with me, and meekely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:112196:6"/>
me to ſend him ſome of my Arguments, affirming that if
he ſaw weight in them that hee would yeeld, promiſing that
when he had peruſed them he would returne them againe; and
ſend me the grounds of his <hi>opinion.</hi> I therefore ſent him thoſe
foure arguments above ſpecified, at large with their proofes,
which hee hitherto keepeth by him, and would not returne
them, neither would hee ſend his grounds according to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe:
Is this equity? nay is it honeſty? but it is ſuch honeſty
as well becommeth Maſter <hi>Barton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, almoſt two yeares agoe I ſent him another Argument.
Firſt and laſt in conference, and otherwiſe, I know not one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
but he hath been acquainted with: and he knew as long
agoe as <hi>September</hi> 1641. that I would ſet out my booke; and
yet this man hath the face to ſay that hee anſwered my whole
booke in ten dayes. To adde to this, in one paſſage of his
booke he layes to my charge that my booke is a <hi>monſter</hi> of three
yeares hatching;<note place="margin">Page 50.</note> great oddes, his brood but ten dayes in hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
mine three yeares; But this is the truth, finding this groſſe
ſuperſtition to take ſo much in the Countie by thoſe <hi>ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
teachers,</hi> and ſome ignorants in my owne pariſh to bee ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
with it, I ſomething more then three yeares agoe delivered
as much againſt it as amounted to the quantitie of an houre and
a halfe at two ſeverall <hi>Sermons,</hi> and then left it, onely being
ready to encounter with any of that opinion, as occaſion
ſhould ſerve, and never thought to come in print, till I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
abuſes by theſe men, and ſo with as much convenient
ſpeed as other buſineſſes would give mee leave, I wrote it out
faire, making it ready for the preſſe; and ſo I ſent it up to a
friend at <hi>London,</hi> where it lay almoſt halfe a yeare before it
came into the <hi>Preſſe,</hi> till ſuch time as I was carefull to looke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it my ſelfe. If my booke had beene made ten yeares agone,
what then? I may put it out when I pleaſe, it is raſhneſſe and
madneſſe to affirme that becauſe my booke came out three yeares
after I firſt ſtudied the point, that therefore I was ſo long in
ſtudying it; by this rule Maſter <hi>Partons</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is a monſter
as well as my booke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for I can prove that three yeares agone,
and better, he beganne to preach for his opinion, and a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
friend of his told me before my book was in the preſſe, that
he had a booke of this Queſtion ready for the Preſſe, which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:112196:6"/>
without doubt was this his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. This I thought good
to make knowne, leſt the reader ſhould be deceived in a paſſage
of his in the Title of the ſaid booke, where he ſaith it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
1642. for if by <hi>preparing</hi> he meane <hi>inventing</hi> or <hi>ſtudying,</hi> hee
wrongs his <hi>reader</hi> and his owne conſcience, ſeeing hee
preached for his opinion three yeares before. Thus much in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to his proud bragge. This Sophiſter (for ſo I cannot
chuſe but call him; for all his anſwers are but meer ſophiſtrie)
is offended at the title of my booke, becauſe I call bowing at
the name Jeſus ſuperſtition. One reaſon is, becauſe, ſaith hee,
Jeſus is the Genitive caſe, and cannot be nominall in any caſe;
which exception ſhall be anſwered hereafter. And ſecondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the tearme of ſuperſtition is an Enthuſiaſme (as he calleth
it) of Maſter <hi>Prynne</hi> and Maſter <hi>Burton,</hi> whom in ſcorne he calls
<hi>Confeſſor Prynne</hi> and <hi>Father Burton,</hi> fathered on him and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
by me, whom he calls their <hi>Pupill.</hi> But it was called <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition</hi>
by ſundry learned, long before they or my ſelfe wrote
in the <hi>Queſtion:</hi> therefore it doth not appeare to be firſt brought
up by thoſe worthy men, or if it were, I have no reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
for ſaying ſo too, unleſſe he can diſprove the truth of it:
and whereas he upbraides them with their forfeitures, and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
me whether I will undergoe the ſame; I anſwer, hee is a
malicious impudent perſon to caſt the ſufferings of thoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
men, with ſcorne into their teeth, in compariſon of whom
for true ſolid learning, piety and ſincerity, he is not worthy of
that honour that <hi>Job</hi> refuſed to give to the fathers of thoſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
that mocked him;<note place="margin">Job 6. 30. 1. 2.</note> but himſelfe alſo hath undergone a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture,
which if it had beene in as good a quarrell as theirs, it
would have beene more for his comfort, but he ſpeakes out, he
can be content to helpe mee to their forfeiture, if it lay in his
power, becauſe he ſaith, that contrary to my <hi>knowledge</hi> (his
owne ſaying, he ſhould have ſaid) I accuſe him of <hi>ſyllabicall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi>
having often (but it was never but once as I remember) in
the preſence of <hi>Divines</hi> and <hi>Gentlemen</hi> affirmed the contrary: In
anſwer to which, I doubt not but this <hi>malecontent</hi> will doe what
he can to the uttermoſt of his power, to the extremitie of forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
his malice is ſo <hi>implacable</hi> not only againſt me, but againſt
all ſuch as hate his courſes; but he cannot tell what forefeiture he
himſelfe may undergoe for his miſdemeanours if once a good

peace be ſetled, and I am confident that they that are through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

in ſaying that they doe not deveſt the name above every name
to <hi>bare letters,</hi> and <hi>ſyllables,</hi> and that they doe not take the <hi>name</hi>
without the <hi>ſenſe:</hi> but what if himſelfe doe utterly miſtake the
queſtion? for by a bare name I intend not any name ſimply
debarred of ſenſe, but firſt a proper name conſidered <hi>Seorſim</hi> and
<hi>apart</hi> by it ſelfe. And ſecondly ſuch a name that is not anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in a true relative ſenſe to names ſubjected to it. My firſt
reaſon, Sir, you needed not to have been offended with, for I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it as you ſee from a reaſon <hi>infallible,</hi> but take it as <hi>probable,</hi>
and as an <hi>introduction</hi> to thoſe reaſons that are more ſure. My
ſecond and third Reaſons taken from the analogie of the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
you take to be nothing, and include them in the former,
but you are miſtaken, and where can you finde theſe phraſes,
<hi>A great Name,</hi> or <hi>Name above another,</hi> taken from a proper namein
this ſenſe in any part of <hi>Scripture?</hi> My fourth reaſon you frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
ſlight, you deny that if <hi>the Name above every Name</hi> be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Name, the <hi>ſubjected Names</hi> muſt be proper Names alſo; this is
to deny evident plaine reaſon, for is there not a manifeſt <hi>relation</hi>
betweene a <hi>proper Name,</hi> and <hi>proper Names?</hi> But you ſay, if I
meane a Name in the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of it, the Name <hi>Jeſus</hi> is above every
Name whatſoever, yea above the <hi>Name of God,</hi> which is a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
aſſertion, for if you meane the <hi>Name of God</hi> conſidered by it
ſelfe as a name, then becauſe it is plaine by the Text that every
Name below this higheſt Name muſt bow knees to that Name,
then it will follow, that beſides the Names of the Creatures the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:112196:7"/>
                  <hi>Name of God</hi> muſt bow to the <hi>Name Jeſus:</hi> this will bee laid to
your charge, avoyd it if you can. But if you will not have the
Name Jeſus referred to names, then it muſt bee referred to the
powers of things ſubjected, then it will follow, that excepting
not <hi>God, God</hi> himſelfe muſt bow to the <hi>Name Jeſus:</hi> impute not
blaſphemy to mee, it is direct blaſphemie in you by your own
doctrine, and becauſe you ſee it lies upon you, you rage and
raile. Now then ſeeing Name above every Name cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
of a bare proper Name in the ſenſe above ſpoken, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it followes that it cannot be underſtood of the Name Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
becauſe the name in the Text is a name of power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
as that parallel place proves it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 18. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>all power is given me.</hi> So Maſter <hi>Calvin</hi> on that place, <q>
                     <hi>Quo etiam
pertinet illud Pauli, to which pertaines that of Paul, hee emptied
himſelfe, wherefore God exalted him, and gave him a name, which is
above every name.</hi>
                  </q> Again, the ſcope of the name proves it, for
Subjection muſt be given in this name ſignified by bowing the
knee, Authority &amp; ſubjection are relatives, there is no <hi>Subjection</hi>
due where there is no <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Authority.</hi> Now the Name <hi>Jeſus</hi> is
a name of <hi>Salvation,</hi> and not a name properly denoting <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi>
and <hi>Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, though it ſhould be granted that the <hi>Name Jeſus</hi> is
a name of <hi>Authority,</hi> yet it is not a name of the <hi>higheſt Authority,</hi>
Doctor <hi>Page</hi> your own witneſſe ſhall be Judge, whom you judge
unreproveable in his judgement,<note place="margin">Pag. 197.</note> who in his anſwer to Maſter
<hi>Prynnes</hi> Reply to <hi>Widdowes;</hi> Maſter <hi>Prynne</hi> having brought
many places to prove that <hi>the name Chriſt denominates Chriſts Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
his Church, his Apoſtles, his Miniſters, his Saints, his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
and therefore a Name eſpecially venerable amongſt Chriſtians,</hi>
doth acknowledge that the name <hi>Chriſt</hi> may be of greater <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie</hi>
and <hi>dignitie</hi> then the Name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> though not of greater
<hi>ſavour</hi> and <hi>mercy.</hi> Now let Doctor <hi>Page</hi> with all his learning,
and Maſter <hi>Barton</hi> with all his Sophiſtrie reconcile this if they
can, how the Name Jeſus can be above every name, yet it be
poſſible that any other name may be of greater <hi>dignitie</hi> and
<hi>authority</hi> than it, ſeeing Name in the Text doth expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note
<hi>dignitie</hi> and <hi>authoritie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, thought it ſhould be granted that the Name Jeſus is
of <hi>higheſt authority</hi> in regard of the <hi>Church</hi> only, yet in this reſpect
neither can it be the name above every name in the Text, for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:112196:8"/>
this name is of higheſt authority in regard of the whole creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
heaven and earth, and therefore without controverſie in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of Angels, Devils, and all men whatſoever, according to
the forecited place, <hi>Matth. 28. 18. All power is given me in heaven
and earth.</hi> Chriſt in this name commands the whole heaven and
earth. Now the Name Jeſus cannot command the <hi>Angels,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
to them he is not Jeſus by redemption, as the name ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies;
much leſſe can it command the <hi>Devills;</hi> and it cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the <hi>whole earth,</hi> for many <hi>nations</hi> have no knowledge of
his written Law, much leſſe the <hi>Goſpell;</hi> therefore neither doth
he command them as <hi>Jeſus,</hi> neither can any of theſe ſubmit
and bow to him as <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Therefore here the <hi>Name Jeſus</hi> ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
as a bare name to Angels, devills, reprobates, and many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the earth. And let not Maſter <hi>Barton</hi> be angry if I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
that he and his fellowes adore the <hi>bare Name Jeſus.</hi> For
firſt underſtanding the Text of the Name Jeſus they appoint the
bowing to the <hi>Name</hi> onely,<note place="margin">Sect. 5.</note> and not to the <hi>perſon,</hi> as I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and they cannot intend it to the perſon except they adde to
the Text. Secondly, when the perſon of our Saviour is as
fully denominated under his other titles, as Jeſus, they move
not, but onely at the name Jeſus. Thirdly, when they ſtand
or ſit to heare the <hi>Word,</hi> a geſture allowable by the Word, as
ſoone as the <hi>Name Jeſus</hi> is mentioned they immediatly bow,
and when oftentimes the great mercy of God in ſaving us is
largely and copiouſly laid open in a Sermon, or when in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of a Chapter many excellent ſentences are related, wherein
the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of our <hi>ſalvation</hi> is more clearely notified to our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
then by the <hi>Name Jeſus,</hi> yet there is no ſtirre, no ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
but onely at the Name Jeſus, no not at the title <hi>Saviour,</hi>
which is the very <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the name Jeſus, and better underſtood
of all. Fourthly, it is ordinary with theſe men, when they
be upon their knees at the prayers to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then to
make a <hi>ſpeciall incurvation</hi> of the body at the ſound of Jeſus, a
plaine argument that theſe men are guilty of <hi>Syllabicall worſhip,</hi>
and worſhip the <hi>bare name</hi> more then <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Chriſt himſelfe.</hi> That
I alone doe not ſo charge them, Maſter<note n="*" place="margin">On Phil 2. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Calvin</hi> and Maſter<note n="*" place="margin">Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Creede.</note> 
                  <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bington</hi>
do both of them lay <hi>ſyllable worſhip</hi> to their charge. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I returne Maſter <hi>Bartons</hi> ſcoffes upon himſelfe, and I would
faine ſee, how not poore ſilly <hi>flies,</hi> but ſuch <hi>mighty Elephants,</hi> as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:112196:8"/>
this <hi>Saphiſter</hi> is, can eſcape out of theſe nets: and therefore his
<hi>Crambe</hi> ſo often <hi>Cocta</hi> caſt upon me is more then ridiculous,
<hi>viz. Name above every name as a bare name cannot be underſtood of
the Name Jeſus, as a bare name,</hi> and this ſhall ſerve to anſwer it
every where when it is brought. To the ſecond part, <hi>viz.</hi> If it
ſhould be underſtood of a proper name, yet may it not bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
of the Name Jeſus; my firſt reaſon is, becauſe the word
<hi>Jeſus</hi> doth no where denote the name Jeſus, but onely <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.
21. and <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 21. where it muſt needs ſo ſignifie; but hee will
have my meaning to be this, that the word Jeſus doth not ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the word Jeſus, which is a <hi>Crotchet</hi> of his owne deviſing:
I ſay the word Jeſus doth not ſignifie the name, not the word,
your inſtance of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to ſignifie <hi>Jehovah</hi> in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is nothing to the purpoſe; for I ſpeake here of Jeſus; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is the <hi>Parallel</hi> brought right, for you ſhould have produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
where the word <hi>Jehovah</hi> is taken for the <hi>Name Jehovah,</hi> and
if you did, it is beſides the Queſtion, which is onely there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Name Jeſus.</hi> But you can prove, you ſay, that
name is often uſed for <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and inſtance in one place, which if
true, it is not for your turne, for you muſt prove that Jeſus is
taken for the Name Jeſus, but that place of <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 41. is not for
you; doth the Apoſtle ſpeake there <hi>barely</hi> of the <hi>name</hi> or <hi>appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
Jeſus?</hi> you thought belike you ſhould never be anſwered;
theſe be the words, <hi>they rejoyced that they were counted worthy to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
rebuke for his name:</hi> what is <hi>name</hi> taken for the <hi>name Jeſus</hi> here
properly? did the Appellation Jeſus offend the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> enemies?
did not they call him <hi>Jeſus</hi> as well as the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> This is that
offended them, for preaching that <hi>Jeſus:</hi> not the <hi>name</hi> but <hi>perſon</hi>
was the <hi>Chriſt;</hi> no quarrell at all about the <hi>name Jeſus:</hi> Would
it be thought that one that profeſſeth himſelfe ſuch a Scholler
as Maſter <hi>Barton</hi> is ſhould run into ſuch an abſurditie? To my
ſecond reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is never taken for the name
Jeſus, you object that I take the <hi>word</hi> without the <hi>ſenſe;</hi> but Sir
you muſt not take the <hi>ſenſe</hi> without the <hi>name:</hi> the queſtion is
about the <hi>name Jeſus</hi> as a <hi>name,</hi> and though you take the <hi>ſenſe</hi>
with it, yet you cannot bring any Scripture for this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
but becauſe you cannot anſwer this reaſon, therefore you
put it off with a ſcoffe. In the next place you affirme that in
this phraſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is the <hi>genitive caſe,</hi> and not the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:112196:9"/>
                  <hi>dative,</hi> and ſo you will have it read not in or at the name Jeſus;
but name of Jeſus: therefore it pleaſeth you <hi>Sect. 5. Page</hi> 36. in
your learned ſcurrilous language to call me a Jugler, a Thiefe,
a beguiler of the people, and that I have put the theft impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
on the <hi>Church,</hi> for turning the Genitive caſe into the
caſe of the Nonne; but what Sir, if I prove you to be the Jugler,
and the thiefe? for if you will have it read in or at the name of
Jeſus, then I agree with you; you know I am content to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
it ſo too; but here now will be a great doubt, what is
meant by the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> If by the <hi>word Jeſus</hi> you doe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the <hi>perſon,</hi> Name is generall, and many ſenſes may be made,
then my ſenſe of the <hi>Name of power and glory</hi> will come in <hi>fairely,</hi>
then any other name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> may come in to bee the name as
well as <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as <hi>Christ, Emmanuel, Mediatour,</hi> which are all
names of Jeſus, as well as Jeſus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea in better congruity of
ſpeech, theſe may be called name of Jeſus, then the name Jeſus,
But if by the <hi>word Jeſus</hi> you meane the <hi>name Jeſus,</hi> and yet will
not have it be in <hi>appoſition</hi> with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, then the ſenſe will bee
thus, <hi>at the name of the name Jeſus,</hi> which will be very ſenſeleſſe;
therefore by theſe words, <hi>in the name of Jeſus</hi> you muſt read <hi>name
Jeſus,</hi> or elſe no body underſtands you: yea your owne friends

that whereas your two friends affirme that ſundry men were
called <hi>Chriſts,</hi> therefore Chriſt is a communicable name, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered:
Theſe were no more called <hi>Chriſts</hi> then others were
called <hi>Saviours, Nehe.</hi> 9. 27. And though you reply, that none of
theſe were called <hi>Saviours</hi> as <hi>Jeſus</hi> was a <hi>Saviour;</hi> ſo I ſay that
none of theſe were called <hi>Chriſts</hi> as <hi>Jeſus</hi> was <hi>Chriſt.</hi> So here I
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:112196:9"/>
have taken off your <hi>two friends,</hi> and <hi>your ſelfe,</hi> and in this wee
areeven. But here I have the better of you. Some were called
<hi>Jeſus</hi> either by <hi>ſpeciall providence,</hi> or <hi>generall allowance,</hi> as by an
<hi>ordinary Name</hi> to be called by, but none might be called <hi>Chriſt</hi>
in an ordinary Name to be called by, without <hi>horrible blaſphemy.</hi>
And whereas you deny this, and ſeeme to affirme that ſome are
called Chriſts without offence, by an ordinary Name to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by, as you inſtance in <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> it is ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous;
what, is <hi>Chriſtopher Chriſt?</hi> it is no more Chriſt, then <hi>Mary</hi>
the mother of our Lord is the Lord himſelfe: and if you think
you are called <hi>Chriſt</hi> when called <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> I tell you plainely
you are a very <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> My quotation of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſin</hi> is <hi>ad idem,</hi> for
I cite him onely to this end, to ſhew that <hi>Joſhuah</hi> had his
name given him by a ſpeciall providence; and if <hi>Moſes</hi> gave him
the name, is doth the more confirme it.</p>
               <p>To my fourth reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe the <hi>Name Jeſus</hi> was given
to <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>beginning of his humiliation;</hi> therefore it cannot
be the <hi>Name above every Name</hi> in the Text, which was given him
at his <hi>exaltation;</hi> you anſwer nothing, but referre mee to your

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Pag. 13, 14, 15. and what doe I finde there? that two
or three doe ſay that <hi>Chriſts Name</hi> was manifeſted after the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,</hi>
but not any to apply it to the Name Jeſus. This
Name needeth no manifeſtation, becauſe hee was all along ſo
called; as God indeed his Name was manifeſted, but as man
the Name was then given him; <hi>Name</hi> here is the higheſt glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the <hi>humane nature</hi> as generally the beſt expoſitors doe
underſtand the Text.</p>
               <p>But if you can produce any place to prove that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> doth
ſignifie to manifeſt or declare, I will the ſooner incline to your
opinion; and according to your owne reaſon, a literall-ſenſe,
admitting no abſurditie, and expreſſing a cleare truth, is to bee
preferred before a myſticall. Now you ſcoffing at our <hi>figurative
interpretation</hi> of ſome clauſes, though warranted by <hi>Scripture,</hi>
doe make a <hi>myſticall ſenſe</hi> here no where warranted. Now that
<hi>give</hi> is to be taken here <hi>properly,</hi> the <hi>Analogie</hi> of the <hi>Text,</hi> and
the <hi>order</hi> of the words will evidence; for the Name given here
is Gods free rewarding of Chriſt after his obedience &amp; ſufferings
as is plaine by the Text; which if it were onely by the <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation</hi>
of his former <hi>Name,</hi> it is not ſo <hi>proper,</hi> as by giving him
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:112196:10"/>
that <hi>glory</hi> which he had not before; Secondly, the words are
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, there being no article before

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> it is plaine it hath no relation to any proper Name then
called by. Againe it being <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, hee gave a name to
him, not his Name, it is evident it is a gift not before had.
I doe not deny it to be underſtood of ſome Name or Names that
Chriſt as God had before, as God <hi>Jehovah,</hi> Sonne of God, for
ſo they may after a ſort be called a gift, for theſe names being
laid downe in his <hi>humiliation, reſtoring</hi> is a kinde of <hi>giving;</hi> much
more as the <hi>glory</hi> of theſe <hi>Names</hi> are given to the <hi>humane nature.</hi>
For whereas he was before called by theſe glorious names, as
<hi>God</hi> onely, now he is ſo called as <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
though <hi>Zanchius</hi> doe underſtand it of the name of God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted,<note place="margin">On Phil. 2. 9. 10.</note>
yet he affirmes it to be a reall gift, <hi>viz.</hi> as the humane
nature is honoured thereby; but in no ſenſe can it be underſtood
of the declaration of the Name Jeſus, which Name was never
denied him: therefore ſaith <hi>Zanchius, alii pro nomine Jeſu, ſed mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus

leſſe fitly,</hi> becauſe before the reſurrection he was called Jeſus by
all. To have the name Jeſus declared after the reſurrection is
not properly an advancement of Chriſt<note n="*" place="margin">Your ſelfe ſay, that the declaration of a thing is not more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy then the thing, <hi>Part. 2. Sect.</hi> 4.</note>. Therefore is it not
the name above every Name. If you Mr. <hi>Barton,</hi> ſhould preſent one
of your <hi>Bookes</hi> to your <hi>Godfather,</hi> and he to <hi>gratifie you,</hi> ſhould
give to you your <hi>Name Thomas,</hi> or declare your name <hi>Thomas,</hi>

if the Name above every Name bee but the <hi>declaration</hi> of
the name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> he ſhould have more given him at his <hi>Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
then at his <hi>exaltation;</hi> for a <hi>gift</hi> is more then the <hi>declaration</hi> of
it. If any thing were now added to the name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> then was not
his name <hi>perfect</hi> at the firſt; and you may as well ſay that <hi>Christ</hi>

as that the Name <hi>Jeſus</hi> was not <hi>perfect.</hi> You ſay your

I pray, Sir, wherein doth the <hi>eminencie</hi> of the Name <hi>Jeſus</hi>
appeare after the <hi>reſurrection?</hi> in all your <hi>treatiſe</hi> I doe not ſee
but you make it to conſiſt in this, that it ſignifieth a <hi>Saviour,</hi>
but ſo it ſignified before, and ſo it ſignified after he had wrought
<hi>ſalvation</hi> for us by his <hi>death;</hi> to what purpoſe then was the ſenſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:112196:10"/>
of the name given him, when the nature of the name, eſpecially
after the worke was finiſhed, declares it of it ſelfe? if then the

then the <hi>declaring</hi> of the Name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> God ſhould but mocke his
Sonne, and indeed give him no more <hi>honour,</hi> or not ſo much as
he gave him before.</p>
               <p>To my fifth reaſon, that Jeſus cannot be the Name above ove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Name, becauſe <hi>Jeſus was advanced after his reſurrection to bee
Lord and Chriſt, Act.</hi> 2. 36. you have nothing to ſay to it, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
me of <hi>Arianiſme,</hi> as if ſay you <hi>Jeſus</hi> was not the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that he was declared to be after the reſurrection, <hi>Lord,</hi>
and <hi>Chriſt.</hi> I anſwer, though Jeſus were ſo before, yet he was not
honoured ſo before in reſpect of the <hi>humane nature,</hi> for ſo hee
was <hi>advanced</hi> to that honour. If <hi>Jeſus</hi> were the <hi>higheſt Name;</hi>
how could Jeſus come to be more highly advanced in becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Chriſt?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Part 2. Sect. 4.</note> And here I muſt put you in mind of an
horrible <hi>abſurdity</hi> of your opinion; you affirme that the name
<hi>Chriſt</hi> is the Name onely of the <hi>humanity,</hi> the Name <hi>Ieſus</hi> the
<hi>eſſentiall Name</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> then by this your <hi>doctrine,</hi> according to

Well then hence I argue that it is impoſſible that the Name
Jeſus ſhould be the proper Name of the Deitie, and Chriſt of he
humanitie; for then ſhould hee be moſt commonly called <hi>God</hi>
in the time of his humiliation, when his <hi>God-head</hi> was veyled,
when <hi>Chriſt</hi> called himſelfe the <hi>Sonne of man,</hi> and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called <hi>Man</hi> in the time of his exaltation, after that hee
had mightily declared himſelfe to be the ſonne of God; which
were utterly ſenſeleſſe to imagine.</p>
               <p>But before I leave this, I will note a contradiction in Doctor
<hi>Page,</hi> your infallible witneſſe, who in his anſwer to Mr. <hi>Prynnes
Appendix</hi> *,<note place="margin">Page 55.</note> makes <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be the name of the Deitie, Chriſt of
the humanitie;<note place="margin">Page 197.</note> yet in his anſwer to his <hi>Reply *,</hi> he affirmes, as I
noted before, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a name of greater <hi>dignitie</hi> and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
then <hi>Jeſus:</hi> hence it will follow that our Saviour is of
greater dignitie and authoritie as man then as God; let this
be reconciled if it can.</p>
               <p>Your anſwer to my fixt reaſon is nothing but ſenſeleſſe ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility.
Whereas I ſay, God in advancing his Sonne above all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
himſelf, and no where is Chriſts Name ſaid to be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
above divine Names, but created onely; I overthrow here no
gracious diſpenſation that you can prove from the word, for
though the high advancement of the Sonne be to the glory of
every Perſon, yet hath he not a Name or glory above them. And
if you can prove it otherwiſe by Scripture, why doe you ſpeake
of Scripture, and alledge none?</p>
               <p>Seing <hi>Name above every Name</hi> cannot bee underſtood of the
name <hi>Jeſus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Name above every Name, <hi>what it is.</hi>
                  </note> I underſtand it of the <hi>ſupereminent glory</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
theſe reaſons. To let alone your ſcoffe at my <hi>tranſition,</hi> for
you can doe nothing elſe, take the <hi>ſenſe</hi> and the <hi>Name</hi> together
if you will, I deny it not. Firſt I ſay it is no way contrary to
the <hi>Analogie</hi> of faith, ſo to underſtand it, for Name is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken for glory in Scripture. To this, your exception is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
for from hence I gather that this expoſition is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Scripture.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Name of God</hi> doth uſually in Scripture denote the
<hi>power</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> of <hi>God</hi> either <hi>implicitly</hi> of <hi>expreſſely:</hi> hence alſo I

any of the titles of God; as <hi>Name of God,</hi> or <hi>Lord,</hi> or <hi>Jeſus,</hi>
&amp;c. to denote the name <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Lord;</hi> therefore are the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
againſt your expoſition, though plaine for me.</p>
               <p>To my third reaſon, you have more cauſe to bluſh for your <hi>fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous
exception,</hi> than I for affirming that it is more agreeable to
<hi>Scripture</hi> to underſtand name for the <hi>ſupereminent power and glory of
Chriſt,</hi> then otherwiſe; for you ſee I anſwer on by degrees in my
reaſons. My firſt and ſecond, as <hi>a great Name,</hi> and <hi>Name above
another;</hi> are two diſtinct phraſes, and doe every where ſignifie
not a <hi>proper Name,</hi> but onely <hi>glory:</hi> but you will have this to be
againſt me, for, ſay you, if a <hi>great Name</hi> doe ſignifie the <hi>great
glory</hi> of the <hi>perſon,</hi> then it is not the <hi>glory,</hi> for <hi>ſignum is not ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi>
I reply ſigne, and the thing ſignified are the ſame materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
and though when they ſtand in oppoſition they differ; yet
otherwiſe the ſigne doth often denote the <hi>thing ſignified;</hi> and
they are the ſame.</p>
               <p>To my fourth reaſon, that it muſt be underſtood of <hi>Power</hi> and

the <hi>gift</hi> which God gave him, other <hi>correſpondent Scriptures</hi> doe

learned ſtuffe? If the Name Jeſus ſuffered as the perſon ſuffered,

united: You ſee, I except my two firſt from evidently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
they ſhew onely that this expoſition is agreeable to
the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> my maine ſtrength lies in my third <hi>Reaſon,</hi>
confirmed by the other: where I prove that becauſe <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
Devills, ſoules of men</hi> muſt bow; beſides ſenſitive, and inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
creatures; which have no proper knees: therefore proper
knees are not commanded. For if ſuch knees were properly
commanded, it would be injuſtice in God to require ſuch knees
where they are not: as in a King if hee ſhould command ſuch a
ſumme of mony to be payd by his ſubjects, which he knowes
they are not able to pay. That which you anſwer to this is to
no purpoſe; For it is abſurd to ſay, becauſe ſome creatures
have knees, they are bound to bow proper knees <hi>expreſſely,</hi> and
thoſe creatures that have no knees, are bound to bow <hi>analogically:</hi>
for the ſame bowing is injoyned to all, if the Text did make a
<hi>difference</hi> it were ſomething; but there is no difference in the
Text. But you will prove that <hi>Angels</hi> have <hi>knees</hi> as well as
<hi>Tongues, 1 Cor.</hi> 13. 1. and <hi>faces, Rev.</hi> 7. 11. and they are ſaid to
ſtand, to fall downe, which inſinuate knees; and this you ſay
is enough to thoſe that will be ſatisfied with reaſon; Sir this
reaſon will not ſatisfie any one that knowes the <hi>Scriptures:</hi> for
becauſe faces, tongues and bodily poſtures are aſcribed to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
it will not follow that they have them properly, no more

that underſtanding it thus, you muſt needs underſtand it of the
<hi>whole ſtrength</hi> of the creature, for what proper knees have <hi>ſoules</hi>
more then other parts of the body? yea, they come nearer to
proper knees then the ſoule; being corporeall as the proper knee
is, which ſoules are not. Therefore you expounding the Text
of ſoul-knees, you cannot in any ſenſe exclude the other parts
of the body, beſides the proper knee, and therefore whether
you will or no, you muſt yeeld to me here; If you underſtand
the Text of expreſſe corporeall knees, then are no other knees
commanded, then are not <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Devills</hi> to bow becauſe
they have no ſuch knees, and ſo it will be <hi>will-worſhip</hi> in you to
give any part beſides the <hi>knee,</hi> and then you ſinne, when you
put of your hat, and bow your bodie at the name; when in ſo
doing you doe rather ſtiffen your knees, then bow them. If

be given and nothing elſe in ſtead of it, then you cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
it of ſoule-knees; for ſoule-knees are no proper knees.
Therefore you muſt with me here (yea you doe if you could

<hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 10. as you underſtand it, you muſt make the ſenſe to bee
this. All nations compaſſed me about; but when the <hi>Lord is
mentioned,</hi> that is, at the inſtant time thereof, I will deſtroy them,
as at the very time, when Jeſus is mentioned you bow; if this
be the meaning of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> I ſee no reaſon but you muſt have
a Sword, or a Piſtoll, or ſuch like with you at the Church, and
when the Lord is mentioned, you muſt fall to killing your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
and then when the people ſay <hi>good Lord deliver us,</hi> if you
have any enemies there, they deliver up themſelves into your
hands, to be killed, and ſo you will not bee of <hi>Davids</hi> minde;
for he when his adverſaries were againſt him, gave himſelfe to
prayers, but when your enemies pray you will kill them. My
next Scripture is, <hi>Act. 9. 29. Saul ſpake boldly in the name of the
Lord Jeſus,</hi> I ſay it would be infinitely abſurd to ſay hee ſpake
boldly at the naming of the Lord Jeſus; <hi>you cry out againſt mee
and ſay is this abſurd? and infinitely too? we all know that Paul was
a zealous profeſſor, and might not he be ſtout at the mention or naming
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:112196:15"/>
of Jeſus? he is ſtoutly preached, whom we feare to name. Now you
cry out where is this great challenger? were I Anteus I ſhould never
riſe againe:</hi> but ſtay Sir, I am on my legges yet, to buckle with
you once, and againe; What, doth <hi>In</hi> ſignifie <hi>time</hi> here, as you wil
have it ſignifie at <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9? <hi>Nomen capitur pro profeſſione:</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>Name
is taken for profeſſion. So the ſenſe is this, Paul valiantly defended the
cauſe of Christ;</hi>
                  </q> but if you will have In ſignifie the preſent
time there, then the ſenſe will be this; <hi>Saul</hi> preached or ſpake
boldly when Jeſus was named, that is, as ſoone as ever the
Name was named, as accordingly you bow. Then it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that whenſoever you heare <hi>Jeſus</hi> named you muſt fall to
<hi>preaching,</hi> and then as ſoone as you come in the <hi>Common Booke
of Prayer</hi> to the abſolution, <hi>Jeſus</hi> being named you muſt fall to
<hi>preaching,</hi> and then you muſt curtaile almoſt all the <hi>Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi>
and run into that which you judge a great fault in others,
goe to your Sermon before you have ſaid the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall
prayer;</hi> &amp; though you ſhould make but a ſhort Sermon &amp;
returne to your abſolution, at the concluſion of it <hi>Jeſus</hi> is named
againe, and once more you muſt goe to <hi>preaching</hi> before you come
to the Lords Prayer; and if you preach every time Jeſus is named
in the divine ſervice, you will preach oftner in a day then any
of thoſe you call <hi>Puritans,</hi> in a quarter of a yeare at leaſt; and
if often preaching bee as you deeme, a note of a <hi>Puritane,</hi> you
will be the <hi>rankeſt Puritane</hi> in the world; yea in the <hi>abſolution
Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> being both mentioned together, you muſt <hi>preach</hi>
and <hi>kill,</hi> all at one time, and this I thinke will bee the maddeſt
Sermon that ever was made. In the next place as if my owne
<hi>weapons</hi> were not enough to ſtrike me dead, you will ſtrike mee
with your owne, and what are they? Firſt, you bring the third
Commandement, but this phraſe in the name is not there. Next
you come to <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 23. whatſoever you ſhall aske the Father in
my name; that is, ſay you by faith mentioning me as <hi>mediatour.</hi>
And then you argue, <hi>Act. 5. 40. not to ſpeake in the name of Jeſus, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by preaching, ſay you, or otherwiſe to his glory, at our invocation over
the name of Ieſus is a fruitfull naming, or mentioning of him; not inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
alwayes, but by heart and tongue alſo alwayes unto God, Epheſ.</hi> 5. 20.
To what purpoſe is this brought? what frivolous ſtuffe is here?
And yet you having had me downe before in your conceit, now
you gall me terribly. But we will examine theſe places: as for
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:112196:16"/>
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 40. it is anſwered before in <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 29. being a parallel
place, but I adde this further to it, Were the Apoſtles forbidden
to mention the name Jeſus? did not their enemies mention Jeſus
as well as they?</p>
               <p>But you adde <hi>[to his glory].</hi> But you will have your people
bow when you mention <hi>Ieſus</hi> in the Church, but you will not
have them queſtion whether you doe it to his glory or no; As
for <hi>Iob.</hi> 16. 23. we are bidden there <hi>to pray to the Father in the name
of Chriſt,</hi> that is, in and by <hi>Chriſt himſelfe,</hi> as other places demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate:
but I pray Sir, doth In here ſignifie time? If you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
this place as you doe <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. the ſenſe will be this, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
you aske of my Father, when Jeſus is named; then it
will follow that whenſoever you heare <hi>Ieſus</hi> named, you muſt
fall to <hi>Prayer.</hi> And as before this ſenſe of <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 29. will drive
you to <hi>preaching</hi> in the time of <hi>prayer:</hi> So here it will drive you
to <hi>prayer</hi> in the time of <hi>preaching,</hi> if at any time you name Jeſus in
it;<note place="margin">* Sect. 5. You make the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus to bee a ſigne how to know when to bow, by this reaſon you muſt make it alſo a ſigne how to know when to preach and pray.</note> and what a confuſion will this be alſo?</p>
               <p>But to returne againe to theſe two places, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. and <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.
If Maſter <hi>Barton</hi> bring <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9. to the meaning of theſe two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as he underſtands them, he cannot but know that preaching
and praying is begun, and continued before and after Jeſus is
named, and not then begun onely at the inſtant time of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of it, for Jeſus is named but now and then; then accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to this you muſt continue all along your <hi>Geſture</hi> of bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
throughout preaching and praying, though the name Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
be ſeldome mentioned; and then you muſt neither kneele
nor ſtand, but have your body bowed all the time halfe way to
the ground, and then there ſhall not be any viſible appearance
of bowing at the name Jeſus more then ordinary, then at any
other name whatſoever, which may bee named in preaching or
prayer: and if any ſhould ſee you in this <hi>poſture,</hi> continuing
halfe bowed to the ground, they would thinke you to be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to another kinde of buſineſſe then preaching or prayer. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale
here to all the world whether you have not here given
your ſelfe ſuch <hi>a ſhamefull foyle</hi> as you will never be able to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
My expoſition of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. 4. you miſlike not; but yet it
cannot beare your ſenſe of <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9. for though the Saints have
uſed to lift up the hands in prayer, yet I thinke they are not
preciſely bound to it; and if they were, it is ſenſeleſſe to gather
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:112196:16"/>
from this or any other place, that they are bound to a new act
of lifting up the hands every time the name of God ſounds,
which ſenſe you muſt put upon it, if you match it with <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9.
you have not proved yet that In the name ſignifieth any where
at the time of mentioning the name, neither can you; here then
one maine pillar of your cauſe is ſhaken downe.</p>

and what I have ſaid againſt this crotchet of yours in Sect.
10, 11. neither Dr. <hi>Page</hi> here, nor your ſelfe there have taken off,
for you ſay nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But you will have the expoſition of the Text to be this:</hi> the
Lord Jeſus by the union, and for our ſalvation was humbled: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:112196:17"/>
God exalted him, and ſet up the name Jeſus above every name; that
for the union, and our ſalvation, every rationall creature ſhould bow at
the nameof Jeſus; <hi>which you will have to be at the mention of
Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now whereas you eſteeme my interpretation to be ſhort, hard,
doubtful; I appeale to all the <hi>world</hi> whether I have added or detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
any thing, or have not made good every <hi>clauſe</hi> from the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
And that your interpretation is not according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
I have proved; and beſides you adde to the Text: for theſe
words <hi>(for the union, and for our ſalvation)</hi> are not in the Text.</p>
               <p>In my notation of the <hi>abſurdities</hi> of your opinion, I ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
to underſtand <hi>Name</hi> for <hi>glory,</hi> the name is knowne what
is given <hi>Chriſt:</hi> but to underſtand name for a proper name;
it is not ſhewed what name it is in this clauſe, <hi>(God gave him a
name above every name)</hi> and whereas you bid me looke for it in
the 10. <hi>verſe,</hi> I referre my ſelfe to this <hi>clauſe,</hi> and in verſe 10. you
contradict your ſelfe; for you ſtill fall out with me for calling
it the <hi>Name Jeſus:</hi> You doe not then ſhew what <hi>Name</hi> it is; the
reſt of your anſwer is but <hi>rayling</hi> and <hi>very babling</hi> and is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
anſwered already.</p>
               <p>In my ſecond note I ſay againe that in your expoſition you
doe not denote the <hi>perſon</hi> properly, to whom the bowing ſhall
be done, but onely ſet downe a time when the <hi>bowing</hi> ſhall bee
done, neither have you anſwered it; for the Name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as you
meane it, is diſtinct from the <hi>perſon.</hi> But you ſay, how ſhall wee
know when to bow if it be not ſignified by ſome <hi>ſigne?</hi> I reply,
by what <hi>ſigne</hi> ſhall wee know how to honour the <hi>Father?</hi> you
will not obey without ſignes. Thoſe <hi>famous Churches</hi> that abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
your bowing, know how and when to honour <hi>Chriſt</hi> bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then your ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I ſay againe that in this your expoſition you apply
no <hi>honour</hi> at all to the name, if you make <hi>In</hi> to ſignifie <hi>time,</hi> but
onely make it a <hi>watchword</hi> when to bow, you ſet not downe to
whom. And if you underſtand <hi>In</hi> for <hi>To,</hi> as Biſhop <hi>Andrewes</hi> doth
underſtand it alſo, then you give <hi>the name</hi> the whole bowing of
the <hi>regard,</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> alſo, call it what you will, and none at
all to the perſon: but referring it to both you adde to the <hi>Text,</hi>
and either way you make it <hi>Idolatry;</hi> in the firſt ſenſe it is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:112196:17"/>
                  <hi>Idolatry,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Expoſition of the Creed.</note> you know it well enough though you will take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it. And you are an impudent perſon to ſay that Biſhop
<hi>Babington</hi> in that place ſaith nothing againſt your <hi>ſenſe;</hi> for he
neither underſtandeth <hi>Name</hi> to be <hi>Jeſus,</hi> but <hi>power, and glory,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth he underſtand bowing <hi>literally,</hi> but for ſubjection, and
he calls your worſhip <hi>ſyllable worſhip,</hi> and ſaith ſuch worſhippers
are given up to <hi>deluſions:</hi> As for Dr. <hi>Whitakers,</hi> he is as full as
any againſt your ſenſe, though hee might hold it indifferent,
ſo bowing be at other names alſo; but ſole bowing at the name
Jeſus he holds unlawfull, and utterly damnes your expoſition;

The next place is 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 10. 12. but for the tenth Verſe no
name is mentioned at all. And for the twelfth verſe, the words
are theſe, <hi>That the name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt may be glorified in
you, and you in him.</hi> I anſwer, that very good authors, as <hi>Calvin</hi>
and <hi>Marlorate</hi> do underſtand it of <hi>Chriſt</hi> being glorified by us
in an <hi>holy life.</hi> Thus ſaith <hi>Calvin, Revocat nos, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <hi>Hee calls us
backe to the chiefe end of our life, that we ſhould ſerve the Lord of
glory; it is chiefely to be noted that they ſhall againe bee glorified in
Chriſt, who have ſet forth the glory of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </q> This agrees with
the precedent verſe as <hi>Marlorate</hi> on that place well obſerves. And
to this doth <hi>Zanchy</hi> agree, and though hee doe alſo allow the
other, and apply it to the day of judgement; yet doth he not
underſtand it of any <hi>literall name,</hi> but of the <hi>perſon of Chriſt,</hi> for
thus he ſaith. The ſumme of theſe words is this, that <q>

ſhall be glorified in us as the head in the members, when he endueth
us with that glory wherewith himſelfe is glorified.</hi>

any <hi>bare title.</hi> Now here is your Argument, <hi>the Lord Ieſus
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:112196:19"/>
ſhall be glorified in the Saints at the day of judgement. Ergo, all ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
creatures ſhall bow corporall knees at the name Ieſus at that day:</hi> a
very ſenſeleſſe inconſequent: I am very confident that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bring any orthodox interpreter to underſtand that Text
of the literall Name Jeſus. If it could bee proved, Jeſus is no
more mentioned there, then Lord and Chriſt; and there is
no mention of bowing at any name. Thoſe Texts of <hi>Iſay</hi> 45. 23.
and <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 11. though they be to be underſtood of the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
make nothing for the purpoſe. Thus we ſee how trimly
Maſter <hi>Barton</hi> hath anſwered my firſt reaſon.</p>
               <p>My ſecond reaſon is this; To what end ſhall the Name Jeſus
be named at that day, that all ſhould bow at the mention of it,
when Chriſt ſhall appeare in his moſt glorious name of power
and glory; when he ſhall not come as a Jeſus to the moſt that
ſhall then bow; but a Lord to all, and ſo ſhall all call him?
Here you are very ſnuffe; as it is uſuall with you when your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
are moſt weake, there to bee moſt outragious: you tell
me it is a demand, rather then a diſproofe: but diſproofes by
queſtions as ordinarily moſt vehement; but you here fearefully
wreſt my words; for I have not ſaid that the name Jeſus ſhall
not be mentioned at all at that day, but that it ſhall not be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
that all ſhall bow at it, but if I ſhould have denyed that
the name Jeſus ſhall be then mentioned, it is more then you can
prove by any cleare Scriptures; Becauſe then you referre mee to
your <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. wee will examine the Scriptures you there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Firſt, you bring 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 7. where it is ſaid <hi>that in that day the
Lord Ieſus ſhall be revealed:</hi> but this is ſpoken of the perſon, not
of the literall Name: it is no more but this; Chriſt himſelfe ſhall
appeare in judgement; and here the emphaſis is in the word
<hi>Lord,</hi> being the title of his honour, rather then in <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Your
ſecond inſtance is 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 12. but that is anſwered already.
The third place is 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 14. where <hi>the day of judgement is called
the day of the Lord Ieſus,</hi> this is all one with the firſt inſtance; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this you deſcant, <hi>ſhall he have a day, and ſhall he not be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned?</hi>
But it will not follow that becauſe the ſaid day is called
the day of the Lord Jeſus, that therefore the Name Ieſus ſhall
be mentioned, becauſe there is nothing ſpoken of the bare lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
name, but perſon. Your next place is <hi>Phil. 2. 10. Every
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:112196:19"/>
tongue ſhall confeſſe Jeſus Chriſt to be Lord:</hi> you then fall very fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
on them that ſhall queſtion the Name Jeſus to bee then
mentioned, in this manner? <hi>If they be Schollers, can they be thus igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant?
if Divines, be they not infatuated? if both, are they not in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt?</hi>
But ſoft Sir, better Schollers, better Divines, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier
men than your ſelfe cannot neceſſarily make your conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
from this place.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle ſpeaking here in the <hi>third perſon</hi> ſhewes what ſhall
be at the day of judgement, and therefore might well ſpeake of
Chriſt in his proper name, yet it will not follow thence that
the name Jeſus ſhall be then mentioned, when they that ſhall
then appeare ſhall not ſpeake in the third perſon; but ſhall ſpeak
to Chriſt in the ſecond perſon before his face. But I pray Sir
tell me, if the <hi>Name Jeſus</hi> be to be then ſounded out, who ſhall
ſound it out? you did once tell me, that the <hi>Trumpe</hi> ſhould doe
it, but that is ridiculous. Shall <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe ſound it out?
there is no proofe of that. Shall thoſe that ſhall appeare before
him ſound it out? there is no proofe of that; there bee ſundry
Scriptures that they ſhall call him <hi>Lord,</hi> but not one that they
ſhall call him <hi>Jeſus</hi> at that day: So then the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> might well
ſay ſpeaking of Chriſt in the third <hi>perſon,</hi> before the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that every tongue ſhall confeſſe Jeſus to be Lord at that
day, for in calling him Lord they call Jeſus Lord, though they
doe not Name the word Jeſus; As when any Sir to your face
ſhall call you <hi>Prieſt,</hi> it may be juſtly ſaid, when you are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of in the third perſon, that they called <hi>Thomas Barton
Prieſt,</hi> though they named not <hi>Thomas</hi> when they ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
you. So then hee that doubts this ſay you, doubts
all, this may juſtly bee doubted, and ſo all may bee doubted.
But if you could prove this to bee true, as for my part I
will not peremptorily deny it, though there is no cleare
Scripture for it, yet what can you get by this proofe? will
it therefore follow, that all ſhall bow at the mention of
the Name Jeſus? This is your Argument or it is nothing at
all, but it is a mad <hi>inconſequence.</hi> This conſequence, if good, will
make certainly for bowing at the Name <hi>Lord,</hi> which ſhall then
be mentioned by <hi>confeſſion. Chriſt</hi> indeed ſhall bee bowed to by
all as <hi>Lord,</hi> but not at the Name <hi>Lord,</hi> Chriſt ſhall be confeſt to
be <hi>Lord,</hi> therefore to him as Lord ſhall the bowing bee perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:112196:20"/>
if the Text had ſaid, that every tongue ſhall confeſſe the
<hi>Lord Chriſt</hi> to be <hi>Jeſus,</hi> then had <hi>Jeſus</hi> beene the Name to bee
confeſt, but ſeeing that they ſhall confeſſe Jeſus Chriſt to bee
Lord, it is plaine, that Lord is the Name, as being ſaid, that
all the Subjects in <hi>England</hi> doe confeſſe <hi>Charles</hi> to be <hi>King,</hi> they
doe not properly now confeſſe the King to be <hi>Charles,</hi> but <hi>Charles</hi>
to be King. And whereas you returne me to your <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Next you fall foule upon my Argument, and tell me that it
is very falſe to ſay, that Chriſt ſhall come as a Lord to all, and
not as Jeſus, and that the ſimple people are abuſed by my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applying
the Text, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 37. 44. But that I have neither
abuſed the Text, nor the people, I have made good ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
but that you have done both it is evident to your ſhame.
But you have not ſet downe my words right, for I ſay thus,
He ſhall not come as a Jeſus to all that ſhall bow. But by two
<hi>reaſons</hi> you will prove that I have miſapplyed the Text. The
firſt is by a <hi>Queſtion:</hi> Who is Lord, ſay you, but Jeſus? Here you ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly
confound theſe two Names, making them all one. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
not that <hi>Jeſus</hi> the <hi>perſon</hi> is <hi>Lord,</hi> but I deny that the Name
<hi>Jeſus</hi> is the Name <hi>Lord.</hi> Your ſecond reaſon is, becauſe Jeſus
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:112196:20"/>
being the Saviour of us, is the <hi>confounding Jeſus</hi> of his, and our
enemies: this is your Argument; <hi>to whom he is not a ſaving Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
he is a confounding Jeſus,</hi> ſo one way hee is a <hi>Jeſus</hi> to all.
But Sir the name Jeſus is a ſaving, not a confounding Name,
and it was given not for Angels, Devils and Reprobates, but
for his people onely, and that for ſalvation, not for deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
all this is plaine from <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. 21. Seeing then you affirme
that the bowing in the Text muſt bee done in the ſenſe of this
Name, the <hi>Angels</hi> cannot bow in the ſenſe of this Name, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
you will make them <hi>ſinners;</hi> for <hi>Jeſus</hi> is a <hi>Saviour</hi> from
ſinne: much leſſe can <hi>Devils</hi> and <hi>Reprobates</hi> bow to him in that
ſenſe, except you will have them to be <hi>ſaved.</hi> Againe it is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
againſt the <hi>Scripture</hi> to hold, that Jeſus as <hi>Jeſus</hi> is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founder,
for all the while that he was moſt commonly called
by this Name and was in the ſtate of ſaving us,<note place="margin">Act. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Hee was meeke,
mild;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 9. 56.</note> 
                  <hi>went about doing good, would not breake the bruiſed Reed, nor
quench the ſmoaking Flax.</hi> When his Diſciples requeſted of him
to command fire from heaven to deſtroy thoſe that would not
receive him, he rebukes them ſaying, <hi>The Sonne of man is not come
to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them;</hi> marke the reaſon, he would
not deſtroy,<note place="margin">Joh. 12. 47.</note> becauſe he came to ſave. So againe, <hi>If any heare my
words, and beleeve not, I judge him not;</hi> conſider the reaſon, for
ſaith he, <hi>I came not to judge the world, but to ſave the world.</hi> You
ſee then, he cannot judge or deſtroy as Jeſus; ſalvation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
are contrary.</p>
               <p>If any object, that this was in the time of his humiliation, but
he ſhall come otherwiſe to judgement; I anſwer, the ſenſe of the
Name can never be altered, God cannot deny his word; If at any
time ſalvation be oppoſed to deſtruction or judgement it is ever
ſo. The name Jeſus therefore being an humble, &amp; lowly name (as
you confeſſe) and a ſaving name, cannot be the Name in which
he ſhall come as univerſall Judge; but that muſt be a Name of
power and authority over all as I have proved.</p>
               <p>But might I grant, as I will not, that Jeſus is a confounding
Name to ſome, yet it cannot be a confounding Name to thoſe
nations that never knew him, for theſe never offended him in
this name; His Spirit of illumination, they never reſiſted, His
Goſpel they never rejected, His precious blood they never
trode under their feete. Chriſt is an upright Judge, and ſhall
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:112196:21"/>
come <hi>to recompence every one according to his workes:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 26.</note> Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it would bee injuſtice in Chriſt, (which were blaſphemy
once to thinke) if he ſhould deſtroy them as Jeſus, againſt whom
as Jeſus they never offended. This is contrary to <hi>Rom. 2. 12. They
that ſinne without Law, ſhall perish without Law,</hi> Chriſt ſhall judge
them indeed as <hi>Jehovah,</hi> for the breach of the <hi>Law of nature,</hi>
which he hath written in their hearts, but not as Jeſus, for ſo
they never offended him.<note place="margin">De 369. Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him, l. c. 3. 3 p. 437.</note> I will bring your owne witneſſe <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi>
againſt you, <hi>Cauſa <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nica;</hi> 
                  <q>The onely cauſe why the
creature boweth knees to God is not becauſe he is Judge, or
Mediatour, but onely becauſe he is Jehovah, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
from, <hi>Deut. 6. 13. Iſa. 45. 23. Rom.</hi> 14. 11.</q> Now let us
briefely ſumme up all: you have not proved by any cleare Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that Jeſus ſhall be named at the day of judgement; if you
could, it would not follow thence, that bowing ſhall bee at the
mention of that name. You cannot prove that <hi>In the name</hi> doth
any where ſignifie <hi>at the mention of the Name.</hi> Sundry Scriptures
you have wickedly falſified for it, as I have proved Sect. 4. If
you could prove it from ſome Scriptures, yet ſeeing this phraſe
is often uſed, and hath other meaning in other Scriptures, yet
there will be a juſt doubt, whether it be ſo meant in this place
or no. Then thoſe that ſhall ſtand to bee judged at that day,
whom you damne to hell for not performing it now, ſhall
have juſt cauſe to plead againſt Chriſt in this manner; Lord in
all thy other Commandements thou deliveredſt thy will plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unto me, but here in this Text thou haſt delivered it in ſuch
words as are not agreeable in ſenſe to any part of thy word elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where;
or ſo as I could not underſtand thy meaning, whether
it were according to thy will, or no; ſo that becauſe I might
juſtly doubt it, I could not practiſe it without ſinning againſt
thee; and how derogatory will this be to Chriſts honour that
the judged ſhall have juſt cauſe of exception againſt the Judge?
Again, it is againſt the Scripture to hold that he ſhall confound
any in the ſenſe of the name Ieſus. It ſignifyeth a Saviour, and
ſo Angels, Devils, and Reprobates cannot bow to him; It is
againſt the Scriptures to hold that hee ſhall confound any as
Ieſus, againſt whom as Ieſus they never ſinned.</p>
               <p>Therefore Maſter <hi>Barton</hi> you have ſhewed your ſelfe a <hi>Maſter
Schiſmatique</hi> in delivering an opinion that was never knowne
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:112196:21"/>
in the Chriſtian world, till you uttered it, making it a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
point of faith, threatning the neglect of the practiſe of it
with eternall damnation, which you cannot prove by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
but is contrary to the Scriptures. Therefore you make
your ſelfe a very Antichriſt in creating new points of faith, and
making Lawes to binde the conſcience;<note place="margin">Matth. 23. 8. 10.</note> and therefore
without repentance,<note place="margin">Jam. 4 1.</note> your ſelfe are liable to damnation. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes

               </p>
               <p>But you hold another <hi>Crotchet</hi> as ridiculous as this,<note place="margin">

                     </gap> p. 62. 63.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> that
the name Ieſus ſhall to all eternitie be bowed to after the day of
judgement. This you would faine prove from, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 4. where
it is ſaid, <hi>that the Saints ſhall ſee Chriſts face, and his name written
on their foreheads,</hi> and then you ſay, wee ſhall ſee it alwayes,
heare it alwayes; but I pray what ſhew of Text can you bring
that it ſhall be alwayes heard? it ſeemes now you make it indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
to bow to the name ſcene as wel as heard, but you are beſides
the Text. The beſt expoſitors hold that it doth not concerne hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Thus ſaith Maſter <hi>Brightman</hi> on that place,<q> they ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
a clearer viſion than before,<note place="margin">Zach. 14. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

they ſhall enjoy in heaven;</q> and he applyeth the propheſie of
<hi>Zachary</hi> to theſe times.</p>
               <p>But grant that it ſhould bee referred to heaven, yet firſt, It
cannot concerne the ſtate of glory after the day of judgement,
but before; for Chriſts comming is mentioned after in the 12.
Verſe of this Chapter. Secondly, it is abſurd to take it literally:
If it ſhould be ſo, it denotes the name Ieſus no more than any
other name, and there is nothing conſequent that any bowing
ſhall be to it: but it is not ſo. Thus ſaith Maſter <hi>Brightman</hi> on
that parallel place, <hi>Rev. 1. 14. You may obſerve that this is no ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
ſigning.</hi> Bowing is ſubjection, and Ieſus is the name of our
Mediator: this Doctrine will make Chriſt Mediator for ever,
contrary to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24. for if we muſt bow to him in heaven
by the name of his Mediatorſhip, we muſt bow alſo by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of his Mediatorſhip: and ſo the Saints ſhall never be in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

ſhall the devils and damned bow after the day of judgement at
this name, (for if the Saints muſt, they muſt alſo) except you
will grant that the name Ieſus ſhall be alſo written upon their
foreheads? None ever in this point exceeded ſo farre in <hi>blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>
and <hi>abſurditie</hi> as you have done.</p>
               <p>You gave a childiſh anſwer to my third Reaſon, for if it bee
no more than corporall bowing at a Name, a childe can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
the like to his father; and ſo Chriſt ſhould have a weake
kingdome. As for Biſhop <hi>Andrewes,</hi> I am not the firſt that have
ſo taken him, as I have ſet downe, and he is plainely ſo to bee
taken, (otherwiſe there will be no ſenſe in the words) and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken, the conſequences that I have noted will directly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p>Though names be <hi>metaphoricall Images,</hi> yet they repreſent the
<hi>Perſon</hi> to our underſtanding as well as true <hi>Images,</hi> and I ſuppoſe
that if a Iew ſhould ſee you bow to the Name <hi>Jehovah</hi> written
upon a wall (for writing you make all one with mentioning, as
before, and there is no cauſe why you ſhould doe otherwiſe by
your interpretation) that he would fling a ſtone in your face;
and I perſwade me, that if a ſubject ſhould bow to the Kings
Name or picture before his face, hee would defie him; and
though we are bound to confeſſe Chriſt according to his word,
yet are we no where commanded to adore a bare Name; which
to doe before Chriſts face, I ſay againe, is worſe then Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.</p>
               <p>For the two Arguments in the concluſion; for the firſt of
them, the minor which you except againſt, hath beene proved,

you underſtood <hi>a trueneſſe</hi> of <hi>worſhip,</hi> and not every way an <hi>equall

table, when our maine diſpute was about the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. In
my reply I have not changed the principle, but you have runne
your ſelfe into a <hi>contradiction;</hi> for whereas you hold it indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
to bow at any name of the <hi>Trinity</hi> if wee pleaſe; then you
preſently ſay that our not bowing at the name of the Father,
nor at the name of the Sonne, nor at the Name of the Holy
Ghoſt, but at the name of Ieſus, ſhewes that they being three
one to another, but one in themſelves, and that our ſalvation
was wrought <hi>equally</hi> by them three, onely terminated in the Son;
for by giving toleration above ſpecified you overthrow this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative
end which you ſet downe, and this reaſon is but a
Phantaſie of your braine without proofe.</p>
               <p>Whereas in my reply to the ſecond anſwer, I affirme that you
cannot perſonally bow to <hi>all the perſons</hi> at the name Ieſus: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the diſtinct names of any one perſon doe not perſonally
denominate the other perſons; and therefore if you ſay, that
you bow perſonally to every perſon at the Name Ieſus, you
confound the perſons. You tell me that a <hi>father</hi> is a <hi>father</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in reſpect of his <hi>ſonne,</hi> and ſo is a <hi>ſonne</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:112196:24"/>
but yet though a father hath reference to the ſonne, and a
ſonne to the father, yet is not one the other, and what is done
to the one, is not done perſonally to the other; as if you bow
to the <hi>King</hi> you doe not by the ſame act bow to the <hi>Prince.</hi> And
when I ſay, I beleeve in God the Father, I profeſſe my faith in
the Sonne eſſentially, and ſo I doe in the Father, when I
ſay I beleeve in God the Sonne. In that you ſay that I
am a Triformian, for affirming that every perſon is in one
Divine eſſence,<note place="margin">Catech. p. 155.</note> is but one of <hi>Thomas Bartons</hi> bald Crot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chets,
for hereby I acknowledge but one divine eſſence to all the
Perſons. Divines doe ordinarily ſay ſo. As <hi>

And I muſt tell you Sir, in that you ſay that every <hi>perſon</hi>
is honoured alike <hi>perſonally,</hi> at the name Jeſus you overthrow
the Text of <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9. for as <hi>the Name there above every Name</hi> (as it
is evident) is proper onely to the <hi>ſecond perſon,</hi> becauſe he is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Mediatour</hi> and <hi>ſolely incarnate,</hi> ſo the bowing in the Text is
due to him alone diſtinctly, and <hi>perſonally;</hi> for by the ſame reaſon
if we muſt bow to the <hi>Son</hi> together with the <hi>Father,</hi> and the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt</hi> perſonally by this Text, it will follow that they were
incarnate, and mediators, and ſhall come to judgement as well
as the ſecond <hi>perſon.</hi> To conclude, this anſwer doth fully over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
that place of <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 23. for out of queſtion <hi>our Saviour</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
there a <hi>diſtinction of perſons,</hi> and ſo a diſtinction of the <hi>Sonnes
honour,</hi> elſe he ſhould have ſpoken <hi>obſcurely</hi> and to no purpoſe: for
if there be not a <hi>diſtinction of worſhip</hi> there required, but that
the <hi>Perſon of the Father</hi> muſt be neceſſarily honoured in the <hi>perſon
of the Sonne</hi> without diſtinction; then there can be no <hi>compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
made betweene the <hi>honour</hi> of the one and the other, and ſo
our Saviour ſhould confound his owne rule; for it could not
be knowne whether the Sonne be honoured as the Father is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,
or no.</p>
               <p>For my two Arguments in the end, which you call <hi>Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmes</hi>
(though I note neither major, minor, nor concluſion,
neither is any bound to reaſon alwayes from direct Syllogiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes)
the one is drawne from the <hi>Premiſes,</hi> in which you ſay
there are 4. <hi>Termini</hi> (whereby you wrong me, but indeed <hi>your

I make two oppoſite inferences in the ſame for brevities

taken from the <hi>eſſence,</hi> which to pleaſe you ſhall be this <hi>Syllogiſme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Every honour of the Sonne equall to the honour of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is ſo to honour the Sonne in the Father as the Father is
honoured in the Sonne.</p>
               <p>But to honour the Father by bowing at the name of the Son,
and not to honour the Son by bowing at the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is not ſo to honour the Son in the Father, as the Father is
honoured in the Sonne. <hi>Ergo,</hi> This honour is not an equall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>

               <p>No unjuſt or cruell command is Gods command. But to command all
creatures to bow at the name Jeſus is a cruell and unjuſt command.

               <p>Every command that enjoynes that to be done by any that have no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Firſt, you make an objection which I told you I meant

               </p>
               <p>Many things here babled have beene anſwered before, which
I now pretermit for brevities ſake.</p>
               <p>To my queſtion, how <hi>divels,</hi> and <hi>damned ſoules</hi> ſhall bow at
the name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> you ſhuffle in your anſwer moſt pitifully, firſt
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:112196:25"/>
you ſay, <hi>Devills</hi> ſhall bow, as they confeſſe: Though they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him Ieſus, yet you prove not that they then made a court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.
I acknowledge the Devills ſhall tremble; yet that trembling
is not that kind of bowing you underſtand here; for you make
it an act of Religion, or at leaſt a religious ceremony. But you
ſay they ſhall tremble moſt of all at the Name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> wherein
they are conquered: but what meane you by <hi>wherein</hi> here? if you
meane <hi>whereby</hi> as a <hi>cauſe,</hi> as you muſt ſo meane, elſe it is <hi>nonſenſe,</hi>
then you make the <hi>literall name</hi> to <hi>conquer</hi> them, which is <hi>Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>
and <hi>Idolatry.</hi> No marvaile if ſuch as you be, put all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in bowing at the name Jeſus, ſeeing you thinke to conquer
the Devils by it. Sir, you call this name an hony name, an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
name, a poore name, Pag. 2. Sect. 2. how ſhall they tremble
rather at this ſweet name, this humble name, then at the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and terrible Name Jehovah? It cannot ſinke into the braines
of them that have but common reaſon to conceive it. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Devils be fooles as long as they have liberty to walke too,
and fro, if ever they come to Church; for in thinking to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
others they confound themſelves; for if once they heare
<hi>Jeſus</hi> named they muſt fall flat upon their faces for feare, as
you ſay, which confuſion they might avoyd if they come not
at <hi>devotions;</hi> for if they doe, then woe be to them. And then
they might alwayes avoyd trembling; for themſelves need not
name <hi>Jeſus</hi> except they will at any time. How ſhould they bee
forced to name it? If their naming Jeſus be their torment, they
are mad, if they torment themſelves when they may chooſe For
my inſtance in <hi>damned ſoules,</hi> how they ſhould bow at the Name
Jeſus in <hi>Hell,</hi> ſeeing there is no <hi>divine ſervice in Hell;</hi> and theſe
men hold that it is not neceſſary for any of us, but at ſuch a
time; we may ſay they, if we will, bow at other times, but then
we muſt, becauſe the Church commands it; and ſeeing there
is nothing in hell but blaſphemy, and theſe hold that when
men ſweare by Jeſus, which is nothing ſo bad as the <hi>Damned
blaſpheming;</hi> it is no ſeaſon to bow, you here cannot tell how
to anſwer, but are intangled in the briars; and therefore cry
out of blaſphemy: but Sir, it is plaine blaſphemy in you, as
will be proved: but at length you ſay that bowing and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
will conſiſt. They ſhall blaſpheme, ſay you, becauſe they
cannot chooſe but bow; what prepoſterous foppery is here? On
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:112196:25"/>
earth you bow, becauſe you mention Jeſus; in hell they ſhall
blaſpheme, becauſe they ſhall bow: ſo it ſeemes that bowing
ſhall cauſe the blaſphemy; but I wot, Sir, that they ſhall blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme
by the name; they muſt firſt then blaſpheme, how elſe
ſhall they bow? Their bowing you make to bee their horrour,
and trembling, in lying flat on their faces, and crouching
downe under the name Jeſus, as you doe the Devils: if this bee
ſo, then ſurely they may eſcape torment if they will. If the
name Jeſus torment them, it muſt bee by mentioning, for ſo
you underſtand the Text: but what need they mention it? If
they doe not mention it <hi>alwayes,</hi> which were abſurditie to grant,
then are they not <hi>tormented alwayes;</hi> and if they be not compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to mention it alwayes, they bee <hi>never compelled to doe it;</hi> if
they be not compelled to it, what neede they doe it? and if they
neede not doe it, what need they be <hi>tormented;</hi> ſeeing they bee
tormented at the Name, as theſe men ſay? Yea if they ſhould
mention the name never ſo oft by blaſphemy, in hell, how
ſhould they <hi>fulfill the Text,</hi> ſeeing theſe men hold it not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for us to fulfill the Text, but at publique devotion on the
Lords dayes, though we may, ſay they, at other devotions? See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then the damned are not bound to Lords dayes, and have
no publike devotions, how ſhall they fulfill the Text, and then
how ſhall they be damned, ſeeing their fulfilling the Text is by
their damnation? Happy damned, if this Doctrine were true:
The Pope was wont to deliver the ſoules out of purgatory for
mony, but theſe will deliver the damned out of hell for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>

               </p>
               <p>It is not <hi>worth</hi> a reply, it comes not neere the <hi>matter;</hi> you have
anſwered nothing to the <hi>inſtance;</hi> that every command in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
limited to a time binds ordinarily to that time; you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
produce any exception; and then if this be a command to
bow at the Name of Jeſus, it muſt be a command to binde when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
it ſounds: and it is not in the Power of all the world to
alter, diminiſh, or limit any of Gods unlimited commands;
therefore I ſay that your rule of affirmative precepts cannot hold
in this place. And this here is not anſwered, Sect. 5. as you ſay.
Doctor <hi>Page</hi> his inſtance of Prayer, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. is taken indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely,
Pray continually, <hi>i. e.</hi> every day, or at every occaſion: but
as you underſtand this Text, the determinate time preſent is ſet
downe when to bow, but you ſay it is to bee done at times of
confeſſing, which is in time of Divine Service. But I hope Sir,
that Devils and damned in hell doe not obſerve times of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
nor divine ſervice, which bow as well as we. But Sir, as
you expound the Text, <hi>confeſſion</hi> doth not regulate the <hi>time of
bowing,</hi> for <hi>the name Jeſus doth that,</hi> and alſo the time of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
for bowing and confeſſion are connected by a conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
copulative, and the ſeaſon of bowing and confeſſion both
are ſet downe to be at the mentioning of the Name Jeſus, ſo that
it will follow if this <hi>interpretation</hi> bee true, whenſoever Jeſus is

               <p>The <hi>damned</hi> would thanke you, if when they heare their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes

meanes you make the <hi>Devills</hi> to reprove ſinne, and the <hi>damned</hi>
rebuke their fellowes when they blaſpheme. But how doe you
anſwer my inſtance of the third Commmandement? for that

might as well have put in the ſecond Table too, and then it

Chriſt Glory, for it attributes to him a Name diſtinct from
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:112196:27"/>
                  <hi>power</hi> and <hi>Authority.</hi> Firſt, you deny that <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 21. is a paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel

who do parallel them together; and that <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 48. in the type is
alſo parallel to this place &amp; Text, I appeale to any that are <hi>judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi>
and you have not diſproved it but by your deniall. Becauſe
I expound Name for <hi>univerſall dominion,</hi> you tell me, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
takes me <hi>but dominion and dignitie, but it is a name of mercy
that God moſt delighteth in, if we will have ſalvation, ſay you. Power
muſt be powred forth in mercy;</hi> But what is all this to this Text?
any thing ſhall take me agreeable with it, but the fantaſie of
your braine ſhall not take me: you calling Name in this Text
a name of mercy, you apply it to the elect onely; but the name
here concernes the Devils and reprobates alſo, your ſelfe being
Judge. Therefore, if you will have this name in it ſelfe to bee
a Name of mercy, you muſt make Chriſt to ſhew mercy to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
and Reprobates, or elſe you muſt deny that they bow. This
I ſay, the Name in the Text is a name of <hi>ſupreame authoritie</hi> over
all, denoting Chriſt to be King of Kings, and Lord of Lords;
but you affirme that the Name Jeſus doth include theſe and all
other <hi>glorious titles.</hi> See how wayward you be; before, all the
ſtirre was about <hi>ſignification,</hi> and now you talke of <hi>incluſion:</hi>
but I deny that the name Jeſus as a Name, being as you call it, <hi>a
Name of povertie and humilitie,</hi> and communicated to others, doth
properly include in it the name King of Kings; why according
to my ſtating the queſtion, which I have proved to bee accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Text, and other correſpondent Scriptures, you
ſhould lay to my charge, <hi>that I goe about to make the world beleeve
that Chriſt redeemed us by a powerfull hand, but not by price, and that
Chriſts ſufferings were to confirme his Doctrine, and not to ſanctifie us
by his blood,</hi> I know not, except you meane this Text concerneth
Chriſts redeeming us by his blood, and then, as I ſaid, you
muſt make Chriſt to redeeme the Devils, and then by your <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>
you muſt make Chriſt to ſuffer againe, and redeeme us
when he comes in his moſt <hi>glorious kingdome:</hi> and ſo whereas you
ſay I looke like a <hi>Socinian,</hi> certaine I am you looke more
like <hi>an Antichriſtian.</hi> To my ſecond reaſon you confeſſe
Chriſt Lord of every creature: and thus you contradict
your ſelfe: for ſo the ſubjection muſt bee of every creature,
here implyed by bowing the knee. Seeing then many <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:112196:27"/>
cannot doe their dutie as you underſtand the Text, in this
ſenſe he cannot be Lord of every <hi>creature.</hi> The reſidue is anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
abundantly before.</p>
               <p>To my third reaſon I have ſhewed at large, Sect. 3. that you
underſtanding the Text <hi>literally</hi> cannot underſtand it <hi>figuratively:</hi>
For my part I deny not the <hi>knee,</hi> but I grant it not in a literall
way, and ſhall yeeld it according to the <hi>true meaning of the Text,</hi>
but not according to your <hi>fancy;</hi> but here you contradict your
ſelfe, for you will have <hi>knees</hi> and <hi>hearts</hi> bow together, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you underſtand the Text figuratively: And ſeeing you joyne
them together at the Name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> why did you ſever them in
conference with me, whether you gave the heart or no I cannot
tell, ſure I am, you did not give the knee; if you did give the
heart, by your doctrine you ſhould have given the knee, if the
inward bowing were then neceſſary, why not the outward?
Dr. <hi>Page</hi> making this bowing a ceremony diſtinct from a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall
dutie, I affirme makes it but a poore honour, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
to Chriſt after his great ſufferings; and if it bee a
ceremony to us, it is a ceremony to all other creatures, which
you deny, the ſame being injoyned to all. And if, as you ſay,
many creatures come not within compaſſe of <hi>Religious worſhip,</hi>
it is plaine <hi>Religious worſhip</hi> is not ſimply here injoyned; But if
you give the ceremonies, and not the ſubſtance, it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
Religious worſhip; And ſo this bowing is but a mocking
of Chriſt; and if it be ceremony to us and not to other <hi>creatures,</hi>
as you affirmed; I pray, what is it to <hi>Devils</hi> and <hi>Reprobates?</hi> if it
be not a <hi>ceremony</hi> to them it is <hi>ſubſtantiall,</hi> it muſt be one of them,
and what will follow hence? Thoſe to whom Chriſt is a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer</hi>
muſt performe the ſubſtance; and you that ſay you bow,
becauſe of <hi>ſalvation,</hi> give but a ceremony. You be thankefull pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
indeed for ſuch a great mercy, that the Devils ſhall doe more
for <hi>Damnation,</hi> then you for <hi>ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To my fourth reaſon, whereas I ſay, the Text truely under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
enjoyns the bowing to <hi>all times and places,</hi> continually, but
the other makes it to be done but one day of the weeke ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily;
and then alſo but now and then. In your anſwer there is
a manifeſt contradiction, for firſt you ſay, <hi>The Text enjoynes it not
to all times and places,</hi> which indeed is no better then blaſphemy,
and then you preſently ſay <hi>the whole man ought ever to ſubmit to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:112196:28"/>
Chriſt:</hi> how can this agree together? For if this continuall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
be grounded upon the Text, then I pray, how doe you
limit it the mention of the name Jeſus, when alſo no mention
of the Name doth binde you to bow, but on Lords dayes? I
would faine know of you whether <hi>Devils</hi> by the Text be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
ſubject to Chriſt, or onely then when Jeſus is named. If
their <hi>ſubjection</hi> be alwayes to be done; then it is falſe to tie it
to the name onely. If at the name onely, as it muſt be ſo, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you apply it ſo to us, ſee then what will <hi>neceſſarily follow.</hi> If
the <hi>Devils</hi> be not alwayes ſubject to Chriſt by this Text, then
hath not Chriſt <hi>Authoritie and power</hi> over them <hi>continually;</hi> for
Chriſts authoritie, and the Creatures ſubjection are relatives.
It will follow then that ſo long as they be not ſubject, they bee
Lords. There is but one Lord, and Chriſt is hee; but Satan
ſtrives to be Lord, and certainely, if Chriſt ſhould ever ceaſe to
be Lord, <hi>Satan</hi> gaines it; and as long as he is not in <hi>ſubjection</hi>
he is <hi>Lord:</hi> hee muſt be Lord or in ſubjection, he cannot be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all, and in no relation; ſee then the whole conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of this Doctrine; the Devill ſhall be Lord all the weeke,
and he ſhall not need to bow but the <hi>Lords dayes,</hi> for then one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we are bound to bow ſay they, (except they will have the
devils to doe more ſervice then wee) but wee need not then till
Jeſus be named. So it followes that <hi>Satan</hi> ſhall be Lord all our
time, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhal be Lord but two or three minutes in a week,
is not this ſound Doctrine? and then the <hi>Devils</hi> muſt be tied to
come to Church; for if they be not tied they are <hi>fooles</hi> to come
thither; to be ſubject with horrour, when they might bee at
their owne <hi>libertie;</hi> or elſe they muſt ſet up a Church of their
owne, and chooſe a <hi>Prieſt</hi> to ſay <hi>Service;</hi> or elſe upon
theſe mens grounds how ſhall they ever be ſubject at all? For if
the dutie of the <hi>Text,</hi> as theſe men ſay, be not ſeaſonable but in
times of <hi>devotion,</hi> then are not <hi>Devils</hi> capable of <hi>ſubjection</hi> at all,
except they will make them <hi>religious</hi> and <hi>devout;</hi> well then, if
the Devils muſt bow, but when theſe men doe; it will follow
that when <hi>Satan</hi> is not over-ruled he will rule; when he is not in
ſubjection, hee will command; no marvaile then if theſe men
generally live ſuch <hi>ſcandalous lives,</hi> for would not you have
their lives agree with their doctrine? They teach it, they make
Satan <hi>Lord</hi> over them, to rule them all the weeke; but Chriſt
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:112196:28"/>
ſhall be their Lord but two or three minutes on the Lords day;
yea they teach this doctrine in reſpect of <hi>themſelves,</hi> for if the

indeed ſhould be a <hi>proper King</hi> by this Doctrine to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of his <hi>ſubjects</hi> a fit or two on the <hi>Lords day,</hi> and all their

be told that theſe cringers goe to heaven, and the other to hell,
would chooſe to goe to hell with theſe, then to heaven with
thoſe cringers.</p>
               <p>That none ſhould write againſt your opinion till <hi>T. C.</hi> I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

ſay that <hi>Jeſus is the Name of the three Perſons, and ſo by bowing at
this Name they honour all alike;</hi> that if Jeſus be the Name of the
<hi>three Perſons,</hi> then cannot it be the Name above every Name in the
Text as they ſay, becauſe that name is onely proper to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Perſon; becauſe he onely was incarnate, and Mediator,
and God gave him that name after his humiliation. You not
knowing how to ſhuffle up a faire anſwer, in a ſcurrilous way,
lay <hi>Arianiſme</hi> to my charge, and tell me that I am put to a ſhift,
and that pitifully, becauſe ſay you by this reply I ſhake downe
my owne pillar, Part 1. Sect. 1. for ſo I muſt deny (you ſay)
what I there affirmed, that ſupereminent power and glory is
the Name above every Name, becauſe the three Perſons have
ſupereminent power and glory, or elſe I muſt affirme that the
Name Jeſus is proper to the ſecond Perſon by diſpenſation, as
alſo <hi>in my owne Tenet,</hi> ſupereminent power and glory. But Sir
it is you that ſhift and not I, for ſupereminent power and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which is eſſentiall and ſo common to every perſon in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
is not here the Name above every Name, but that ſupere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
power and glory, which is the advancement, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Chriſt Mediator, God and Man. It is impoſſible that
the eſſentiall Name of God can be made proper, unleſſe the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
it ſelfe be made proper. Therefore your conceit of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie
by diſpenſation is frivolous. If the Name Jeſus bee (as
you ſay) eſſentiall, it cannot be proper to the ſecond Perſon; and
if proper, it cannot be eſſentiall. The Name above every Name,
which I have proved is ſupereminent power and glory, is given
to Chriſt as Mediatour, and therefore it is not eſſentiall in him
as a Perſon of the Trinitie; therefore my pillar ſtands as firme
as ever it did, and you ſhew your ſelfe but a trifler in this

Gods eſſentiall glory, is a preferring our ſalvation above Gods

nothing? Is God to us ſomething, and God in his glorious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

               <p>Againe you impudently wrong mee, in laying to my charge
that I make Ieſus and Iehovah not the ſame God, it is your

diſtinguiſh the names, (which you here confound for your owne

what he is in himſelfe; therefore to worſhip him as Ieſus, and
not as Iehovah,<note place="margin">See Sect. 3.</note> is abominable. There is nothing elſe worth

               <p>HEre I ſay that Doctor <hi>Page</hi> his reaſon is not good, that
we ſhould bow at the Name Jeſus, becauſe above all other
Names it minds us of Chriſts death. Firſt, I denyed the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
affirming that many called <hi>God their Saviour</hi> in the old
Teſtament, yet few ſuppoſed that God ſhould die, but you ſay
very few, which I ſay not, I deny not that it was knowne, but
it was not commonly and clearely knowne, as appeares by
Chriſts Diſciples, who though they called him Jeſus, yet would
hardly be perſwaded that redemption ſhould bee by his blood,
though they were often told of it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 9. Therefore <hi>Jeſus</hi> is
not the chiefeſt name ſignifying <hi>death;</hi> but the Name <hi>Chriſt</hi> is
rather, becauſe it denotes him to be a Prieſt, and ſuch a Prieſt,
that did alſo ſhed his owne blood, and therefore I ſay againe,
God could have beene a <hi>Jeſus</hi> if he had would, without becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
a Prieſt, he could not indeed, becauſe hee would not, but
he never could have beene a Prieſt unleſſe hee had beene a Jeſus.
You have not overthrowne the conſequent, for firſt, how have
you proved by the Scriptures that the Name of Chriſts death
is the Name of his Glory? Secondly, I goe not againſt the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Text, when I ſay the Name above every Name leades
us to Chriſts <hi>glory,</hi> and not to his <hi>ſufferings.</hi> I deny not that
<hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Text</hi> proceeds from humility to glory, yet is it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
to confound Chriſts humiliation with his exaltation;
and the Name of the one with the Name of the other;
<hi>The Name Jeſus lookes to hell ſaith Doctor Page,</hi> but we muſt looke
for Chriſt in heaven. Thirdly, neither have I changed the
<hi>Queſtion,</hi> but it is you rather; for doe you bow onely to the
Name, becauſe you ſay (but prove it not) that it is a ſuffering
Name? doe you not bow alſo to the ſenſe of the Name, becauſe
it ſignifieth <hi>ſalvation by dying?</hi> This you ſtand upon continually,

               <p>HEre I affirme, <hi>that it is no good reaſon to bow at the Name Jeſus
becauſe the fulneſſe of the God-head dwells in Chriſt bodily,
Col.</hi> 2. 9. That which you reply to the deniall of the conſequence
is nothing, but what hath been ſufficiently cleared before. And
that which you alleadge from <hi>Tertullian</hi> is againſt you. For if the
Names <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> do one of them imply the other, why
doe you make ſuch a difference? though it be your direct opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by the humanity to climbe up to the glorious Trinitie, which
I deny not; yet this will not prove the conſequence: and I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
beleeve, that God will accept our worſhip in, and by the
Name Chriſt, as well as Jeſus; I ſay it is no Reaſon to affirme
that we ſhould bow at the Name Jeſus rather than Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſome ſay, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the Name of the <hi>Perſon,</hi> Chriſt of
the <hi>office,</hi> becauſe Chriſt by his office brings us the Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeſus</hi> doth denote his office as well as his Perſon, though
more ſummarily his office; Chriſt denotes his Perſon as well as
his office, though more clearely his office then the Name Jeſus
doth; yea it denotes his perſon more properly and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
then the name Jeſus, which denotes ſome body elſe, but Chriſt
none but he. There is nothing elſe worth anſwering, onely
this I ſtand ſtill to juſtifie, that upon the foregoing reaſon if we
muſt bow to the Father at the mention of the Name Jeſus onely,
we muſt as well pray to the Father by mentioning of that Name
onely; neither have you diſproved it, for though Prayer bee
one dutie and bowing another, yet are they both parts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and lip-prayer is no more ſubſtantiall than outward bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the excellency of both is in the heart.</p>
               <p>For the concluſive Argument, the heads are but barely denyed
without proofe, and what I affirmed is ſufficiently juſtified in
the premiſes, and confirmed in this reply, and ſo I leave it.
But Sir I muſt tell you, that whereas you lay to my charge
