            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The firſt reaſon which the Apoſtle
<pb facs="tcp:7816:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
here in this text vſeth to perſwade vs to liue vprighly &amp; to forſake ſinne, and wickednes, is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> circumſtaunce of the time, the wordes be theſe: And that coſidering the ſeaſon, it is nowe time for vs to awake out of ſléepe. In which verſe he telleth vs that it is now high time for vs to amend our liues, and to ſerue God, eſpecially becauſe good oportunitie ſerueth therevnto, and ſomuch the rather bycaſue the cloudes of ignorau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, vnbeléefe, and wicked luſtes, are now driuen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from vs by the light of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and knowledge of gods truth, and therefore it behoueth vs ſo to order our liues as they which haue y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> light, and which are ſtill conuerſaunt in the open ſight &amp; eies of all men.

<pb facs="tcp:7816:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhall bée eſpyed and haue many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes ready to accuſe them, of theyr ſinne and iniquitie. So in like maner, it behoueth vs (who liue in the ſighte of God and his angels, hauing Chriſte the true ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of rightuouſneſſe, a vew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and beholder of all our dooings, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding vs to walke as before him) to take aduiſed héede, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> we doo nothing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> may offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his diuine maieſty, bicaſe if we ſo doo, we ſhall haue Chriſt himſelf a witnes againſt vs, who ſhall iudge in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt day, &amp; pronounce ſentene vpon all fleſh, acording to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tenour of iuſtice and equitye. But it appereth that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the talke that is here vſed, is not plaine, but <hi>Metaphoricall.</hi> For the Apoſtle maketh mencion of ſléepe, of waking, of night, of darkenes, of lyght, of day. And therefore before I procéede any further in the text. I thinke it méete and conuenient to declare vnto you, what is ment, by euery one of theſe wordes, to the ende that, that which I am about to teach, may bée more manifeſt and playne to you that be my hearers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7816:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>Know ye therefore that by ſléepe, hée meaneth ſinne, and a certen ſluggiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and drowſines to imbrace the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, to heare gods word, and to frame and faſhion our liues ther after. By awaking out of ſléepe, hée meaneth a certen deſire and readines to doe our duties, and ſuch things as God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of vs in his worde.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ariſtole</hi> therfore doth very well and truely cal waking a liberty or fréedom of the ſences, and hée calleth ſléepe a bande or impryſoninge of them. For when a man is a ſléepe, he hath all his ſences, ſo tyed vp &amp; impriſoned, that he hath neither eyes to ſée, eares to heare, noſe to ſmell, handes to touche, féete to goe, nor hart to conceyue, but is like vnto a deade corps that lyeth rottinge in the graue: But when a man is a wake, then is hée ready y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſée, to heare, to ſpeake, to run, to goe, or to doe any thing belonging to a reaſonable creature. Therefore the Apoſtle ſayth it is now time for vs to awake out of ſléepe, as though hée ſhould haue ſayd before our regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:7816:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
before god had geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs eies te ſe, and harts to beleue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth, we were faſt a ſleepe in ſinne, and did lye in the ſhadowe of death, and there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in vs but horrible blindnes, ſo that we could not ſee y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maieſty of god, we did not féele and faſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mercies of god offered to vs in Chriſt his deare and welbeloued ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, neither had we learned how ſwéete y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lorde is. Our eares were ſo ſtopped y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> we could not harken vnto the ſwéete voyce of God, and glad tidinges of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued nothing at all of the goodnes of God towards vs, neither yet were we moued to any worke of charitye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our neighbour but were vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye vnapt &amp; altogether vnable to doo any good worke, yea not ſo much, ſo much as to thinke a good thought. But now ſeinge it hath pleaſed the lord to pittye our miſery, to awake vs out of this deadlye &amp; daungerous ſleepe of ſinne, to ſend his worde amongeſt vs, and by it through the working of his ſpirit to create fayth in vs, it is very méete and alſo right nedefull that we

            <p>The longer we liue, and the nearer that we approch to death, the more earneſt we ought to be to ſerue God, and the longer that we haue hard the Goſpel, and beleued in Chriſt, ſo much the more earneſt wée ought to be to obey the Goſpell.

            <p>But alas we haue gonne to ſchole not ſeuen yeares, but eighttene yeares, we haue had many notable Schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters and teachers, and yet for all this wée be little amended, but like very blockheades we tary ſtyll in our ould leſſons, and will not take forth into good manners and newe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

And we go rather back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward then forward.</p>
            <p>And what a reproche, and ſhame is it for vs, to be more ſlowe, to ſerue God then we were in the beginning, conſidering we haue taſted of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye and grace, ſo longe, and ſo many yeres together, and that in ſuch ſorte,

            <p>You knowe that they which runne for a wager, that the nearer they draw to the marke, the faſter they runne, and they make the more ſpéede.</p>
            <p>So, the longer that we haue harde the Goſpel, and the longer that we haue beléeued, ſo much the holier we ought to be in life and conuerſation.</p>

            <p>But (alas) many at the firſt hearing of the Goſpell, ſhewed them ſelues zelous, and ready to folow it. But after a while they gaue ouer euen in the middeſt of their race, and waxed weary of well dooing.

            <p>But foraſmuch as it is nowe not night with vs, but day, let vs doe thoſe things that are ſéemely for them that haue the lyght, and followe the counſell of <hi>Paule,</hi> who wylleth vs to caſt away the workes of darknes, and to put on the armoure of lyght.</p>

For whoremongers, théeues, murtherers, and wicked perſons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly doo their feates in the darke, and in the night ſeaſon, and therefore ſaith <hi>Paul, Quae ab illis clam fiunt tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe eſt vell dicere,</hi> It is a ſhame euen ones to name thoſe thinges that are done of them in ſecrete.</p>
            <p>The darkenes of the night doth make them bold to commit ſinne, for they feare onely the eyes of men, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider not that the eyes of the Lord are vppon euery mans waies, &amp; that with him ther is no darkenes at al, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the night is with him as the noone daye.
<pb facs="tcp:7816:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And therefore although men commit ſinne neuer ſo cloſely, yet doth god ſée them, and at length will reauele and bring it to lyght, as he dyd the whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and there is no wall ſo thicke, that can hide them that worke wickedneſſe, from the ſight of god. Let vs therefore caſt away the workes of darkenes, and put on the armoure of light. By the armoure of light he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth good workes, bicauſe they procéede of faith, and of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of god, and ſhine before men to the honor &amp; praiſe of our good god, who worketh them in vs by his holy ſpirit. But here it may be demaunded why <hi>Paule</hi> doth call vices and ſinnes the workes of darkeneſſe, &amp; good workes the armoure of light. Truely, you knowe that our fleſh is prone ynough and inclined of it ſelf to follow naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe, and in committing ſinne we take great pleaſure, and thinke it no payne at all to doo wickedly.</p>
            <p>But if we begin ones to ſerue God, &amp; to frame our liues according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rule of his word, then muſt we ſtriue and

are they that are ſound in the way, &amp; walke in the lawe of the Lorde, by which two places it appeareth that to liue vprightly, &amp; honeſtly, is nothing els but to walke in the lawe of the Lorde. For if a man liue after hys owne ſwynge he ſhall do nothing els but wander out of the right way, and doe thoſe thinges which are neyther ſéemely nor honeſt. <hi>Paule</hi> ſettinge downe certaine preceptes concerning maners, and chriſtian life, ſaith I pray you walke worthye of the vocation<note place="margin">Ephe. 4.

For though all men doe walke, yet doe not all men walke noneſtly, and in the lawe of GOD, or daye light as they ſhould doe.

Manye there be that ſéeke to ſpoyle &amp; robbe their enimies, and ſome ther be that will ſteale from their friends, but dronkerdes, robbe their owne wiues and childrne, and are moued with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pitie and compaſſion towardes them. Here I knowe that theſe ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe knightes wil reply and ſay, that they ſpend nothinge but their owne.

            <p>God hath made the earth to bringe forth fruite, and hath made man lorde and kinge of all his creatures, but yet to vſe them, not to abuſe them.
