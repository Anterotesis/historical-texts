         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To the Reader who loveth God.</head>

            <p>CHriſt ſaith to Pilate: <hi>My Kingdome is not of this world; elſe would my
ſervants fight for it:</hi> John 18. 36. And to his Diſciples he ſaith: <hi>Behold I
ſend you as Sheep amongſt Wolves, Mat:</hi> 10. 16. To ſignifie: that where Chriſt ſhall
become manifeſt in a Man; that Man MUST in this world be ſurrounded on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with Enemies, who without ceaſing would root out, and kill, Chriſt.</p>
            <p>2. Which is the way of all true Chriſtians, for they <hi>muſt</hi> walk in this
world among the Devills Thorns; as now it is with the <hi>Name</hi> of the Author
of that deſpiſed Book, as alſo with his <hi>Perſon,</hi> that <hi>Satan</hi> raiſeth his ſtormy
winds againſt the Gifts of the Holy Spirit, and will not endure <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his
Members, as in this enimicitious <hi>Libell</hi> is to be ſeen, how enraged <hi>Satan</hi> is and
how abominably he ſlanders and reproacheth the<note n="*" place="margin">I. B.</note> Authour, and how he ſets
himſelfe as a <hi>Richter</hi> or <hi>Judge</hi> over Gods work, and would ſuppreſſe and
not it out.</p>
            <p>3. Dear Reader and Brother in Chriſt, who loveſt God; though I am an
<hi>Enemy</hi> from my <hi>heart,</hi> to ſuch accurſed, unworthy, reproachfull, contentious
writings of <hi>controverſie,</hi> not accounting thoſe divulged reproachfull wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
contrary to Chriſtian Love and Truth, worthy <hi>any anſwer at all:</hi> Yet
for the Command ſake and Love of my Lord Jeſus Chriſt, I would make an
anſwer, for <hi>their ſakes,</hi> who do not underſtand the Matter, and have not
read my little Book of <hi>True Repentance</hi> and <hi>Refignation,</hi> as <hi>the way to
Chriſt;</hi> nor know my perſon, and who only regard the reſpect and
favour, of the <hi>Primate;</hi> and ſuppoſe he reproacheth me out of Chriſtian
zeal, and doth it for the ſake of God, in reſpect of his Office or Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>4. As the <hi>moſt</hi> Part of them are thus lead aſtray, to give him applauſe, and
think, he doth right, and that it is all true which he cryeth out on in the
<hi>Pulpit;</hi> ſeeing he makes uſe of Gods Name in it, and thereby ſo cloaketh
the Matter, that Men can <hi>not</hi> ſee his fierce wrathfull Heart, and appeals to
his <hi>Office</hi> and Miniſtry, then the ſimple people which know nothing of his
dealing, how maliciouſly he perſecuteth me, and dealeth quite <hi>contrary</hi> to his
<hi>Office,</hi> and never will examine me, about it, but condemneth what himſelf
underſtandeth NOT: therefore have I made an anſwer; to try whether
any will become ſeeing and go forth from reproaching the gift of God.</p>
            <p>5. And do <hi>here with</hi> teſtifie in the preſence of God that I have anſwered
out of no other <hi>intention,</hi> then barely for the Love-ſake of our Neighbour.</p>
            <p>6. And do <hi>admoniſh</hi> the <hi>Primate,</hi> to conſider better of me,
for he hath no <hi>Lyon</hi> to deal with, but a <hi>Lamb</hi> of JESUS CHRIST; or

go forth from the <hi>wicked</hi> wayes of this world, and enter into true
<hi>Repentance,</hi> and put on Chriſt in <hi>Faith,</hi> and be new born in
Chriſts <hi>Spirit,</hi> and how he muſt be renewed in Mind and <hi>Thoughts,</hi>
and <hi>follow</hi> or imitate Chriſt.</p>
               <p>5. SECONDLY; it teacheth of True <hi>Reſignation,</hi> how a Penitent
Man, muſt give up himſelf to God wholly and altogether and begin
and finiſh all his works in <hi>divine</hi> Truſt and Confidence, and it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
moreover, how the Devill layes Snares, continually, for

and how the <hi>Entrance</hi> into it is effected.</p>
               <p>This Doctrine is the true Ground of the New
Teſtament, as Chriſt and the Apoſtles have
taught us.</p>
               <p>8. But ſeeing the <hi>Libeller</hi> ſaith, there are as many blaſphemies
againſt God, in it, as there are <hi>Lines</hi> in that Book; it is <hi>manifeſt,</hi> that he
blaſphemeth and reproacheth the Holy Spiri; in that he <hi>calleth</hi> Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
Prayer, a blaſphemy againſt God, for the book treateth
only of Repentance and of the <hi>New Birth.</hi>

               <p>9. Dear <hi>Herr Richtender Kichter, Sir, thou</hi> Judging <hi>Judge,</hi>
where will you go out, or where will you go in, when the Supream,

               </p>
               <p>10. That <hi>Richter,</hi> or <hi>Judge,</hi> will not reſpect a <hi>Primate</hi> or his
followers, which he draws after him, nor any King, Prince or Lord
of the world, according to the Authority they <hi>have had,</hi> nor their
Laws, Statutes or Inſtitutions, but will judge the LIFE; and try it in
HIS Fire.</p>
               <p>11. Where will then <hi>your reproachings</hi> and diſgracings abide,
which you have exerciſed againſt Chriſt <hi>in</hi> his Members: It is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;
<hi>he that blaſphemeth the Holy Spirit, hath no forgiveneſſe Eternally,
Math.</hi> 3. 29. What will you then Anſwer to him? you, who have
knowingly blaſphemed his Giſts, and ſo miſerably perſecuted the
Children of Chriſt? when Chriſt will ſay, <hi>What you have done to theſe the
leaſt of my brethren, you have done unto me,</hi> what Anſwer will you then
Give?</p>
               <p>12. You deſpiſe me, in that I am a<note n="*" place="margin">Lay-Man or Ideot.</note>

cry out, Fy, upon my Gifts, which yet I have received from God, as a
<hi>Noble Bounty,</hi> which alſo is more dear to me than the whole world,
and reproacheſt my Trade or <hi>Handicraft,</hi> with your crying fye upon

ſhall awaken in you in Body and Soul, and become kindled with
Gods Anger? ſo that the world will become too narrow for you?
what would you <hi>then</hi> afterwards give, that you had never done
<hi>ſuch</hi> a thing?</p>
               <p>13. The Spirit which now rejoyceth you, that you may have your

               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:57424:5"/>
14. You force Tears from me, and earneſt Prayers againſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
or blaſpheming of God, in that you blame me altogether
with <hi>untruth,</hi> have a care, that my Tears become not,<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 12. 20.</note>

               </p>
               <p>15. I have prayed much to God for you, that God would <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten</hi>
you, and give you to acknowledge the Truth, but you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
continually the <hi>worſe,</hi> I will be <hi>blameleſſe</hi> concerning you, if
Gods Anger touch you.</p>
               <p>16. Why do you deſpiſe me becauſe I am a Layick, and yet have
<hi>high Divine</hi> aud <hi>Naturall</hi> knowledge? Do you ſuppoſe the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is bound to your Schools or Univerſities? Did not our
deareſt Chriſt ſay? <hi>My Father will give the Holy Spirit to them that ask
him for it?</hi> Luke 11. 13. <hi>Alſo ask and you ſhall receive, ſeek and you ſhall
find, knock and it will be opened unto you?</hi> Matth: 7. 7.</p>
               <p>17. I have received my Gift through <hi>earneſt</hi> PRAYING and
knocking, and reliſh it ſo, that I would not give it for all the
worlds Honours and Goods, alſo can never deny or forſake it,
wherefore do you aſcribe the <hi>Gift of God</hi> to the Devill?</p>
               <p>18. Do but look back into the world, what kind of <hi>ſimple People</hi>
hath he uſed for his work? <hi>what was Abel, Seth, Enoch,</hi> and <hi>Noah?
what were the</hi> Patriarchs? <hi>Shepheards,</hi> none of them was a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor:
<hi>what was Moſes?</hi> A Shepheard: <hi>what was David?</hi> A Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard;
<hi>what were</hi> the Prophets, <hi>eſpecially Eliſha</hi> and <hi>Habbakkuk</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
ſimple people, who were Tillers of the Ground: <hi>what was Mary</hi>
the Mother of our <hi>Lord</hi> CHRIST? A poor honeſt deſtitute young
<hi>Maid: what was</hi> the Foſter-Father of Chriſt, during his child-hood? A
Carpenter: <hi>what were</hi> Chriſts Apoſtles all of them? poor ſimple
Handicrafts-men or Tradeſ-men, as Fiſher-men and the like; <hi>why did
not</hi> Chriſt reject them alſo, ſeeing they had not ſtudyed? did HE cry
fy upon them, becauſe they were Handicrafts People, as you do?</p>
               <p>19. What was <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Nobility from the Beginning?
<hi>even</hi> Humility, <hi>and the</hi> Feare of <hi>God;</hi>
where now lyeth your great boaſting in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> as alſo in <hi>Art?</hi>
ſhew me it. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was a Scribe, learned in the Scriptures, but
when he became a Chriſtian, then he muſt firſt<note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>become a Fool</hi> to his
Art and knowledg, that the <hi>divine</hi> wiſdom might find a place in him.</p>
               <p>20. Why do you brag ſo much of your Art, if you call your ſelf
a Chriſtian? do you not know, that we are ALL ONE in Chriſt,
which is Chriſt us ALL? If Chriſt teacheth us and loveth us, <hi>why
then</hi> do you curſe us; and call, Chriſt <hi>in</hi> US, a ſtink.</p>
               <p>21. Moreover, hath not that an ill aſpect or ſymptome, as if the
ill ſpirit were in you, that can <hi>not</hi> endure Chriſt, <hi>nor</hi> willingly
would ſee, that Men do repent and pray, being you call <hi>Repentence</hi>
and <hi>Prayer,</hi> a ſtink? which you can <hi>not</hi> deny, being, you ſay that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57424:5"/>
every Line is a blaſphemy againſt God; and you forbid the people
to read it under pain of Eternall puniſhment.</p>
               <p>22. Do but open your <hi>Heart,</hi> and read <hi>that</hi> little book aright, you
will find ſome what elſe, <hi>therein;</hi> you have <hi>not</hi> read it at all, <hi>yet,</hi> that, I
perceive, by the Title of your Libell, for you ſet down the Title
wrong, and have not ſeen the little book of <hi>true Refignation,</hi> of the
Imitation or following of Chriſt, therein; you ſet the <hi>Morning Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>
or <hi>Aurora</hi> for the <hi>Firſt</hi> Book, of which you know little, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and <hi>the way to Chriſt</hi> for the <hi>Seccond</hi> Book, and yet it is no
ſingle Book, but is only the <hi>Generall</hi> Title, And the Book of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi>
he ſets for the <hi>Third;</hi> whereas it is the <hi>Firſt</hi> in the printed
Book, and the <hi>laſt,</hi> he hath never ſeen.</p>
               <p>23. <hi>O Primate!</hi> Satan hath blinded you, and led you into <hi>Anger,</hi>
that for anger you could not <hi>ſo much</hi> as read it, but he hath inſtantly
made <hi>haſte</hi> with you, to reproachings and ſcandalizing, for it is a
ſtink in his Eyes, thus you have imitated and followed <hi>him,</hi> do but
drive away <hi>Evill</hi> affections from you, and read it aright, and you
will ſee very much <hi>otherwiſe</hi> therein.</p>
               <p>24. Alſo you know, that God hath converted <hi>'ſome</hi> thereby, ſo that
they are entered into true Repentance, and have attained <hi>that very
thing</hi> which Chriſt hath promiſed us, that is to ſay, the <hi>Gift</hi> of the
Holy Spirit, Luke 11. 13. there are eminent Examples neer by.</p>
               <p>25. Theſe Mens Gifts of the Holy Spirit, you <hi>call them</hi> all, A
ſtink, whereby <hi>Men</hi> may eſpye and diſcerne that this little Book, is
altogether <hi>againſt</hi> the Devill, and that in you no good Spirit muſt
dwell, while you blaſpheme the Gift of <hi>God,</hi> for you ſay; this <hi>Stink</hi>
viz: <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> which is the <hi>whole</hi> Contents of this Book,
be farre from you, it may well <hi>ſo</hi> come to paſſe, that Gods Gifts
ſhould remove, and be farre from you.</p>
               <p>Libell.</p>
               <p>26. You ſay alſo <hi>that Great</hi> Plagues hang over
thoſe places, where ſuch Blaſphemy againſt God,
<hi>unpuniſhed,</hi> may be deviſed, divulged, and
beleeved; where Men may alſo freely without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption,
<hi>think write beleeve and divulge,</hi>
what they will.</p>
               <p>Anſwer.</p>
               <p>27. Yes, I beleeve ſo too, that <hi>thoſe</hi> places, where Men blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme
the Gifts of God, and <hi>aſcribe</hi> them to the Devill, great puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
hang over them; Alſo there hangeth over the Ear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

where ſuch an Earneſt <hi>ſincere</hi> Repentance becometh exerciſed, cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
great puniſhment, for he muſt be dayly killed, and be made a Fool
to the world, when he ſhall walk in the <hi>Divine</hi> way.</p>
               <p>28. <hi>You ſee</hi> very well, how I am puniſhed by you, in <hi>ſuch wayes,</hi>
and not only, by you, but you egg; and ſet on the whole City alſo
with reproaching, upon <hi>my</hi> Neck, ſo that they beleeve you, and
puniſh me; but it is the Badge Character or <hi>Mark</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>29. But that you will preſcribe a Modell or <hi>platform</hi> of FAITH for
the People, ſo that they ſhould not every one beleeve in <hi>his own Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>
Gift, as the Spirit of God in their ſoul, manifeſts or reveals it ſelf,
to <hi>them;</hi> Another Libell is requiſite of that, this is not ſufficient for
<hi>that</hi> purpoſe.</p>
               <p>30. But that you <hi>threaten</hi> them with puniſhment, that I beleeve
you in, very well, If you had the Power, <hi>then,</hi> they muſt either into
the Fire, or out of the Land, or Countrey.</p>
               <p>31. But that you ſay, the way to Repentance is a<note n="*" place="margin">E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that, the New Teſtament, ſaith not, for when Chriſt began
his Goſpel with <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, then he ſaid, <hi>Repent, Mark</hi> 1. 15. and
my book ſaith alſo <hi>the ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>32. <hi>The Naturall Man receiveth or perceiveth nothing of this way,</hi>
1 Cor. 2. 14. you need not puniſh him, he goeth <hi>without</hi> that enough
in the wayes of the Devill, <hi>till</hi> Chriſt in Repentance doth enlighten
him: Now look upon your ſelf, and try your ſelf, whether your
<hi>ſelf</hi> be in ſuch away, Before you preſcribe to me and other children
of God, limits and bounds, in our Gifts of God, whereas your preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is but a defaming deſgracefull <hi>Libell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Libell.</p>
               <p>33. Further ſaith the Libell; God will won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
reſcue his honour, and will not ſuffer his
Eternity to be taken away by ſuch <hi>Sectarian</hi> or
ſwarming <hi>Shoemakers, Tanners, Taylors,
Woman, Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Doctors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſwer.</p>
               <p>34. I <hi>hold</hi> the ſame opinion and beleeve ſtedfaſtly, that God, will
ſuffer, his honour, which he in JESUS CHRIST, with the victory
over Death and Hell, hath manifeſted or revealed <hi>in us</hi> poor Men, to
be taken away, <hi>by</hi> no Devill, <hi>much leſſe</hi> a Primate, Doctor, Prieſt,
Shoemaker, Taylor, Tanner, or Woman: but whoſoever among
<hi>theſe,</hi> ſhall <hi>Repent,</hi> and turn himſelf to him, upon <hi>thoſe</hi> he will beſtow
his honour: I beleeve alſo well, that he will deliver <hi>his children</hi> from
all Evill, and fave them.</p>

               <p>35. <hi>The</hi> Poyſon <hi>of</hi> Arrius, <hi>which</hi> denieth the

and pernitious, as this</hi> Poyſon <hi>of the</hi> Shoema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
<hi>which</hi> takes away the Eternity from the

               <p>Anſwer.</p>
               <p>37. To this I ſay cleerly NO; you can <hi>not</hi> in Eternity Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate

               <p>45. It is <hi>not of Mans</hi> Ability, but Gods Spirit performeth that

which you demonſtrate by this Libell, and by your whole Life.</p>
               <p>53. But all the works of God, <hi>muſt ſerve him,</hi> God hath uſed you
for an Inſtrument, of this <hi>Publication</hi> of them, which God

<hi>root</hi> out my writings; and hunt me therewith: out of the Countrey,
then it would go juſt ſo with <hi>us</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p>55. Tell me I pray, whether alſo Lying and Sinne be from the
Devill or no; ſhew me the Opinion of <hi>Arrius</hi> in my little Prayer-Book;
there is indeed more Devotion, and divine power in the
words of that little book, then is yet at <hi>this time</hi> come into your
heart; which a Man may obſerve by your injurious perſecution, in

               <p>56. Chriſt ſaid: <hi>Be ye Mercifull as your Heavenly Father is Mercifull;

               <p>57. Hearken, <hi>Herr Primarius,</hi> Lord Primate: do you know <hi>wherefore</hi>
God took from the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Countreys the<note n="*" place="margin">Rev: 2. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Candleſtick,</hi> as he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
in the <hi>Revelations;</hi> It was for the ſake of the Contention
Pride and State of the <hi>Learned,</hi> in that they were only Mouth Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
and ſought only their <hi>Belly God,</hi> and earthly <hi>Lucifer;</hi> and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the <hi>Antichriſt</hi> with Chriſt Purple Mantle: and contended about
Opinihns, they <hi>forſork</hi> the Holy Spirit in Power, and ſet themſelves
in Chriſts ſtead, they were but contenders and diſputes, and their
Aime was only at <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>reſpect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>58. Theſe things the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Countreys looked upon and ſaw that
in ſuch Contention, Gods Love was not, and in that reſpect they
began to doubt concerning the <hi>Faith,</hi> and ſeeing the Learned did but
contend, and one part acknowledged Chriſt, and the other part
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57424:9"/>
denied him, and run on to meer IMAGES and <hi>Opinions,</hi> wherein
none ſaw conformity to the other, then the Potentates thought, with
themſelves, who <hi>knoweth,</hi> how it is with the Prieſts contention, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be any thing in IT or no?</p>
               <p>59. Then came forth <hi>Mahumet,</hi> and taught the ONE only
God, without Trinity; to whom the people fell away, when they
ſaw, that <hi>therein</hi> there was no ſtrife in reſpect of the TRINITY, for
they had enough of ſtrife.</p>
               <p>60. Alſo God permitted it to be ſo, becauſe in their Contention
they did <hi>only blaſpheme</hi> CHRIST, then he took the <hi>Candleſtick</hi> away,
and ſo they became <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> and began to warre and diſpute
with bloud and Sword, and drave out the Titulary and Mouth-Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
and God ſuffered it, that they might no more, <hi>contend</hi> about
Chriſts honour, ſeeing <hi>Chriſt honour</hi> is only<note n="*" place="margin">NOTE</note> Humility <hi>and</hi>
Love.</p>
               <p>61. Behold, and conſider well, how are you, the <hi>Learned,</hi> at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<hi>marked</hi> or characterized; howiis it concerning Chriſts Kingdome
among you? ſee and compare the Times of <hi>Arrianiſme</hi> and the ſtrife of
the Learned, in reſpect of the <hi>Religion</hi> of your Times; and your
Contention, which you have had along time.</p>
               <p>62. Shew me the true Chriſt in <hi>Love and meekneſſe,</hi> in all your Books
of <hi>controverſie</hi> or Contention, are they not meer libellous papers, and
reproachfull ſlanders, and evill affections? wherein every one cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

                  <note n="†" place="margin">Matth. 24. 23, &amp;c. Mark 13. 21. Luke 17. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Here is Chriſt, there is Chriſt; behold, he is in
the Wilderneſſe, in the Chamber, in the Field,</hi> Alſo in the Supper, in the
Baptiſme and in Confeſſion; <hi>and the other ſay</hi> No: he is not there, it is
only a Remembrance, and ſend forth ſuch blaſphemies reproaches and
diſgracings about <hi>Chriſts</hi> Cup Office and Perſon, as was done in the
time of <hi>Arrius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>63. Therefore you are now your own Prophet and threaten
darkneſſe to your ſelfe; it may very well befall you; and unleſſe you
be altogether blind, you may ſee it before your eyes, yet you had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
contend, and reproach Gods children, yes wholly thruſt from
you, CHRIST, <hi>in his Members,</hi> then repent.</p>
               <p>64. <hi>Thoſe</hi> who hitherto have <hi>prayed to God,</hi> and have confeſſed
the peoples Sinnes; <hi>they</hi> have kept back the deſerved puniſhment
but <hi>you</hi> make haſte, with <hi>them,</hi> out of the Countrey.</p>
               <p>65. And ſeeing you call me <hi>Prophet;</hi> but with an <hi>evill</hi>
acceptation for ſcorn and diſgrace; therefore I ſhall tell you; <hi>what
the Lord hath given Me to know;</hi> viz: that the Time is born, or come,
wherein God will require an account of your ſtrife about the Cup of
Chriſt, and puniſh you for it, that which you now fear, and yet do not
Repent, THAT will come upon you.</p>
               <p>66. And thea you ſhall give an account to God of your reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,

CHRIST; it is time to abſtain; or elſe you will then ſee what hath

               <p>68. You call, in your Libell, <hi>Zu dem Rechten Richter, to the

ſhould beleeve you, that your Libell is right and true; why then do
you not take the <hi>Certainty</hi> out of the Printed Book? <hi>It is likely</hi> you

               <p>70. <hi>Have a Care,</hi> that the Dirt and Burres, which you caſt upon

<hi>covereth</hi> himſelf with Chriſts Purple-Mantle; &amp; acknowledgeth and

But Chriſt ſaid, <hi>they were from beneath from the Father of this world, viz:
from the Devill,</hi> John 8. 23, 24.</p>
               <p>73. Herewith I would not touch or diſturb the good Conſcience

               <p>86. You have ſtudied upon it this <hi>Faſting</hi> Time, how you might

               <p>110. I tell it you in love, obſerve it well. I have received it from
God, ſo that I know it, alſo the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> throughout teacheth you
the ſame; I have in <hi>my little Book</hi> very well ſignified to you; that No

are fit and prepared for it in true Repentance, if that were done, which
I would wiſh, then would I have <hi>further ſpeech</hi> with you about it, for
now you are not yet worthy of it, ſeeing you contemn it.</p>
               <p>112. In that regard alſo, is your teaching ſo <hi>cold,</hi> becauſe you have

ſhould Co work with the <hi>Litterall</hi> Word <hi>it ſelf;</hi>
Therefore ſaid Chriſt, <hi>The ſheep hear not the voice of the Hireling,</hi>
John 10. 3. for his crying and calling is but meer <hi>jugling,</hi> and a fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

113. This Power, which I mean, is the <hi>Doro,</hi> to the Sheep, you

               <p>Libell.</p>
               <p>114. <hi>CHRIST</hi> hath directed us to the <hi>Word</hi>
and to the hidden ſecret Myſtery which the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving

               <p>Anſwer.</p>
               <p>115. I lead not Men away from the <hi>Preached</hi> and
<hi>written</hi> Word; you do me wrong in that, but I ſay, that they
ſhould bring along with them the Temple of JESUS CHRIST, to the
preached or written word, viz: a <hi>Repentant</hi> hungry <hi>Soul,</hi> which
heareth in its own ſelf Chriſt, which is, <hi>viz:</hi> the LIVING Word, in the
<hi>Litterall</hi> and preached Word; as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I will hear what the Lord
ſaith in me,</hi> Pſal. 85. 9. And Chriſt alſo ſaith: <hi>He that is of God, heareth
Gods word: and to the Phariſees he ſaith: therefore you hear not, for you are
not of God,</hi> John 8. 47. <hi>alſo you are not my ſheep,</hi> John 10. 26.</p>
               <p>116. This now I intend in my meaning, that a Man ſhould have

the <hi>Preaching,</hi> in <hi>Reading</hi> or <hi>Conference;</hi>
for, this, hath CHRIST taught us, whom I <hi>more</hi> beleeve then, I do,
all ART whatſoever; for the Hiſtoricall Faith, to tickle and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
ones ſelf with knowing without power, and an earneſt ſincere

               <p>117. It is not enough, that we go to <hi>Church</hi> and to

into the Kingdome of Heaven, but they that do the will of my Father in
Heaven,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; Matth: 7. 2. It muſt not be Hiſtoricall beleeving
only, but <hi>bowerfull doing;</hi> Now if they are to do the Divine
will, then muſt the ſame, viz: the <hi>Spirit of</hi> CHRIST, work power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
IN them; for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>without</hi> ME <hi>you can do nothing,</hi>
John 15. 5.</p>
               <p>119. Therefore flattering Hypocriſie: and <hi>Luke-warmneſſe;</hi>
availeth not, for the true ſaith is not only an <hi>imprinted</hi> or imaged fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
but it is power Spirit and Life, it is a Fire of the <hi>Divine</hi> word;
which there burneth, and ſhineth abroad, which Co-worketh with
God, the right and true Faith, is the <hi>Seat</hi> of God, on which he ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
and ſpeaketh.</p>
               <p>102. Faith is <hi>not</hi> meer hiſtoricall Breath, wherewith a Man only
comforteth himſelf, and flattereth the Evill Beaſt full of falſe and
<hi>wicked</hi> deſires: No, it is a <hi>living working Power of God,</hi> its burning
Fire, is the fire-flaming <hi>Love</hi> of God, which breakes forth, and doth the work.</p>
               <p>121. Your <hi>Preaching</hi> is all in vain, if CHRIST worketh <hi>not</hi>
through your word in the Hearers, but if that muſt be done; then
you Muſt teach them LOVE, not Contention diſgracing and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning,
you muſt put the Dung and ſcorn out of your Mouth, not
Judge falſely, and Blaſpheme or reproach; for in reproachings,
SATAN worketh, but with a pure ſoul, CHRIST worketh; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching,
is the ANTICHRIST.</p>
               <p>122. But that you ſay; I direct Men to Dreams, that is worthy of
<hi>no anſwer,</hi> for it is <hi>not</hi> ſo: this reproaching is alſo a <hi>Signaturo</hi> or <hi>Sign</hi>
of Antichriſt, which thus defileth the children of Chriſt, ſhew it, or it
is <hi>not</hi> true.</p>
               <p>123. But that you alſo ſay; My <hi>Dreams,</hi> for ſuch you hold my
writings to be, do rob the beleeving hearts, of FAITH, that alſo is
not ſo, but they lead Men from the Hiſtoricall Faith, from <hi>Hypocriſie;</hi>
to the <hi>Living</hi> Faith, which is, JESUS CHRIST: and do ſhew them,
how they ſhould <hi>daily dye</hi> away from ſinne, and become new born
in Chriſt, and imitate or follow him in Faith and Spirit, and become
ONE <hi>Spirit</hi> with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>124. Which makes the Devill, afraid, that Men will no more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
him under Chriſts Purple Mantle, but the time is Born or
Come, that <hi>his Kingdom</hi> ſhall be revealed and brought to ſcorn, which
No <hi>Primate</hi> ſhall hinder, it is ſo <hi>ordained</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>Libell.</p>
               <p>125. CHRIST <hi>hath handled</hi> weighty <hi>Matters,

calleth it a ſlight and contemptible way, ſeeing it is a <hi>Croſſe-way,</hi>
wherein a Man in this world in miſery and humility muſt follow or

               <p>131. CHRIST was indeed <hi>Sober:</hi> but what the <hi>Primate</hi> layes upon
the Shoemaker, he is <hi>that</hi> himſelfe; Men uſe ſometime to take him
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57424:15"/>
from lying drunk under Tables, abroad, and bring him <hi>Home:</hi> Men
may indeed find him oſt drunk in <hi>one</hi> week, but the Shoemaker <hi>not</hi>

               <p>135. It ſeizes upon <hi>me</hi> with wonder, that he is not <hi>aſhamed,</hi> being
he is an Old Man, in whom a Man ſhould ſeek for wiſdome, that he
dares write ſuch <hi>open</hi> untruths and fooliſh <hi>flouting Expreſſions,</hi> and

very like * <hi>Marcolphus</hi> his filthey ſcurrilous ſcoffings, who all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
carrieth filth in his Mouth, as this <hi>Libell</hi> alſo doth.</p>
               <p>136. It bringeth but little repute to a Teacher of Chriſt, who
<hi>ſhould</hi> forbid it others, and yet doth it himſelfe: The <hi>Shepheards</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
will be handſomely ſerved by it; none ſhould truſt his SOUL to
ſuch ſcoffings; he will be <hi>deceived:</hi> this Spirit <hi>ſtandard upon</hi> the Sand,
and tottereth to and fro, Men may <hi>try him now,</hi> in ſuch ſcoffings.</p>
               <p>137. <hi>Men may well know the Fowle by his</hi> Feathers: <hi>Chriſt ſaid:</hi>
That which is within, that cometh forth, what the Heart is full of, that comes
out upon the Mouth? <hi>Alſo,</hi> how can you that are evill ſpeak that which is
Good? <hi>Alſo,</hi> Can a Man gather Grapes of Thiſtles, or Figs of Thorns?
A Good Man bringeth Good, forth, out of the Treaſure of his heart, and
an Evill Man bringeth Evill forth, out of the Treaſure of his Evill Heart,
<hi>Luke</hi> 16. 45.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:57424:15"/>
138. This I give now to the Reader, to ponder of, what <hi>kind</hi> of
Good Treaſure can the <hi>Primate</hi> have in Heart, when he brings forth
ſuch wondrous things out of his Heart, there muſt <hi>certainly</hi> needs
<hi>ſtick</hi> many ſtrange things, therein, which he ought indeed to be a
little aſhamed to bring forth; ſeeing he is the High-Prieſt, but if a
Man come to him, and but diſpleaſe him with one word, then a Man
may hear <hi>Satan</hi> many times laugh, out from him, with reproachings
and blaſphemyes.</p>
               <p>Libell.</p>
               <p>139. When <hi>Chriſt</hi> Taught the People, he did
it openly, but <hi>the Shoemaker</hi> uſeth to creep into
ſecret Corners.</p>
               <p>Anſwer.</p>
               <p>140. CHRIST was a Teacher ſent from God, and yet muſt often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
depart from the Phariſees, and Scribes learned in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and go into the Wilderneſſe to teach the People, when they
ſaw him teach, they would <hi>ſain have killd him, and called him a decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
and maker of uproars:</hi> and ſaid: he had his<note n="*" place="margin">Or Art.</note> skill and <hi>Doctrine from
the Devill:</hi> and though they ſaw the wondrous ſigns or <hi>Miracles,</hi> yet
they were ſo Mad and hardned, and ſuppoſed, <hi>Teaching,</hi> belonged
<hi>only</hi> to them, and did to him alſo, as the <hi>Primato</hi> doth to the Shoema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker:
<note n="†" place="margin">Math: 11. 10. Luke 7. 34.</note>
                  <hi>they called him a Wine-bibber;</hi> and Miniſter or Servant, to rich
<hi>Publicans;</hi> And <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt preached alſo in the Wilderneſſe;
yes in the Wilderneſſe was the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> of Chriſt began by <hi>John,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the Apoſtles muſt often for fear of the High-Prieſts, Teach in Corners,
and Houſes, as the Acts of the Apoſtles <hi>witneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>141. But the Shoemaker is <hi>no</hi> Preacher, but he giveth only <hi>an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi>
of his Gift and knowledge, and ſpeaketh often with Honeſt
Hearts, concerning The <hi>Way to Chriſt;</hi> how we muſt convert and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and become new-born, for CHRIST ſaith alſo thus; <hi>Where
two or Three of you are met together in My Name, there am I in the midſt
among them:</hi> Matth: 18. 10.</p>
               <p>142. The <hi>Primne</hi> ſhould teach us, that when we come or meet
together, we ſhould ſpeak of GOD and of our <hi>Salvation,</hi> and
<hi>edifie</hi> or build up <hi>one another</hi> in true Love; on the Contrary, he
<hi>forbids</hi> us this, whereby Men may try what ſpirit he ſerveth; A high
Glaſſe of Wine, in his meetings, is better liked by him, then
A <hi>hearty</hi> bleſſed Conference, concerning the
New Birth.</p>
               <p>143. CHRIST on Earth had no greater Enemies, then the High
Prieſts, it will be ſo ſtill at this Day, for all Warres and ſtrife, come
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57424:16"/>
from the High-Prieſts diſputings and reproachings, as it is before our
Eyes, if our Eyes be open to ſee it, but the account is <hi>neer</hi> at
hand.</p>
               <p>Libell.</p>
               <p>144. <hi>Chriſt</hi> deſired no <hi>Kingly</hi> honour, but
the <hi>Shoemaker</hi> if he could, would be <hi>King,</hi> and
<hi>God</hi> to o</p>
               <p>Anſwer.</p>
               <p>145. CHRIST came upon Earth, <hi>poor,</hi> that he might have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion

The Shoemaker <hi>alſo</hi> is upon Earth Poor, and <hi>deſpiſed,</hi> but deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<hi>from</hi> CHRIST the <hi>Heavenly</hi> Kingly Honour, and to be like the

               <p>149. The will of his Father, was the Title of CHRIST, his honour
was in God, and he introduced it into our Humanity, and exalted
our humanity to the right hand of the Power of God: that very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
he <hi>hath beſtowed</hi> upon his Chriſtians, that they alſo in him, <hi>ſit at

of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, as a Champion over Death and Hell,
he deſireth ſuch a high Title, that he may ſtand in the ſtrife againſt
Death and Hell, and that, in CHRIST he thinketh, to conquer and
overcome the whole world, to be a <hi>King</hi> in <hi>Chriſt;</hi>
&amp; to rule over all Enimicitious Libells and reproaches of the <hi>Primate;</hi>
otherwiſe, he deſireth no worldly Titles for the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of a <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
is not of this world:</hi> John 15. 19. for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I have called you out
of the world ſo that you may be where I am:</hi> John 17. 24.</p>
               <p>150. But the <hi>Primate</hi> doth deſire a Title, for he hath <hi>ſet his</hi> Titles
of the High-Prieſts Office, and of his <hi>Perſon,</hi> in the Libell, with GREAT
LETTERS, that men might ſee the <hi>Richter,</hi> or JUDGE, who hath
authority over Chriſts Children, alſo, if one come a little too neer

not yet come to that place, where CHRISTS Titles ſtand IN <hi>the</hi>
SCRIPTURE.</p>
               <p>154. But that he ſaith, the Shoemaker, will be called <hi>Doctor</hi> and a
<hi>New Prophet,</hi> that is only <hi>his</hi> Fiction, as Men uſe in ſuch Libells to
ſeign, after the Manner of <hi>Poets.</hi> The People <hi>need not</hi> beleeve it all,
for a good Man may now and then Erre, eſpecially when a Man is
Drunk, an puts on a Vizard a Man can <hi>not</hi> know him; and though
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57424:17"/>
he were High-Prieſt, if men ſee him go ſo from one houſe to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then People ſay, <hi>there comes</hi> a Fool, and <hi>many may well ſay,</hi> it
<hi>were</hi> the Devill: But it is <hi>not all true;</hi> the People give them only ſuch
a Title, when they aſſume ſuch Images ſhapes or Geſtures; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
they become Men again, when they put off the Vizard, many
a one goeth ſo, only that he may come to his <hi>Paramour</hi> or <hi>where,</hi> then
he makes ſome fooliſh Occaſion; but men ſhould not in ſuch matters
beleeve the Title, when the People ſay, one with a Vizard, is <hi>ſuch</hi>
a Beaſt, it is Death, or the Devill; No, he is but <hi>a captive</hi> of
the Devill.</p>
               <p>155. Thus alſo men Should not beleeve, when the <hi>Primate</hi> puts
Titles upon the Shoemaker, and calleth him A Heretick,
A Sectary, Fool, Phantaſtick or Fanatick, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtick,
A Raſcally Knave, A forſworn
or perjured Shoemaker, <hi>and more,</hi> like that
they are ſuch ſtretched ſtrained Names, like a Vizard, which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
puts upon him, becauſe he is in ſtrife and at odds with him; It is
not good to beleeve, though the High-Prieſt <hi>himſelf</hi> ſay it, <hi>men</hi>
may be deceived, for great people may be miſtaken, for, the
<hi>Phariſees,</hi> were miſtaken <hi>in</hi> CHRISTS Titles,
how then will the <hi>Primate</hi> not be miſtaken in the Shoemakers <hi>Titles,</hi>
ſeeing he knows that he is but a Laick, and he <hi>knoweth not</hi> the Name
of CHRIST-in him.</p>
               <p>156. The <hi>good</hi> LORD, ſure, was once with ſome Shoemaker, who
had <hi>touched</hi> the Blacking, which made him ſtink, whence is ſo very
much angered offended and enraged, that he ſuppoſeth, that THIS
Shoemaker alwayes ſmells of that colouring, and therefore he is ſo
fiercely enraged againſt the Shoemakers <hi>Titles;</hi> likely ſome Shoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers
<hi>Pitch</hi> remains ſticking to <hi>his</hi> Hands, that is dryed to them,
and in that regard, he giveth the Shoemaker ſuch <hi>abominable</hi> Names,
that he is ſtill angry at it: He can not endure the Shoemaker <hi>yet,</hi> and
is afraid, the Shoemaker may defile his own Pen, and <hi>therefore</hi> forbids
him to uſe it: O, <hi>Primate!</hi> the Shoemaker hath his Titles IN himſelfe,
you can <hi>not</hi> defile them, he will <hi>Eternally</hi> keep THEM, well nough.</p>

giveth to my thirſty Soul to drink, for which I thank him <hi>Eternally,</hi>
that he hath through <hi>this</hi> Water, made me living and <hi>Seeing,</hi> that very

               <p>159. But that he ſaith, I run every Morning to the Brande-wine

to me, ſo that I do not <hi>willingly</hi> ſmell to it; It is a wonder to
me, that he being a High-Prieſt, ſhould be ſo very much <hi>miſtaken,</hi> he
would look upon it very ill, if a mean Man ſhould doe ſo, then a
Man would ſay, he were a Lyar, I know not at all, what anſwer I

there be any Man, that can ſay ſo, of me.</p>
               <p>161. It is a great ſhame, that you cauſe ſuch untruth, to be <hi>printed</hi>

I in a whole <hi>year.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>165. But I underſtand very well where the matter <hi>pincheth,</hi> He
knoweth that I through <hi>divine appointment,</hi> have often been requeſted
to go to <hi>Great</hi> Lords <hi>and</hi> Noble-men, then thinks
he, when we come to meet, we ſit together, and quaff our Fill, as he
uſeth to do, with <hi>his</hi> Companions; But No! the Nobility and <hi>Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates</hi>
in Authority, which are ſerved with full draughts, do <hi>not</hi> cauſe
me to be ſent for, to <hi>them,</hi> but only honeſt Lords fearing God, who
earneſtly ſeek after <hi>Salvaiton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>166. But there is in the <hi>Primate</hi> a Miſtruſt and grutching, he think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
ſomewhat is going away from him; but he need not fear it.
Thoſe People, which deſire to have ME, they deſire not to have
HIM at all, there is a great difference between Hypocriſie or Flattery
and telling the Truth to ones Face; whether the <hi>Primate</hi> will beleeve
it or no, it is not my Cuſtome, to ſlatter the Rich for gifts and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents;
as he ſuppoſeth.</p>
               <p>167. I believe verily, that ſome Old <hi>Ruffians,</hi> have brought him
thoſe tydings as Newes concerning Me, And the <hi>Good Lord</hi> hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved
it as Goſpel, and with great earneſtneſſe written it, and ſo
<hi>enraged</hi> himſelf at it, that he hath thereupon <hi>condemned</hi> the poor Shoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker,
<hi>unheard,</hi> but it would look ſtrangely, if Men ſhould ask
after the Ground of it, and compare this <hi>Anſwer</hi> with the <hi>Libell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>168. It is truly a great Matter, for ſuch a Man as <hi>you</hi> are, ſo to
deal with the Truth. The City <hi>Goerlitz</hi> know very well, that I for a
long time <hi>without neceſſity,</hi> have come into No Mans Houſe, The
Tap-houſes and Wine-Cellers, are <hi>at quiet</hi> for all me; for you have ſo
judged and condemned me that I would <hi>willingly</hi> come <hi>no whither;</hi>
now if I ſhould go to drink in Tap-houſes; how many hundred of
your Flouts ſhould I not get; which you have caſt among Common-people,
which are all, your Fruits, which will follow you, you may
well rejoyce at them.</p>
               <p>Libell.</p>
               <p>169. Now if by <hi>this</hi> thou knoweſt the <hi>Shoema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi>
as the <hi>Lyon</hi> by his Paw: Wilt thou then read
his <hi>Books?</hi> No, but Shun them as the filthy Spawn
of a <hi>Devill,</hi> and abominable Errour, and hold
thee cloſe to the Word of <hi>God,</hi> and beware of
the <hi>Shoemakers Scholars</hi> or Diſciples, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57424:18"/>
they be <hi>Noble-men</hi> or <hi>Doctors, Taylours,
Men</hi> or <hi>Women;</hi> The <hi>LORD CHRIST</hi> deſtroy
<hi>Satans</hi> Inſtrument, and let not <hi>THY Word</hi> be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
or obſcured.</p>
               <p>Anſwer.</p>
               <p>170. In <hi>theſe words</hi> it may well be obſerved, <hi>wherefore, the Libell</hi>
hath been written, <hi>viz:</hi> that he might bring to nothing and quite root
out my writings, by theſe defamatory Reproaches; It <hi>vexes</hi> the
Devill, that my writings do lay open his <hi>Smoak-Hole,</hi> and therefore
it is, that he paints me with ſuch colours; that NONE ſhould READ
me, Men might otherwiſe Repent, and ſo there would be a greater
Breach made, to his Kingdome.</p>
               <p>171. But this Devill is ſo very Groſſely <hi>vile,</hi> that he goeth quite
Naked, the People may eaſily obſerve him, and <hi>learn</hi> to know him,
for men ſee his Pawes in his <hi>diſpoſition</hi> and reproachings, and that he is
altogether a Poyſonous <hi>venemous</hi> or <hi>Spitefull</hi> Spirit; It is now quite
an other Time, then it hath been, Men will not now ſo <hi>ſuddenly</hi> beleeve
what every one ſaith; Men will ſee <hi>proof</hi> for it: why doth he not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
what he ſayes out of the <hi>printed</hi> Book; ſeeing he forbids it,
to the Congregation of the People: ſuch defamatory reproaches, are no
demonſtrations, men may well call them Filth and Dung.</p>
               <p>178. He <hi>ſpeaketh of</hi> the Lyons Paw, by which Men ſhould know
the Shoemaker; Now it may well be true, that men at preſent may
eaſily <hi>ſee</hi> the <hi>Lyons Paw</hi> in Me, how the <hi>Lyon</hi> with contemning and
reproaching, hath <hi>griped</hi> and <hi>clawed</hi> Me; but the Bloud of JESUS
CHRIST hath hitherto reſiſted the <hi>Lyon,</hi> elſe he had torn the Shoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker
in peeces.</p>
               <p>173. But that he ſaith; the Shoemakers <hi>Doctrine</hi> is Filth and Dung:
therein he calls CHRISTS Mind or <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> Filth and
Dung. And that Men ſhould beware of the Shoemakers <hi>Scholars</hi> or
Diſciples, to that, I ſay, I know of <hi>No</hi> Scholars or Diſciples, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Chriſtian Men, where <hi>one</hi> SOUL is refreſhed by an <hi>other:</hi> I
have no <hi>New</hi> Doctrine, but only the <hi>Old,</hi> which is to be found in the
BIBLE, and in the Kingdome of NATURE.</p>
               <p>174. But that he calls his reproaching Blaſphemies, GODS WORD,
which men ſhould hear, <hi>only</hi> from HIM, and ſhould ſo reproach; as
he doth; that I offer to Chriſtian Hearts to conſider of, <hi>what Spirits</hi>
Childe he is.</p>

viz: the <hi>falſe</hi> or <hi>wicked</hi> Spiritualty or Clergy, very <hi>Mightily:</hi> It may
not be otherwiſe; it <hi>muſt</hi> ſo come to paſſe.</p>
               <p>180. But I know, <hi>very Many</hi> Spiritual Prieſts, <hi>or</hi>
Clergy-Men, whom it will NOT hurt, but
do them <hi>much good,</hi> whoſe Office of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
is ſincerely and earneſtly intended by them;
BUT who can, [do any thing], <hi>before
the Time,</hi> which bringeth <hi>ALL THINGS</hi>
to paſſe?</p>
               <p>181. If the <hi>Primate</hi> with his Warning or admonition, intend ſo
faithfully, then let him leave, his reproaching Blaſphemies in the
PULPIT, and only require me, to come to him, and ſhew me my Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
if I did but find that he had any thing of Truth, againſt me,
and would ſhew me a <hi>better</hi> way; O how I would cheerfully love
him, and faithfully thank him for it; he <hi>rejoyceth,</hi> that he hath but
any thing that he CAN reproach.</p>
               <p>182. AT the beginning, after his firſt reproaching Blaſphemy, and
perſecution, I bowed and yeelded to him for<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Note</hi> J. B. did forbear writing of his Works for ſix years.</note> Six <hi>years
together,</hi> and wrote No word further of my works, why did not he
ceaſe to Reproach? who did any thing to him? But he could not;
why? Becauſe God had made him a driving <hi>Hammer,</hi> that muſt drive
on the work.</p>
               <p>183. His reproaching hath become my ſtrength and growth,
through his Perſecution my <hi>Pearl</hi> is grown, he hath preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
it forth, and <hi>publiſhed</hi> it <hi>himſelfe,</hi> and in that regard I wiſh him
Gods Mercy and Compaſſion, that he might yet partake thereof,
ſeeing God hath uſed him for <hi>my</hi> inſtrument <hi>in my</hi> work.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:57424:20"/>
184. I would deal much <hi>humblyer,</hi> towards him, if he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert,
then he hath done towards me, He <hi>need not</hi> think I ſhun coming
before his Face; I have a good Conſcience, and wiſh him one too.</p>
               <p>185. In no Judgement, to ſentence one, <hi>unheard,</hi> doth availe, I
ſubmit not my ſelf in ſuch a way to his Judgement, for my heart is not
<hi>convinced,</hi> with ſuch a ſentence, I am innocent of all that is laid to my
charge; All that he hath ſpoken againſt me in the Pulpit, is quite <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi>
to my ſence and meaning, and not one true word of it, he hath
<hi>wreſted</hi> and perverted all my words, with a ſtrange underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
               <p>186. Therefore ſeeing I can now, have no other <hi>Richter,</hi> or
<hi>Judge,</hi> who himſelf will underſtand my Gift, I appeal from his <hi>Judicium,</hi>
Cenſure or Judgement, <hi>before the</hi> Judgement of my

things: when this <hi>Cerinthus</hi> was in the
Bath, he deſpiſed the <hi>LORD CHRIST,</hi> and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in his railing, babling vehemently againſt
<hi>GOD,</hi> but the Houſe fell down and Slew him: thus

LORD <hi>and</hi> GOD: and have ſubmitted and given up my ſelf in <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
to him, to live according to his Will and Commandement; but that
the <hi>Primate</hi> ſaith, that I have done <hi>Like</hi> Cerinthus, that needs well
to be demonſtrated, elſe it will not be true.</p>
               <p>189. But that he ſpeaks of my <hi>Wondrous Things;</hi> To that I ſay
with truth, I have written of <hi>No Wondrous things;</hi> I have only writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
what NATURE and MAN is; but ſeeing this ſeemeth to be

A <hi>wonder</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>197. But you aſcribe it to the <hi>Devill,</hi> as the High Prieſts did to
