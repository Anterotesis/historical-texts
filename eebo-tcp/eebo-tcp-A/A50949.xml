            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the publishing of humane lawes, which for the most part aime not beyond the good of civill society, to set them barely forth to the people without reason or Preface, like a physicall prescript, or only with threatnings, as it were a lordly command, in the judgement of <hi>Plato</hi> was thought to be done neither generously nor wisely. His advice was, seeing that persuasion certainly is a more winning, and more manlike way to keepe men in obedience then feare, that to such lawes as were of principall moment; there should be us'd as an induction, some well temper'd discourse, shewing how good, how gainfull, how happy it must needs be to live according to honesty and justice, which being utter'd with those native co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours and graces of speech, as true eloquence the daughter of vertue can best bestow upon her mothers praises, would so incite, and in a manner, charme the multitude into the love of that which is really good, as to imbrace it ever after, not of custome and awe, which most men do, but of choice and purpose, with true and constant delight. But this practice we may learn, from a better &amp; more ancient autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, then any heathen writer hath to give us, and indeed being a point of so high wisdome &amp; worth, how could it be but we should find it in that book, within whose sacred context all wisdome is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded? <hi>Moses</hi> therefore the only Lawgiver that we can believe to have beene visibly taught of God, knowing how vaine it was to write lawes to men whose hearts were not first season'd with the knowledge of God and of his workes, began from the book of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis, as a prologue to his lawer; which <hi>Josephus</hi>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63661:3"/>
whom they could derive so many blessings upon themselves, might be mov'd to obey si cerely by knowing so good a reason of their obedience. If then in the administration of civill justice, and under the obscurity of Ceremoniall rites, such care was had by the wisest of the heathen, and by <hi>Moses</hi> among the Jewes, to instruct them at least in a generall reason of that government to which their subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was requir'd, how much more ought the members of the Church under the Gospell seek<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to informe their understanding in the reason of that government which the Church claimes to have over them: especially for that the Church hath in her immediate cure those inner parts and affections of the mind where the seat of reason is; having power to examine our spirituall knowledge, and to demand from us in Gods behalfe a service intirely reasonable. But because about the manner and order of this government, whether it ought to be Presbyteriall, or Prelaticall, such endlesse question, or rather uproare is arisen in this land, as may be justly term'd, what the feaver is to the Physitians, the eternall reproach of our Divines; whilest other profound C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And if any man incline to thinke I undertake a taske too difficult for my yeares, I trust through the supreme inlightning assistance farre otherwise; for my yeares, be they few or many, what imports it? so they bring reason, let that be looke on: and for the task, from hence that the question in hand is so needfull to be known at this time chiefly by every meaner capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and containes in it the explication of many admirable and heavenly privileges reacht out to us by the Gospell, I conclude the task must be easie. God having to this end ordain'd his Gospell to be the revelation of his power and wisdome in Christ Jesus. And
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63661:3"/>
this is one depth of his wisdome, that he could so plainly reveale so great a measure of it to the grosse distorted apprehension of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay'd mankinde. Let others therefore dread and shun the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for their darknesse, I shall wish I may deserve to be reckon'd among those who admire and dwell upon them for their clearnesse. And this seemes to be the cause why in those places of holy writ, wherein is treated of Church-government, the reasons thereof are not formally, and profestly set downe, because to him that heeds at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively the drift and scope of Christian profession, they easily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themselves, which thing further to explane, having now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd enough, I shall no longer deferre.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That Church-government is prescrib'd in the Gospell, and that to say otherwise is unsound.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He first and greatest reason of Church-government, we may securely with the assent of many on the adverse part, affirme to be, because we finde it so ordain'd and set out to us by the appointment of God in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but whether this be Presbyteriall, or Prelaticall, it cannot be brought to the scanning, untill I have said what is meet to some who do not think it for the ease of their inconsequent opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, to grant that Church discipline is platform'd in the Bible, but that it is left to the discretion of men. To this conceit of theirs I answer, that it is both unsound and untrue. For there is not that thing in the world of more grave and urgent importance through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole life of man, then is discipline. What need I instance? He that hath read with judgement, of Nations and Common-wealths, of Cities and Camps, of peace and warre, sea and land, will readily agree that the flourishing and decaying of all civill socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, all the moments and turnings of humane occasions are mov'd to and fro as upon the axle of discipline. So that whatsoever power or sway in mortall things weaker men have attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to fortune, I durst with more confidence (the honour of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence ever sav'd) ascribe either to the vigor, or the slack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of discipline. Nor is there any sociable perfection in this life
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63661:4"/>
civill or sacred that can be above discipline, but she is that which with her musicall cords preserves and holds all the parts thereof to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Hence in those perfect armies of <hi>Cyrus</hi> in <hi>Xenophon,</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi> in the Roman stories, the excellence of military skill was esteem'd, not by the not needing, but by the readiest submitting to the edicts of their commander. And certainly discipline is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the removall of disorder, but if any visible shape can be given to divine things, the very visible shape and image of vertue, whereby she is not only seene in the regular gestures and motions of her hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly paces as she walkes, but also makes the harmony of her voice audible to mortall eares. Yea the Angels themselves, in whom no disorder is fear'd, as the Apostle that saw them in his rapture describes, are distinguisht and quaternion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> into their celestiall Princedomes, and Satrapies, according as God himselfe hath writ his imperiall decrees through the great provinces of heav'n. The state also of the blessed in Paradise, though never so perfect, is not therefore left without discipline, whose golden survaying reed marks out and measures every quarter and circuit of new Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. Yet is it not to be conceiv'd that those eternall effluences of sanctity and love in the glorified Saints should by this meanes be confin'd and cloy'd with repetition of that which is prescrib'd, but that our happinesse may or be it selfe into a thousand vagancies of glory and delight, and with a kinde of eccentricall equation be as it were an invariable Planet of joy and felicity, how much lesse can we believe that God would leave his fraile and feeble, though not lesse beloved Church here below to the perpetuall stumble of conjecture and disturbance in this our darke voyage without the card and compasse of Discipline. Which is so hard to be of mans making, that we may see even in the guidance of a civill state to worldly happinesse, it is not for every learned, or every wise man, though many of them consult in common, to invent or frame a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, but if it be at all the worke of man, it must be of such a one as is a true knower of himselfe, and himselfe in whom contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and practice, wit, prudence, fortitude, and eloquence must be rarely met, both to comprehend the hidden causes of things, and span in his thoughts all the various effects that passion or complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can worke in mans nature; and hereto must his hand be at defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with gaine, and his heart in all vertues heroick. So far is it from the kenne of these wretched projectors of ours that bescraull their Pamflets every day with new formes of government for our Church. And therefore all the ancient lawgivers were either truly

of the Law there can be no doubt; for to let passe the first institution of Priests and Levites, which is too cleare to be insisted upon, when the Temple came to be built, which in plaine judgement could breed no essentiall change either in religion, or in the Priestly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; yet God to shew how little he could endure that men should be tampring and contriving in his worship, though in things of lesse regard, gave to <hi>David</hi> for <hi>Solomon</hi> not only a pattern and modell of the Temple, but a direction for the courses of the Priests and Levites, and for all the worke of their service.

In the Prophesie of <hi>Ez-kiel</hi> from the 40 Chapt. onward, after the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Temple, God by his Prophet seeking to weane the hearts of the Jewes from their old law to expect a new and more perfect reformation under Christ, sets out before their eyes the stately fabrick &amp; constitution of his Church, with al the ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call functions appertaining; indeed the description is as sorted best to the apprehension of those times, typicall and shadowie, but in such manner as never yet came to passe, nor never must literally, unlesse we mean to annihilat the Gospel.

Did God take such delight in measuring out the pillars, arches, and doores of a materiall Temple, was he so punctuall and circumspect in lavers, altars, and sacrifices soone after to be abrogated, left any of these should have beene made contrary to his minde? is not a farre more perfect worke more agreeable to his perfection in the most perfect state of the Church militant, the new alliance of God to man? should not he rather now by his owne prescribed discipline have cast his line and levell upon the soule of man which is his rationall temple, and by the divine square and compasse thereof forme and regenerate in us the lovely shapes of vertues and graces, the sooner to edifie and accomplish that immortall stature of Christs body which is his Church, in all her glorious lineaments and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

And what more frequent then in like manner to say the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> So that either to restraine the significance too much, or too much to inlarg it would make the adjuration either not so waighty, or not so pertinent. And thus we find here that the rules of Church-discipline are not only commanded, but hedg'd about with such a terrible impalement of commands, as he that will break through wilfully to violate the least of them, must hazard the wounding of his conscience even to death. Yet all this notwithstanding we shall finde them broken wellnigh all by the faire pretenders even of the next ages. No lesse to the contempt of him whom they fain to be the archfounder of prelaty S. <hi>Peter,</hi> who by what he writes in the 5 Chap. of his first Epistle should seeme to be farre another man then tradition reports him: there he commits to the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters only full authority both of feeding the flock, and Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: and commands that obedience be given to them as to the mighty hand of God, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is his mighty ordinance. Yet all this was as nothing to repell the ventrous boldnesse of innovation that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su'd, changing the decrees of God that is immutable, as if they had been breath'd by man. Neverthelesse when Christ by those visions of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> foreshewes the reformation of his Church, he bids him take his Reed, and meet it out againe after the first patterne, for he prescribes him no other. Arise, said the Angell, and measure the Temple of God and the Altar, and them that worship therein. What is there in the world can measure men but discipline? Our word ruling imports no lesse. Doctrine indeed is the measure, or at least the reason of the measure, tis true, but unlesse the measure be apply'd to that which it is to measure, how can it actually doe its proper worke.

But if this instance be able to assert any right of jurisdiction to the Clergy, it must impart it in common to all Ministers, since it were a great folly to seeke for counsell in a hard intricat scruple from a Dunce Prelat, when there might be found a speedier solution from a grave and learned Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yet all this will not fadge, though it be cunningly interpolisht by some second hand with crooks &amp; emendations; Heare then; the type of Christ in some one particular, as of entring yearly into the Holy of holies and such like, rested upon the High Priest only as more immediately perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating our Saviour: but to resemble his whole satisfactory office all the lineage of <hi>Aaron</hi> was no more then sufficient.

And this shewes the excellente or Christs sacrifice, who at once and in one person fulfill'd that which many hunderds of Priests many times repeating had anough to foreshew.

The Primat of <hi>Armagh</hi> at the beginning of his tractat seeks to availe himselfe of that place in the 66 of <hi>Esaiah,</hi> I will take of them for Priests and Levites, saith the Lord; to uphold hereby such a forme of superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity among the ministers of the Gospell, succeeding those in the law, as the Lords day did the Sabbath. But certain if this method may be admitted of interpreting those propheticall passages con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Christian times in a punctuall correspondence, it may with equall probability be urg'd upon us, that we are bound to observe some monthly solemnity answerable to the new moons, as well as the Lords day which we keepe in lieu of the Sabbath: for in the 23 v. the Prophet joynes them in the same manner together, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did the Priests and Levites, thus. And it shall come to passe that from one new moone to another, and from one Sabbath to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly with as good consequence may it be alledg'd from hence, that we are to solemnize some religious monthly meeting different from the Sabbath, as from the other any distinct formality of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall orders may be inferr'd. This rather will appeare to be the lawfull and unconstrain'd sense of the text, that God in taking of them for Priests and Levites, will not esteeme them unworthy though Gentiles, to undergoe any function in the Church, but will make of them a full and perfect ministery, as was that of the Priests

Hence that open confession of the Primat before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd.

But first I conclude from their owne mouthes that Gods command in Scripture, which doubtlesse ought to be the first and greatest reason of Church-government, is wanting to Prelaty.

But if her dignity came by favour of some Prince, she was from that time his creature, and obnoxious to comply with his ends in state were they right or wrong. So that in stead of finding Prelaty an impeacher of Schisme or faction, the more I search, the more I grow into all perswasion to think rather that faction and she as with a spousall ring are wedded together, never to be divorc't.

And as I noted before that the patterne of the High Priest pleaded for in the Gospel (for take away the head Priest the rest are but a carcasse) sets up with better reason a Pope, then an Archbishop, for if Prelaty must still rise and rise till it come to a Primat, why should it stay there? when as the catholick govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not to follow the division of kingdomes, the temple best re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting the universall Church, and the High Priest the universall head; so I observe here, that if to quiet schisme there must be one head of Prelaty in a land or Monarchy rising from a Provinciall to a nationall Primacy, there may upon better grounds of repressing schisme be set up one catholick head over the catholick Church. For the peace and good of the Church is not terminated in the schismelesse estate of one or two kingdomes, but should be provided for by the joynt consultation of all reformed Christendome: that all controversie may end in the finall pronounce or canon of one Arch-primat, or P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But what if ye prevent, and hinder all good means of preventing schisme? that way which the Apostles us'd, was to call a councell; from which by any thing that can be learnt from the fifteenth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> no faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Christian was debarr'd, to whom knowledge and piety might give entrance. Of such a councell as this every parochiall Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story is a right homogeneous and constituting part being in it selfe as it were a little Synod, and towards a generall assembly moving upon her own basis in an even and firme progression, as those smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler squares in battell unite in one great cube, the main phalanx, an embleme of truth and stedfastnesse. Whereas on the other side Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laty ascending by a graduall monarchy from Bishop to Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, from thence to P imat, and from thence, for there can be no reason yeilded neither in nature, nor in religion, wherefore, if it have lawfully mounted thus high, it should not be a Lordly ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the horoscope of the Church, from Primate to Patriarch, and so to Pope.

But the losty minds of an age or two after, such was their small discerning, thought it a poore indignity, that the high rear'd government of the Church should so on a sudden, as it seem'd to them, squat into a Presbytery. Next or rather before councels the timeliest preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of schisme is to preach the Gospell abundantly and powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly throughout all the land, to instruct the youth religiously, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour how the Scriptures may be easiest understood by all men; to all which the proceedings of these men have been on set purpose contrary. But how O Prelats should you remove schisme, and how should you not remove and oppose all the meanes of removing schism? when Prelaty is a schisme it selfe from the most reformed and most flourishing of our neighbour Churches abroad, and a sad subject of discord and offence to the whole nation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

These are but winds and flaws to try the floting vessell of our faith whether it be stanch and sayl well, whether our ballast be just, our anchorage and cable strong.

But thus while some stand dallying and deferring to reform for fear of that which should mainly hasten them forward, lest schism and error should encrease, we may now thank our selves and our delayes if instead of schism a bloody and inhumane rebellion be strook in between our slow movings.

This is that which the sad Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> laments, <hi>Wo is me my mother, that thou hast born me a man of strife, and contention.</hi> And although divine inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion must certainly have been sweet to those ancient profets, yet the irksomnesse of that truth which they brought was so unpleasant to them, that every where they call it a burden. Yea that mysterious book of Revelation which the great Evangelist was bid to eat, as it had been some eye-brightning electuary of knowledge, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight, though it were sweet in his mouth, and in the learning, it was bitter in his belly; bitter in the denouncing. Nor was this hid from the wise Poet <hi>Sophocles,</hi> who in that place of his Tragedy where <hi>Tirefias</hi> is call'd to resolve K. <hi>Edipus</hi> in a matter which he knew would be grievous, brings him in bemoaning his lot, that he knew more then other men.

For me I have determin'd to lay up as the best treasure, and solace of a good old age, if God voutsafe it me, the honest liberty of free speech from my youth, where I shall think it available in so dear a concernment as the Churches good. For if I be either by disposition, or what other cause too inquisitive, or suspitious of my self and mine own doings, who can help it? but this I foresee, that should the Church be brought under heavy op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, and God have given me ability the while to reason against that man that should be the author of so foul a deed, or should she by blessing from above on the industry and courage of faithfull men change this her distracted estate into better daies without the lest furtherance or contribution of those few talents which God at that present had lent me, I foresee what stories I should heare with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my selfe, all my life after, of discourage and reproach.

pencill it over with all the curious touches of art, even to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of a faultlesse picture, whenas in this argument the not deferring is of great moment to the good speeding, that if solidity have leisure to doe her office, art cannot have much. Lastly, I should not chuse this manner of writing wherin knowing my self inferior to my self, led by the genial power of nature to another task, I have the use, as I may account it, but of my left hand. And though I shall be foolish in saying more to this purpose, yet since it will be such a folly as wisest men going about to commit, have only confest and so committed, I may trust with more reason, because with more folly to have courteous pardon. For although a Poet soaring in the high region of his fancies with his garland and singing robes about him might without apology speak more of himself then I mean to do, yet for me sitting here below in the cool element of prose, a mortall thing among many readers of no Empyreall conceit, to venture and divulge unusual things of my selfe, I shall petition to the gentler sort, it may not be envy to me. I must say therefore that after I had from my first yeeres by the ceaselesse diligence and care of my father, whom God recompence, bin exercis'd to the tongues, and some sciences, as my age would suffer, by sundry masters and teachers both at home and at the schools, it was found that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought was impos'd me by them that had the overlooking, or betak'n to of mine own choise in English, or other tongue prosing or versing, but chiefly this latter, the stile by certain vital fignes it had, was likely to live. But much latelier in the privat Academies of <hi>Italy,</hi> whither I was favor'd to resort, perceiving that some trifles which I had in memory, compos'd at under twenty or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about (for the manner is that every one must give some proof of his wit and reading there) met with acceptance above what was lookt for, and other things which I had shifted in scarsity of books and conveniences to patch up amongst them, were receiv'd with writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Encomiums, which the Italian is not forward to bestow on men of this side the <hi>Alps,</hi> I began thus farre to assent both to them and divers of my friends here at home, and not lesse to an inward prompting which now grew daily upon me, that by labour and intent study (which I take to be my portion in this life) joyn'd with the strong propensity of nature, I might perhaps leave some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so written to aftertimes, as they should not willingly let it die. These thoughts at once possest me, and these other. That if <hi>I</hi> were certain to write as men buy Leases, for three lives and downward,

And because I see that most men, as it happens in this world, either weakly, or falsly principl'd, what through ignorance, and what through custom of licence, both in discours and writing, by what hath bin of late written in vulgar, have not seem'd to attain the decision of this point, I shall like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise assay those wily Arbitresses who in most men have, as was heard, the sole ushering of Truth and Falshood between the sense, and the soul, with what loyalty they will use me in conuoying this Truth to my understanding; the rather for that by as much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance as I can obtain with them, I doe not find them engag'd either one way or other. Concerning therfore ecclefial jurisdiction, I find still more controversie, who should administer it, then dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent enquiry made to learn what it is, for had the pains bin taken to search out that, it had bin long agoe enroul'd to be nothing el<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It cannot be conceiv'd that what men now call jurisdiction in the Church, should be other thing then a Christian censorship; and therefore is it most commonly and truly nam'd ecclesiastical censure. Now if the Roman censor a civil function, to that severe assise of survaying and controuling the privatest, and sliest manners of all men and all degrees had no jurisdiction, no courts of plea, or inditement, no punitive force annext, whether it were that to this manner of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection the intanglement of suits was improper, or that the notic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And if the censor in his morall episcopy being to judge most in matters not answerable by writ or action could not use an instrument so grosse and bodily as jurisdiction is, how can the minister of Gospel manage the corpulent and secular trial of bill and processe in things meerly spiritual.

inward bed of corruption, and that hectick disposition to evill, the sourse of all vice, and obliquity against the rule of Law. Which how insufficient it is to cure the soul of man, we cannot better guesse then by the art of bodily phisick. Therfore God to the intent of further healing mans deprav'd mind, to this power of the Magistrat which contents it self with the restraint of evil doing in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal man, added that which we call censure, to purge it and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it clean out of the inmost soul. In the beginning this autority seems to have bin plac't, as all both civil and religious rites once were, only in each father of family. Afterwards among the heathen, in the wise men and Philosophers of the age; but so as it was a thing voluntary, and no set government. More distinctly among the Jews as being Gods peculiar, where the Priests, Levites, Profets, and at last the Scribes and Pharises took charge of instructing, and overseeing the lives of the people. But in the Gospel, which is the straitest and the dearest cov'nant can be made between God and man, wee being now his adopted sons, and nothing fitter for us to think on, then to be like him, united to him, and as he pleases to expresse it, to have fellowship with him, it is all necessity that we should expect this blest efficacy of healing our inward man to be minister'd to us in a more familiar and effectual method then ever before. God being now no more a judge after the sentence of the Law, nor as it were a school maister of perishable rites, but a most indulgent father governing his Church as a family of sons in their discreet age; and therfore in the sweetest and mildest manner of paternal discipline he hath committed this other office of preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in healthful constitution the innerman, which may be term'd the spirit of the soul, to his spiritual deputy the minister of each Congregation; who being best acquainted with his own flock, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And if any thing may be done to inbreed in us this generous and Christianly reverence one of another, the very Nurs and Guardian of piety and vertue, it can not sooner be then by such a discipline in the Church, as may use us to have in aw the assemblies of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, &amp; to count it a thing most grievous, next to the grieving of Gods Spirit, to offend those whom he hath put in autority, as a healing superintendence over our lives and behaviours, both to our own happines and that we may not give offence to good men, who without amends by us made, dare not against Gods command hold communion with us in holy things. And this will be accompanied with a religious dred of being outcast from the company of Saints, and from the fatherly protection of God in his Church, to consort with the devil and his angels. But there is yet a more ingenuous and noble degree of honest shame, or call it if you will an esteem, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men bear an inward reverence toward their own persons.

If this obtaine not, he then with the counsell of more assistants who are inform'd of what diligence hath been already us'd, with more speedy remedies layes neerer siege to the entrenched causes of his distemper, not sparing such servent and well aim'd reproofs as may best give him to see the dangerous estate wherein he is. To this also his brethren and friends intreat, exhort, adjure, and all these endeavours, as there is hope left, are more or lesse repeated. But if, neither the regard of himselfe, nor the reverence of his Elders and friends prevaile with him, to leave his vitious appetite, then as the time urges, such engines of terror God hath given into the hand of his minister as to search the tenderest angles of the heart: one while he shakes his stubbornnesse with racking convulsions nigh dispaire, other whiles with deadly corrosives he gripes the very roots of his faulty liver to bring him to life through the entry of death. Hereto the whole Church beseech him, beg of him, deplore him, pray for him. After all this perform'd with what patience and attendance is possible, and no relenting on his part, having done the utmost of their cure, in the name of God and of the Church they dissolve their fellowship with him, and holding forth the dreadfull sponge of excommunion pronounce him wip't out of the list of Gods inheritance, and in the custody of Satan till he repent. Which hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid sentence though it touch neither life, nor limme, nor any worldly possession, yet has it such a penetrating force, that swifter then any chimicall sulphur, or that lightning which harms not the skin, and rifles the entrals, it scorches the inmost soul. Yet even this terrible denouncement is left to the Church for no other cause but to be as a rough and vehement cleansing medcin, where the malady is obdurat; a mortifying to life, a kind of saving by undoing. And it may be truly said, that as the mercies of wicked men are cruelties, so the cruelties of the Church are mercies. For if repentance sent from heaven meet this lost wanderer, and draw him out of that steep journey wherein he was hasting towards destruction, to come and reconcile to the Church, if he bring with him his bill of health, and that he is now cleare of infection and of no danger to the other sheep, then with incredible expressions of joy all his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren receive him, and set before him those perfumed bankets of Christian consolation; with pretious ointments bathing and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the old and now to be forgotten stripes which terror and shame had inflicted; and thus with heavenly solaces they cheere up

continue so long to them, as by pleasing him they shall deserve, whence it must needs be they should bend all their intentions, and services to no other ends but to his, that if it should happen that a tyrant (God turn such a scourge from us to our enemies) should come to grasp the Scepter, here were his speare men and his lances, here were his firelocks ready, he should need no other pretorian band nor pensionry then these, if they could once with their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious preachments aw the people. For although the Prelats in time of popery were sometimes friendly anough to magnacharta, it was because they stood upon their own bottom, without their main dependance on the royal nod: but now being well acquainted that the protestant religion, if she will reform her self rightly by the Scriptures, must undresse them of all their guilded vanities, and reduce them as they were at first, to the lowly and equall order of Presbyters, they know it concerns them neerly to study the times more then the text, and to lift up their eyes to the hils of the Court, from whence only comes their help; but if their pride grow weary of this crouching and observance, as ere long it would, and that yet their minds clime still to a higher ascent of worldly honour, this only refuge can remain to them, that they must of necessity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive to bring themselves and us back again to the Popes supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, and this we see they had by fair degrees of late been doing. These be the two fair supporters between which the strength of Prelaty is born up, either of inducing tyranny, or of reducing popery. Hence also we may judge that Prelaty is meer falshood. For the property of Truth is, where she is publickly taught, to unyoke &amp; set free the minds and spirits of a Nation first from the thraldom of sin and superstition, after which all honest and legal freedom of civil life cannot be long absent; but Prelaty whom the tyrant custom begot a natural tyrant in religion, &amp; in state the agent &amp; minister of tyranny, seems to have had this fatal guift in her nativity like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Midas</hi> that whatsoever she should touch or come ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But laying down his head among the strumpet flatteries of Prelats, while he sleeps and thinks no harme, they wickedly shaving off all those bright and waighty tresses of his laws, and just prerogatives which were his ornament and strength, deliver him over to indirect and violent councels, which as those Philistims put out the fair, and farre-sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted eyes of his natural discerning, and make him grinde in the prison house of their sinister ends and practices upon him. Till he knowing this prelatical rasor to have bereft him of his wonted might, nourish again his puissant hair, the golden beames of Law and Right; and they sternly shook, thunder with ruin upon the heads of those his evil counsellors, but not without great affliction to himselfe. This is the sum of their loyal service to Kings; yet these are the men that stil cry the King, the King, the Lords Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

What fidelity Kings can expect from Prelats both exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples past, and our present experience of their doings at this day, whereon is grounded all that hath bin said, may suffice to inform us. And if they be such clippers of regal power and shavers of the Laws, how they stand affected to the law giving Parlament, your selves, worthy Peeres and Commons, can best testifie; the current of whose glorious and immortal actions hath bin only oppos'd by the obscure and pernicious defignes of the Prelats: until: their insolen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

broke out to such a bold affront, as hath justly immur'd their haughty looks within strong wals. Nor have they done any thing of late with more diligence; then to hinder or break the happy as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling of Parlaments, however needfull to repaire the shatter'd and disjoynted frame of the Common-wealth, or if they cannot do this, to crosse, to disinable, and traduce all Parlamentary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. And this, if nothing else, plainly accuses them to be no lawful members of the house, if they thus perpetually mutine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their own body. And though they pretend like <hi>Salomons</hi> harlot, that they have right thereto, by the same judgement that <hi>Salomon</hi> gave, it cannot belong to them, whenas it is not onely their assent, but their endeavour continually to divide Parlaments in twain; and not only by dividing, but by all other means to abolish and destroy the free use of them to all posterity. For the which and for all their former misdeeds, wherof this book and many volumes more cannot contain the moytie, I shal move yee Lords in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half I dare say of many thousand good Christians, to let your justice and speedy sentence passe against this great malefactor Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laty.
