            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In the 13. day it pleaſed God to ſend faire weather, by meanes whereof they got in one day &amp; night that which they had before loſt. And being in it, and the fayre weather continuing ſtill, he did follow his voiage, till the 21. at which time they had the ſight of the Ile of <hi>S. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeel.</hi> And the 22. day being Sunday, they approched neere vnto <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>illa Franca,</hi> which is a towne of the ſaid Iland, containing about 500. houſholds.</p>
            <p>The day before they ariued at the Iland, the Marquis diſpatched two Pineſſes, vnder the charge of Capteine <hi>Aguirrei,</hi> who was capteine ouer the fiue aforeſaid, and did ſend in euery one ſixe ſouldiers with Caleuers, giuing them warning to go warilie, and if they ſhould chance to meete with their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Nauie, that they ſhould not come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bord anie of their ſhippes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither ſuffer any of them to come aborde of their pineſſes. And by the ſaid Capteine the Marquis did write vnto <hi>Ambroſe Aguier</hi> gouernour of the ſaid Iland, certifying him how his Maieſties Nauie which he brought was verie ſtrong, conteining 5500. ſouldiers, in which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb facs="tcp:20938:3"/>
was <hi>Don Lopus de Figueroa,</hi> with a 1800 of them of <hi>Flanders,</hi> ouer and aboue 200. Gentlemen and perticular perſons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with their aduantages, who came to ſerue his Maieſtie. And that the Nauie which was made readie in <hi>Calis,</hi> (for the which they did looke euery houre) was of the number and quantitie aforeſaid, with other 5000. ſouldiers, wherof was fiue enſignes of old <hi>Terſua</hi> of <hi>Flaunders.</hi> And the Marquis did deſire the ſaid <hi>Ambroſio de Aguier</hi> to ſend him ſuch newes as he had of the French Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, &amp; whether they had paſſed by that waies or not, and the number of their ſhips: becauſe he was determined to go ſeeke them, and fight with them. And that he ſhould ſay vnto <hi>Peter Piſhoto,</hi> if he ſhoulde chaunce to bee there, that he ſhould make himſelfe readie to follow him with the ſhippes of his charge.</p>
            <p>Whiles the Marquis was at an anker in the road of <hi>Villa Franca,</hi> there did ariue vnto the Admirals ſhip, one Caruaile of the three which were left in <hi>Liſhborne,</hi> for to bring the horſes, who gaue them to vnderſtand, that the day before were ariued to the ſaide <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>illa Franca,</hi> the three ſhippes which were left in <hi>Liſhborne,</hi> who departed from thence the next day after the Marquis, in companie with the ſaide three Carnailes. They reported
<pb facs="tcp:20938:4"/>
likewiſe, that the three ſhips, after they had fallen with <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>illa Franca,</hi> were forced backe againe to the ſea, and that the two carueils were taken by the enemie, the other with the horſes belonging to the generall of the field, and others, went to the ſea, beeing chaſed by a French ſhip.</p>
            <p>The Marquis did ſend ſome perticular men to vnderſtand ſomewhat of them of the Iland, who would not ſuffer them to come aland, but diſcharged their peeces at them. And there was a Preiſt that tolde them that the Iland was for his Maieſtie, and that he knewe nothing of the french Armie, others willed them to goe to the Citie. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe vnderſtanding what had paſſed, and perceiuing by one of the two Pineſſes which hee had ſent with Captain <hi>Aguirre,</hi> that the other Pinaſſe with Captain <hi>Aguirre</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken priſoner by a French Shippe and other Barks that came from the land, hee did then ſuſpect that the Iland had rebelled, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſent for <hi>Don Lopo de Figueroa</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the Feeld, to conferre with him about the landing of ſome quantitie of men to haue ſpech with them of <hi>Villa Franca,</hi> and likewiſe to take freſhe water, and hauing ſent to the Captains <hi>Michel de Oquendo</hi> and <hi>Rodrigo de Vargas,</hi> to take notice in what place they

               </gap>o ſhips, &amp; then they perceiued that it was the armie of <hi>Don Anthonio.</hi> So our armie approching vnto the enimie, and hauing now certaine knowledge of them, for that they prepared them ſelues towards the ſea, and perceiuing them to be aboue 60. ſhips of ſmal and great, the Marquis called a councell, and with the aduice of <hi>Don Pedro de Tolledo,</hi> the Maſter generall of the Campe, the Marquis <hi>de la Fauora, Don Pedro de Taſsis</hi> generall Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troler, <hi>Don Franciſco de Bouadilla</hi> maſter of the Campe, and other Capteins &amp; Knights beeing called therevnto, they determined to preſent the battell, and to fight with the enimie: who did the like, and put themſelues in order, and ſo they diſcharged a peece of ordinance towards vs in token of battaile. With that the Marquis commanded to put foorth a baner of defiance, and ſhot off one peece of ordinance, and ſent Capteine <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roline,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:20938:5"/>
and capteine <hi>Rodrigo de Vergas,</hi> to aduertiſe the whole armie to ſet them ſelues in order of battaile, which was done in this maner: In the forefront was a rowe of ſhips and galions, and of the right hand of the Admirall was placed the galion <hi>Saint Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theo,</hi> wherein was the maſter Generall of the field, and the generall Comptroller: and of the left hand was the ſhip, wherein went <hi>Don Franciſco de Bouadilla</hi> great maſter of the field, and foure ſhips more to be aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants: the ten <hi>Biſcains,</hi> with the other ſhips, wherein was the capteines <hi>Michel de Ouan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> and <hi>Vilia Viſioſa,</hi> were placed in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reward. And by reaſon the ſhip wherin <hi>Don Chriſtopher de Eraſſo</hi> went, had ſtrained the head of hir maine maſt, by meanes whereof ſhe could not beare hir top ſaile, ſhe was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſtaie behind, and could not therefore take hir place accordinglie. Which was a great greefe to the Marquis, to want the companie of <hi>Don Chriſtopher</hi> in ſuch a time of occaſion. The Marquis him ſelfe went in the galian <hi>Saint Marten,</hi> whiche was Admerall of the ſame Nauie. He gaue this order for the battell, that in the uppermoſt ſight vpon the poope ſhould be 20. gentlemen and piſtolets, &amp; 20. caleuers: and belowe the <hi>Portiugal</hi> gentlemen (except <hi>Syr Iames de</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:20938:5"/>
               <hi>Caſtro,</hi> which was vpon the poope) and 20. piſtolets, and 6. caliuers: and loweſt of all ſhould be for helpe and ſuccour <hi>Syr Anthonie Peſſoua, Syr Lewes Oſorio, Syr Goſton Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelio,</hi> the coronell <hi>Mondonario,</hi> captaine <hi>Queſſatha,</hi> and other foure piſtolets: and vpon the hatches of the galion 40. piſtolets vpon either ſide, vnder the charge of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Gamboa:</hi> neere to the chamber of the poope, was the body of the gard, with 40. ſouldiers, moſt of them particuler men, which had bene in office before, vnder the charge of capteine <hi>Auguſtin Deherrara,</hi> for to helpe and ſuccor where ſhould be moſt need. In the ſtarne of the ſhip was <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt Sauffone</hi> gentleman of <hi>Milan,</hi> with the ſerieants of the capteines <hi>Auguſtine Deher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rera,</hi> and <hi>Gamboa,</hi> with 15. piſtolets, and 10. caliuers: in the great top was the ſerieant <hi>Syr Frances Galeio</hi> with 8. caliuers, and in the top of the Trinket ſixe, beſides thoſe that were in the ſmall tops. Vnder the hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches where the great ordinance dooth lie, were the capteins <hi>Syr Chriſtopher Deacco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia,</hi> and <hi>Scouetho,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Alter,</hi> and the ſerieant <hi>Tauſte,</hi> and <hi>Eſquiuel,</hi> and with euerie peece of ordinance one gunner, and ſix men to helpe him. And euerie one had an inſtrument called hanſpiks. With the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
<pb facs="tcp:20938:6"/>
which was vpon the hatches, was <hi>Marcelus Carraceolus:</hi> and like ſeruice was vnderneath. And in keeping of the gunne powder was capteine <hi>Grimaldo,</hi> with foure mariners. He commanded alſo, that there ſhould ſtand hard by the ſterne of the galion, the great bote called the <hi>Salua,</hi> and foure ſmall ones, for to carrie directions, and fill tubbes of water and hogſheads in diuers places of the ſaid galion, and deuide in their places diuers pikes, and that the Mariners ſhould be in the ſhips apparell, and the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teines <hi>Marolin</hi> and <hi>Roger Deuargas</hi> (as ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and of great experience) ſhould attend vnto the ordinance and other neceſſaries. All this was executed verie ſhortlie, and with a great good will. For all this was prouided before they approched vnto the Iland.</p>
            <p>This beeing doone, with great noiſe of wifflers and drums, and their baners open, went our nauie for to inuade the enimies: the which made the like in good order. But bicauſe the wind was calme, they could not fight that day, but went ſeaward. And yet the Marquis could not vnderſtand of the ſtate of the Iland. Afterward foure owers within night ariued vnto the admirall Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, in a Pineſſe, wherin was <hi>Domingo de Adurriaga,</hi> maſter of a ſhip called the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teline,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:20938:6"/>
with other fiue mariners <hi>Biſcaines,</hi> and brought a letter from <hi>Don Iohn de Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilio,</hi> conteining as followeth.</p>
            <p>In the army of <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> there is 58. ſhips, wherof 28. be great ſhips, and the reſt ſmall, and in them is 6000. Frenchmen. If our armie be not ſtrong enough to fight with them, then it may drawe nigh the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, which is for the king. And I would wiſh you to haue a great regarde to it, for if you ſhould looſe the victory, great inconuenience would enſue. Furthermore the Maiſter and his company declared, that <hi>Don Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio</hi> with his armie came to the Iland of <hi>S. Michael</hi> the 15. day of Julie, and the 16. he ſet 3000. men a land, with whome <hi>Don Lorenco Noguera</hi> with iiii. enſigens of foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men did meete, being in number about 500. men, and with 150. Harquebuſhiers taken out of the <hi>Byskaine</hi> ſhippes, who a litle from the citie did ſkirmiſh with the french armie, but being ouerpreſſed with nomber, were forced to retire to the Caſtle to <hi>Peter Piſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> with the loſſe of 10. <hi>Caſtellions,</hi> and 12. <hi>Byſcaynes, <hi>Don Lorenco</hi>
               </hi> being hurt, wherof after he dyed: and in the Caſtle with <hi>Peter Piſoto</hi> is the ſonne of the gouernour <hi>Ambro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio de Aguiar,</hi> and the Biſhop, the Corigedor, and other two or three Gentlemen, and all
<pb facs="tcp:20938:7"/>
the reſt went out of the citie, calling ſome of <hi>Don Anthonio,</hi> and the ſouldiours of the Frenche armie ſacked the Citie: and that <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> ſent to the Captaine <hi>Don Iohn de Caſtillio,</hi> willing him to yeeld vnto him the caſtle, knowing it to be his, and that he would giue him free paſſage for him and his company: the which thing if he refuſed, that then he would bring aland 7. peeces of Ordinance from the ſhips, and would bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Caſtle: &amp; moreouer he gaue him to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that the armie of <hi>Spaine</hi> woulde not come this yeere. To whom <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> the gouernours ſonne, the Biſhop, and the Cori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedor made anſwere, that the Caſtle was the king of <hi>Spaines,</hi> and that they woulde not yeeld it to him. The Marquis did likewiſe vnderſtande by the ſaide Maiſter, that the Frenche men the next daye (hauing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the approching of our armie) did imbarke themſelues in all haſt, and that the 2. Gallions and 3. great Caruelles of <hi>Peter Piſoto,</hi> were ouerthrowne neere vnto the Caſtle, and the 4. <hi>Byskaine</hi> ſhips the French men tooke, after that the men were gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and withdrawen themſelues into the Caſtle. The Marquis being informed of all things, wrote vnto the Captaine and Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, &amp; others in the Caſtle, by the ſaid Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
<pb facs="tcp:20938:7"/>
incouraging them, and certifying them of the force of the kings army, not doubting but the next day to giue battell, and to haue the victorye, and that therewith they ſhould holde them ſelues contented, as he him ſelfe was much ioyful of the ſeruice which they had alredy done to the king, which he knew ſhould not remain vnrecompenſed. And with this anſwere they returned with the Pinaſſe to the Iland.</p>
            <p>The next day being Munday, &amp; the 23. of Julie, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two Armies came to preſent battel: the french Armie hauing both the vantage of the wind and alſo of the Sun, came to aſſalt our Armie being deuided in three quadrons, and made three ſeuerall attempts, and yet could put nothing in execution. And toward night the Spaniſh Army making towardes the ſea, the french Armie placed ten ſhippes alongſt the Iland, thinking that night to haue got the winde of vs: but by reaſon it was calme, they could not preuaile.</p>
            <p>The 24. day of July the Marquis retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, approching nerer the French army, who hauing the vantage of the winde, gaue two ſeuerall attempts, and yet put neither in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. Then the Marquis perceiuing that the courſe towardes the land was not conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for him, he cauſed the armie to take the
<pb facs="tcp:20938:8"/>
courſe towardes the Sea, thinking with himſelfe that whiles his ſhippes were trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of their ſayles, that the enemie woulde aſſault him hauing the winde for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: which fell out accordingly. For one of the Frenche Captaines with 7. Galleons came to aſſault the Captaine of the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes, and the Galleon <hi>Saint Matteo,</hi> but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching neere vnto them, did not board them, but diſcharged great quantitiae of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance againſt them, and likewiſe did the reſt of the ſhips againſt ours: of whom they were receiued accordingly, in ſo much that our Captaine did ſhoote of at them aboue 40. peeces, and alſo the Galleon <hi>Saint Matteo</hi> ſhotte of many peeces, alſo the ſhippe of <hi>Don Chriſtopher de Eraſſo</hi> (who was now ioyned with the armie) and alſo the ſhippe of <hi>Don Franciſco de Bouadilla,</hi> and <hi>Myguell de O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quendo,</hi> and others, which was a pleaſaunt ſight to beholde what Ordenance was ſhotte off, they did hit our Captaine with 4. ſhotte, one in the foreſaile, another in the ſhrouds, another vpon an Anker, and the fourth in the ſhippes ſide, without doing any harme: they hit the Galleon <hi>Saint Matteo</hi> with 3 ſhotte, without doing any harme, no more did many their peeces which did hit many of our ſhips. And in the Galleons of the Frenchmen wee
<pb facs="tcp:20938:8"/>
might perceiue many ſhot to light, but ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally 4. out of our <hi>Captaine,</hi> which made them to retire, whereby it appeared they receiued ſome harme.</p>
            <p>There came in the Frenche armie two Captaines &amp; two Admirals, and there was a ſmall Galleon like a <hi>Patacha,</hi> being excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent good of ſayle, wherein it ſhoulde ſeeme <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> was, carying a ſtandarde in the Poope, which did not approch the fight, but kept a farre off to beholde what paſſed. There came to the number of 40, gret ſhips, and amongſt them ſome very fine Galleons, the reſt were ſmall ſhippes, but fit for the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie in reſpect of the lightnes, and there came diuers other ſmall Pineſſes all about the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie about 2. or 3. leagues of to diſcouer and vnderſtand of all things, and alſo 2. Saities of <hi>Mercelles,</hi> very good ſhippes of ſayle, and many other light Boates with owres, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they did put in order the battaile, and direct things as time ſerued. The ſame day at night the two armies did ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. The Marquis determined that at the going downe of the Moone to procure to get the wind of the French armie, and in the morning to aſſault them againe, which hee did, ſo that the 25. day of July he found him ſelfe to windward of the enemy, &amp; ſo ſought
<pb facs="tcp:20938:9"/>
to board them, but bicauſe his ſhippes were great and heauie of ſaile, he could not put in effect that which he purpoſed, but was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to returne to the reſcue of <hi>Don Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher de Eraſſo,</hi> who was in ſome diſtreſſe in following the enemie, and by defaulte of his maine maſt, gaue him a toe with his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. This day there was diſcried a great ſhippe of the enemies which wanted her fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſt, and other 2. ſhips which did helpe her, and they being not able to helpe her, ſhe was forced to ſinke: it is iudged ſhee had ſome harme with ſome ſhot the day before.</p>
            <p>Of the 10. Hulkes of the Spaniſh armie there did want two which caryed <hi>Almaines,</hi> and there wanted likewiſe the three ſhippes that departed from <hi>Liſhborne</hi> after the army departed, ſo that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Marques had in his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie no more but 25. ſhippes with the two gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions.</p>
            <p>The 26 of Julie the Frenche armie came againe to aſſault the Spaniſh armie, in very good order and with a fauourable wind. The Marques did cauſe his ſhips to be placed in order, although the galleon <hi>Saint Matteo</hi> was ſomewhat aſterne, which was ſome greefe to the Marquis, doubting that the enimy might board hir, before ſhe could conueniently be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcued: and ſo it fell out, for ſhe was borded
<pb facs="tcp:20938:9"/>
by two galleons, a captaine and an admirall, againſt whom ſhe did defend her ſelf very va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly, being likewiſe aſſalted by other two ſhippes, who after they had diſcharged cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ordinance at her, paſſed forwards. At the ſame time came other two French ſhips vppon the Captaine, who beginning to fight with her, ſhe gaue them two ſuch welcomes with her ordinance and arquebuſhe ſhotte, that the one of them was euill to paſſe and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſonke: and ſo they retyred, hauing ſhot many peeces at the Captaine, and the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine at them. At which time came the ſhip of <hi>Don Franciſco de Bouadilla,</hi> who was nere the Capteine, who did likewiſe annoie the Frenchmen greatlie with hir ſhot.</p>
            <p>All this while did the Admirall, and the Viceadmirall of the French army fight with the galion <hi>Saint Mattheo,</hi> who did defend hir ſelfe, and offend the others valiantlie: the generall maſter of the Campe, <hi>Don Lopo de Figueroa, Don Pedro de Taſsis</hi> ouerſeer ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, with the reſt of the gentlemen and ſouldiers that were in hir, valiantlie ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the enimies bath with great ſhot, arquebuſhot, and muſket ſhot. The Marquis perceiuing that the Spaniſh nauie was to the windward of the French nauie, &amp; ſeeing the diſtreſſe that the galleon <hi>S. Mattheo</hi> was
<pb facs="tcp:20938:10"/>
in by reaſon of the two French men, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the Captaine to turne towards the enemie, &amp; ſo did <hi>Don Chriſtopher de Eraſſo,</hi> and the reſt of the ſhippes of the Spaniſh ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: and the ſhippes of <hi>Michael de Oquendo, Vilia Vicioſa,</hi> and another <hi>Biskain,</hi> which were before the ſternemoſt, by changing the wind were then the foremoſt, who came and borded the Admirall of the French nauie, who fought with the galeon <hi>Saint Mattheo,</hi> and afterward came the ſhip, wherein went <hi>Michael de Veneſa,</hi> who fought with the capteine of France like a good Capteine, and ſo in like ſort did the ſouldiers that were with him, and bicauſe his ſhip was betwene, the Marquis could not at that time board the Capteine of France, but paſſed forward. In this meane time the Admirall of France was in ſight with the galeon <hi>Saint Mattheo,</hi> and three ſhips more, who borded hir, <hi>Villia Vicioſa</hi> being one of the three, and hauing borded the French Admirall at the prowe, was ſlaine, with manie of his companie, as ſhall be declared. The ſhip of <hi>Oquendo</hi> did board hir aſterne, and did enter his men into hir, and began to ſacke, and tooke foure priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and the enſignes. The battell began now to encreaſe: with that came two other French ſhips to reſkew their Capitaine, and
<pb facs="tcp:20938:10"/>
putting aboard hir aboue 300. freſh men, ſhe got from them.</p>
            <p>In this meane while the Marquis gaue an other aſſault vpon the enimie with much ſhot, and at the laſt borded with the French Capteine prowe to prowe, and ſo grapened togither, where was a cruell fight of both ſides, ſhooting the one at the other both with great ſhot and ſmal, for the ſpace of an houre, till ſhe yeelded, where was beheaded aboue 300. Frenchmen, and the Gentlemen and ſouldiers that were in the two fights, did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them ſelues valiantlie: ſo likewiſe did the two capteins <hi>Auguſtine Deherrara,</hi> and <hi>Gamboa,</hi> and their Lieuetenants. The Marquis like a generall went through the fights, encouraging the people to the aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the enimie, foreſeeing and ordering all things needfull to be doone. The artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie both belowe and aloft did great good, through the great diligence of thoſe capteins that had charge thereof. The battell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the other ſhips did proceede, giuing and receiuing great chargings one vpon an other. The battell continued fiue houres, and at the laſt the enimie fled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> was departed in a ſmall Pineſſe, with another ſhip the night before the battell. Some ſhips were ſonke, &amp; ſome
<pb facs="tcp:20938:11"/>
ſpoiled, hauing beheaded the men that were found in them, and ſome fled to other ſhips. And for that we could not toe their ſhips, the Marquis commanded that we ſhould burne them, and ſinke ſuch as we could, as we had begun to doo. The Caruaile with the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which they had taken, was recouered.</p>
            <p>It is thought that there is of the enimies aboue 1200. ſlaine, drowned, and beheaded, beſides manie that be hurt, of them that eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the ſhips which fled. There might haue bene taken manie of their ſhips more, if we had had time and mariners ſufficient for to haue towed them, but they were ſuffered to depart without men and ſpoiled: and it is certaine, that the Admirall which was left for halfe drowned, and other foure or ſiue ſhips more, were ouerthrowne in the Ile of <hi>Saint Michael,</hi> and it it thought others haue done the like in other places.</p>
            <p>The number of thoſe that were ſlaine in the Nauie of the Spaniards, was 224 men: and of thoſe that were hurt 553. which is in all 777. Beſides ſome that were ſcalded with artificiall fire, amongſt whom was the generall Comptroller <hi>Syr Peter de Taſsis</hi> in the face.</p>
