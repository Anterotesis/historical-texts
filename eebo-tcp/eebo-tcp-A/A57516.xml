            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Coppy of a Letter from Sir <hi>Thomas Rowe</hi> Lord Embassador Extraordinary for His Majesty in Germany, to the Earle of <hi>Holland, &amp;c.</hi>

            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have heard that the French Embassadour hath by your Lordships mediation preferred a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint against me in the House of Peeres: <hi>That I have offered to the King of Hungary, in the Name of His Majesty my Master a League Offensive and Defensive against all Men, upon condition of restitution and reintegration of the Prince Elector Palatine to his Lands and Dignities: which being in contravention of the League between His Majesty, the French King, and the United States, was offensively ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi> In which he desired reparation.</p>
            <p>I could have wished so much moderation in the French Embassador (if the jealousie proceed from himselfe) that he had first been well grounded to have proved his Accusation: If by Order from the King his Master, that he would have been pleased, to have asked this Question of His Majesty, before he brought it into publique, to whom, he cannot doubt, that I have given account of my Actions?</p>
            <p>But seeing he hath presented me before the Lords, I am not sorry nor unwilling to purge my selfe before so Honorable Judges: nor that I am fallen into your Lordships Hands, who I presume will do me equall Justice (which I beseech of you) to represent my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer before their Lordship, which is,</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:29873:3"/>
With all Reverence to the thrice Christian King, and due respect to his Embassador, as his representant, and without relation to the command of the one, or obedience to the other: the whole Accusation in Forme and Matter, in Substance and Circumstances, is unjust, and in the first Inventor false, and against In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, Truth, and Faithfull service, Scandalous.</p>
            <p>I never received any such Power, nor Instruction, from his Majesty, my Master, nor had the boldnesse, infidelity, or indiscretion, to presume to do it of my selfe; but so far the contrary, that I have often openly, authentically, and seriously professed against any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or overture of any confederation directly or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently against the Crownes of France and Swede, and the United Provinces, his Majesties Friends and Allies, which is Registred in many Publike Acts, which I could produce, testifie by all the Embassadors, Mediators in this Treaty, but that I value my owne Witnesse equall, and sufficient against my Accuser.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship and many of the honorable Peeres, have long known me: I am not ignorant, either of my Duty, or the present conjuncture of Europe, and shall end with this Profession: that as I am a faithfull Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to my Master, so I am a good and true English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, neither French, Spanish, Austrian, nor Dutch, nor for any respects shall ever be: which I wish were the true Character of all my Countrymen, of which, when I shall have the honor to render an Accompt (if I be called unto it) to the high Court of Parliament, I am confident that I shall not onely justifie all my Actions, but make it appear to my owne Advantage, That in a businesse of so much perplexity, and of so


<pb facs="tcp:29873:3"/>
many Relations, wherein I have stood alone; That I have both understood my imployment and the present condition of Publique Affaires; and principally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected all my scope to the honour of his Majesty, the safety and advantage of his Kingdomes, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of true Religion in those places, where it hath pleased God, both to plant and purge it, by his Chastisements. And thus much, out of your innate Cander and ingenuity, and for a Testimony of your Lordships Favour to me, I beseech you humbly to present, in my Name, to the house of Peeres: That they may be pleased to Register, and Publish my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation, for the Vindication of my honesty and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, wherein you shall infinitely Oblige.</p>

            <head>The Coppy of another Letter from Sir <hi>Thomas Rowe,</hi> to Master <hi>Edward Waller,</hi> one of the Members of the House of Commons, concerning the French Embassadors Accusation against him, in the House of Peeres.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Was confident that the whole course of my Life, and the warinesse I have learnt by long experience, would have prevented my necessity of making an Apologie, especially to the Honourable House of Commons (whereof I am an humble Member) either of my intentions or Actions. But having understood that I have been Accused by the French Embassador, <hi>To have offered to the King of Hungary, in the Name of His Majesty, my Master, a League Offensive and Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive against all men, upon condition of restitution and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>integration of the Prince Elector Palatine to his Lands and dignities, which being in contravention of the League between His Majesty, the French King, and the United States, was offensively taken, and therefore repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration required.</hi> I have thought it my Duty, both to His Majesty, and for the Justification of my fidelity, and the tender care of my reputation, wounded in the high Court of Parliament, to desire this Office of


<pb facs="tcp:29873:4"/>
Friendship from you, to represent my Answer.</p>
            <p>First, That I never received any such Power nor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions from His Majesty, my Master, nor that any respect could so far decline me from my Duty, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake of my selfe to transgresse both my Order and against my own judgement. Therefore I must protest, with all reverence to the thrice Christian King, and due respect to his Embassador as his representant, and without Relation to the command of the one, or obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the other; the whole Accusation in forme and matter, in substance and circumstance, is unjust, and in the first Inventer false, and against Innocency, Truth, and Faithfull service, Scandalons.</p>
            <p>It is very easie to Blot and Stain the purest Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency; but I am confident, in the equity and Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the house of Commons, that they will not onely give credit to my assertion, but that they will so far regard the reputation of one of their Members, as to Blot out and expunge all Record or Memory of this Imputation; and that they will please to beleeve, that I both understand my Duty, and the present State of the troubled World, and that all my Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations have principally respected the honour and conveniency of my King and Country: of which I shall render such an Account as every Accusation shall turn to my advantage.</p>
            <p>I will not reflect upon the scope of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint against me, knowing well their Wisedomes will easily penetrate, that there may lye hid other designes, then to disgrace a private Man: but hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly


<pb facs="tcp:29873:5"/>
desireing, they will be pleased, as far, and wide to publish my integrity, as it hath beene defamed: I will no further trouble them, nor you, but rest.</p>
