            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe maine Reaſons ſuggeſted by the Minors for the paſſing of this Bill, is, That the paying of this Cuſtomary Duty of the Tyth or Tenth of Lea<gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> Oare, waſhed and clenſed from earth and Rubbiſh, being allowed onely one penny for the waſhing of euery tenth Diſh or Meaſure, will diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the Minors from working, and that this Duty is but lately exacted from the poorer ſort of Minors.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Both theſe Suggeſtions are meerely vntrue, as by the Reaſons following may appeare.</head>
               <p n="1">1. FIrſt this is an ancient cuſtomary Duty, and hath time out of mind beene payed in the high Peake and all other places where Lead Oare hath beene gotten in that County to the ſeuerall Miniſters and Proprietors in right of their Churches, as may appeare by Deeds without Date, ancient Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. The Miniſters and Proprietors of the ſaid Cuſtomary Tythe, or Duty of Lead Oare in that Country haue paid and doe pay to his Maieſty firſt Fruits and other Duties accordingly, for this Cuſtomary Duty of Tythe Oare, in particular, as by their ſeuerall compoſitions in the firſt Fruites Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice ſhall appeare.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The King hath alwayes had and hath an ancient Officer ouer the Myne, called a Barre-Maiſter, whoſe Office amongſt other things is to ſee this <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uty paid, as appeares by Record in the Dutchy.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Of late time ſome Minors being encouraged by men of great power, for their owne particular intereſt haue denyed to pay this ancient Duty.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Vpon which denyall a Bill was exhibited into the Exchequer Chamber for a Proprietor of this Duty, and a Decree thereupon obtained vpon f<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll Hearing againſt the ſaid Minors, and another Bill was exhibited into the Court of Wards in right of a Ward, Farmer to the Deane and Chapter <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Lichfield, where the Poſſeſſion of this Duty was eſtabliſhed likewiſe by Iniunction of that Court againſt the Minors.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Minors vpon the ſame pretence which they now alledge in this Bill in Parliament obtained Order at the Counſell Table to retaine the ſaid Cauſe there, and to ſtay all further proceedings at Law: And their Lordſhips after ſeuerall Hearings at the Councell Table, referred this Cauſe to a Tryall at the Common-pleas Barre, which accordingly was had, and after full and long Euidence giuen of both Parties, the Verdict paſſed againſt the Minors in Eaſter Terme, 1620.</p>
               <p n="7">7 The Minors not yet ſatisfied obtained of their Lordſhips to haue a ſecond Tryall at the ſame Barre of the Court of Common Pleas, which alſo was had, and after full and long euidence againe giuen of both Parties, another Verdict paſſed againſt the Minors for the Proprietor of the ſaid cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Duty, in Michaelmas Terme, 1620.</p>
               <p n="8">8. His Maieſty then being petitioned in this Cauſe, referred the conſideration of it to the Right Reuerend Father in God, the Lord Arch-biſhop of Canterbury, and Right Honourable the Lord Preſident of the Councell, who after full Examination of all former proceedings had in this Cauſe in Iuly 1621. certified his Maieſtie that they thought fit that the ſaid Tythe or cuſtomary Tenth of Lead Oare ſhould bee eſtabliſhed according to the ſaid <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>wo Trials at Law, and the ſaid Decree had in the Exchequer.</p>
               <p n="9">9. His Maieſty againe referring the whole Buſines concerning the Tyth or cuſtomary Tenth of Lead Oare vnto the Councel Table: their Lordſhips vpon due conſideration taken of all former proceedings in the Cauſe, did by their Order of the 5. of October 1621. cleerely diſmiſſe and diſcharge the whole Cauſe concerning the ſaid Tythe or Tenth of Lead Oare, from the Board, and left it to the full fruition and benefit of the Law, with this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, that becauſe the Proprietors and Owners of the ſaid Tythe or Tenth had receiued loſſe by being ſtayed at the Board vpon pretence from the Minors of ſome poynt of State which their Lordſhips there declared to be otherwiſe. Therefore their Lordſhips in an Honourable reſpect of them the ſaid Miniſters and Proprietors, did wiſh that they might haue all the ſpeed and expedition that the Law in Iuſtice might afford them, as by the ſaid Order may appeare.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Since which diſmiſſion two ſeuerall Bills were exhibited into the Chancery touching the right of the ſaid Tythe or Tenth of Lead Ore; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon after examination of Witneſſes and Publication of the Depoſitions, and other due proceedings, two ſeuerall Decrees were made in the ſaid Court againſt the Minors, the one in Michaelmas Terme, 1622. and the other in Michaelmas Terme laſt paſt.</p>
               <p n="11">11. During the Dependancie and continuance of all which Suites and contentions, the Minors in the Pariſhes where, and when great men meddled not, did all the time of theſe Suits, and ſtill doe conſtantly pay the ſaid Tythe or Tenth of Lead Ore.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The Lords of the Soyle and their Farmours haue two ſeuerall Duties from the Minors, the Cope which in ſome places is foure pence, and in others ſixe pence for euery Load, and the Lot which is euery thirteenth Diſh, for which the Lords are to allow the Minors Wood for their Groues, or holes where they get their Oare, as by the cuſtome of the Mine appeares, which allowance the Lords of the Soyle of late haue refuſed to make the Minors, in recompence of which loſſe they are ready to further the Sute againſt the Miniſters and Propriators of the Tythe or Tenth.</p>
               <p>By all theſe proceedings it appeares that in poynt of Law the Title is cleered againſt the Minors in Law, by the two Verdicts: in poynt of equity it is likewiſe cleere againſt them, by the ſeuerall Decrees in Courts of equity, one in the Exchequer Chamber and two in the Chancery, and for matter of State, it is alſo cleered by the Order and proceedings of the Councell Table. Therefore this being the Inheritance of the ſaid Miniſters and Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etors; and hauing in a manner paſſed all the Courts of Iuſtice at Weſtminſter and the Councell Board, they hope this Honourable Houſe will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherite them.</p>
               <p>All the Premiſes the Miniſters and Proprietors of the ſaid Tythe or Tenth of Lead Oare doe auerre to be true vpon their Houſe, and are ready prepared to proue the ſame by the ſeuerall Records and proofes by them alleadged.</p>
