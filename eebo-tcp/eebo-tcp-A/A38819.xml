            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>This <hi>Information</hi> of the Plot was five years ſince given by me to perſons herein ſpecified, but was ſuppreſſed; and was again now of late tendered a-new to the Committee of the Lords ſitting in Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> upon Oath, the <hi>21</hi>ſt of <hi>December, 1678.</hi> And is now ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd by me to the Commons.</head>
            <p>WHILE I was employed as Agent at the <hi>French</hi> Court for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Militia's Concerns, one of the Officers brought me at <hi>Paris</hi> to the acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of my Lady <hi>Anne Gourdon,</hi> Siſter to the now Marqueſs of <hi>Huntley</hi> in <hi>Scotland.</hi> She after about a years frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, communicated unto me certain important ſecrets concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Popiſh Plot</hi> againſt <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She's a Lady of vaſt correſpondence with the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Clergy and Nobility almoſt through all <hi>Europe;</hi> living ordinarily as a free perſon in Nunneries, and was then in a Convent at <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At a time I ſurprized her with two of the chief <hi>Scotch</hi> Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts of <hi>Paris,</hi> in a deep and dark diſcourſe of the Engliſh Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; and as ſoon as my Lady made them underſtand that I was one of her privateſt Friends, and Catholickly affected (it being fit ſhe ſhould imagine this) they begun to ſpeak plain enough, to let me perceive that their diſcourſe tended to ſome ſudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign for the ſubverſion of the Engliſh Government and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and the ſetting up of <hi>Popery</hi> here in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But on ſome day of the Month of <hi>November,</hi> 1673, I enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of my Lady what thoſe myſterious diſcourſes meaned ſhe had with the <hi>Scotch</hi> Prieſt? She after long importunities and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations, revealed unto me that which follows.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:93950:3"/>
I. That there was now a grand Deſign on foot in <hi>England,</hi> for the ſetling of the Catholick Faith there publickly.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That there was alſo a project againſt the Parliament that made ſuch a ſtir (as ſhe ſpoke) and was their obſtacle, either to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally to diſſolve it, or to ſow ſome diviſions betwixt the King and It; where his Majeſty alſo ſhould find potent Adverſaries of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Nobility, who would cut out work for him.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That there was a very conſiderable party in <hi>England,</hi> who laboured to make the Duke of <hi>York</hi> King, but that the <hi>Scots</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were more for the Duke of <hi>Monmouths</hi> being ſuch, if means could be made to bring him over to it, wherein ſhe conceived I might be an uſeful Inſtrument, having been employed under him. But ſaid I, What do they mean to do with the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? She anſwered,</p>
            <p n="1">I. That the now King of <hi>England</hi> would be made away, and diſpatcht after his Father, ſo that he would not be ſhortly in a caſe to annoy any body.</p>
            <p>Then I askt her by what means they thought to bring ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters about? and who were the leading-men in the contrivance, and who the Under-agents to carry it on? She ſaid, That all that was too much for me to know at the firſt time; beſides, that it was then too late at night; but that at my return within three days (for avoiding of ſuſpition) I ſhould be fully ſatisfied. But I inſiſted, That theſe were grand affairs whereof ſhe ſpoke, for which conſequently ſhe needed to have more than common grounds. She replied, that I ought not to doubt but that ſhe had the beſt correſpondency in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the one part Madam <hi>de Gourdon</hi> her Aunt, one of the chief Ladies with the Dutcheſs of <hi>Orleance,</hi> which was taken to be of the fitteſt for Intelligence and Intrigues at the <hi>French</hi> Court; and on the other ſide, that ſhe received Letters almoſt every week from the eminenteſt Church-men on this and that ſide of the ſea, as alſo from ſome of the greateſt Nobility of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> namely, from her Brother the Marqueſs of <hi>Huntley,</hi> my Lord <hi>Oxenford</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> Mr. <hi>Maitland</hi> (ſomewhat concerned, as ſhe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93950:3"/>
ſaid, in the Secretaryſhip of Miniſtry of State of <hi>Scotland)</hi> and from the Earl of <hi>Roches</hi> Chancellor there; but ſhe afterwards run out into ſome of his Love commerce with her; ſo that I leave to others to infer from the premiſes to which, either to Love, or the Plot-part, or all of this his Letter-Correſpondency muſt be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And to confirm further the credit I muſt yeild to her words, ſhe drew forth a Bag full of Letters, a matter of a Buſhel full, and ſhewed ſome more in a Cabinet, ſaying, Are theſe all about trifles, think you? She further produced a picture in mignature of the ſaid Chancellor, and went about to read one of his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (of a large and ill-ſhaped Character methought), but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, referring me till the fore-mentioned three days term. I in fine, asked how ſhe could avoid ſuſpition, if ſo many Letters were directed to her in her own name? She told me ſhe had taken a good care for that, becauſe her Correſpondents writ to her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſeveral names by which they called her, and part of her Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were directed to Mr. <hi>Conne</hi> a <hi>Scotch-man,</hi> living at <hi>Paris</hi> as Agent for the Pope, others were addreſſed to Mr. <hi>Dalliſon</hi> her <hi>Scotch</hi> Phyſician there, ſome to Father <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Prior of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Benedictines at <hi>Paris,</hi> who was her Confeſſor.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Now in the interval, having before been recommended by Dr. <hi>Brien,</hi> Dr. <hi>Molony</hi> Prieſts, and others, to Colonel <hi>Richard Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot,</hi> and to his Brother <hi>Peter</hi> (the pretended Archbiſhop of <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin)</hi> for a perſon that carried on buſineſs after the formalities of the Court of <hi>France,</hi> and the Colonel himſelf having made ſome tryal of me; he on a time deſired me to be aſſiſtant to his Brother the Biſhop, not long ſince come out of <hi>England:</hi> The Biſhop deſired I ſhould go and complement on his behalf, the Marſhal <hi>Bellefond</hi> (Grand Steward to the King of <hi>France),</hi> and know when he might be introduced by him to the Kings Audience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the buſineſs whereof he treated with the Marſhal himſelf while he was in <hi>England</hi> as Ambaſſador (in or about the year 1670.)</p>
            <p>The Marſhal being then at Court, kept at <hi>Verſaile,</hi> the Biſhop would have one Mr. <hi>Moore,</hi> a Prieſt and Philoſophy-Profeſſor at <hi>Paris,</hi> to accompany us thither on the next day, having lain that night at <hi>Verſaile;</hi> and the Biſhop ſtriving to make us all merry on the good Catholick Cauſes ſucceſs, I took that opportunity to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93950:4"/>
enquire, whether he thought it not fit to communicate unto me the Heads and Grounds of this affair wherein he was pleaſed to make me his Speaker and Introducer at Court, leſt, ſaid I, any occaſion might happen for me to ſecond it. The buſineſs that I am to repreſent to the King of <hi>France</hi> is this:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">Articles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Talbots.</hi>
               </note> I. It is a buſineſs, ſaid he, which mightily concerns the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Catholicks in <hi>England,</hi> and of thoſe in <hi>Ireland</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That he was to propoſe ways to the King of <hi>France,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to relieve them in their preſent extremities and perſecutions, and for to undertake their protection; and ſome of his ways was to Arm ſome <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and to ſecure ſome Sea-Port Town in <hi>Ireland</hi> for the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. He ſaid that he had a ſpecial good Warrant and Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for this his Negotiation from ſome of the greateſt perſons in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. That he was to ſolicit his Chriſtian Majeſty for a Penſion, or the Arrears payable to himſelf. The next morning I went to the Kings Riſing to acquaint the Marſhal <hi>Bellefond,</hi> that the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>Talbot</hi> was in Town to wait on His Majeſty and Him; he wiſh't me to introduce him: The Marſhal knew him at firſt ſight, and imbraced him, and acquainted the King with his coming; His Majeſty receiving him with great civility, led him into a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Room, where Mr. <hi>Moore</hi> and I following them, he beck'ned to Mr. <hi>Moore</hi> that had the paper, to advance: But I from the door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſaw the Biſhop preſent a Letter to the King, and other pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, which I think were ſealed. I over-heard he ſpoke in <hi>Italian</hi> at firſt entrance, their Conference laſted about half an hour; and though that King is ſomewhat of a Grave, and ſomewhat Moroſe temper, yet he often ſmiled, as at Propoſitions that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him.</p>
            <p>But at our coming out from Court, I enquired of the Biſhop of the good ſucceſs of his Negotiation, which I told him ſeemed to be of other or more matters then he acquainted me with. No, ſaid he, 'tis but of the ſame matter I ſpoke to you of laſt night;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93950:5"/>
whereof he ſaid, I ſhould know more, ſeeing he muſt come to Court again and again about it, though the King (conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued he) promiſed all poſſible ſatisfaction and hopes of a good iſſue. So, not to increaſe ſuſpicion by further inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, I urged him no more, but departed from him for that time to <hi>Paris.</hi> Yet note, that Mr. <hi>Moore</hi> did alſo generally touch unto me the Matters of the aforeſaid Articles and Plot, having heard it from the ſaid Biſhop, <hi>Peter Talbot,</hi> and his papers.</p>
            <p>And further obſerve, That one Mr. <hi>Conne</hi> a <hi>Scotch-man</hi> (who was formerly the Popes Nuncio, and then his Agent at <hi>Paris)</hi> had almoſt every day private Conferences with both the <hi>Talbots,</hi> and went betwixt them, their Nuncio, then being at <hi>Paris;</hi> and that the <hi>Talbots</hi> and this <hi>Conne</hi> came often to my Lady <hi>Anne Huntleys,</hi> though my Lady had alſo another pretext to ſee <hi>Conne.</hi> The very ſame night I did communicate all that paſt in this <hi>Peter Talbot</hi>'s Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation to Sir <hi>Robert Welſh,</hi> as I had done before that other Plot of Lady <hi>Huntleys,</hi> both fearing leſt this grand ſecret might dye with me, I having many Enemies daily threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning me then at <hi>Paris;</hi> and for that this Sir <hi>Robert</hi> was a man that ſtill made much profeſſion of his Actings, Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Loyalty for the King of <hi>England,</hi> in ſuch former diſcoveries; but Sir <hi>Roberts</hi> truer Character I found out too late.</p>
            <p>However Sir <hi>Robert</hi> moſt unfaithfully forthwith diſcovered all to Colonel <hi>Talbot,</hi> both that of my Lady <hi>Huntleys,</hi> and the <hi>Talbots</hi> buſineſs; and that I intended ſpeedily to go for <hi>England</hi> to accuſe both him and his brother <hi>Peter;</hi> the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel feigning to keep his bed, deſires to ſpeak with me at his own Lodging. The Circumſtances of the meſſage with the Premiſſes weighed, I took one or two along with me to his very<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chamber door on another pretext; he preſently deſired to know when I intended for <hi>England,</hi> and when I had ſeen Sir <hi>Robert Welſh.</hi> But by this much, forthwith perceiving I was betrayed; I pretended another occaſion of that voyage; for which beſides I ſeemed not to be very earneſt, if either in <hi>Paris,</hi> or with the now Dutcheſs of <hi>York</hi> (then at <hi>Paris)</hi> he would procure me ſome fit employment of Secretary, or Uſher. And at firſt he went about to perſwade me from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93950:6"/>
over into <hi>England</hi> at all. Then began to threaten me man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; and if he heard I did otherwiſe than I ſaid, in ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away for <hi>England</hi> on ſuch occaſions againſt them and the Catholicks, they would infallibly procure I ſhould be forthwith committed to the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London</hi> or the <hi>Gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,</hi> at my arrival; which accordingly happened according to his ſpightful propheſie, about ſeven days after I arrived at <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That ſeeing the effect of his threatnings fall out ſo pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually, and not doubting thereupon, but that he, with Sir <hi>Robert Welſh,</hi> and Correſpondents here, were the ſecret Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers of my four years cloſe impriſonment in the <hi>Tower</hi> (though a very remote ſurpriſe was put in by them for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text) therefore I ſaid I was afraid to charge them much, and but warily, whilſt I was in the <hi>Tower,</hi> fearing to fare the worſe by the means of any ſecret friend of theirs.</p>

               <head>EVIDENCES.</head>
               <p>THE aforeſaid Sir <hi>Robert Welſh</hi> his Evidence, now in <hi>London,</hi> may firſt confirm the truth of this my Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for he being now in <hi>London,</hi> can witneſs that I diſclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to him all the ſaid Treaſons about five years ſince, in or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Month of <hi>November</hi> 1673; ſo that it cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that this my Information is ſome new matter fitted for the times againſt <hi>Papiſts;</hi> nor that it is ſome odious new-coined ſlander, according to the humour and device of ſome diſſenting parties (as <hi>Papiſts</hi> cavil), ſeeing that by four or five witneſſes hereafter mentioned, who are none of my Friends, it undeniably appears that I diſcovered this ſaid Plot many years before theſe times were thought of; nay, and in ſuch a time when I never had ſeen <hi>England,</hi> or knew any perſon there, either by Letters or otherwiſe (except ſuch Officers of the Army that were then in <hi>France).</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. I did not know but that Sir <hi>Robert Welſh</hi> or ſome other had hinted theſe matters to ſome Miniſter of State.</p>
               <p n="2">II. I began to diſcover ſome of theſe matters to Sir <hi>John</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:93950:6"/>
                  <hi>Robinſon</hi> at the beginning of my impriſonment; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was through any defect of my delivery, or that he took ſuch Relations for a deviſed ſtarting from the only point he would have me confeſs againſt the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> againſt whom I never conceived the leaſt harm; but whatever it was for, Sir <hi>John</hi> made light of my Narration concerning the Lady <hi>Huntley</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Talbots</hi> buſineſs, which I am ſure I began to relate to him, at the leaſt in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; but how far he ſuffered me to proceed, I cannot now well remember, both for that there's above four years ſince, and for the hard uſages wherewith he ſtill troubled my mind (whereof neither His Majeſty nor the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> knew their continuance ſo long) as my Lord of <hi>Northampton</hi> told me.</p>
               <p n="3">III. And ſince my enlargement at the very beginning of this Parliament, I yet went to the <hi>Tower</hi> to deſire Sir <hi>John</hi> to ſecond me for the diſcovering of the ſaid matters; but he at my firſt ſpeaking rejected my propoſal, referring me to the Secretaries. And truly I would as heartily have applied my ſelf to the Secretaries as to any, but that I feared, leſt of ſome errors which might be found in my carrying on this buſineſs, they would be more likely to charge me therewith, as parties for the King and Laws, than any other chief Parliament-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, who would be more fit to intercede for me, and more at leiſure to ſue out a pardon for me, if need were.</p>
               <p n="4">IV.

               <p n="5">V. Nay, and one Capt. <hi>Barret,</hi> with ſeveral other Officers that were beyond ſeas, told me about a fortnight ago, that the report went amongſt the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> That the <hi>Talbots</hi> were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon my Information, though I never ſpoke of them theſe four years till now; but that by a fore-boding guilt they knew perfectly, and heard I had grounds enough wherewith to accuſe them; ſo that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Catholicks here did threaten me, alledging me to be an abettor of Mr. <hi>Oate</hi>'s Informations

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE true Contrivers of my Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were the <hi>Talbots</hi> and Lady <hi>Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> who for diſcovering of their Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, threatned me in expreſs words, <hi>That if ever I came over into</hi> England, <hi>on that Deſign, I would be ſecured in the</hi> Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>or</hi> Gate-Houſe; <hi>or if I remained in</hi> France, <hi>they would get me laid faſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough:</hi> They put theſe Threatnings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Execution, for though both they and I were ſeemingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, yet they made ſuch a Search for me in <hi>Paris,</hi> that I was faign to change Lodgings very often into remote and by-places; and when I was on my Journey for <hi>England,</hi> one or two of my own ſervants, whom I diſmiſt at <hi>Paris,</hi> ſeeing me take Coach privately, carried them word of it, and for ſome pretence or other they ſent one Mr. <hi>Perrig,</hi> who was their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and <hi>Huntley</hi>'s chief friend, in poſt to apprehend me; whereof Sir <hi>Edward Hungerford,</hi> of this Honourable Houſe, can teſtifie from a Friend of his, who heard the ſame from <hi>Perrig</hi>'s mouth (that is now dead.) And it's to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd, that he could not purſue or apprehend a ſtranger in <hi>France,</hi> but in a concern againſt the King of that Countrey; who rather gives protection to ſtrangers that are purſued on any other Account. Before the <hi>Talbots</hi> fell out with me, and when I firſt determined in my own mind to come over privately into <hi>England,</hi> I inquired of one of the <hi>Talbot</hi>'s ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants (who was my Countreyman) where one might take
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93950:8"/>
cheap and friendly Lodgings in <hi>London,</hi> till one were in fit Equipage (I having never been in <hi>England</hi> before) he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected me to one <hi>Kenedy</hi>'s Houſe at the <hi>Pall Mall,</hi> or to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Countreyman's Houſe of his in St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s Lane, at the Sign of the <hi>Patrick;</hi> the firſt night and hour I came to that Houſe I told them my<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Name and Imployment from the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and that it was fit I ſhould go and wait on him immediately, leſt he ſhould take it ill; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſned my Landlord to ſend for ſome Link-boy that knew his Grace's Houſe, where I repaired forthwith; but not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Grace at home, I acquainted ſome of the ſervants of my Arrival<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to notifie to his Grace: The next day I came, he alſo was abroad earlier than ordinary, on ſome Riding or Recreation Account: I But unto Gentlemen of his Chamber, Mr. <hi>Champins</hi> and <hi>St. Giles,</hi> I told I would gladly come to kiſs his Grace's hand, and confer about Buſineſs, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever company he were in; ſo that Captain <hi>Watſon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> were not preſent, who were my Enemies on private Accounts, and would move his Grace doubtleſly againſt me, not to grant me my Requeſt; which partly was ſome Arrears or an Imployment.</p>
            <p>The next day I being ill, was let blood and kept my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber a day or two: I think the Sunday morning I went to viſit Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Trelany,</hi> who meeting accidently a day or two before, I came to re-viſit on this Sunday morning, who at my firſt ſight found more than ordinarily diſturbed, and courteouſly deſired to know my Lodgings, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I had ſeen the Duke? I told him of the ſorry Dwelling I had taken up for a little time, and that I would gladly ſee his Grace without the ſide enemies and with him: He deſired me to accompany him to <hi>Whitehall</hi> Chappel, where I might at the leaſt be ſeen of his Grace. (Thither we went) But the Collonel deſiring me to ſtay about the Chappel Door, throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in with great haſte, without coming out to me afterwards: In the mean time hearing of Organs and Children ſinging in Surpluſſes, as I had ſeen and heard in the <hi>French Kings Chappel,</hi> where I perceived ſome of the <hi>English Nobility</hi> come as freely as here; I did not know what to think, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I had not been too forward in ſpeaking of any <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries</hi> againſt that <hi>Religion</hi> which might be perhaps of late
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93950:8"/>
changed in <hi>England:</hi> for that I had not heard or ſeen ſuch things in the <hi>French Church</hi> at <hi>Charenton,</hi> where I only took my <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Proteſtaniſm;</hi> but this erronious ſtate of things (that I now know to be indifferent) did however make me pauſe in my <hi>Diſcoveries;</hi> but whilſt in theſe thoughts, Captain <hi>Watſon</hi> ſtept out of the <hi>Chappel,</hi> who looking on me a-ſquint, went down the <hi>Privy Stairs</hi> in one end, and the other <hi>Watſon</hi> his Nephew, ſpeaking a word or two to me more coldly than ordinarily, went out through the <hi>Guard Hall,</hi> to the other <hi>Stairs,</hi> and preſently follows in the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>company</hi> the Duke of <hi>Monmouth;</hi> who eying me only, paſt by: at all which <hi>paſſages</hi> of indifferency from former friends I was aſtoniſh'd. But I was in <hi>Scarlet Breeches</hi> and <hi>Stockings,</hi> ſo that I could be eaſily diſcerned and dogg'd to my <hi>Lodgings;</hi> where I went preſently from <hi>Chappel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Within two days after two men brought a <hi>Paper</hi> to my ſaid <hi>Lodging,</hi> ſigned by the Secretary whereupon he ſaid he muſt needs ſpeak with me: I inquired for what? but they could not or would not tell me; but it ſeems by their <hi>expreſſions</hi> to my <hi>Landlord,</hi> they were with him the day before to inquire for me: and they could tell that I had been laſt Sunday at Morning Prayers at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and there alſo ſeen the ſame Night amongſt others: After break-faſting peaceably, I went with them to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> not thinking this any Commitment Buſineſs. I told my Landlord I thought I would be back within an hour. The Secretary at my arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, inquiring of my Name, told me he would go and ſpeak with the <hi>King</hi> about me; which I know not whether he did ſo, or no: but returning ſoon after ſpake not one word to me, but going into his Clerk, he ſent out the ſame <hi>Meſſengers,</hi> who called me into the <hi>Stone Gallery;</hi> who ſaid they had <hi>Orders</hi> to carry me to the <hi>Tower,</hi> but for what they could not tell me.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John Robinſon</hi> after my Arrival entertained me to Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which continued in the company of his Lady and Solicitor, in a free and cheerful manner in Diſcourſe of the French Cuſtoms, and of his Son, whom I knew at <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:93950:9"/>
After Dinner, and having had a Nap with his Chaplain, who came in, Sir <hi>John</hi> inquired of me, Whether I were not a <hi>Roman Catholique?</hi> I told them I had been ſuch, but not one of late; and whether I was in Orders? I told them never<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inquiring whether I knew for what I was committed? I told them no, no; No more do I, ſaid Sir <hi>John,</hi> but in the general; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he ſent for one Captain <hi>Creſſet,</hi> the then Gentleman Goaler, he read unto me a Paper, he called his Warrant, which being but in general words, and giving me no Copy of it, made no ſuch impreſſion upon me, as now to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Contents; for I thought it was but ſome <hi>Tower</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, wherewith others were ſerved as well as I: for Sir <hi>John</hi> never explained nor inſiſted upon it, no more did I, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Captain <hi>Creſſet</hi> to my appointed <hi>Lodging;</hi> which was convenient enough, as alſo the Diet: ſo that at the beginning I being not lock'd up neither day nor night, for a Month or thereabouts, and giving my ſelf to reading an <hi>English Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi> that belonged to my Landlord, I unconcernedly expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſpeedy enlargement, after the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> ſhould come to hear of my Impriſonment; unto whom I deſired Sir <hi>John</hi> to give notice of it; but I had no return.</p>
            <p>After ſome Months, Sir <hi>John</hi> ſent for me, and ſaid he had Order to examine me; he inquired, What and whom I verily thought were the Cauſes of my Impriſonment? I told him that the Lady <hi>Anne Gourdon,</hi> alias <hi>Huntley,</hi> with <hi>Peter Talbot,</hi> Titular Bilhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> were aſſuredly the Cauſes of it; and might well contrive by other Inſtruments ſome falſe Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt me, for to weaken the teſtimony I was to give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them of their plotting againſt <hi>England:</hi> for that the ſaid Lady had informed me of a Deſign the <hi>English Catholiques</hi> had againſt the <hi>King's Perſon,</hi> his <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>Religion;</hi> and that ſhe had correſpondency with her Brother the Marquiſs of <hi>Huntley,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Rothes,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Oxenford</hi> of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and other Catholiques and Prieſts, this ſide and beyond Seas: That the ſaid <hi>Peter Talbot,</hi> before I brought him to the <hi>French King</hi>'s preſence, told me, That he was to treat with that King from ſoine very great Perſon or Perſons in <hi>England,</hi> for to raiſe men in <hi>Ireland</hi> for the <hi>French King,</hi> and that I had declared theſe things in <hi>France</hi> to one Sir <hi>Robert Welsh,</hi> who
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93950:9"/>
deſired me to acquaint the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> therewith. So Sir <hi>John</hi> being in haſte to go to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> took theſe Heads in his <hi>Table-book,</hi> and ſaid he would acquaint them above with it; but bid me not to mention the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> at all, for he was a goodman. I bring him in onely by occaſion, ſaid I. Next day Sir <hi>John</hi> ſent for me, and deſiring to know what other things I could ſay, I began to particularize the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned relations of the <hi>Plot;</hi> but he broke me off of that, ſaying, <hi>That theſe were but trifles, and that we cared not in</hi> England <hi>what Prieſts and Women beyond Seas, could deviſe; and that he took ſuch Stories from me but as ſtarting-holes from the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly point he had to urge againſt me. That unleſs I would confeſs other matters againſt the Duke of</hi> Monmouth, <hi>he would rack me next day, and afterwards hang me.</hi> I ſaid, <hi>He might do what he pleaſed, but that I neither knew or could confeſs any ſuch Deſign:</hi> And ſo I was ſent back to my <hi>Lodging,</hi> but my forwardneſs to ſpeak ever afterwards of any <hi>Plot</hi> againſt <hi>England</hi> was well abated, by this Storm. I deſired my Keepers Wife and Child, here preſent to pray for me, for that I was to be rack'd the next day. I asked my Keeper, <hi>What a Rack was? An In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>to ſtretch the Body and Limbs out of all joynts, ſometimes full of Needles; and that it was called the Daughter of ſome Duke. I do not now remember which.</hi> But this Family be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weak perſons, were themſelves frightned at this ſad and terrible threatnings; alledging, <hi>That none was ever carried to be executed out of their houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometime afterwards I was ſent for to be examined, to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> before the Secretary, my Lord of <hi>Bath,</hi> of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> and ſome others, I never ſaw before: They inquired, Whether I had been imployed under the Duke of <hi>Monmouth?</hi> And whether I knew ſome other perſons, I do not now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member my ſelf? with ſuch other Queſtions; out of which I could not yet know certainly the Cauſe of my Commitment; for no body appeared againſt me, as I think, at that time, one only at the ſecond time: So they in a general manner urged me ſtill to confeſs, to confeſs, what evil Deſign I had in coming to <hi>England:</hi> I ſaid ſtill, <hi>I had none, nor could I confeſs any:</hi> And ſo was ſent back to the <hi>Tower.</hi> Some Weeks or Months afterward I was ſent for to <hi>Whiteball</hi> again, where one <hi>Dalliſon,</hi> who was formerly in <hi>France</hi> entertained by me
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93950:10"/>
for writing, appeared. He there ſaid, <hi>That I there in</hi> France <hi>threatned ſome perſons here in</hi> England, <hi>and that he thought that it was the Duke of</hi> Monmouth, <hi>becauſe of non-payment of Arrears.</hi> I told him, <hi>That that was a bad inference, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I threatned ſome body, it muſt be therefore the Duke of</hi> Monmouth, <hi>who had never any ground ſo to do; for that he had ſigned an Order for payment of me; and ſpoke to Captain</hi> Watſon <hi>and Doctor</hi> Goaſe <hi>for it: Though I never was yet paid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the pretext or ground from which they took the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this ſlanderous Allogiſme, was from the matters of ſome private quarrels, which one Mr. <hi>Hampton</hi> and the Lady <hi>Anne Gourdon</hi> would have me vindicate againſt ſome of their Rivals; which I complimentally was ſtill wont to promiſe them I would do, the better to inſinuate my ſelf into their ſecrets, concerning the <hi>Plot</hi> and other matters.</p>
            <p>The Lady <hi>Gourdon</hi> would have the Earl of <hi>Rothes</hi> his Lady to be made away, ſhe being a <hi>Presbiterian,</hi> begot (as ſhe ſaid) a great obſtacle to the <hi>Roman Catholick Religion's</hi> progreſs in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and her own Rival, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Mrs. <hi>Wingfield,</hi> alias <hi>Hampton,</hi> a Benchers Wife of the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> then alſo in <hi>Paris,</hi> went alſo about to all <hi>English Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> there to avenge her quarrels againſt her Husband, who as they ſay (not without ſome good cauſe) has caſt her off: She applied her ſelf to me, who not approving of thoſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent means, I obtained for her a Letter of Recommendation for Juſtice to be done to her, from the <hi>French King</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> ſigned by Secretary <hi>Pompone,</hi> directed to Secretary <hi>Arlington</hi> in <hi>England:</hi> This was in 73, but ſhe not finding any good by this Letter, ſhe went on to propoſe to me her old ways; ſo ſeeing her incorrigible, fearing ſhe would fall into worſe hands, and hoping to get back the money I had lent to her and laid out for her; I kept in with her till ſhe could get money to pay me: but finding no hopes of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one or the other, I bid this <hi>Dalliſon</hi> my Man, to take her in hand, to pretend to cloſe to her Deſigns, till I could get my money. I directed him to her <hi>Lodgings,</hi> but he told me that Sir <hi>Robert Welsh</hi> and himſelf knew her well enough: And that he would get me one <hi>Johnſon</hi> a Student in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93950:10"/>
               <hi>Phyſick,</hi> who would act his part in the Comedy better than any. I told them I would ſhare with them both of what was due to me by this Woman, and what beſides they could get from her: She proffered to give ſome Hundreds of Pounds, then in the hands of Monſieur <hi>de Baſti</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and her Daughter beſides in Marriage, to any that would kill her Husband by the Sword, Poyſon, &amp;c. But finding ſhe could not perform the payment of a far leſs ſum due to me, and that to receive into my company perſons of ſo wicked principles in Religion and Moralities, was ſcandalous; I caſt them all off in <hi>Paris.</hi> She ſome Weeks before came over un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to me into <hi>England,</hi> but the next day after my Arrival here, I met her accidentally, and ſhe brought me to her Lodging; having now caſt of <hi>Dalliſon.</hi> Alſo he there in <hi>Paris</hi> met with the <hi>Talbots</hi> every night, and with Sir <hi>Robert Welsh;</hi> amongſt them it was contrived that <hi>Dalliſon</hi> ſhould come over into <hi>England,</hi> and turn theſe petit matters where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I ſeemed to comply with theſe Ladies, as if I intended them againſt the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> for not payment of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears, &amp;c. and by this means they thought to blaſt my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the <hi>Plot</hi> againſt them, when I came into <hi>England;</hi> and that I would be certainly ſecured when I arrived there: and they had the aſſurance to threaten me there-with to my face. Their threats came punctually to paſs, for I was ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red according to their Contrivance within a few days after I was in <hi>London.</hi>

            <p>Now when Sir <hi>John</hi> and the <hi>Secretary</hi> did ſo oft preſs me, What might give grounds to this Slaunder of ſome Deſign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> I have related theſe matters aboveſaid, unto them concerning theſe Womens Propoſals, which I conceived to be the only ground and pretext of that Slaunder, they made me ſign it, I think; which taking but for a formality of no great importance, I did do; and though I did but out of a complemental policy hearken to theſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens deſigns, I could not be at quiet there at the <hi>Tower</hi> with Sir <hi>John</hi> and others, till I had ſaid, That I had a real intention to ſerve theſe Women in the premiſſes; though Mr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> the <hi>Tower Chaplain,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> the <hi>Tower Gentleman Jaylor,</hi> may witneſs that I told them and others, That I dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied with theſe Ladies only. But what-ever Sir <hi>John</hi> or the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93950:11"/>
Secretary can make of this or any other lie, the Popiſh plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſent into their hands, to ſlaunder my Evidence, cannot be material to the purpoſe, and I will be ready to anſwer it. And though Sir <hi>John</hi>'s ill uſage and threats of Racking of me, and hearing that he was wont to give an account of me to the Duke of <hi>York</hi> (the <hi>Talbot</hi>'s Maſter) though I ſay, theſe things did diſcourage me to ſpeak further of the <hi>Plot</hi> whilſt I was in the <hi>Tower,</hi> either to Sir <hi>John</hi> or the <hi>Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> yet after I had been abroad a while, during the laſt <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments</hi> Sitting, I went to him to the <hi>Tower,</hi> intreating him to ſecond me in the diſcovering of the ſaid Matters afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, for the good of the Government; <hi>John Bagot</hi> his Man I think was in hearing; but he with a Check rejected me: which diſcouraged me ſo, as almoſt never to ſpeak any more of the Matter. Till a Lord of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> to whom I diſcovered the whole, by the means of a Friend, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived me again to make the Diſcovery, as I have done on the Twenty fourth of <hi>December</hi> laſt before the Committee of Lords upon Oath, Three Months ago before this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation I now do give into the Commons.</p>
