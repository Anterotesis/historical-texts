            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Manger ought to be of an indifferent height, made deep, and of one entire Piece, as well for ſtrength as conveniency. Let the Floor be Pitched and not Planked, and let there be no Mud or Lome-wall near it, for he will eat it, which will cauſe him to be ſick, for Lome and Lime are ſuffocating things, and they will infect and putrifie the Blood, and endanger his Lungs, and ſpoil his Wind; Neither let any dung lie near his heels, for that will breed Cib'd and ſcabby heels.</p>

                     <p>Fourthly, it is the moſt excellent thing that may be for Colts, who are unſhod, for it hardeneth their Hoofs, ſo that by cuſtom they will be as bold to go upon ſtones, rocky and hard ways, as Horſes that are ſhod; neither will it ſuffer the Hoofs to grow abroad in the manner of an Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; beſides, the uſe thereof will make their Hoofs more tough, durable and hollow, inſomuch that when they come to be ſhod, they will carry their Shooes much longer.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, it is more ſlippery, out of which reaſon a mettl'd Horſe may be endangered, to be lamed or ſpoiled by ſome ſudden ſlip, which a pitched Stable is not ſo ſubject to.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Planks oftentimes ſhrinking, if the Horſe be high Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tl'd and be ſubject to Curvet, he may break a Plank, and ſo Plunging may eaſily ſpoil or break his Leg.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, when you put forth your Horſe to Graſs in the Summer, the Sun will ſo dry the Planks, that they will warp and looſen the Pins, and make them give way, that ſo when Horſes that have gone for ſome Months before, not being handled, become wild and unruly, that when they come into the Stable, and feel the Planks to give way under them, will fall to Flinging and Leaping till they have diſlocated the Planks, and not only both endanger himſelf but his Fellows alſo.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, whereas you may imagine a Planked Stable warmer then a Paved one, I know the contrary, for your Pitched Floors have no Vaults or Channels under them, like as your Planked ones have, to carry away the water that the Horſes make, by which means the Horſes lieth over a dampiſh, moiſt Vault; and beſides, the evil ſavour of the Horſe-Piſs will be ever in their Noſe, which is very unwholeſom and noiſom, and many times the cauſe of many infirmities; neither can it be ſo warm as the other for chinks and holes, which are made by the Awger through the Planks, (which muſt always be kept open to let forth the Urine) to give way to the cold wind which cometh from thence, which cannot but be very unwholeſom. Therefore I do affirm, that if your Groom do Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter up Horſe well, ſo that he may lie ſoft and warm, he will proſper bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then upon a Planked Floor, provided it be laid even, not higher be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then behind, more then will carry the water to his hinder-feet, where
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:36503:20"/>
there ought to be a ſmall Gutter to carry it away, for by raiſing your Floor too much, his hinder Legs will ſwell, and ſo he will become Lame, by reaſon he bears too much weight on his hinder parts.</p>

His Rider therefore muſt be an Expert and able Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and his Keeper every way as ſufficient, otherwiſe what defects you find in your Horſe, are not to be attributed to him, but either to his Rider, or to his Groom; therefore let your care be, that they be both ſufficient.</p>

And it is not much to be wondred at, if a Horſe fall into Imperfections or Vices, for theſe his evil conditions and faults are not ſo much to be imputed to the Horſe, but to the Teacher, for he is not a good Horſe-man that doth not bring his Horſe to Perfection, by ſweet and gentle means, rather then by Correction and ſevere Chaſtiſements; yet not but that I allow of Correction, and that it is as neceſſary as Meat, if it do not exceed the limited Bounds of Moderation, and that it be done at the very inſtant when he offendeth, and doth juſtly merit the ſame, or elſe he will not know the Cauſe why he is Chaſtiſed; ſo on the other ſide, when he doth well, let h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Some do affirm, that a Horſe newly taken from Graſs, being foul, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made fit under ſix Months: By which they Rob their Maſters of half a years pleaſure, thruſt him upon a tyring Charge to make the Sport lothſom, and get nothing but a Cloak for Ignorance, and a few falſe got Crowns, that melt as they are poſſeſſed.</p>

                     <p>Yet as Hereticks cite Scripture, ſo theſe find Reaſons to defend want of Knowledge.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As,</hi> The danger of too early Exerciſe, the Offence of Greaſe ſuddenly broken, the Moving of evil Humours too haſtily, which leads to mortal Sickneſs; And the Moderation, or Helping of theſe by a ſlow Proceeding, or bringing of the Horſe into Order by degrees and time; <hi>Or (as I may ſay) by an ignorant Sufferance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe Reaſons have ſhew of a good Ground, for too early Exerciſe is dangerous, but not if free from violence.</p>
                     <p>To break Greaſe too ſuddenly is an offence inſufferable, for it puts both Limbs and Life in hazard, but not if it be purged away by whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Scourings. The haſty ſtirring up of Humours in the Body, where they ſuperabound, and are generally diſperſed, and not ſetled, cannot chooſe but breed Sickneſs; but not where Diſcretion and Judgement eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuateth them in wholeſom, ſweet and moderate Ayrings.</p>

laſt. It is like the Curing of the <hi>Gangreen</hi> in an old man; better to die then to be diſmembred, better loſe the price then bear the charge. For I appeal to any Noble Judgement, whoſe Purſe hath experienced theſe Actions, if ſix Months Preparation, and the dependents to it, do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour up a hundred pounds wager.</p>
                     <p>Now I allow but of two Months time at any time of the year whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, for an old Horſe, or an Horſe formerly trained, for I ſpeak not of Colts; if he does it not in two Months, he ſhall not do it in fifteen.</p>
                     <p>But reply they, no Scouring is to be allowed, for they are Phyſical; they force Nature, and ſo hurt Nature; they make Sickneſs, and fo em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair Health. And that indeed nothing is comparable to the length of time, becauſe Nature worketh every thing it ſelf, and though ſhe be longer, ſhe hath leſs danger.</p>
                     <p>I confeſs that Sibbeſauce Scourings, which are ſtuff'd with poiſonous Ingredients, cannot chooſe but bring forth Infirmity; but wholeſom Scourings, that are compoſed of beneficial and nouriſhing Simples, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion Sickneſs, nor any manner of Infirmity, but brings away Greaſe and all foulneſs, in that kindly and abundant ſort, that one week ſhall effect more then two Months dilatory and doubtful forbearance,</p>
                     <p>I call it dilatory and doubtful, becauſe no man (in this lingring Courſe) can certainly tell which way the Greaſe and other ſoulneſs will avoid, as whether in his Ordure (which is the ſafeſt) into Sweat, (which is hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous,) into his Limbs, (which is miſchievous) or remain and putrifie in his Body, (which is mortally dangerous) ſince the Iſſue of any, or all theſe fall out according to the ſtrength and eſtate of the Horſes Body, and the diligence of the Feeder. And if either the one fail in Power, or the other in Care, Farewel Horſe for that year.</p>
                     <p>All this Envy cannot chooſe but confeſs; only they have one broken Crutch to ſupport them, which is, they know no Scouring, therefore they will allow of no Scouring.</p>
                     <p>Againſt Barbariſm I will not diſpute, only I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>appeal to Art or Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether Purgation or Sufferance, when Nature is offended, be the better doers.</p>
                     <p>But they Reply by a Figure called, <hi>Abſurdity,</hi> that whatſoever is given to any Horſe more then his Natural Food, and which he will Naturally and willingly receive, is both improper and unwholeſom, To this I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, the Natural Food of Man is Bread only, all other things (according to the Philoſopher) are ſuperfluous, and ſo to be avoided.</p>
                     <p>At this Argument both Humanity and Divinity laughs. For other Helps, as Phyſick, divers Meats, and divers Means, ordeined for both, even by the Power of the Almighty himſelf, tells the Contemners hereof, how groſsly they err in this fooliſh Opinion. Nay, allow them a little ſhadow of truth, that things moſt Natural are moſt beneficial, then it
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:36503:25"/>
muſt follow, that Graſs or Hay, (which is but withered Graſs) is moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and ſo moſt beneficial. Now Graſs is Phyſical, for in it is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all manner of Simples, of all manner of Mixtures, as hot, cold, moiſt, dry, of all qualities, all quantities. So that whatſoever I give (which is good) is but that which he hath formerly gathered out of his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, only with this difference, that what he gathereth is in a confuſed manner, clapping contraries together ſo abundantly, that we are not able to judge where the Predominant Quality lieth; and that which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound is ſo governed by Art and Reaſon, that we know how it ſhould work, and we expect the event, if it be not croſs'd by ſome greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter.</p>
                     <p>But will they bind themſelves to keep the Running Horſe only with Graſs or Hay? They know then the end of their Labours will be loſs. Nay, they will allow Corn, nay, divers Corns, ſome nouriſhing and looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as Oats and Rye; ſome Aſtringent and Binding, as Beans; and ſome Fatning, breeding both Blood and Spirit, as Wheat; nay, they will allow Bread, nay, Bread of divers Compoſitions, and divers Mixtures, ſome before heat, and ſome after, ſome quick of Digeſtion, and ſome ſlow, And if this be not as Phyſical as Scourings a good Horſe-man gives, I repent me that I have ſaid any thing.</p>
                     <p>Nay, theſe Contemners of Scourings will allow an Egg, and that mixt with other Ingredients. And for Butter and Garlick they will uſe it, though it be never ſo fulſom; the Reaſon is, becauſe their knowledge can ariſe to no higher a Stair in Phyſick; and Authoriſed Ignorance will ever wage battel with the beſt Underſtanding; Like fooliſh Gallants on St. <hi>George</hi>'s day, who neither having ability to buy, nor Credit to borrow a Gold Chain, ſcorn at them that wear them; or <hi>Martin Mar-Prelate,</hi> that not having Learning worthy of a <hi>Deacon,</hi> found no felicity, but in Railing at Divine Fathers. There are another ſort of Feeders, which in a contrary extream, run beyond theſe into miſchiefs, and thoſe are they that ov r-ſcoure their Horſes, and are never at Peace, but when they are giving of Portions, (which they call Scourings) ſometimes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe, always without order, bringing upon an Horſe ſuch intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable weakneſs, that he is not able to perform any violent labour.</p>
                     <p>From this too little, and too much, I would have our Feeder to gather a mean; that is, firſt to look that his Simples be wholeſom: then to the occaſion, that he be ſure there is foulneſs: And laſtly, to the Eſtate of Body, that he may rather Augment then decreaſe Vigour, ſo ſhall his Work be proſperous, and his Actions without Controulment. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, two Months I allow for Preparation, and according to that time have laid my directions. Mine humble ſuit is, out of a ſincere Opinion to Truth and Juſtice, ſo to allow or diſallow, to refrain or imitate.</p>

                     <head>The firſt Ordering of the Running Horſe. according to the ſeveral Estates of their Bodies.</head>
                     <p>This <hi>Office of the Feeder,</hi> albeit in general it belong to all Horſe-men, yet in particular it is moſt appropriate to the Feeder of the Running-Horſe; becauſe other general Horſes have a general way of Feeding, theſe are Artificial and Preſcript from, full of Curioſity and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, from which whoſoever errs, he ſhall ſooner bring his Horſe to deſtruction then perfection. You are to have regard to three Eſtates of a Horſes Body.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, if he be very Fat, Foul, or either taken from Graſs or Soil.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond, if he be extream Lean and poor, either through over-Riding, diſorder or other infirmity.</p>
                     <p>And the third, if he be in good and well-liking eſtate, having had good uſage and moderate exerciſe.</p>
                     <p>If he be in the firſt Eſtate of Body, you ſhall take longer time for his Feed, as two Months at the leaſt: for he will ask much labour in Air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, great carefulneſs in hearing, and diſcretion in Scouring, and rather a ſtrict then liberal hand in feeding, If he be in the ſecond Eſtate of Body (which is poor) then take a longer time, and let his Airings be moderate, as not before and after Sun, rather to encreaſe Appetite then harden Fleſh, and let him have a bountiful hand in Feeding, but not ſo much as to cloy him.</p>
                     <p>If he be in the third Eſtate of Body, which is a mean betwixt the other extreams, then a Month of ſix Weeks, or a Fort-night, or leſs, may be time ſufficient to dyet him for his Match. Now as this Eſtate participates with both the former, ſo it would borrow from them a ſhare in all their Orderings, that is, to be neither too early, nor too late in Airings, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious, but not painful Heatings, nouriſhing in Scouring, and conſtant in a moderate way of Feeding.</p>

                     <p>Now as you regard theſe general Eſtates of Bodies, ſo you muſt have an eye to certain particular eſtates of Bodies. As if an Horſe be Fat and Foul, yet of a free and ſpending Nature, apt quickly to conſume and loſe his Fleſh, this Horſe muſt not have ſo ſtrict a Hand, neither can he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſo violent Exerciſe as he that is of an hardy diſpoſition, and will feed and be fat upon all Meats and all Exerciſes.</p>
                     <p>Again, if your Horſe be in extream Poverty, through diſorder and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſage, yet is by Nature very hard, and apt both ſoon to recover his Fleſh, and long to hold it; then over this Horſe you ſhall by no means hold ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berai a hand, nor forbear that Exerciſe, which is of a tender Nature, a weak Stomach, and a free Spirit, provided always you have regard to his Limbs and the Imperfections of Lameneſs.</p>

                     <p>If you Match a Horſe that is fat and foul, either by running at Graſs, or ſtanding at Soil, or any other means of Reſt, or too high feeding; you ſhall (after his Body be emptied, and the Graſs avoided, which will be within three or four days) for the firſt Fortnight at leuſt, riſe early in the Morning before day, or at the ſpring of day according to the time of the year; and having put on his Bridle waſht in Beer, and tied him up to the Rack, take away his dung and other foulneſs of the Stabie; then dreſs him well, as in <hi>The Office of the Keeper.</hi> When that Work is finiſhed, take a fair large Body-cloth of thick Houſe-Wives Kerſie, (if it be in Winter,) or of Cotton or other light ſtuff (if it be in Summer,) and fold it round about his Body, then clap on the Saddle, and Girt the foremoſt Girt pretty ſtreight, but the other ſomewhat ſlack, and Wiſp it on each ſide his Heart, that both the Girts may be of equal ſtreightneſs.</p>
                     <p>Then put before his Breaſt a Breaſt-cloth ſuitable to the Body-cloth, and let it cover both his Shoulders, then take a little Beer into your Mouth, and ſquirt it into the Horſes Mouth, and ſo draw him out of the Stable, and take his Back, leaving a Groom behind you to trim up the Stable to carry out your dung, and to truſs up the Litter. For, you are to underſtand that he is to ſtand upon good ſtore of dry Litter both Night and Day, and it muſt be Wheat-ſtraw or Oat-ſtraw, for Barley-ſtraw and Rye-ſtraw are very unwholeſom and dangerous, the one doth Heart-burn, the other cauſeth Scouring. When you are Mounted, Rack the Horſe a Foot-pace, (for you muſt neither Amble nor Trot, for they both hurt ſpeed) at leaſt a mile or two, or more, upon ſmooth and ſound Ground, and (as near as you can) to the ſteepeſt Hills you can find; there Gallop him gently up thoſe Hills, and rack and walk him ſoftly down, that he may cool as much one way, as he warmeth another. And when you have thus exerciſed him a pretty ſpace, and ſeeing the Sun begin to Riſe, or elſe Riſen, Rack down either to ſome freſh River, or clear Pond, and there let him drink at his pleaſure.

When you have uſed him a little calmly, put him into a Gallop gently, and exerciſe him moderately, as you did before; then walk him a little ſpace, after offer him more water; if he drink, then Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him again (after calm uſage;) if he refuſe, then Gallop him to

When you come to the Stable Door, provoke him to Piſs if you can, by ſtirring up his Litter under him, which if he do not a little cuſtom will make him do it, and it is a wholeſom Action, both for his Health and the ſweet keeping of the Stable. This done, bring him to the Stall, and Tie him up to the Rack, and Rub him well with Wiſps, then looſe his Breaſt-Cloth, and Rub his Head and Neck with a dry Cloth, then take off the Saddle and hang it by, then take his Body-Cloth and Rub him all over with it, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially his Back, where the Saddle ſtood. Then Cloath him up firſt with a Linnen-ſheet, and then over that a good ſtrong Houſing-Cloth, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it his Woollen Body-cloth, which in the Winter it is not amiſs to have loyned with ſome Cotton, but in the Summer the Kerſie is ſufficient.

Then at one of the Clock uſe him as you did before, and give him another quart of Oats in the ſame manner, making of him clean by taking away his dung, and give him a little Knob of Hay, and leave him till the Evening.

from eating up his Litter, from gnawing upon Boards and Mud-walls, and indeed to keep him from eating any thing but what he receiveth from your own hands, they are made ſometimes of Leather, and ſtampt full of holes, or elſe cloſe, but they are unſavoury and unwholeſom. Nay, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all Leather is unpleaſant. Beſides, they are too cloſe and too hot for him The beſt Summer Muzzle, (and indeed beſt at all times) is the Ner-Muzzle, made of ſtrong Pack-thread, and knit very thick and cloſe in the bottom, and ſo enlarged wider and wider upwards to the middle of the Horſes Head; then bound upon the top with Tape, and on the nether ſide a Loop, and on the farther ſide a long String to faſten it to the Horfes Head. The beſt Winter Muzzle (and indeed tolerable at any time) is made of double Canvaſs, with a round Button, and a ſquare La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice Window of ſmall Tape before both his Noſtrils, down to the very bottom of the Muzzle, and upward more then a handful, and muſt alſo have a Loop and a String to faſten about his Head. At Nine of the Clock at Night, give him a quart of clean Oats, and when they are eaten, put on his Muzzle, and toſs up his Litter, and ſo leave him.</p>
                     <p>The next day early give him a quart of clean Oates, rubbed between your hands with ſome Beer or Ale, and when he hath eaten them, Dreſs him and Saddle him as before, and being ready to depart, give him a new laid Egg or two, and waſh his Mouth after it with Beer or Ale, and ſo lead him away, and at the door provoke him to empty, then Mount and Rack him gently to the Courſe, ever and anon making him ſmell an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Horſes dung.</p>
                     <p>When you are come within a Mile of the ſtarting Poſt, alight and take off his Body-Cloth and Breaſt-Cloth, and Girt on the Saddle again; then ſending away your Grooms both with thoſe Cloaths, and other dry Cloaths to rub with, let him ſtay at the end of the Courſe till you come: then your ſelf Rack your Horſe gently up to the ſtarting Poſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond, making him ſmell to that Poſt, (which you call the weighing Poſt) that he may take notice of the beginning and ending of the Courſe. There ſtart your Horſe roundly and ſharply, at near a three quarters ſpeed, and according to his Strength of Body, Ability of Wind, and Chearfulneſs of Spirit, run him the whole Courſe through. But by no means do any thing in extremity, or above his Wind, but when you find him a little yield, then give him a little eaſe, ſo that all he doth may be done with Pleaſure, and not with Anguiſh; For this manner of training will make him take delight in his labour, and ſo encreaſe it: The contrary will breed diſcomſort, and make Exerciſe irkſom. Alſo during the time you thus courſe him, you ſhall Note upon what Ground he runneth beſt, and whether up the Hill or down the Hill; whether on the ſmooth, or on the rough, on the wet or on the dry, or on the level, or the Earth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Riſing: and according as you find his Nature, ſo manage him for

When you have Finiſhed the Heats, and a little ſlightly Galloped him up and down to Rate his Wind and chear his Spirits, you ſhall then (the Groom being ready) Ride into ſome warm Place, and with your Glaſſing Knife, or ſcraping Knife, made either of ſome broken Sword blade, or ſome old broken Sythe, or for want of that, a thin piece of old hard Oaken wood, faſhioned like a long broad Knife with a ſharp edge, ſcrape off the Sweat of your Horſe in every part (But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks excepted) till there will none ariſe, ever and anon moving him up and down: Then with dry Cloaths Rub him all over (Buttocks except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) then take off his Saddle, and having Glaſſed his Back, and rub'd it near dry, put on his Body-Cloth and Breaſt-Cloth, and ſet on his Saddle again and Girt it, then Mount and Gallop him gently, and ever and anon Rubbing his Head, Neck and Body, as you ſit, then walk him about the Fields to cool him; And when you find he drieth apace, then Rack him homewards, ſometimes Racking, and ſometimes Galloping; and by no means bring him to the Stable, till you find him throughly dry. When you are come to the Stable-door entice him to empty, then ſet him up and Tie him to the Rack, and (as having prepared it before) give him this Scouring, made in this manner.</p>

But if you finde no ſuch offence, then give him the Ears of Wheat, by three or four together, and if he eat this handful, give him another, and ſo another or two. Then give him a little Knob of Hay well duſted, and draw his Bridle, and rub his Head well. An hour after give him a quart of clean Oats, and put two or three handfuls of ſpelted Beans amongſt them, and ſee that they be very clean, and break amongſt them two or three Shives of Bread clean chipt, and ſo leave him for two or three houres. At Evening before you dreſs him, give him the like quantity of Oates, Beans and Bread, and when he hath eaten them, Bridle him, Dreſs and Cloath him; for you ſhall neither Saddle, or Air him forth, becauſe this Evening after his Heat, the Horſe being foul, and the Scouring yet working in his Body, he may not receive any cold water at all. After he is dreſt, and hath ſtood two houres on his Bridle, then waſh three pints of clean Oates in Beer or Ale, and give them him, for this will inwardly cool him, as if he had drunk water</p>

                     <p>You ſhall keep your Heating-days the firſt Week or Fortnight, but the laſt Week you ſhall forbear one Heat, and not give any five days before the Match-day, only you ſhall give him ſtrong and long Air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>

                     <p>Late at Night feed as you did in the Evening, and give him what he liketh, according to his ſtomach, only as you can, forbear Bread and Beans.</p>
                     <p>This day you ſhall Coul your Horſe, Shoo him, and do all extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary things of Ornament about him, provided that you do not give him offence to hinder his Feeding or Reſting; For I have heard ſome Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſay, that when they had ſhod their Horſes with light Shoos, the Night before the Courſe, that their Horſe hath taken ſuch notice thereof, that they have refuſed to eat, or lie down. But you muſt underſtand, that thoſe Horſes muſt be old, and long Experienced in this Exerciſe, or elſe they cannot reach theſe ſubtil apprehenſions. But to paſs by Curioſity, as plating of Tails, and all other unneceſſary Ornaments, whereby they do injury to the Horſe, I ſhall adviſe you for neceſſary and indifferent things, that they be done the day before, then in the Morning of the Courſe, becauſe I would have him that Morning find neither trouble nor vexation.</p>
                     <p>The next Morning (which is the Match-day) come to him very early, and take off his Muzzle, Rub his Head well, right his Cloaths, and give them eaſe by wiſping and uſing the plain Circingle, then give him a pretty quantity of Oats waſhed in <hi>Muſcadine,</hi> or the Whites of Eggs, or if he refuſe them, try him with fine dreſs'd Oats, mixt with Wheat, or Oates ſimple; when he hath eaten them, if he be a ſlow emptier, walk him abroad, and in the places where he uſes to empty, there entice him to empty, which when he hath done, bring him home and let him reſt till you have warning to make ready. But if he be a free Emptier, let him lie quiet.</p>

                     <p>In all your Leadings upon the Courſe, uſe gentle and calm Motions, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering him to ſmell upon any Dung, and in eſpecial places of advantage, as where you find Ruſhes, long Graſs lying, Heath or the like, walk in and entice him to Piſs.

But the Rule is neither good nor handſom; for if the Tramel be too long or looſe, that is, gives no offence to the Sinews, and other ligaments, about which they muſt neceſſarily be bound, when they are raiſed ſo high, then they can give no true ſtroke, neither can the fore-Leg compel the hinder to follow it.

                     <p>For the Horſe which muſt be placed in the ſmall of the Fore-leg, and the ſmall of the hinder-Leg, above the Feet lock, they muſt be made of fine Girt-Web, which is ſoft and pliant, and loyned with double Cotton: Over the Girt-Web muſt be faſtened ſtrong Tabbs of white Neats Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther well Tallowed, and ſuited to an even length, and ſtamped with holes of equal diſtance, which ſhall paſs through the Nooſes of the Side<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Ropes, and be made longer or ſhorter at pleaſure, with very ſtrong Buckles.

                     <p>The Back-band being of no other uſe but to bear up the Side Ropes, would (if you Tramel all the fore-Legs) be made of fine Girt Web, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Then with your hand on the Bridle, ſtraining his Head, put him gently forward, and if need be, have the help of a by-ſtander to put him forward alſo, and ſo force him to Amble up and down the Road, with all the Gentleneſs you can, ſuffering him to take his own leiſure, that thereby he may come to an underſtanding of his reſtraint, and your Will for the Performance of the Motion, and though he ſnapper or ſtumble, or peradventure fall now and then, yet it matters not, do you only ſtay his Head, give him leave to Riſe, and with all gentleneſs put him forward again, till finding his own fault, and underſtanding the Motion, he will become perfect, and Amble in your Hand to your contentment. And that this may be done with more eaſe and leſs amazement to the Horſe, it is not amiſs (at his firſt Tramel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) that you give your Side-Ropes more length then ordinary, both that the Twitches may be leſs ſudden, and Motion coming more gently, the Horſe may ſooner apprehend it.</p>

And thus you ſhall do, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging from one ſide to another, till with this half<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Tramel he will Run and Amble in your hand, without ſnappering or ſtumbling, both readily and ſwiftly; when this is attained unto, which cannot be above two or three houres labour, (if there be any tractableneſs) you may then put on the whole Tramel, and the broad, flat back Band, Trameling both ſides equally, and ſo Run him in your hand (at the utmoſt length of the Bridle) up and down the Road divers times, then pauſe, cheriſh, and to it again; and thus apply him, till you have brought him to that Perfection, that he will Amble ſwiftly, truly and readily, when, where, and how you pleaſe; then
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:36503:36"/>
put him upon uneven and uncertain ways, as up-hill and down-hill, where there are clots and roughneſs, and where there is hollowneſs and falſe treading.</p>

                     <p>Now when he is perfect in your Hand upon all theſe, you may then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to Mount his Back, which (if you pleaſe) you may firſt do by a Boy, or Groom; making the Horſe Amble under him, whileſt you ſtay his Head to prevent danger, or to ſee how he ſtriketh. Then after Mount your ſelf, and with all gentleneſs and lenity, encreaſing his Pace more and more, till you come to the height of Perfection. And thus as you did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in your Hand, ſo do now on his Back, firſt with the whole Tramel, then with the half, and changing the Tramel oft, firſt from one ſide, then to another, then altering Grounds, till you finde that exquiſiteneſs which you deſire, and this muſt be done by daily exerciſe and labour, as twice, thrice, ſometimes oftner in the day.</p>

But this ExerciſeI would have upon the High-way, (and not Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſer like) in a private ſmooth Road, for that affords but a couſening Pace, which is left upon every ſmall wearineſs; therefore take the High-way forward for three, four or five miles in a Morning, more or leſs, as you finde his aptneſs and ability. Now if in this journeying, either through wearineſs, ignorance or peeviſhneſs, you finde in him a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to forſake his Pace, then (ever carrying in your Pocket the half Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel) alight and put them on, and ſo exerciſe him in them, and now and then give him eaſe, bring him home in his true Pace. This Exerciſe you ſhall follow day by day; and every day increaſing it more and more, till you have brought him from one mile to many; which done, you may then give him eaſe, as letting him reſt a day or two, or more, and then apply him again; and if you finde in him neither errour nor alteration, then you may conclude your Work is finiſhed.</p>
                     <p>But if any alteration do happen (as many phantaſtick Horſes are ſubject unto,) if it be in the motion of his Pace, then with your hand reform it. But if that fail, then the uſe of the half-Tramel will never fail you.</p>
                     <p>Now if the Error proceed from any other occaſion, look ſeriouſly into the cauſe thereof, and taking that away the effect will ſoon ceaſe; for you are to underſtand, that in this manner of teaching him to Amble, you

                     <p>The third year he changeth the Teeth next unto them, and leaveth no apparent Foals Teeth before, but two above, and two below of each ſide, which are all bright and ſmall.</p>
                     <p>The fourth year he changeth the Teeth next unto them, and leaveth no more Foals Teeth before, but one of each ſide, both above and below.</p>

                     <p>The ſeventh year all his Teeth will have their perfect Growth, and the Mark in his Mouth will be plainly ſeen.</p>
                     <p>The eighth year all his Teeth will be full, ſmooth and plain, the black ſpeck or mark being no more but diſcerned, and his Tuſhes will be more yellow then ordinary.</p>
                     <p>The ninth year his foremoſt Teeth will be longer, broader, yellower and fouler then at younger years, the mark gone, and his Tuſhes will be bluntiſh.</p>

And to conclude, the perfect Shape of a Horſe, according as a famous Horſe-man hath deſcribed it, is in a few words, thus, <hi>viz.</hi> A broad Fore-head, a great Eye, a lean Head, thin, ſlender, lean, wide Jaws, a long high reared Neck, reared Withers, abroad deep Cheſt and Body, upright Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns, and narrow Hoof; And this is the common, allowed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Shape of a perfect Horſe, ſo that if any of thoſe things be deficient in him, he cannot be ſaid to be a Horſe of a perfect Shape. Wherefore I conclude, that if a Horſe be of a good Colour, well Marked, and rightly Shaped, and right alſo by Sire and Mare, it will be ſeldom ſeen that he would prove ill, unleſs his Nature be alienated and marred, either in the Backing and Riding, or elſe that he be otherwiſe wronged, by the means of an unskilful Groom.

Fifthly, the opening of the two Plate or Breaſt-Veins do help the Anticor, Sickneſs of the Heart, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundring, which is the Foundring in the Body by over-riding, whereby the Greaſe of the Horſe is molten; it alſo preventeth Diſeaſes in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Lungs, and inward parts grieved; and ſometimes Hurts in the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which cauſeth Lameneſs before.

Eighthly, we uſe to ſtrike the two Spur-Veins, which Cureth the Farcin in the Sides, Morfoundring, ſwelling under the Belly, which is a Diſeaſe called the Feltrick, and the like. Ninthly, we prick the two Toe-Veins, which do help Frettizing, Foundering, Hoof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, beating of the Horſes Feet by Riding upon hard and ſtony ways, and the like. Tenthly, we open the two Thigh-Veins behind, and this doth help the Grief of the Kidneys, ſwelling in the Hinder-Legs, Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, Sellenders, Scratches, Kybes, &amp;c. And it alſo helpeth Diſeaſes in and about the Belly, as Piſſing of blood, Piſſing oft after great and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary hard labour, and the weakneſs of the Reins, the Back, Belly, Guts, or any other of the inward Parts, the Curb, Spaven, and ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes which come of Rankneſs of Blood.

Twelfthly, we let Blood in the two Flank or Hanch-Veins, and this is moſt probable for all kind of Feavers, the Stones, Poverty and the Felter-worm. Thirteenthly, we draw Blood from the two Tail-Veins, which Cureth the Mange in the Tail, falling of the Hair, or Itch in the Tail. And theſe are for the moſt part all the Veins that are uſually opened. So that the full ſum or number of Veins which Farriers commonly open are thirty. Other Veins there are which are of a ſmaller proportion, and therefore not fit to be opened, I will not ſay that theſe Veins ſo opened doth Cure the Diſeaſes abſolutely; but it doth ſometimes aſſwage the Malignancy of the Malady, ſometimes it preventeth Diſeaſes, and ſometimes again it prepareth the Body, the better to receive ſuch Phyſical Drinks which do inwardly Cure them, and ſuch Salves, Oyls, Unguents, which do dry and heal up outward Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, &amp;c.</p>

They are able to endure the reaſonable ſtrength of any Medicine, becauſe of the abundance of Phlegm which is in them, ſufficeth both Nature, and the Potion to work upon. All cold Simples are to them exceeding hurtful, ſo are alſo they which are violently hot in the third degree; The firſt, becauſe it bindeth too ſoon; The latter, becauſe it diſperſes too ſuddenly, therefore Simples of a moderate Mean are beſt.</p>

in the Spleen, Frenzie, Dropſey, and ſuch like; They are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly of better ſtrength then they appear by their Actions, and are able to endure the ſtrength of any reaſonable Medicine; All cicatrizing and dry Simples are hurtful unto them, the cold and moiſt are the moſt profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Having thus ſhewed you theſe four Complexions, <hi>Cholerick San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine, Phlegmatick</hi> and <hi>Melancholy,</hi> together with their qualities and ſtrengths; You ſhall underſtand now, that amongſt Farriers there is another Complexion, or fifth Conſtitution, which is called the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, or Mixture of Complexions; that is, when a Horſe doth participate of all the four Elements equally, and in due proportion, and this is the beſt Complexion, and the Horſe that is of this Complexion is ever one of theſe Colours; that is to ſay, of a fair brown Bay, dabled, or not dab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, a Dable Grey, a Black full of Silver Hair, or a fair Roan red or black. And theſe Horſes are of Nature moſt excellent, moſt temperate, ſtrongeſt, gentleſt and moſt healthful, though they may have any diſeaſe as the other hath, yet are they naturally inclined to no diſeaſe. But what infirmity ſoever falleth unto them, is meerly accidental, and not through any over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow of natural diſtemperature. All Medicines muſt be compounded for them according to the Nature of the Sickneſs, and the time of their Languiſhment; for if the Sickneſs be young and new bred, then are they able to receive any well Compoſed Receipt; but if it be old, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Powers and Faculties feebled, then you muſt be careful to help Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by adding to every Medicine, of what Nature ſoever, ſome Simple of Comfort, that as ill Humors be clenſed, ſo Strength may ſtill be repaired and maintained. And thus much for Complexions.</p>

And this manner of Scouring will cauſe him to empty himſelf well of all his evil Hamours and Surſeits, eaſe his Limbs marvellous well, do his Legs and Feet very much good, refine his corrupt Blood, and make him agile and full of Spirit. Next unto Graſs is Sorrage, which is only the Blades of green Corn, as <hi>VVheat, Rye, Barley,</hi> and ſuch like, being given him ſeven days and no more, which cleanſeth and cooleth the Body very much, ſo doth the leaves of <hi>Sallows,</hi> and of the Elm-green Thiſtles, likewiſe being cut up and given him for about five days is a good Scourer.

                     <p>If he do Halt before, his Grief muſt of neceſſity be either in the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or Knee, or in the Shank, or in the Paſtern, or in the Foot; if it be in the Shoulder, it muſt be either towards the Withers, or in the pitch of the Shoulder, you may know it in that he will a little draw his Leg after him, and not handle it ſo nimbly as he doth the other, if he caſt his Leg more outward then he doth the other, it is a ſign that he is Lame, and that the Grief lieth in his Shoulder; and if you take him in your Hand turn him ſhort on either Hand, you ſhall finde him to complain of that Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he is Lame of, and he will either favour that Leg, or trip in the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you may finde him Lame by his ſtanding in the Stable, and he will hold out that Leg that is Lame more then the other; and if he complains more when you are on his Back then otherwiſe, then be ſure the Grief lies in the Withers, and Gripe him hard, <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>and you ſhall perceive him to ſhrink, and perhaps offer to bite. If he tread thick and ſhort before, then is the Grie

upon the Pitch of the Shoulder cloſe to the Breaſt, which you may finde by ſetting your Thumb hard to the place, and by Thruſting him with it, if you would have him to go back, whereat he will ſhrink and put back his Leg, Foot and Body; if the Grief be in the Elbow, you may know it by pinching him with your fore-Finger and Thumb, and he will hold up his Leg and offer to bite; and theſe be all the Griefs that lie in the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of a Horſe. If the Griefs lie lower, they muſt be either in the Knee, in the Skin, in the Paſtern, or in the Foot.</p>

                     <head>When in the Knee.</head>
                     <p>If it be in the Knee, you may find it by his ſtiff going, for he will not bend it ſo nimbly as he doth the other. If it be in the Shank or Shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, you may ſee it, and likewiſe feel the ſame, it being then a Back-Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new ſtrain, Splint, or ſome ſuch like Sorrance or Annoyance If it be in the bending of the Knee, then it is a Mallender, which is alſo eaſily deſcried; when it is in the Paſtern or Joynt, then you may know it by his not bending it ſo well as the other; beſides, if you put your Hand upon the place, you ſhall find it very hot; if it be in the Foot, it muſt be either in the Cronet or in the Sole; if in the Cronet it is probable it came by ſome ſtrain or wrench; if in the Heel, then it came by ſome over-reach, or elſe by ſome Diſeaſe in or about the Fruſh; If in the Sole, then it came by ſome Prick, Accloy, Retoire, Nail, Stub, Stone or Gravel. And thus I have ſhewed unto you the ſeveral ways that cauſe a Horſe to be Lame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and how to know and diſtinguiſh the places grieved, together with the occaſion of every particular Grief.</p>

                     <head>How to diſtinguiſh an old Grief from a New.</head>
                     <p>You have three Ways to finde out his Lameneſs, in what Joynt, Limb or Member of the Body ſoever.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The firſt way is to cauſe him to be turned at the Halters end, on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, ſuddenly and ſwiſtly, upon as hard a way as you can pick out; and if he have any Ach, Wrench or Grief in his fore-parts, it will appear: for when he turneth upon that Hand that the Grief is on, he will favour that Leg, and ſo run both towards you and from you, eſpecially done at a little yielding Hill; and if he have any imperfection, he will ſoon ſhew it, for he will favour that Leg wherein the Grief reſideth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if you cannot finde it out this way.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Then your ſecond way muſt be to take his Back, and Ride him till you have thoroughly heat him, then ſet him up for two or three houres till he be cold, then turn him at the Halters-end, or Ride him, and you may eaſily diſcover the leaſt Grief that may be in him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A third way there is, and that to know whether the Grief proceeds from a hot or cold cauſe, for if it proceed from a hot cauſe, he will Halt moſt when he is hot; but if it be of a cold cauſe, then he will Halt leaſt when he is hot, and moſt ridden and travelled, and moſt at his
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:36503:60"/>
firſt ſetting ſorth, whileſt he is cold, and thus much for Lameneſs and Halting before.</p>
                     <p>Now finding that his Lameneſs is not before, you may then conclude, if he be Lame at all it muſt needs be behind, and then it muſt of neceſſity be either in the Foot or in the nether Joynt, in the Paſtern or in the Leg, in the Ham or in the Hoof, in the ſtiffling place or Joynt, or in the Hip. If the Grief be either in the Leg, Paſtern or Foot, you may know it by the ſame Signes as I have inculcated to you already in the fore-Legs. If it be in the bending of the Ham it muſt be a Selander. If it be in the Hoof, then it is either a Bone or Blood-ſpavin, which is eaſie enough to be diſcerned, or elſe it muſt come of ſome Blow, Wrench or Strain, neither then will the ſwelling eaſily appear, which you may perceive either by the ſtiffneſs of the Joynt, or you may find the place to be hot and burning. If the pain lie in the ſtiffing place, you may know it by his Gate, for in his going he will caſt the ſtifle-Joynt outward, and the Bone on the inſide will be bigger then the other, beſides his Toe will hardly touch the Ground. If it be in the Hip, which is upon the ſide of the Buttock; and if it be newly taken, you may know it in that he will go ſide-long like a Crab. And if it be an old Hurt, the Hip will be fallen lower then the other, and the fleſh to ſhrink, which to diſcover it the ſooner run him at the full length of the Rein, and he will be ſure to favour that Leg the Grief is in; but if you find him to go upright without favouring any Leg, then take his Back and ride him till he be warmed, and then ſet him up till he be cold, and then lead or trot him in your Hand as you did before, and if he be lame at all he will be ſure to complain. And ſo much for Lameneſs before and behind.</p>

                     <p>The imperfect Hoof is that which lacketh any of theſe Properties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-ſaid, belonging to a perfect Hoof. If the Hoof be not round but broad, and ſpreading out of the ſides and quarters, that Horſe for the moſt part hath narrow heels, and in continuance of time will be flat Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which is a weak Foot, and will not carry a Shoo long, nor Travel far, but ſoon ſurbate; and by treading more on his Heels then on his Toes, will go low on his Paſterns, and ſuch Feet through their weakneſs be much ſubject to falſe quarters, and to Gravelling, which is moſt commonly ſeen in <hi>Flanders</hi> Horſes, and ſuch as are bred in moiſt Grounds.</p>

                     <p>Make your Shoo of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Iron, with a broad Web, fitting it to the Hoof, and let the Spunges be thicker and more ſubſtantial then any other part of the Shoo, yea, and alſo ſomewhat broad, ſo as the Quarters on both Sides may appear without the Hoofs a ſtraw bredth, to guard the Coffin, which is the ſtrength of the Hoof, and when you come to the pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing thereof, pierce it from the Quarter to the hard Toe, but not back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward towards the Heel, and that the holes may be wider on the out-ſide then on the in-ſide, and that the Circle of the piercing may be more diſtant from the edge of the Toe, then from the edge of the Quarter, whereas it beginneth becauſe the Hoof is thicker forward then backward, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more hold to be taken. Make your Nails of the ſame Iron as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, the Heads whereof ſhould be ſquare, and not fully ſo broad beneath as above, but anſwerable to the piercing holes, ſo as the Heads of the Nails may enter in and fill the ſame, appearing ſomewhat above the Shoo, and then they will ſtand ſure without ſhogging, and endure longer, and that that which pierceth them be of the ſame Size as the Nails, that is to ſay,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:36503:61"/>
great above and ſmall beneath, which our common Smith, little regard, for they make the holes as wide on the inſide as the outſide, and their Nails of ſo great a Shouldering by driving them over-hard upon the Nail-hole, as that the Heads, or rather Necks of the ſaid Nails cannot enter into the holes. For to ſay the truth, a good Nail ſhould have no ſhouldering at all, but be made with a plain and ſquare Neck, ſo as it may juſtly fill the piercing hole of the Shoo, for otherwiſe the Head of the Nail ſtanding high, and the Neck thereof being weak, either it breaketh off or elſe bendeth upon any light occaſion, ſo as the Shoo ſtandeth looſe from the Hoof, and is quickly loſt. Moreover, the ſhanks of the Nails ſhould be ſomewhat ſlat, and the Points ſharp, without hollowneſs or flaw, and ſtiffer towards the Head above then beneath. And when you drive, drive at the firſt with ſoft ſtrokes, and with a light <hi>Hammer,</hi> until the Nail be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what entred, and in Shooing fine and delicate Horſes, Greaſe the Points of the Nails with foſt Greaſe, that ſo they may enter the more eaſily, and drive the two Talon-Nails firſt. Then look whether the Shoo ſtandeth right or not, which you ſhall perceive in beholding the Fruſh, for if the Spunges on both ſides be equally diſtant from the Fruſh, then it ſtandeth right, if not, then amend it and ſet the Shoo right, and ſtanding right drive in another Nail, that done, let the Horſe ſet down his Foot again, and look round about it, to ſee whether it fitteth the Horſes Foot in all places, and whether he treadeth even or juſt on it or not, and if you ſee that the Shoo doth not furniſh every part equally, but appeareth more on one ſide then another; Then lift up the Horſes other Foot, that ſo he may ſtand ſteadily upon that Foot, and ſo ſtanding ſtrike him on the Hoof with your <hi>Hammer</hi> on that ſide that the Shoo is ſcant, and that ſhall make the Shoo to come that way. The Shoo ſtanding ſtreight and juſt, drive in the reſt of all the Nails, to the Number of eight, that is to ſay, four on one ſide, and four on another, ſo as the Points of the Nails may ſeem to ſtand in the out-ſide of the Hoof, even and juſt one by another, as it were in a Circular Line, and not out of order like the Teeth of a Saw, whereof one is bent one way and another another way. That done, cut them off and clinch them, ſo as the Clinches may be hidden in the Hoof, which by cutting the Hoof with a point of a Knife, a little beneath the appearing of the Nail, you may eaſily do.

                     <p n="1">I. THAT all Diſeaſes are Cured by their Contraries, and all parts of the Body are maintained by their like, <hi>viz.</hi> If Heat be the Cauſe of the Diſtemper, then appropriate thoſe Medicin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s that are cold to it; If cold, then give hot; If Wind be the cauſe of Illneſs, then finde out in your Table of Simples proper Medicines for that Diſeaſe, and uſe them according to Directions.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Apply not the Medicines to one part of the Body, that are appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to another part, <hi>viz.</hi> If the Brain be over-heated, uſe not ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines as cool the Heart and Liver.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. If you give diſtilled Waters for the Diſeaſe you intend to Cure; Give ſuch Water as is diſtilled out of the Herb proper for that Diſeaſe, and ſweeten it with the ſame quantity of Syrup as you give Water, made alſo of the ſame Herb, or ſome other proper for the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. If the Diſeaſe of the Body lie remote from the Stomach and Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, then uſe Pills or Balls, which is the moſt proper Phyſick for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, becauſe they are longeſt in digeſtion, and therefore the moſt fit to carry off the Diſeaſe by degrees.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. Rather be found faulty on the ſafer ſide, by giving your Phyſick too weak then too ſtrong.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. Conſider the natural temper of your Horſes Body that is afflicted, and ſupport it in that, or elſe you weaken and deſtroy Nature, in ſtead of Repairing it; as the Heart is hot, the Brain cold, ſo apply your Simples accordingly.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Thoſe Medicines that are hot in the firſt degree, are juſt of the heat

and temper of the Blood, and therefore moſt wholeſom and proper for the Body.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. All Medicines that are opening and provoke Urine, are beſt given in white-Wine or Ale, for they are of an opening Nature, and a great Strengthner of the Reins.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. All Medicines that are given to ſtop any Looſneſs or Scouring, let him faſt three houres or more before he receive them.</p>
                     <p n="10">X. Let your Medicines be proper to the humor offending<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or elſe you will weaken Nature, not the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p n="11">XI. If the Humor offending be thin, that you intend to remove, then let your Medicine be gentle; but if it be thick and tough, then give him ſome cutting and opening thing the Night before, to prepare his Body the better for his Purge the next day.</p>
                     <p n="12">XII. Have a care how you uſe binding Medicines, when you purge tough humors.</p>
                     <p n="13">XIII. If your Horſe be bound in his Body, either Rake him with your Hand, (being firſt anointed with Sallet Oyl, Hogs-Greaſe or ſweet But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, before you pull his baked or hard dung from him) or elſe give him a Gliſter before you give him a Purge.</p>
                     <p n="14">XIV. You muſt conſider the ſtrength and ſtature of your Horſe, and accordingly prepare your Medicines, either ſtronger or weaker.</p>
                     <p n="15">XV. If you give your Horſe a Drench for a Cold, you uſually give him of theſe ſorts of Powders. <hi>viz.</hi> Fennegreek, Liquoris, Bay berries, Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeds, Cummin-ſeeds, Grains of Paradice, Long Pepper, Elecampane, Turmerick, &amp;c. But be ſure you exceed not above three Ounces of them in his Drench at one time.</p>
                     <p n="16">XVI. If you give a Horſe a Scouring that is very ſtrong and luſty, you may venture to give him with ſafety an Ounce or more of the beſt <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badoes Alloes,</hi> (which is the ſtrongeſt ſort of <hi>Aloes</hi> that is) powdred and made up into Balls with freſh Butter, as you have Directions after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                     <p n="17">XVII. If you give <hi>Aloes Succotrina,</hi> you may give an Ounce and an half of it. (becauſe it is of a weaker Nature than the other) diſſolved on the Fire in half a Pint of white-Wine, and brewed afterwards in a quart of ſtrong Beer, with about two Ounces of freſh Butter put into it, which by reaſon of the Looſning and Opening quality it hath, will cauſe the Aloes to work ſo much the ſooner and better. This Proportion is to be given only to a large and ſtrong conſtitutioned Horſe, a leſs quantity will ſerve a ſmaller.</p>

                     <p>There are four ſeveral ſorts of them, and differ only in Purity, <hi>viz. Aloes Caballina, Aloes Hepatica, Aloes Barbadoes,</hi> and <hi>Aloes Succotrina.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="227" facs="tcp:36503:121"/>
1. <hi>Aloes Caballina</hi> is a yellowiſh ſort of Aloes, much of the colour of a boiled Liver, and is ſomewhat dearer, ſtronger and better then <hi>Aloes Hepatica.</hi> This is ſeldom ſold by it ſelf, but kept only to mix amongſt the black and courſer ſort of Aloes, to give them a good colour.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>es Hepatica</hi> is much of the ſame kind with the <hi>Caballina</hi> (for they come over mixt together) but is of a blackiſh Roziny colour when Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, which is accounted the beſt colour.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Aloes of Barbadoes</hi> is found out but of late years, but is accounted the ſtrongeſt ſort of all the kinds of them; If it be of a duskiſh ſad brown, and hath an Eye of yellow amongſt it, you may conclude it to be good; but the moſt common colour is black like unto Pitch; An Ounce of either of theſe three is a Purge ſtrong enough for moſt reaſonable Horſes.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Aloes Succotrina</hi> is the weakeſt, but beſt of all the kinds of them; If you break it thin, and find it of a clear Roziny colour, and tranſparent, you may be ſatisfied 'tis the very beſt. This is four times dearer then the other ſorts, and is alſo Given to Horſes, (but in a larger quantity) by thoſe that value not their Purſes.</p>
                     <p n="18">XVIII. If you make your Balls of the Powder of Aloes and Butter, mix it not all at once with the Butter, but work it up in a little at firſt, and then divide it into three equal parts, and cover every part over with freſh Butter, about the bigneſs of a ſmall Waſh-ball, which will prevent the bitter taſte of the Aloes from offending him when you give them, give him a Horn-full of warm Beer after every one of them, not only to prevent ſticking, but to clear his Paſſage, the better for the remaining Balls. But the beſt Way of making of Balls of Aloes for a Scouring you may find after the beſt Receipt for the Glanders, within a leaf of the latter end of the Book.</p>
                     <p n="19">XIX. If you put <hi>London</hi>-Treacle at any time into your Horſes Drinks, put not above one Ounce of it at a time where there are other Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, but if you give it by it ſelf, you may give him two Ounces of it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in a pint of Sack, or for want of that a quart of good Ale or Beer.</p>
                     <p n="20">XX. When you phyſick your Horſe at any time, give him his Hay ſo ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly over-night, that he may ſtand two or three houres at the Rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaves, and let him faſt three or four houres after he hath taken it.</p>
                     <p n="21">XXI. 'Tis good to ſtir him a little after he hath taken his Drink, which will make his phyſick work ſo much the better.</p>
                     <p n="22">XXII. If you are about the Cure of any outward Wound or Sore, the beſt way to Expedite it, is to keep the place warm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is done by clapping a plaiſter of <hi>Burguna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And about three or four houres after it, give him the common Cordial for Horſes, which is made of a quart or three Pints of ſtrong Beer, with a good big Toaſt of Houſhold Wheat-bread crumbed into it groſs and well boied. Before you give it him, while it is cooling, put into it two or three ſpoonfuls of Honey, and about two Ounces of freſh or ſalt Butter, and let him have it luke-warm; Give him at Night a Maſh of Malt, or Oats, that are boiled till they are burſten. After he hath eaten them, let him feed upon Hay for about an hour or more, then give him warm-VVater to drink, with a handful or two of VVheat-Bran ſtirred amongſt it; The next morning give him his Cordial again, and at Nine or Ten of the Clock warm-VVater and Bran, and boiled Oats, and now and then a Cordial of white-VVine and Honey, and moderate Exerciſe once or twice a day, (if he be not too weak to walk.) This is the only Method that I know of that you can uſe for the Recovery of a ſick and weak Horſe, and for to Remedy his Coſtiveneſs which does uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally attend Sickneſſes.</p>

In all Bruiſes by Falls or any other Accidents, 'tis good to Bleed firſt in the common Bleeding Neck-Vein, before you give him any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Medicines for it, and be very careful that what you give him be not binding things, for they will ſo coagulate and thicken the ſtrained blood, that it cannot have its free paſſage through the Uriter Vein as it ſhould have, which will be very prejudicial to his Health.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The beſt thing you can give him for any inward Bruiſe or Wrench in the Back or Kidneys, is common Turpentine made into Balls, with the beſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liquoris-powder you can get for Money, about an Ounce of it given him every Morning for about a Week together, and a Plaiſter or Charge applied at the ſame time to his Loyns or Fillets, made up with <hi>Oxicrocium</hi> and <hi>Paracelſus</hi> melted together, will perfectly Cure him in a Month at fartheſt, you may renew your Charge, if there be occaſion.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. All things that provoke Urine are very good for him, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed Blood muſt have its Vent through the Uriter-Veins, or elſe it will do him but little good.</p>

4. If your Horſe hath a Strain upon the Back-Sinews; 'tis alſo very convenient to let him Blood with your Fleam on the Shackle-Vein, on the Paſtern-Joynt, the Hair being firſt clipped away, to the end you may the better ſee how to ſtrike the Vein; When you have ſo done, apply your Piaiſter or Charge of <hi>Oxicrocium</hi> and <hi>Paracelſus</hi> melted together, as before directed, and laid hot upon the grieved part, and let it lie on till it come off of it ſelf, and it will Cure him in a very ſhort time.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. The Juices that you are to preſs out of Herbs, Plants, Tops and Flowers muſt be done when they are young and tender.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If you intend to preſerve them ſome time, you muſt gather them when they be thoroughly dry.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When you uſe them they muſt be bruiſed in a Stone-Mortar with a wooden Peſtle, and put afterwards into a Canvaſs bag, and the Juice preſſed out in a Preſs, and when you have ſo done ſet it over the Fire in an Earthen Pipkin or Skillet, and clarifie it by taking off the ſcum that ſhall ariſe; You may know when it is well clarified, for then the ſcum will not appear on the top.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. This being Clarified according to your mind, you may preſerve it for your uſe, (in the Winter when you can get no Herbs) theſe two ways. Firſt, by putting it into a Glaſs when it is cold, and pouring ſo much Sallet Oyl over it as will cover it, let the Oyl lie about the thickneſs of two Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers above the Juice; This Oyl being of a light Body will always get up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt, and keep out the Air from entring, and ſo preſerve it the better from putrefaction. When you have occaſion to uſe it, pour it out into a Porringer or any other convenient Veſſel, ſo much as you think you ſhall uſe, and take off the Oyl that comes out with it, with a little Cotton or with a Spoon, and put the remainder back again in the Glaſs, (if you leave any) and it will quickly ſink under the Oyl again, &amp;c. The ſecond way of preſerving it is after you have Clarified it, to boyl it over again, (being firſt cold) to the thickneſs of Honey, and this way it is uſed for the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the Mouth.</p>

<pb n="403" facs="tcp:36503:209"/>

                     <p n="2">2. If you intend any Phyſick for preſent uſe, let the Herbs, Roots, Seeds and Flowers be always in a readineſs, ready dried in your Houſe, that ſo you may not want them when you come to uſe them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They will keep beſt whole, for being beaten and made into pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they will be ſoon penetrated by the Air, which will cauſe them to loſe much of their Strength and Virtue.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If you find them not dry enough to beat, make them fit for the Peſtle by drying them by the Fire.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. When you uſe them, beat them as ſmall as you can, and then Sift them through an indifferent fine Sieve.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. To one Ounce of this Powder you may add three Ounces of clarified Honey, and make up what quantity of Electuary you pleaſe, according to the occaſion and uſe you have for it.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Your Honey muſt be clarified by the Fire, by ſcumming off the ſcum from it that ſhall ariſe.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Mix the Powders and this Honey very well together in a Mortar, before you put them up for your uſe.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The uſual Doſe of Cordial Electuary is from one Ounce to two Ounces, diſſolved in a pint or a quart of ſtrong warm Ale or Beer, and given him in the Morning or Evening faſting, and to faſt two or three houres after it.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. Diſtilled Waters are the weakeſt of all Artificial Medicines, and made more weak by diſtilling them in a Pewter Still, being good for very little unleſs mixed with other Medicines. But the ſtrongeſt Way of Stilling them is in Sand.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When they are diſtilled put them up into a Glaſs, and bind on the Top of it a Paper prick't full of Holes, that ſo the fiery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Vapours may Exhale, for elſe they will cauſe them to Mother, which will corrupt the Waters. Then cover them cloſe, and keep them for your uſe.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Stopping them with Cork is the common Way though not the beſt, becauſe that Way will make them grow Muſty, and not much better is Paper, if it be ſuffered to touch the Water; But the beſt and moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Way to keep them is to Top them with a Bladder, being firſt wet in Water, and bound over the Glaſs.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Thoſe Waters that are diſtilled in a Pewter Still will not keep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a year good, when thoſe that are diſtilled in Sand will keep twice as long.</p>

They are thus made, <hi>viz.</hi> To every pound of Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers well pickt, add three Pints of Spring Water made boyling hot on the Fire; Put them in an Earthen Veſſel, and put the Water to them, then cover it cloſe, and let it ſtand by the Fire to infuſe about twelve or thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen houres, then ſtrain it out (in ſuch Syrups as Purge, as Peach-Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Damask Roſes, &amp;c. the uſual and beſt way is to repeat to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion freſh Flowers divers times, which after you have ſtrained it out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome convenient Veſſel, add to every pint of it two pounds of Loaf Sugar, then melt it over a gentle Fire again, taking off the Scum that ſhall ariſe, and your Syrup is made.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Thoſe Syrups that are made by Decoction are made of Compounds, yet any Simple Herb may be made alſo into a Syrup; Take the Root, Herb or Flower you intend to make into a Syrup, and bruiſe it a little in a Mortar; Then take it forth, and put to every Handful of Roots, Herbs or Flowers, a pint of Running Water, and boyl it till half the Water be
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:36503:211"/>
conſumed; After you have ſo done, ſtrain it through a Woollen Cloth, letting it Run out at leiſure without preſſing; And to every pint of this Decoction add one pound of Sugar; then boyl it again over the Fire till it come to a Syrup, which you may know when it is well done, if you take a little of it now and then in a Spoon, and let it cool. Be ſure you take off the Filth that doth ariſe while it is a boyling; And when you think it is enough, ſtrain it hot through a Woollen Cloth, and preſs it out and keep it for your uſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Syrups that are made by Juices, uſually are made of ſuch Herbs as are moſt full of Juice, and are beſt made this Way, <hi>viz.</hi> Take the Herbs and beat them in a Mortar with a Wooden Peſtle, then preſs forth the Juice, and Clarifie it as you were taught before in Juices, then ſet it over the Fire again, and let it boyl till a quarter of it be conſumed, and to a Pint of it add a pound of Sugar, and boyl it up to a Syrup, keeping it ſcumming all the while; When you think it is well boiled, ſtrain it through a Woollen Cloth, as you did the other, and keep it for your uſe.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If you make Syrups of Roots that are hard, as Graſs-Roots, Parſley, Fennel, &amp;c. Bruiſe them very well firſt, then lay them aſteep in that Water you intend to boyl them in, which will cauſe the Vertue of them to come forth ſo much the better.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Your Syrups that are well made will keep ſomewhat above a year, but ſuch as are made by Infuſion will not keep ſo long.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The beſt Way to keep them when made, is in Glaſs or Stone-pots, and to bind a Paper about the Mouth of them.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. If you make a Decoction for to cleanſe the Paſſages of Urine, and to open Obſtructions, chuſe rather to make it of white-Wine, becauſe it is of a more penetrating and ſubtil Nature then Water.</p>

                     <p n="5">5. All the difference that are between Decoctions and Syrups made by Decoction, is only this, Syrups are made to keep, Decoctions only for preſent ſpending.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. When you give your Horſe a Purge or Scouring, either for Surfeit, Cold, or any other Illneſs, let him faſt about three houres before he takes it, and about three or four houres after it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Let the firſt thing he eats after he hath faſted his limited time, be a Maſh of Malt or boiled Oats, and let him not have it till his Phyſick hath wrought twice or thrice with him, which will ſet it working ſo much the more freely.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If you give him Hay firſt, before you give him his Maſh, 'twill ſo bind his Phyſick upon his Stomach, that it will ſpoil the Operation and working quality thereof, to the no little prejudice of his Health.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The beſt time in my opinion is to give it him about four or five in the Afternoon, for then 'tis poſſible you may ſee the Working of it the next Morning, which if you give it him in the Morning (which is the uſual time of giving a Horſe Phyſick) it may work in the Night, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent you of ſeeing the Operation thereof.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. According to the ſtrength of your Horſes Body, and the quantity or quality of the Phyſick you give him will be the Operation of it, for in ſome Horſes it will work in twelve houres, in others not in twenty four, and again in others not in fourty eight.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Let him have no Water, till after his Phyſick hath done working, and then let it be a little Aired before you give it him, with a Handful or two of Wheat-bran put amongſt it.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. If you fear your Horſe is troubled with Bots or Wormes, and that you find him to begin to dung looſe after his Purging, then put a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baccho-pipe at the ſame time ready lighted into his Fundament (breaking off ſome part of it before you put it in, leſt it prove too long) and the Wind from within his Body will draw it out, as orderly as if it were taken at your Mouth, ſo that the Smoke being thus received into his Body will ſo ſuffocate and choak them, that it will make them to let go their hold, which being looſe will be the more eaſily thrown out by the Purge in his Excrements.</p>

                        <hi>Foundering in the Feet,</hi> cometh evermore by hard riding, or ſore labour, by great heats and colds, whichdiſtemper the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ſtirs up peccant and malignant humors, that inflames the Blood, melts the Greaſe, and cauſeth it to deſcend downwards into his Feet, and there ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, which cauſeth ſuch a numbneſs and pricking in his Hoofs, that he hath no ſenſe nor feeling of them, for he is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly able to ſtand, which if he do, it is but after a feeble manner, for you may ſoon puſh him down with your hand; beſides, he will ſtand ſhaking and quaking, as if he had a Fit of an Ague. This diſeaſe cometh ſeveral ways, ſometimes by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering him when he is very Fat, and his Greaſe molten within him, and then ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly cooled, by ſetting him upon cold Planks without Litter, or taking his Saddle off too ſoon, or elſe by letting him ſtand when he is hot in ſome ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low water up to the Feet-locks; by which means, through the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary coldneſs of it, cauſeth the Molten-Greaſe to deſcend into his Feet, and there to cake and congeal, which is the true reaſon of this Malady. A Horſe alſo may be Foundred by wearing ſtrait Shoos in the heat of Summer, and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling upon hard Ground. To know when a horſe is foundred upon his ſore-feet, and not on his hinder-feet. You may know it by this, He will tread only upon his hinder-feet, and as little as he can on his fore-Feet, and go crouching and crimpling with his buttocks. Sometimes he will be Foundred on his hinder feet, and not on his fore-feet, (but this is very ſeldom) which you may know by his ſeeming very weak behind, and will reſt himſelf as much upon his fore-feet as he can, being very fearful to ſet his hinder-feet to the Ground. 271</item>

And if it be of a long ſtanding, he will be very hollow upon the brisket, towards the Arm-holes, and will go wider beneath at the Feet, then above at the Knees. The Cure I ſet down here, becauſe it is not in the place of Cures: 'Tis this, Give him a Slit with a ſharp Knife an inch long, upon both ſides, an inch under the ſhoulder-bone: then with a large Quill put into the Slit, blow up firſt one ſhoulder, and then the other, as big as you can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, even up to the Withers, and with your hand ſtrike the Wind equally into every place of the ſhoulders, and when they be both full, beat all the windy pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with a good Hazel wand over all the Shoulder, then with a flat Sclice of Iron looſen the skin within from the fleſh: Then rowel the two ſlits or cuts, with two round Rowels made of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Leather of an old Shoo, with a hole in the midſt, that the corruption may iſſue forth, and let the Rowels be three
