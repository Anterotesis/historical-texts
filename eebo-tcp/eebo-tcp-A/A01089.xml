            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

hath a moovable bead upon it for speciall use. The

behind the Quadrant, and is hung upon a pinne at
the bottome of the Quadrant, noted with W. The

of your plaine, both for declinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and inclination. The best way to
come to the plaines declination is by
helpe of the Sunnes Azimuth.</p>
               <p>By having the Latitude of the place; The place
of the Sunne in the Eclipticke, and the altitude of
the Sunne above the Horizon, you may find out
the Azimuth thereof in this manner.</p>
               <p>Adde the Sunnes altitude, and your latitude to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and substract the lesser of them from the
greater; So shall you have the summe of them, and
the Difference of them. With this summe and
difference, come to your Quadrant, and according
to the time of the yeare (as the lines will direct
you) <hi>Count the said Summe and Difference</hi> respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively,
and applying the threed unto them, find
out the Sunnes place in the Parallels serving there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and where the threed cuts this Parallel, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Azimuth there intersecting, for that is the
Azimuth from the South, if you number it from
the line whereon the summe was numbred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Example</hi> 1. In the North latitude of 52 gr. 30
min. in the Summer-time the Sunne entring into
8, and the altitude being observed 30 gr: 45 min.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2628:11"/>
I adde the latitude 52 gr. 30 min. and the Sunnes
altitude 30 gr. 45 min So I find the summe of
them 83 gr. 15 min. and substracting the lesser of
them from the greater, I find the difference of them
21 gr. 45 min. The summe I number in the line
AE, and the difference in DC (because it is in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer)
and to the termes I apply the threed, and
where it crosseth the parallel of the beginning of
8, there I meet with 66 gr. 43 min. which is the
Azimuth from the South, being reckoned
from the line AE whereon the Summe was
counted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Example</hi> 2. The latitude and Sunnes place being
the same if the altitude had beene 9 gr. 15 min.
The summe of the latitude and altitude would bee
61 gr. 45 min. The difference 43 gr. 15 min. and
so the threed applyed to these termes would have
shewed 96 gr. 52 min. for the Azimuth from the
South.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A third Example.</hi> In the same Latitude of 52 gr.
30 min. in the Winter-time, the Sunne entring the
tenth degree of ♏, and the altitude being 9 gr.
30 min. I would know the Azimuth of the Sun
from the South. I adde the Altitude 9 gr. 30 min.
to the Latitude 52 gr. 30 min. and so find the
summe of them 62 gr. 0 min. And substracting
the Altitude out of the Latitude, I find the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of them 43 gr. 0 min. The summe (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is in Winter) I count upon the line DC
in the Quadrant, and the Difference upon AE. So
the threed applyed to these tearmes cutteth the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2628:11"/>
tenth of ♏, at 49 gr. 50 min. which is the Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth

               <p>To find out this declination you must make two
observations by the Sunne: The first is of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
or angle made betweene the Axis of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontall
line of the Plaine, and the Azimuth
wherein the Sunne is at the time of observation.
The second is of the Suns Altitude. Both these
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2628:12"/>
observations should bee made at one instant, which
may bee done by two observers, but if they bee
made by one, the lesse distance of time betweene
them, will make the worke to agree together the
better.</p>
               <p>1. For the Distance. Upon your Plaine draw
a line parallel to the horizon, to this line apply the
side of your Quadrant, holding it parallel to the
horizon. Then holding up a threed and plummer,
which must hang at full liberty, so as the shadow
of the threed may passe through the center of the
Quadrant, observe the Angle made upon the
Quadrant by the shadow of the threed, and that
side that lyeth perpendicular to the horizontall
line, for that angle is the Distance required.</p>
               <p>2. At the same instant as neere as may be, take
the Sunnes Altitude; These two being heedfully
done, will helpe you to the plaines Declination by
these rules following.</p>
               <p>When you have taken the Altitude, you may
find the Sunnes Azimuth by the former Chapter.
Then observe, whether the Sunne bee betweene
the Pole of the horizontall line and the

                     <item>South</item>
                     <item>North</item>

point or not.</p>
               <p>If the Sunne be betweene them, adde the Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth
and Distance together, and the summe of
them is the Declination of the plaine.</p>
               <p>If the Sunne be not betweene them, subduct the
lesser of them from the greater, and the difference
shall be the Declination of the plaine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:2628:12"/>
¶By your observation you may know to

               <p>This Prosthaphaereticall-arke is to be used as the
Inclination was in the precedent Chapter. For,</p>
               <p>If the Plaine doe incline towards the South, it
must be added to your Latitude: and so the summe
(if lesse then 90 degrees) gives you the <hi>New Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:</hi>

the residue, or supplement of it to 180 degrees

               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:2628:16"/>
If the Plaine incline toward the North, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare

line of latitudes, and of TV the line of Houres;
which two lines with the helpe of the limbe
VCTB, and of the threed and Bead, will serve to
pricke downe any Diall, by the Precepts hereafter
delivered. And first we begin with those Plaines
which have no declination, whose Poles lye di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
under the Meridian of the place; of which
sort are the Horizontall, the Erect South and
North plaines, with all Incliners looking directly
North or South.</p>
               <p>Having then by the former Precepts found the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:2628:17"/>
Elevation of the pole above your Plaine, you may
begin your draught in this manner.</p>
               <p>First, Draw the line RAT of sufficient length,
and out of the line of Latitudes in your Quadrant,
take off the Elevation of the pole above the plaine,
and pricke it downe from the point A, unto R and
T both wayes.</p>
               <p>2. Take the line of Houres TV also out of the
Quadrant, and with that extent of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes
upon R and T as upon two centers, draw the
arkes BV and CV, crossing each other in V; and
draw the lines RV and TV: then comming to
your Quadrant againe;</p>
               <p>3. Apply the threed to every houre point in the
limbe VT or CB, as first to s, or r, so shall it cutte
the Line of houres TV in 1; Then take off with
your Compasses T1, and pricke it downe here
from V to 1, and from T to 7. Again, Apply your
threed to the next houre in the limbe at n or m, it
will cut the Line of houres TV in 2 take off T2,
and prick it down here from V to 2, and from T to
8. So againe, the threed applyed to the third noure
at y, or u, cuts the line TV, in 3; take off T3, and
pricke it downe here from V to 3, and from T to 9.
In like manner, the threed applyed to the fourth
houre at o, or i, will cut the line TV in 4 take off
T4, and pricke it downe here from V to 4, and
from T to 10. So also the threed laid upon the fifth
houre at e, or a, cutteth TV in 5; take off T5, and
prick it downe here from V to 5, and from T to 11.
Thus are all the Houres pricked downe.</p>
               <p>

               </figure>
               <p>Lastly then, laying your Ruler to the center A,
through each of these points, you shall draw the
houre-lines A7, A8, A9, A10, A11, AV which
is 12, A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, RAT is the line of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2628:18"/>
the two sixes. So having 12 houres, which is halfe
the Diall, drawne, you may extend the necessarie
lines, as many as you will, beyond this center, as
5A5, 4A4, 7A7, 8A8, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the same manner may the halfe houres bee
pricked downe and drawne, by applying the threed
to the halfe houres in the limbe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And note also that in these Plaines before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;
As the extent from V to 1, is the same
with that from T to 7, so likewise is it the same
with V11, R5; And as V2 is the same with T8, so
likewise is it the same with V10, R4: So likewise
V9 and T9 are all one, and both equall to R3 and
V3. So that the three first houres taken from the
Quadrant, that is to say, T1, T2, T3, will give all
the houres for these Dialls. T1, gives V1, V11,
R5, T7. T2, gives V2, V10, R4, T8. T3,
gives V3 or R3, V9 or T9. But in other Plaines
it is not so, for which cause I have rather set downe
this way before at length, as a direction for what
comes after, for that is generall.</p>
               <p>Here note againe, that if you desire to make your
draught greater, you may in your description ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
double or triple every length which you take
in your Compasses. And so I proceed to all decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

1. Asbefore; Upon the line RAT, set off the
Elevation of the pole above the plaine, being taken
out of the line of latitudes in the Quadrant, from
A both wayes, to R and T.</p>
               <p>2. Take the line of Houres TV out of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant,
and with that extent upon R and T as upon
two centers, describe the two arkes BV and CV
crossing at V, and draw the lines RV, TV, and AV.
Thus farre we goe along with the last Chapter.</p>
               <p>3. If we take the example in the seventh chapter,
that plaine is the upper face of an East incliner,
whose Elevation is 37 gr. 26 min. and so much
doth this line TA reach unto in the line of Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes:
the Rectifying arke is 35 gr. 58 min. This
arke I number below in the limbe of the Quadrant
ES, and thereto applying the threed I observe in
the upper limbe Vcb T which of the Houres and
where it cutteth, I find it to cut the slope line o u
in the point P; to this point P I set the Bead, which
by this meanes is rectified and fitted to the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Diall.</p>
               <p>Here you see the use of the Bead, and the reason
why this arke counted upon the limbe is called
the Rectifying arke: and here bee carefull that
you stretch not the threed.</p>
               <p>4. The threed and Bead being thus placed and
rectified, you shall see the threed to cut the line TV
at <hi>a</hi> upon the Quadrant; take T <hi>a</hi> in your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes,
and pricke it downe here from V to 12, and
from R to 6.</p>
               <p>Here by the way observe, that because this
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:2628:19"/>
plaine is an Eeast-incliner, the face of it loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
toward the West, and then if you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
the true scituation of this Diall upon the
plaine whereon it must stand, you will easily
conceive that the line of 12 is to stand on the
right hand from the line AV. and so the line
of 6 on the left hand, whereas if this plaine
had faced toward the East, the line of 12 must
have stood on the left hand, and 6 on the
right hand. Your owne conceit, together
with the precepts of the chapter following,
must helpe in this, and in other things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the right scituating of the lineaments of
your Diall.</p>
               <p>To proceed then,</p>
               <p>In the same manner must you apply the Bead to
every houre line, as in the next place I remove it to
the line y m in the Quadrant, and then I see it to
cut the line TV in b; I take 1 b in my Compasses,
and with it doe pricke downe from V to 1, and
from R to 7. Againe, the Bead being applyed to
the lines nr, sb, the threed will cut the line TV up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Quadrant in c and d; I take the points TC,
Td, in my Compasses, and pricke them downe
from V to 2 and 3, and from R to 8 and 9. Then
againe, the Bead applyed to the lines ei, Va, the
threed will cut the line TV in the points e and o; I
take then Te and Tf, and pricke them downe from
U <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o 11 and 10, and from R to 5 and 4.</p>
               <p>5. Lastly, lay your rule to A, and draw A10,
A11, A12, A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2628:20"/>
A9. Thus have you twelve houres, and if you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
these beyond the Center, you shall have the
whole 24 houres, of which number you may take
those that shall bee fit for the Plaine in this scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The halfe houres may thus bee pricked on and
drawne also, by applying the Bead to the halfe
houres pricked downe in Vcb T the upper limbe of
the Quadrant, for so the threed will give you the
halfe houre points upon the line TV, which may
be taken off, and set downe upon the Diall as the
houres themselves were.</p>

last Chapter, they are to be placed in a
right scituation upon their Plaine.
Which to doe, upon some Plaines is
more difficult than the Description of
the Diall it selfe. To give some directions herein,
I have added this Chapter, where you have 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
with their Answers, giving light sufficient to
what is here intended and required: but first be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished
of three things.</p>
               <p>1. That the inclination mentioned Chap. 8. is
the very same in Use with the Prosthaphaereticall
arke mentioned Chapter 9. And therefore when I
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2628:20"/>
mention the Prosthaphaereticall arke, because it is
of most frequent use, you must remember I meane
both the Prosthaph: arke, Chap. 9, and the Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
Chap. 8.</p>
               <p>2. That these rules, though given primarily for
places of North-latitude, lying within the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate,
Torrid, and Frigid Zones, yet are also as
true, and may bee applyed to all places of South-latitude,
if we exchange the names of North and
South, for South and North.</p>
               <p>Here by the way note, that the North part of
the Torrid Zone extendeth from 0 degrees of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude

from 23 gr. 30 min. to 66 gr. 30 min. the
Frigid Zone extendeth from 66 gr. 30 min. to
90 gr. of latitude. And so I come to the 9 Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

common way, to protract them by an equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
circle, for otherwise the style will be alway of
one distance from the Plaine, be the Diall greater
or lesser.</p>
               <p>The Polar plaines that decline, before they can be
described, must have their <hi>New-inclination</hi> known,
and then their delineation will be easie, the manner
of it may be seene in this Example.</p>
               <p>Suppose the upper face of a North-inclining
Plaine, lying in the Latitude of 52 gr. 30 min. to
decline from the South toward the East 68 gr. and
to incline towards the North 73 gr. 57 min. you
shall find by the ninth Chapter, the Prosthaph: arke
to be 52 gr. 30 min. the same with the Latitude of
the place, and therefore you may conclude this
plaine to be Polar. By the same Chapter you shall
find the New inclination to be 63 degrees.</p>
               <p>When you have these you may draw your Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micircle
AB4, and divide it into 12 equall parts for
the houres: so signing the new-inclination 63 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
from A to B, draw CB: and supposing the
altitude of your style to be CD, through D draw
the perpendicular D 12; and where the lines
drawne from C through the divisions of the semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle
doe cut the line D 12, there raise perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2628:26"/>
for the houres, and so finish it up as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
is. The style lyeth directly over and parallel to
the substyle CB, &amp; the distance of it from the plain
is CD, and in this Example the substyle CB stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
from the line of 12 Westward, because the
plaine declineth Eastward, according to the rules
in the former Chapter, and so doe the morning
houres also.</p>
               <p>For the placing of the Diall in a true site upon
the Plaine, you shall find by the answer to the 9
Quest. in the former Chapter, that the Meridian
ascendeth 55 gr. 38 min. for other necessaries, the
precepts of the former Chapter will direct you.
Onely observe, that in Upright East and West

ascendeth above the North end of the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontall

               <p>The readiest way to find the Meridian line is by
the North-starre. This starre is within 2 degr. 37
min. of the North-pole. The North-pole lyes
very neere betweene Allioth, or the root of the
great Beares tayle, and this starre; You may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
imagine where the Pole is, if you conceive a
right line drawne from the Pole-starre to Allioth,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2628:27"/>
and by your imagination suppose ⅔ parts of the
distance of the next starre of the little Beares taile
from the Pole-starre to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Allioth,</hi> for there is
the very Pole-point. Now
then if you set up two
poles aslope, and from the
tops of them hang two
cords with weights at the
ends of them, and turne
them till you standing on
the South-side of them
may see them both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<figure/>with the Pole-point, as it were all in one
line, then be sure these two cords doe hang in the
Meridian line, or very neere it, yea so neere it, that
though you should erre 3 degrees herein (wherein
you need not to erre one degree) yet will not the
Meridian altitude in these Climates (especially
more Northward) faile you above 3 minutes,
which is neere enough to our purpose. I have here
given you the chiefe starres of the great and little
Beares, that by them you may come to know the
starres used in this observation, and so find the very
Pole-point it selfe.</p>

               <p>Before you can find the Declination, you must
know the Sunnes place, and for such as know not
the use of the Astronomicall tables, an Almanacke
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:2628:28"/>
will serve, where for every day at noone, you shall
find the Sunnes place in signes, degrees and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes.
The degr. and min. must bee numbred in
their Signes upon the limbe, and the threed applyed
thereto will shew the declination answerable.
As for example. September 21. 1637 in the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manack
for this yeare, the Sunne is found to be in
8 gr. 23 min. of ♎. In the Quadrants limbe I
looke for the Signe ♎ and number there, 8 gr.
23 min. whereto apply the threed, I find it to cut
in the scale of Declinations 3 gr. 20 min.</p>

               <head>4. By the Meridian Altitude, and declination of the

the Elevation of the Pole above
the Horizon.</head>
               <p>Compare the Sunnes Meridian altitude and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
together, and if the Sunne be in a North
Signe as ♈♉♊♋♌♍, then substract the declinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
out of the Meridian altitude, so shall the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
give you the height of the Equinoctiall.
But if the Sun be in the South Signes, as ♎♏♐♑♒♓,
then adde the declination to the Meridian altitude,
so shall the summe give you the height of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall,
which being taken out of the Quadrant
or 90 degrees, leaveth the Latitude of your
place, or the Elevation of the Pole above your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizen.</p>
               <p>For Example. Upon the 21 of September 1637.
I observed the Sunnes altitude in the Meridian to
be 34 gr. 10 min. Upon which day I find the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2628:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Sunnes place to be (as before) 8 gr. 23 min. of ♎,
and the declination 3 gr. 20 min. And because
the Sun is in a South signe, I adde this declination
and Meridian altitude together; the summe 37 gr.
30 min. is the altitude of the Aequator, and
this taken out of 90 degrees leaveth
52 gr. 30 min. for the Latitude
of Coventrie.</p>
