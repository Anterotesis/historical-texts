         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Sir <hi>William Belford</hi> having thought

take his pleasure where his Lordship
thought fitting; the said Lord <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dison,</hi>
promising upon his honour, to
continue and remaine a prisoner to
him, and at every 6. dayes end, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare

to <hi>Windsor,</hi> sent one of his Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peters
to the aforenamed prisoner;
with a Message, claiming him as his
owne, and according to his vow and
promise.</p>
            <p>This Trumpeter was detained and
kept there by the Lord <hi>Grandison</hi> and
<hi>Prince Rupert,</hi> and after 4. or 5. dayes present
<pb facs="tcp:54851:3"/>
there, it was agreed and concluded
of by the said Prince RVPERT,
and the Lord GRANDISON;
that a Challeng should be sent to Sir
WILLIAM.</p>
            <p>Which to give all good Christians
and well affected people, that have
a helping hand in this cause of Christ,
I thought fit and meete, to set it here
downe in briefe, in this following and
reall relation.</p>
            <p>The Lord GRANDISON ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after some time spent in consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
upon the Message sent be Sir
WILLIAM, he made it knowne
to Prince RVPERT; where they
both consulted together that these
ensuing words would be sent to the
party that were the Author of the
Message, and it was performed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
            <p>For a Trumpeter came from them,
with a warrant under the hand of P.
<hi>Rupert,</hi> wherein was this Chalenge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:54851:4"/>
Sir, I having received your Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
I could do no otherwise, but to
send you this chaleng, for the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and vindication of my honour,
and fidility; Wherein I do dare you
(seeiug that you claime me as your
prisoner) to meete at any place
where you shall thinke fitting, there
to encounter with me at a single Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell,
or else to bring your Troope of
Horse, and so to have a pitched Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to try the valour of us both, and
our followers.</p>
            <p>And I do promise, that there shall
no man come with me, then you will
appoint to come with you.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>William</hi> having received this
chaleng, he was not a little over joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but immediately made his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
acquainted with the same;
And sent this answer by the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter
that brought the chalenge.</p>
            <p>That as the Lord GRANDISON
had sent such a Message to him, dare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:54851:4"/>
to meete him in any place where
he did thinke fitting.</p>
            <p>So he did send the like words to
him; desiring and dareing the said
Lord, or Prince RVPERT; or
any other person of Honour in His
MAIESTIES Army, either to
encounter with him at a single Duell
or else with their Troopes of Horse;
And that although the Lord promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to bring an equall number to Sir
<hi>William.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He made answer, that he did not
feare to meete him, if that he did
bring five to one; And for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
he did not value it at all.</p>
            <p>Declaring, that he had stained his
honour, and blemished his name,
by proving Trecherous, and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p>This answer Sir <hi>William</hi> returned
by the Trumpeter that brought the
chaleng, a youth not above fifteene
yeares of age, who came first unto
<pb facs="tcp:54851:5"/>
               <hi>Maiden-head,</hi> and there had a safe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
to <hi>Windsor,</hi> where the Trumpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was had before my Lord Generall
and after some examination of the
youth, his Excelency gave him a twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
shillings peece, for his good beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
before him; and upon <hi>Tuesday</hi>
last, the Trumpeter returned from
<hi>Windsor,</hi> and came to <hi>Maiden-head,</hi>
where he was blindfolded out of the
