            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Moreover I take God (which alone ſeeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heart) to recorde to my conſcience / beſechinge him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> my parte be not in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bloude of Chriſt / if I wrote of all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I have wrytte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thorow ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te all my boke / ought of an evell purpoſe / of envie or malice to anye ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / or to ſtere vp any falſe doctrine or opinion in the churche of Chriſt / or to be auctor of anye ſecte / or to dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we diſciples after me / or that I wolde be eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med or had in pryce above the leaſt chylde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is borne / ſave onlye of pitie &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion I had &amp; yet have on the blindnes of my brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / &amp; to bringe them vnto the knowledge of Chriſt / &amp;

to make every one of them / if it were poſſible as perfect as an angell of heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / &amp; to wede ou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is not planted of oure hevenly father / &amp; to bringe doune all that lyfteth vp it ſelfe agaynſt the knowledge of the ſalvacion that is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bloude of Chriſt.

            <p>As concerninge all I have tranſlated or other wiſe written / I beſeche all men to reade it for that purpoſe I wrote it: even to bringe them to the knowledge of the ſcripture. And as farre as the ſcripture approveth it / ſo farre to alowe it / &amp; if in anye place the worde of god dyſalow it / there to refuſe it / as I do before oure ſavyour Chriſt &amp; his congregacion.

            <p>Wherfore I beſeche George Ioye / ye &amp; all other to / for to tranſlate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcripture for them
<pb facs="tcp:2623:16"/>
ſelves / whether oute of Greke / Latyn: or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue.

two verſes. Thy Lorde God is one God: and thou ſhalt loue thy Lorde God with all thyne heart / with all thy ſoule / with all thy power and with all thy myght.

            <p>Hell: it is called in Hebrue the valeye of<note place="margin">math. v.</note> Hennon. A place by Ieruſalem / where they burnt their chyldren in fyer vnto the ydole Moloch / &amp; is vſurped &amp; taken now for a pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce where the wycked and vngodlye ſhalbe tor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mented both ſoule and bodye / after the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall iudgement.</p>
            <p>Geue Rowme to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wrath of God. Rom. xii<note place="margin">rom. xxii</note> wrath is there taken for vengeaunce. And the meaninge is: let God advenge / ether by him<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe or by the officers that beare his rowme.</p>
            <p>There tarye &amp; abyde tyll ye go oute. Yt is<note place="margin">mat. x.</note> in Marke the .vi. Whereſoever ye enter in to an houſe / there abyde till ye go oute the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And Luke .ix. it is / into what ſoever houſſe ye enter / ther tarye / and go not oute thence: that is to ſaye / whoſoever receaveth you / there
<pb facs="tcp:2623:430"/>
abyde as longe as you are in the citie or tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne / and go not ſhamefully a beggynge from houſſe to houſſe as freers do.</p>
            <p>Duſt: ſhake of the duſt of youre fete. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew.<note place="margin">mat. x.</note> x. Why are they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to ſhake of the duſt? For a wytnes ſayth Luke. That that dede maye teſtifie agaynſt them in the daye of iudgement / that the doctrine of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion was offered them / but they wolde not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave it. Ye ſe alſo that ſoche geſtures and ce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>remonies haue greater power with them / then have bare wordes onlye / to move the harte &amp; to ſtere vp fayth / as do the layenge on of han<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des and anoyntinge with oyle. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Ypocrytes / can ye decerne the face of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and not decerne the ſigne of the tymes? That is to ſaye: they coulde iudge by the ſig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes<note place="margin">math. xvi</note> of the ſkye what wether ſhuld folowe: but coulde not knowe Chriſt by the ſignes of the ſcripture. And yet other ſigne myght not be geven them.</p>
            <p>He that ſayth he knoweth Chriſt and ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth not his commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes / ys a lyar. To knowe Chriſt is to beleve in Chriſt. Ergo he that kepeth not the commaundementes / be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leveth not in Chriſt.</p>
