            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>See how active the <hi>Queen</hi> is for <hi>promoting</hi> her <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and what <hi>power</hi> and <hi>intereſts</hi> ſhe hath with his Majeſtie, and his Counſells, which cannot be expreſſed in words, and what <hi>dependance</hi> ſhe hath to <hi>Rome,</hi> and all the Prieſts and Jeſuits both in <hi>Forraigne Nations,</hi> and in <hi>England,</hi> conſider alſo what <hi>Motives</hi> and prayers have been made amongſt all the <hi>Roman</hi>

               <hi>Catholiks</hi> all over Chriſtendom, for the good ſucceſſe of the <hi>Kings Armies,</hi> alſo I could go backe and tell you of the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonning of <hi>Marquis Hamilton,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>Popes Nuntioes</hi> reſiding here, and if <hi>Windebanke</hi> and others of their <hi>Orders,</hi> and <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants</hi> in favour of <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and alſo their intended Maſſacre againſt the <hi>chiefeſt Pillars</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Marquis of <hi>Argile,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Lowden,</hi> and Earle of <hi>Leven</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others when the King was in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the very ſame day the <hi>Rebellion</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> brake forth.</p>
            <p>Conſider alſo the <hi>Subtile ingagements</hi> of divers of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> in this war againſt the Parliament and Kingdom, a <hi>deſigne</hi> of the Jeſuits, fetched from <hi>Hell,</hi> to make an inveterate hatred in this Kingdom to that <hi>family,</hi> thereby if it were poſſible, to take away all hopes of ever recovering the <hi>Palatinate</hi> again for the right owners.</p>
            <p>Looke upon the perſons that ſide with the <hi>King</hi> in this war, if not for the moſt part, almoſt generally <hi>Papiſts, Biſhops,</hi> and their adherents, Monopolizers, delinquents to the State, beggerly Gentry of this Kingdom, and of the better ſort of Nobles, and Gentlemen, terrified and frighted with the <hi>Lions Skin,</hi> and <hi>Foxes Cunning,</hi> ſome gained with terrour, others with hope of honour, and preferment; this hath much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed that party amongſt the Gentry, and none but know that his <hi>Majeſties</hi> Store-houſe of Common Souldiers, he raiſeth from the dark corners of the Land, where ignorance, blindneſſe, and Libertiniſme is prdominant and a pious god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miniſtery very ſcarcely to be heard of, where the Lords day is known by a few Common Prayers in the morning, and by dancing, drinking, and rioting about a May-Pole in the afternoone.</p>
            <p>I have now traced and touched upon ſome of the <hi>heades</hi> of thoſe abuſes and falſe pretences, and <hi>black engins</hi> which our enemies have wrought withall to Cozen, and cheat us of our <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> and any underſtanding man

by this diſcourſe may eaſily diſcerne <hi>Popery,</hi> and <hi>Slavery</hi> was intended: And now curteous Reader, ſince ſo many <hi>ſtratagems</hi> and <hi>Traps</hi> have been laid to inſnare thy <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and to bereave thee of thy <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> and fully laid open by the <hi>bleſsing of God,</hi> in this <hi>fixed Parliament,</hi> who have laboured well nigh <hi>foure yeares</hi> againſt <hi>Mountains</hi> of dangers and difficulties, and have alſo caſed you of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>burthens</hi> of ſhipmony, High Commiſſion Court, Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polizers, and have ſet thee at Liberty from the <hi>Iron Yoake</hi> of Biſhops, and their Hierarchy, and dependants, and are ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and wreſtling to ſettle the in thee true <hi>Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> in the purity thereof, to be governed by Lawes, and not by Horſes, and Garriſons, as in other Nations: nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>fancie,</hi> and <hi>will</hi> of the <hi>Prince</hi> or his <hi>favorite,</hi> and alſo indeavoring to ſave <hi>three Kingdomes</hi> from a dying, and ſad Condition they are now in, which will beſt appeare, and be diſcerned when the <hi>preſent Wars</hi> is over, when we ſhall <hi>enjoy</hi> what we now ſo much contend for: Therefore my <hi>advice</hi> is, that every man that loves his <hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> to uſe his utmoſt, in their <hi>Prayers,</hi> in their <hi>purſes,</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> to uphold the <hi>Spirits</hi> of ſuch as faithfully ſtand for theirs, and the Kingdoms good, to their calling in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though ſome of their <hi>Members</hi> be turned <hi>Apoſtats,</hi> and <hi>rotten,</hi> being toſſed, and ſhaken away, with the <hi>anger</hi> of the King, or <hi>inticed</hi> away by <hi>preferments,</hi> or ſuch like va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; are theſe things worth the <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> of the Nation? In a word I dare boldly ſay, that man which doth not cordially uphold, and defend <hi>Parliaments</hi> in times of <hi>try all,</hi> doth as much as in him lies, to <hi>deſtroy</hi> the ſame, and then I <hi>appeale</hi> to every mans <hi>conſcience;</hi> If in <hi>deſtroying</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, thou doeſt not as much, as in thou lieſt, deſtroy <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> of the Kingdome, which God grant we may never live to ſee.</p>
