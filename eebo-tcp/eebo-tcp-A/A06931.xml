            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>First for my birth (so hie my fortunes stood,)</l>
               <l>I issued from an antient worthy blood:</l>
               <l>And faster then my yeares my beauties sprang,</l>

               <l>And hardly numbring twelue yeares was renownd,</l>

               <l>But what auailes the beauty of the cheeke,</l>
               <l>When soule adorning vertue is to seeke?</l>
               <l>Better want life then knowledge, sith tis sayd,</l>
               <l>Pietie liues when beauties glosse is dead.</l>
               <l>Comercement base is youths prorested foe,</l>
               <l>Pitch doth desile, and ils from ill do floe.</l>
               <l>Voluptuous idlenesse was my first nursse,</l>
               <l>And drunken pleasures fixt me to my cursse,</l>
               <l>Garments as rich as star-light, daintie fare,</l>
               <l>Mirth and soft lodging my worst minions are:</l>

               <l>My happie father dead, my mothers loue</l>
               <l>Gaue my youths vines freely leaue to moue:</l>
               <l>A wanton mother breeds a daughter light,</l>
               <l>And appetite doth seldome leade youth right:</l>
               <l>Into disorder all my motions flies,</l>
               <l>Yet in my life no one fault she espies:</l>
               <l>Feeding my wanton humors with delight,</l>
               <l>Bridles no errors, but giues error might.</l>
               <l>Hence I began to chide shame from my face,</l>
               <l>To taunt at modest goodnes, scoffe at grace:</l>
               <l>So that at thirteene yeares (O monstrous thought)</l>

               <l>My mother (antient read in rules of lust)</l>
               <l>Soone reads mine errors in her owne distrust:</l>
               <l>And seeing that the shame recurelesse was,</l>
               <l>With a smooth brow of silence lets it passe.</l>
               <l>Only dismist him and dissembled it,</l>

                  </note> Is held by <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth, a cruell man,</l>
               <l>Who raignes a tyrant ore the Curtezan:</l>
               <l>Blasting our glories euen with his looke,</l>
               <l>And cursing vs with candell, bell and booke.</l>
               <l>Of the first foure which I in order nam'd</l>
               <l>I must speake well, or else be highly blam'd.</l>
               <l>But of this <hi>Paul</hi> who would heauens keyes possesse,</l>
               <l>I must affirme he was too mercilesse:</l>
               <l>And by his rigor seeketh to withdraw,</l>
               <l>Men from free loue, by cruel penall law</l>
               <l>Forbidding by an edict generall,</l>
               <l>That Rome shall hold no curtezan at all:</l>
               <l>But that on paine of death they shall depart,</l>
               <l>Or else indure the scourge of greatest smart.</l>
               <l>O <hi>Paul,</hi> thine errours fault thou dost not view,</l>
               <l>Nor how great dangers will hereof ensue:</l>
               <l>For if all curtezans, or their defect,</l>
               <l>Which Rome so much doth honour and affect,</l>
               <l>Shall be exil'd, and leaue this well knowne ground,</l>
               <l>What stranger then to liue here will be found?</l>
               <l>If they be banisht hence, through thy great hate,</l>
               <l>Rome will be desert, and vnfortunate.</l>

All will be gone, or else in womans stead,</l>
               <l>Each man will haue for lust his <hi>Ganimede:</hi>
               </l>

               <l>Take women then, <hi>Burdashes</hi> doe refuse.</l>
               <l>The first is naturall, although a crime,</l>
               <l>Th'other horrid, damn'd the spewe of time,</l>
               <l>O times, O manners, O vnluckie age,</l>
               <l>O <hi>Rome</hi> once master, now worse then a page!</l>
               <l>Wast not enough that ciuil mutiny,</l>
               <l>Sould suffer all the world to pray on thee,</l>

               <l>Blood thirsty warre, and famine, leane and lanke;</l>

               <l>For which thou ought'st to weepe as much as those</l>
               <l>Thine antient monuments which now to dust</l>
               <l>Are turnd? O who to mortall things would trust!</l>
               <l>Deare daughter, dearer vnto me then life,</l>
               <l>Why wert thou borne in such an age of strife?</l>
               <l>VVhy haue I liued to see thee miserable,</l>

               <l>That liuely rose and lillie in thy cheeke,</l>
               <l>That pearl-set mouth, that forhead smooth &amp; sleeke,</l>
               <l>And that fine waste, whence men do rarenes scanne,</l>
               <l>Be made a pray, not to a gentleman,</l>
               <l>But to some base groome or artificer?</l>
               <l>Doe thus thy starres marke thy dishonor?</l>
               <l>Haue I for this so chairely brought thee vp,</l>

               <l>Wast not enough that I was plagud before,</l>

               <l>My voice is stopt, grief's master of my words,</l>
               <l>And teares are all the talke mine eies affords.</l>
               <l>O you that shall by chance but read my story,</l>
               <l>(Though fewe to heare of my mishap are sory)</l>
               <l>Pardon my lauish speech, it is a wrong</l>

               <l>Since now I haue my life discourst at large,</l>

               <l>Rather she doth preserue me for more woe.</l>

Ill gotren goods are seldome long enioid,</l>
