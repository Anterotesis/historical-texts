            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Letter from a Gentleman at London,
to his Friend in the Countrey, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AS preſſing as I perceive by your Letter, your deſire is, to be
throughly informed of the Truth of what has paſſed, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Counterfeit <hi>Luzancy;</hi> I can aſſure you mine is no
leſs, to ſatisfy you in a buſineſs, which has made ſo much
noiſe, and which is yet ſo much talk'd of. I cannot chuſe but commend
you in this, as in all other occaſions for believing no more, then comes
from good hands: In which Proceeding I obſerve the true Character
of a man of worth, one who judges not by noiſe, and who far from let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
himſelf be carried with the ſtream, hearkens to the common cry with
ſuſpition. I perceive by this exact prudence, you have not forgot,
though you have quitted the world, and that 'twas long experience and
wearineſs of the impertinencies of it, which made the reſolution you have
taken, to ſpend the reſt of your dayes in a Retreat. Where cured of the
diſeaſe of vulgar opinions, you feed on what Phyloſophy affords, of
moſt pure, and moſt free, from the errors of the age. If all thoſe who
are obliged to continue in the trouble and confuſion, from which you
have been ſo wiſe as to diſengage your ſelf, had their ſouls as well ſet,
and diſpoſitions as rational as yours, they would examine matters with
conſideration: and to avoid engaging every day to condemn their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
without a hearing, would not judge of, and decide the merits of the
Cauſe, purely on ſight of his Breviate. But we live in an age where peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are far from doing juſtice to themſelves, that they might render it to
others, and I am but to acquaint you with what I know of the buſineſs
in queſtion, to ſhew you into what an abyſs of confuſion, man is capable
of falling, when he has for Guides, theſe two Monſters, which tyrannize
over all conditions, high and low, I mean <hi>Paſſion</hi> and <hi>Prejudice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will touch the leſs material points but ſlightly, and ſince you have
heard of the Vagabond in the Countrey, it will be ſufficient to tell you, that
he came to <hi>London,</hi> without clothes, without ſhoes, without money, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59648:2"/>
without any recommendation from <hi>France:</hi> That upon his own word,
and at the inſtance of ſome, who ſolicited in his behalf, he was permitted
to get into the Pulpit, there to declare the motives of his Converſion.
The diſcourſe he made, and which he delivered with much boldneſs,
gain'd him the eſteem of his Auditors, who for the moſt part charm'd
with his Eloquence, and full of compaſſion for his miſery, ſoon caſt about
to put him into a condition of appearing in a decent habit and ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.</p>
            <p>This happened when the Court was upon removing to <hi>Windſor,</hi> that
journey gave occaſion to the Lady Marqueſs <hi>de Ruvigny</hi> Embaſſadreſs of
<hi>France,</hi> to deſire this new Proſelyte to go and Preach at her houſe at
<hi>Windſor.</hi> A Requeſt ſo obliging as that of this Lady, could not fail of
ſucceſs, <hi>Luzancy</hi> was too ſenſible of the advantage, and his beſt friends
(who at preſent are againſt him) were raviſh'd at an occaſion ſo favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
which furniſh'd him with convenience to make himſelf known.
Their hopes did not prove vain, his Sermons made a noiſe at <hi>Court,</hi> as
well as at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and much forwardneſs there was in Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to do him good: witneſs the favours he rceived from my Lord Duke
of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> and the Marqueſs of <hi>Ruvigny,</hi> who honoured him with a
place at his own Table, noon and night, and gave him all the marks of
eſteem which could be expected from one of his ranke, ſo many expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of kindneſs, which he dayly received from that Embaſſador and his
Lady, in my opinion ought to have oblig'd <hi>Luzancy</hi> to Confide in them,
and tell them truly who he was, or at leaſt who he was not, for he was all
this while taken for the Abbot <hi>Luzancy</hi> of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> but by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd
impudence, never to be forgot. They are the two
whom he has the moſt abus'd, and who yet by a Prodigy, whereof I
cannot yet dive into the bottome, have moſt contributed to ſave his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
when it was upon the point of being caſt away, of which you will
find convincing proof, and ſuch as will ſurprize you in the ſequel of this
Letter.</p>
            <p>At this time all went with the counter feit <hi>Luzancy</hi> even to his wiſh, and
his friends ſaw from far his Fortune haſtning on a pace towards him:
His Sermon being Printed, had got him credit with the Biſhop of <hi>Oxford</hi>
(at preſent of <hi>London)</hi> to whom he had Dedicated it: The Duke of
<hi>Lauderdale</hi> had preſented him, the Lady Marqueſs <hi>de Ruvigny</hi> beſides
dyet and lodging, allowed him a Lackquey to waite on him: in a word
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59648:2"/>
there was vying who ſhould do moſt: Nay there were ſome who kept
their diſtance with him, believing that they had to do under the name
of <hi>Luzancy</hi> of <hi>Sorborn,</hi> with a Man of Quality; for no body
doubted but he was what he ſaid himſelf to be; In fine, one would
have thought nothing had been able to trouble the calm he then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd:
but his Mask being ſoon pull'd off, he was notorioſly known
to be <hi>Hipolitus Chaſtlett</hi> Son to a famous common Woman named
<hi>Beauchaſteau</hi> a Player belonging to the <hi>Hoſtel de Burgoyn</hi> at <hi>Paris.</hi> By
it we came alſo to know that among the Fathers of the Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
at <hi>Vitry,</hi> he had been a ſmall Uſher of the 5th. Form: that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
he had been with ſome Biſhops, and a Preacher Errant, here and
there, in little Towns, whereof the moſt conſiderable is <hi>Montdidier</hi> in
<hi>Picardy,</hi> and that at laſt having plaid divers Pranks which expoſed him
to the purſuit of Juſtice, his ſafety had oblig'd him to quit <hi>France,</hi> and
ſeek Shelter in <hi>England,</hi> which ſerv'd him for a Stage to act all ſorts of
Perſons upon; whereof I am about to make you a deſcription, having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
care to inform my ſelf exactly, and convers'd with Friends, Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and Neuters of all ſorts both Engliſh and ſtrangers.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the Evidence of all this matter of Fact, this Cheat
dextrous at Lying, and with a Tongue well hung, for a while ſhifted off
all theſe Truths, and told his tale with ſo many ſpecious circumſtances,
that the wiſeſt Men were impos'd upon, but at his buſineſs with
St. <hi>Germayne</hi> the Jeſuit, things appeared ſo groſly forged, that his
moſt intimate Friends opened their Eyes, and thoſe who by too haſty
Zeal had aſſiſted towards his raiſing, were Convinc'd of his Impoſtures
by their own knowledg, and ſoon deſerted him and publiſh'd his Villanies.</p>
            <p>When Fortune has once undertaken the Advancement of a Favorite,
ſhe never fails of her deſign whatever oppoſition can be made, ſhe has
Arts to blind Men withal, and to give even Vice a tincture of Vertue,
enough to keep it from appearing, and if her own tricks will not ſerve,
ſhe can take Advantage of the prejudice of a Nation, and the circumſtance
of time. It was ſufficient for <hi>Luzancy</hi> to accuſe a Jeſuit, to ſwear his ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine,
and like an impudent Tartuff to appear in his Majeſties Privy Council
and all this while the Parliament was ſitting; Theſe things I ſay were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to make his Oaths, at firſt daſh be taken for Truths, fit to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd
by ſound of Trumpet, and ſet up at the corners of all the Streets;
in a Conjuncture ſo nice People would be ſure enough not to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59648:3"/>
to a through examination of ſo great a Trifle in reſpect of thoſe
things which at that time buſied the Court and Parliament. Neither was
the action imputed to St. <hi>Germain,</hi> to ſtand in Competition with the
important affairs of State, which endured no delay to allow Convenience
for clearing an Accuſation which concern'd only a ſingle Man, and he a
Jeſuit: This kept the buſineſs from being ſearch'd to the bottom. And
I conceive that thoſe, who as you know then medled with it, Acted with
much prudence upon that maxime of <hi>Tacitus, Omne magnum exemplum
habet aliquid ex iniquo quod utilitate publica compenſatur.</hi> For my part,
who am but a Cypher in the World, and who go on my great Road with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being diverted by the Proſpect of any worldly Policy, I have made
a reſolution for the ſake of Truth, and to do you a pleaſure, to Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
in few words, both the Crime laid to the charge of the Jeſuite, and
the perſon of the Informer, the Counterfeit <hi>Luzancy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To give a clear and diſtinct Idea of the Accuſation in queſtion, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
it's either force or weakneſs, we are to conſider it in three reſpects.
Firſt, of the Accuſer. Secondly, of the Crime. Thirdly, of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
which attend it.</p>
            <p>If we caſt our Eye on the Accuſer there is good aſſurance to be had,
that he is a Cheat, and a notorious Lyar, whoſe Life hitherto has been
made up of Impoſtures; and this, when there ſhall be Judges Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionated
to examine what he has done beyond and on this ſide the Sea,
ſhall be Legally proved: If we look on the Crime it is ſo pitifully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
that one muſt be a perfect Ideot not to perceive its weakneſs; (and
for the Circumſtances (the beſt means to diſcover the Truth in ſuch caſes)
they all make for the Jeſuit: we muſt run over ſome of them, to judg
well of the Crime.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it was a Month or five weeks before <hi>Luzancy</hi> made a noiſe of
the pretended Aſſaſſinat to be committed on him, nay he ſaid not ſo much
as a word of it to Mr. <hi>Ruvigny</hi> or his Lady, with whom he was as one
of the Family, and for this, 'tis but inquiring of them. This Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
alone is deciſive.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They threatned him, ſays he, with a Piſtol at his Throat,
he does whatſoever they deſire, and after all ſuffers them to depart with
all the quietneſs in the World, without crying out when they were
gone, and without mentioning a word to any body till more than fifteen
days after.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:59648:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Thirdly, He entertains Correſpondence both by word and writing
with this very Jeſuit, his Mortal Enemy; he writes him Billets, he vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites
him ſeveral times: he promiſes him the Theſes of <hi>Monſier Le Blane</hi>
Profeſſor of Divinity, lately printed, and which a Miniſter of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi>
had nicely preſented to him; he Communicates to him the Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
he had from two <hi>French</hi> Biſhops; In fine, there paſſes a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
time before <hi>Luzancy</hi> dreams of contriving his Tragedy.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, In ſeventeen days he ſpeaks not of the Aſſaſſinate to his
dear Friend the <hi>Sieur Corbiere,</hi> who itching to be ſeen at Court and in
Parliament would needs make a ſtudyed Certificate in his favor. This
<hi>Corbiere</hi> is a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> the ſtory of whoſe Life rejected him from an
Honorable Imployment which he ſhould have had with Mr. <hi>Skelton,</hi>
whom the King has ſent to the Emperor's Court.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Luzancy</hi> goes to a Merchant to deſire him to find a Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
for <hi>Luzancy</hi> to return into <hi>France;</hi> and at the ſame time perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Proſelite to return to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and this when Judges
ſhall be appointed, that Proſelyte will depoſe.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, The Diveliſh writing which he ſays was extorted from him
by Piſtols and Daggers, is written in a hand natural and free, tis his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſtyle, 'tis in ſome place razed; ſigns rather of the Attention of one
ſtudying alone, then the confuſion of a Man Tranſcribing with a Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
at his Throat.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Is it likely a Jeſuit, whoſe name is ſo Odious in <hi>England,</hi>
durſt venture on ſo ſtrange an action, and this in the middle of <hi>London,</hi>
and for no greater advantage then to gain a ſimple private Man? To gain
a King, or ſave a Kingdom a Jeſuit poſſibly might venture hanging, and
ſo horrible an Action as Aſſaſſinate, otherwiſe a Jeſuit does not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value
his Life ſo much, as to caſt it away for a Trifle, eſpecially one ſo
well at Eaſe as St. <hi>Germain</hi> was.</p>
            <p>In fine, whoever would ſift the pitiful Evaſions, contained in the
written Diſcourſe, which <hi>Luzancy</hi> gave to Sir <hi>Joſeph Williamſon</hi> Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
of State, would find things ſo abſurd and groſs, that they who
have countenanc'd them with Authority, would be without excuſe if
Reaſon of State did not free them from blame.</p>
            <p>Mean time this Admirable Reaſon of State, or the Zeal without
knowledg of ſome Men, wrought ſo, that all <hi>England</hi> almoſt was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd
with the pretended crime of the Jeſuit, and falſe innocence of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59648:4"/>
               <hi>Luzancy;</hi> Thoſe who have no other knowledg of him then by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
look upon him as a Martyr, ſome who began to have other
thoughts of him are reſetled in their good opinion, while they ſee my
Lord Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> openly protect him; Others to lay on an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to imbroyl things and make their Zeal to the Proteſtant Religion
appear, have gone far in this buſineſs, and contributed much to the
ſucceſs which you know he has had yet there remains a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of thoſe who look purely after Truth, and ſeperate themſelves from
the Crowds, to follow and never ſwerve from her.</p>
            <p>I had Inlarged my Self farther on this Subject, if I did not think I had
ſaid enough to give you an Idea of all this Farce. Let us now paſs
forwards and trace <hi>Luzancy</hi> ſtep by ſtep, in the remaining Acts of a
piece, which includes I know not how many incidents of a different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and which tis fit the World ſhould know, that he may the better be
underſtood.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Germain</hi> having been without hearing, as ſoon condemned as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed,
<hi>Luzancy</hi>'s Advancement was powerfully carryed on, My Lord
Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> took care to have him Ordained and made him Preach
immediately, deſigning to put him into a Condition of becoming one
day a great Defendor of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> And becauſe he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Language of the Countrey to make his Talents appear, he was
ſent to <hi>Oxford</hi> to Learn it. All this was done in an unimaginable Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
'Twas to much purpoſe for the Paſtors and ſeveral Maſters of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of the Church at the <hi>Savoy</hi> to cry out. Nothing could ſtop the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous
Current of my Lord Biſhop's reſolution, and as if it had been a
matter of main import for the upholding of the <hi>Orthodox Faith,</hi> they
drive on his Preferment without obſerving the leaſt Meaſure in the
world.</p>
            <p>While this was a Brewing an Engliſh Miniſter belonging to the <hi>French</hi>
Church; named Mr. <hi>du Mareſq,</hi> full of Zeal for the Truth printed a
Sermon which he had Preached during theſe Buſtles, and this for the
reaſons which he gives in his Preface, they were no ſooner come abroad
but my Lord Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> thought both the one and the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
the Thunder of his Eccleſiaſtical tribunal: To this purpoſe he
cauſed all the Coppies to be ſeized. The Miniſter was cited to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
Court, where at firſt they wrangl'd with him about a Licence to
Preach, which neither he nor any of his Collegues had ever heard of:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59648:4"/>
At laſt after much ado they diſcovered where the ſhoo truly pinch'd;
My Lord Biſhop was offended by his falling upon <hi>Luzancy:</hi> And would
needs have the Miniſter to ask forgiveneſs of God, his Neighbor, the
Church, and his Superior: This is not enough; the Miniſter muſt alſo
acknowledg, that he is Convinc'd in Conſcience that he has offended
God, and his Neighbor, by printing Scandalous things: Yet we have
not all, a Declaration too muſt be Sign'd and Seal'd, otherwiſe the
Miniſter is undone. And becauſe he refus'd a Motion ſo extraordinary,
My Lord Biſhop preſently caus'd him to be publickly Interdicted the
functions of his Charge, upon a <hi>Sunday</hi> in the midſt of his Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
            <p>A proceeding ſo ſevere againſt a Miniſter very well ſpoken of opened
the Eyes and underſtandings, of divers who want none: they ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to inquire attentively, what theſe ſcandalous things were, which
were imputed to him, but their ſearch was Fruitleſs, they found nothing
that look'd towards it. In fine, like the five Propoſitions which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
at <hi>Rome</hi> they maintained, were in the Book of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> they
perceived theſe Scandals ow'd their birth to ſharpneſs and prejudice.</p>
            <p>Mean time this Miniſter of the Goſpel, becauſe he ſtood firm to the
maintenance of Truth, was openly ſuſpended for reaſons reſerved to my
Lord Biſhop and his Officers. They had a care not to ſay what theſe
reaſons were, they were too frivolous, and would have cover'd the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
with Shame and Blame: But by a ſlight not welbecoming a Biſhop
they conceal'd the Account of a proceeding ſo defective. They had much
rather People ſhould have Occaſion to believe horrible things of this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,
than publiſh his fault it was ſo light. And my Lord Biſhop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
doubtes not but Men will judg by the prerogative of his Dignity,
that the right is on his ſide, and that 'twas enough to make one paſs for
Criminal to be accuſed and puniſh'd by a perſon ſo venerable as himſelf
<hi>Quis ſanctum dubitet, quem apex tantae Dignitatis attollit?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this as I have been informed, paſt in the moſt unuſual manner in the
World. The Miniſter is Condemned without being heard according to
the formalities of Law: 'Twas much to purpoſe for him to offer to
juſtify himſelf. The Biſhop refuſes to ſee him; ſlights the ſubmiſſive
Letters which the Miniſter writes to him; and by his Order the Judges
of his Court paſs Sentence without ſaying or knowing wherefore: who
would have believed a Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> one of a Noble Family, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59648:5"/>

who has no ſmall pretentions to the Archbiſhoprik of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> had
been capable of ſuch a Carriage. After ſo much noiſe what could we
expect from a proceeding ſo rigorous? It was believed my Lord Biſhop
would never have reſtor'd this Miniſter at leaſt on eaſier terms than very
ample ſatisfaction, ſuch as might hold proportion with the Offence;
which People were made believe the Biſhop had received. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
againſt the opinion of many (by the good Offices of Monſieur
<hi>Durel,</hi> together with thoſe of Monſieur <hi>Ruvigny</hi> who had a mind to
Oblige the Biſhop, and was pleaſed to Interpoſe without being intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.)
The Miniſter was reſtored to the exerciſe of his charge upon a bare
acknowledgment that he was in the wrong to print his Preface without
Licence from his Superior, or any elſe in Authority, &amp;c. a poor and
dry ſatisfaction in my opinion after ſo much ado, and which juſtifies the
Miniſter, for as much as he has publiſh'd againſt <hi>Luzancy,</hi> and the
Monks, and condemns the rigor uſed to him.</p>
            <p>Behold Sir, whither Paſſion carries Men, behold a Signal example in
the perſon of a Biſhop! The Sanctuary is not priviledg'd, and we are
not afraid to ſet it awork even in that Holy Place: Where is that Charity
whereof ſo unſeaſonably in reſpect of Knaves we pride our ſelves when
to uphold them we overwhelm a Miniſter of the word of God? What
a horrible uſe do we in theſe days make of it? When the matters treated
on in the Preface were without Reply, muſt a whole Kingdom for a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
point of Honor, needs have cauſe to believe, that the Miniſter was
a Lyer, and <hi>Luzancy</hi> and the Monks unjuſtly Attackt? Muſt it needs be
I ſay, that on a pretext ſo ſlight, ſo heavy a Blow ſhould fall on a Man,
whoſe carriage has always been without Reproach, and who without
conſulting Fleſh and Blood reſolved in diſcharge of his Duty to ſpeak
Truths likely to diſpleaſe more than one, and he be puniſhed ſo outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly
for a deſign ſo generouſly executed? we ſee well enough how
the world goes. My Lord Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> had undertaken the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of <hi>Luzancy:</hi> He had a mind to cheriſh this Plant which he had
newly ſet in the Garden of the Church, and could not indure that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
ſhould be inform'd it was of the nature of thoſe Herbs which ſhew
handſomly and yet are full of Poyſon. He could not ſee the Child of
his care and ſtudy wounded, eſpecially in that part where Men are moſt
tender, without receiving the blow upon himſelf; and the Arrows juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhot at the reputation of his Neophyte, have lighted on him. Behold
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59648:6"/>
the true cauſe of the Biſhop's anger. To offend a Knave was to attaque
him; to attaque him was to blemiſh the dignity of his See, and thoſe
immature and haſty deciſions were made both to uphold his Perſon and
his Mitre. Had my Lord Biſhop in the deſign he had to declare himſelf
the ſupport of this Counterfeit Proſelyte conſulted the Commands of
him from whom he holds both this Life and Character, he would have
learned not <hi>to do ill that good may come of it.</hi> And that the uſe of <hi>pious
frauds</hi> is proper only for thoſe places where Religion being deſtitute of
Truth, which is its Baſis, cannot ſubſiſt but by foul Play, with which
thoſe of Wit Amuſe; and make Shittlecocks of the Common People.</p>
            <p>After all how can we henceforward reproach the Papiſts with their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition
when I have acquainted you with things as ſtrange: In good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,
when the wit of Man takes pleaſure in blinding it ſelf how conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
ſoever our Rank is in the world whether in Church or State, and
whatever we deſerve on the account of Learning, and Maſtery in thoſe
commendable Sciences which diſtinguiſh Men one from another, we are
notwithſtanding ſubject to ſtrange ſlips, and if the fall be ſo much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as the place is higher from whence we fall, what grief muſt it be to
a good Biſhop when every one ſees him ſo far out of his Sphaere, and ſo
imprudently derogating from his Character.</p>
            <p>But let us leave my Lord Biſhop a while, for ſince this buſineſs has
made way for ſeveral other incidents, we muſt examine ſome of them
with care, as being no leſs material than thoſe with which I have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
you.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Miniſter du Marreſq</hi> ſeeing himſelf proſecuted with ſo much
heat, and being yet uncertain whether it were for having printed his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
without Licenſe or for having ſaid what he ſays there, thought it
convenient to provide himſelf of all that might ſerve for his defence and
juſtification. To this purpoſe having underſtood a good while before
from <hi>Monſieur Blancard</hi> Secretary to the Embaſſador of <hi>France,</hi> that
druing the time the Court was at <hi>Windſor,</hi> there had paſſed certain Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
and infamous Diſcourſes betwixt <hi>Luzancy</hi> and <hi>Mary Grimplet
Jammarte</hi> waiting Woman to the Lady <hi>Marqueſs Ruvigny,</hi> which had
come to Criminal Actions if both parties had been agreed; He dealt
earneſtly with him to deſire of this woman, that ſhe would ſet down in
writing what had paſt that the Truth might be known and a paſſage of
the Preface juſtified: <hi>Monſieur Blancard</hi> having at firſt word eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59648:7"/>
this writing, gave it to Mrs. <hi>Ann Mareſq,</hi> and the whole Court com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by chance to ſee it, It made ſuch a noiſe, that my Lord Biſhop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
found in it a new ſubject of anger; He would gladly have had the
Woman unſay herſelf, and often ſpoke to <hi>Monſieur de Ruvigny</hi> about
it. <hi>Monſieur de Ruvigny</hi> call'd for her, and ſhe after a great deal of
Talk acknowledged ſhe had ſaid the Truth at the requeſt of <hi>Monſieur
Blancard,</hi> in the interim as plain as the Truth was the Miniſter <hi>Breval</hi>
would needs be medling: He often viſits this woman whom he had never
ſeen before; Fain would he have brought her to recant, but perceiving
ſhe ſtood to the Truth of her writing, had the impudence to ſay where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he came, that Mr. <hi>Blancard</hi> had forc'd her to make that Writing.
This was believed by divers conſiderable Perſons, and the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was alledged that <hi>Monſieur de Ruvigny</hi> ſaid that 'twas true,
that his Secretary <hi>had made the Woman do it.</hi> Theſe four words
were taken as they ſounded, and without reflecting that there was in
them a double ſence, the greateſt part la<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d hold on the worſe as being
conformable to the Reports of <hi>Breval,</hi> and the diſpoſition in which
People were to judg favorably of a Knave, whoſe Emiſſaries gave out,
that Mr. <hi>Blancard</hi> was a Papiſt, and who to oblige <hi>Monſieur du Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſq</hi>
might be like enough to ſuborn a Woman.</p>
            <p>To reſcue this buſineſs from the Confuſion in which they have intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
it, we muſt ſtate it right, and ſay, That 'tis indeed true that <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
Blancard</hi> did get the writing in queſtion from the Woman: but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the plain ordinary way, the way which all the world proceeds by,
<hi>(viz.)</hi> by Requeſt. So that in this ſence Mr. <hi>de Ruvigny</hi> was in the
right when he ſaid his Secretary <hi>had made the Writing be made,</hi> all the
Miſchief is in the Equivocation of the words, and the falſe conſequence
which they draw: <hi>he made the Writing be Signed,</hi> therefore <hi>he did it
by force and ſubornation:</hi> Divers who are not acquainted with Mr. <hi>Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card</hi>
have been wonderfully pleas'd to exerciſe their wit on this ſubject,
and on this is grounded the Calumny which has been publiſh'd againſt
him. I muſt confeſs that <hi>Monſier Ruvigny</hi> himſelf has contributed ſomthing
to it, by thoſe words of two ſences, and to oblige my Lord Biſhop of
<hi>London</hi> who had recourſe only to him. The ſide which the Embaſſador
took from the beginning to favor <hi>Luzancy</hi> allowed him not to explain
himſelf clearly, and perceiving the Bable pleaſed the humor of My Lord
Biſhop, and divers others; he choſe rather dextrouſly to aſſiſt them to
wear it and deceive themſelves then diſcover to them his true thoughts;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59648:7"/>
For it is certain that in this buſineſs, this Old Court Polititian would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
keep to himſelf all the juſt reſentments which without doubt he had of
the tricks play'd him by <hi>Luzancy,</hi> then ſtrive with the ſtream which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor'd
him, by declaring what he truly thought in publick as he did to
his particular friends: Behold the main reaſon why <hi>Luzancy</hi> has not
been ſhamefully thrown out of his Doors; why he, and his Lady more,
have countenanc'd him, and why this refin'd Miniſter of State, has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
diſſembled the better to gain an Aſcendant over thoſe who were
pleas'd with the Chimera, and by that means better ſerve the King his
Maſter.</p>
            <p>To clear this point yet more, is there any likelihood that if <hi>Monſieur de
Ruvigny</hi> had been truly perſuaded of ſo wicked an Attempt practis'd by
his Secretary, one who has ſerv'd him theſe many years, he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to employ him in his buſineſs, and truſt him with the Secrets of
the King his Maſter? can this enter into the Brains of any Man of common
ſence? were peoples eyes not blinded with Paſſion, they would never
run their heads againſt this Poſt.</p>
            <p>But to make an end of clearing the buſineſs is it not true after the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors
uſed by my Lord Biſhop and <hi>Breval</hi> to perſuade People that Mr.
<hi>Blancard</hi> was culpable, that if he truly had been ſo, they would have
cauſed the force of the firſt Writing, which has ſo much ſhocked them to
be voyded, by a ſecond of the ſame hand, why was not the Woman brought
before a Judg and put to declare the Tru<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h upon Oath, and by that means
render it indiſputable? Since this was not, may not we ſay it could not
be done? For it was the only means to decide the Queſtion, ſhe who
was an honeſt woman and a Proteſtant was ſure enough not to unſay her
ſelf, ſince at that very time when <hi>Luzancy</hi> had that diveliſh diſcourſe
with her, ſhe ſpoke of it to ſeveral perſons who if need be will witneſs
it: And I have been informed that Mr. <hi>Blancard</hi> himſelf who paſſes
for a ſincere and good friend, was not wanting to give warning to
<hi>Luzancy</hi> of it, whom he had likewiſe formerly advis'd to leave off that
name as he had quitted that of <hi>dela March</hi> a Month after his Arrival in
<hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding as weak and pitiful as the reaſons are which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadg,
there are ſome who give credit to them and believe that Mr. <hi>Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card</hi>
has ſuborned this Woman, and I am informed they have the credit
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59648:8"/>
to be Abetted by a Noble Lord. I am ſorry that Noble Man, one of
ſuch excellent parts ſhould fall into ſuch a Bogg as this.</p>
            <p>Methinks he might remember a certain famous Jugler, whom time
was he ſheltred againſt Wind and tide, and has ſufficiently repented ſince,
<hi>Aliquando bonus dormitat homerus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us now paſs on to the ſequel of <hi>Luzancy</hi>'s Story, and his witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
It may eaſily be imagin'd how much joy the ſuſpenſion of Mr. <hi>du
Mareſq</hi> brought him: fierce as a <hi>Caeſar</hi> to have a Biſhop for his Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
he undertook ſome weeks ſince to juſtify himſelf in a long Letter
Addreſt as they ſay, to a Lady of Quality, as he proceeds in a manner
peculiar enough, I thought it convenient to examine this Letter, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you with the reflexions I have made which will ſerve for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
to my diſcourſe. This worthy piece being like the laſt Act of
of the Comedy of this Hypocrite. His Letter is written in ſhew to a
Lady of Quality, but in truth to a French Woman named Miſtreſs <hi>Rene</hi>
Wife to a Scotch Taylor living in <hi>Suffolk-ſtreet,</hi> who was one of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zancy</hi>'s
Witneſſes, and one of the Actors in St. <hi>German</hi>'s Tragedy,
This Woman is a curious piece to look on, and one of the moſt infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
remedies of Love that can be met with. A couple of Fellows,
that have no imployment whoſe names are <hi>Le Comte,</hi> and <hi>Champion,</hi>
kept a terrible Pother in diſperſing coppies of this Letter, both in <hi>French</hi>
and <hi>Engliſh</hi> and by their means, it may be called publick, though it
were not Printed, as having gone through as many hands in Manuſcript,
as if it had paſs'd through the Preſs, <hi>Le Comte</hi> the firſt of theſe two
<hi>Frenchmen,</hi> is an old Factioniſt, one who is always an Enemy to the
preſent Government, and who inceſſantly affecting what is paſt, is ſtill
forming frightful Imaginations of what is to come, one of a mutinous
humor of the ſame temper with <hi>Rene</hi> the Taylor, a great Partizan of
<hi>Brevals</hi> as well as he who made himſelf head of the Rabble for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Capucin into the <hi>Savoy,</hi> whom Mr. <hi>Durel,</hi> and divers other
ſober Men judged unworthy of the office of a Proteſtant Preacher, for
reaſons which ſhall be alleadged hereafter. For <hi>Champion</hi> he is a little
pitiful Wretch, heretofore a Monk, now an idle Fellow whoſe tongue is
always imployed in detracting, and Pen in fouling of Paper, Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that impertinent Paultry Anſwer, which he made to the Preface of
Monſieur <hi>du Mareſq,</hi> and which with the Arrogance of an Author
that deſerves a Whipping he went from houſe to houſe to read himſelf;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59648:8"/>
Tis a pitiful Writing void of common ſence, and which has as many
ſaults as words. He is beſides the worthy Copier of all thoſe pieces
which <hi>Luzancy</hi> made to be preſented to the Privy Councel.</p>
            <p>I thought fit to acquaint you what kind of People they are, of whom
<hi>Luzancy</hi> makes uſe, to vent his Tricks, that yov may be ignorant of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which has happened in this abominable Intrigue.</p>
            <p>Let us now go on to examine the ſubſtance of this Cheat's Letter, and
to begin, Imagine with your ſelf a Man who makes an Abridgment of
his Life, and undertakes himſelf to make an Elogy of it, exactly imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Phariſee in the Goſpel, <hi>who gave thanks to God that he was not
like other men,</hi> but not the Publican, who franckly confeſt his faults:
So he ſets off his Righteouſneſs after a very boaſting manner, every
where he makes proteſtations of the innocence of his Converſion, and
purity of his Manners. He flantingly ſets forth the imployments which
he ſays he had both, among Societies, and under Biſhops even beyond
his age, as if this pretended Juſt Man were arriv'd at Chriſtian Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
he impudently maintains that his life has been free not only from
great, but even from the leaſt crimes. After ſuch an aſſurance as he
gives us of his vertue, will not a Manrun great hazard of being thought
ſaucy if he ſhould ſlander him with an imputation of Guilt. And he
whoſe words according to his own ſaying are ſo true, whoſe actions are ſo
innocent, whoſe Qualities ſo rare, ought he not rather to be an object
of every bodies admiration? And yet all this while if we believe our
own Eyes, if the teſtimony of our Ears may be rely'd on, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries
of all <hi>Paris</hi> of both Religions, and a number of People of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
afford any certainty, this falſe Muſter which he makes of ſo many
Vertues, ſerves but to confirm us that he is a through pac'd Knave, a
Rogue capable of any Villany to compaſs his ends, a Cheat, a Makebate,
a Vagabond to day at <hi>Vitry, Regent</hi> of the fifth Form, to morrow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Monks at <hi>Vendoſme,</hi> a little after in the ſervice of a Biſhop,
then in the Abby of <hi>Trape,</hi> next with another Prelate, at laſt a Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Errant, here and there, but chiefly at <hi>Montdidier,</hi> where counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting
the name of <hi>Luzancy,</hi> by a Bill ſigned with that name he cheated
the Damoizele <hi>Cartier</hi> of a piece of Money: All this is very eaſily proved
if there were Judges Commiſſionated to take Information and execute
Puniſhment. This in few words is the Man who deſcirbs himſelf in his
Letter as one exempted from the leaſt Crimes, and who ſays it could not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59648:9"/>
be that he has imbrac'd the Proteſtant Religion, but upon good Motives
ſince in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church he wanted nor occaſions of Debauch, was
not tyed by any Rule nor ſubject to any Law; In fine, he would make
us believe 'twas the pure love of Truth, which has carryed him from his
Country, his Eſtate, his Friends, and all pretences of advancing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
which he might have in his Eye; who is able to reſiſt expreſſions
ſo forcible, and who would not let himſelf be perſuaded by ſuch Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical
Figures of Rhetorick? This crafty Hypocrite draws too, a
Convincing Proof that he has never done any thing worthy of reproach,
from the ſilence of the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> in as much as they, ſay he, ſtirr ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
in producing Proofs of what they affirm.</p>
            <p>To hear him chatter and read his Letter, would not one think all the
world were bound to buſy themſelves either in making Apologies for
him, or ſetting him out for what he is? would not one ſay likewiſe,
that he who is juſtly charged with taking upon him another Man's name,
who can be proved a Lyer, Wencher, an Adulterer, a Deceiver, a
Rook, Prophane and Perjur'd, is a poor Innocent whom the ſilence of
the world Acquits of all theſe crimes? was the like impudence ever heard
of? And this Wretch who has no defence but his Tongue againſt Proofs
of Facts which are brought againſt him, makes loud Braggs of want of
Ability in his Enemies, to verify what they affirm?</p>
            <p>Whereas it were to be wiſhed he would if he could anſwer the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of Mr. <hi>de Mareſq:</hi> He is ſo glad to find in his way my Lord Biſhop
of <hi>London,</hi> thundring at that Miniſter, that he makes that ſerve for a
reaſon of his ſilence in that reſpect. He ſays the actions of that Prelate
are all for him: That they juſtify him but too much; and that to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to defend himſelf; were to wrong the Dignity of his Patron, whoſe
proceedings are ſo favorable to him. And thus the Gallant wards the
blow. He contents himſelf with bemoaning by way of Raillery, the
fate of that Miniſter and only ſays that to anſwer bad Writings is to bring
them into requeſt.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Teſtimony in writing about the Diveliſh Diſcourſe
which he had with the Woman, wherewith I have already entertain'd
you at large, he ſays the carriage of my Lord Biſhop and Mr. <hi>Beval</hi>
juſtify him ſo fully from that horrible Calumny, that raviſh'd to ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſo well ſupported, he ventures with an unmeaſureable impudence
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59648:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to affirm that the Embaſſador of <hi>France,</hi> has diſcovered that the Woman
and her Husband were wrought upon by money: And thereupon Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts,
that in caſe ſuch a depoſition were true he deſerv'd to be burnt alive.
But tis not amiſs to obſerve, that he talks not of that kind of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
till after he was well inform'd that the Ambaſſador, the Biſhop,
and <hi>Breval,</hi> had ſecur'd him from that Depoſition, otherwiſe he would
have taken good heed not to condemn himſelf. Mean time the Woman
who is at <hi>London</hi> may depoſe upon Oath whether the writing be true,
and whether <hi>Luzancy</hi> had that Diveliſh diſcourſe with her at <hi>Windſor,</hi>
or not. Tis hoped Judges will one day examine this Circumſtance, and
give him ſatisfaction according to the ſentence pronounced by himſelf in
his Letter, provided he do not diſavow it.</p>
            <p>In the ſequel he tells us he could alleadg twenty Accuſations brought
againſt him, but that he will deal with Patience yet proteſting withal,
that if this remedy prove unſucceſsful, he will write ſo as to make
his Adverſaries repent. This is what is deſired by abundance of People
provided there be Judges to make him prove what he brings againſt them,
and them what they bring againſt him. Mean time we muſt paſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and ſee what more the Gentleman has put into his Letter.</p>
            <p>Of the other two Miniſters of the <hi>French</hi> Church at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> for
as for thoſe of the Church in <hi>London,</hi> they would never come much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his company, nor ſuffer him to Preach among them; The one he
ſays <hi>is too wiſe to Print what he hints concerning him,</hi> both in Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
and in the Pulpit. And the other Mr. <hi>Breval</hi> is his intimate
Friend, one much eſteemed by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and to whom he has the
greateſt Obligations poſſible. As for the firſt <hi>Luzancy</hi> acknowledges,
and in this obſerve his weakneſs, that he is no more of his ſide, he does
not tell the reaſon, but tis eaſily gueſt at. Mr. <hi>de Langle</hi> at the requeſt
of his Friends, gave him the liberty of the Pulpit, and took much
pains to get him ſome Clarity from the Conſiſtory: He had for ſome
time an eſteem for him, and changed with the reſt of his beſt friends,
when they perceived his Cheats, and part of his Vices. For <hi>Breval</hi> he
is his boſom friend, his right hand, They underſtand one another as
Thieves in a Market, they two contriv'd the b<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſineſs againſt the Jeſuite,
<hi>Breval</hi> thriv'd by the trouble it caus'd at the beginning he was made Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend
of <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> And now ſay whether he be not an able Man, and
whether he do not look more handſomly in a Canons far, than in a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pucins

Raggs. He is for all that at preſent well at eaſe, well Lodg'd,
well Cloath'd, well provided of a Wife, courts well the Biſhops, half
beggs, half commands Alms at good houſes, makes good Chear, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
himſelf to be paid from the <hi>Savoy</hi> out of the money deſign'd for the
Poor. This is the Man whom <hi>Luzancy</hi> ſets out as one ſtrangely perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
by the <hi>French</hi> at his ſettlement in the Church, and hints the cauſe
thereof to have been his great Learning, what he ſays in this particular
is Lamentable, ſince it is certain, that <hi>Breval</hi> Preaches pitifully: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
as is ordinary with Monks he be ready enough; He knows al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
no Proteſtant, and but little Roman Divinity. He made his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into the Church with a plump Concubine, and a Baſtard, and
ſome Money ſtolen from the Poor of that Communion, which he came
from deſerting. Notwithſtanding, all theſe Crimes as Novelty is taking
he was by <hi>Caball</hi> ſettled in the <hi>Savoy:</hi> Mr. <hi>Durel</hi> after he had done
what became an honeſt Man to hinder him, ſate down quietly: The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory
allow'd him a Penſion as to the other Miniſters, and becauſe the
Contribution of particulars was not ſufficient, he makes bold with the
ſtock of the Poor, although his preſent Incomes amount to more than
Two hundred and fifty pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> and his Wife maintain'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
by a Knight, one of his dear friends, who never ſtirrs from her.
For the reſt he is a Man who Counterfeits ſo exactly, that he plays all
parts both in the World and Pulpit, and is a much better Tartuff than
<hi>Luzancy:</hi> This is his Aſſociate, their Crimes make them friends, and
both the one, and other are paid for having made ſport with the World.</p>
            <p>In fine, not to caſt away more time in Confuting things not worth the
while <hi>Luzancy</hi> ſays in his Letter, that he wonders how of a hundred
Proſelytes there remains one with us? this is to anſwer one of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Mr. <hi>du Mareſq</hi>'s Preface which you know well enough. To this
it may be ſaid, that the Sober Papiſts who change upon good Motives,
ſtay with us tyed by the chains of the Spirit which binds them to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox.
Of the bad, ſome leave us to follow the Torrent of their Libertine
humors; Others leave us not becauſe they are throughly faſtened by the
allurements of the Fleſh, I mean Advancement and Marriage as <hi>Breval.</hi>
We have for Examples of the firſt ſort, Mr. <hi>Cottereaw,</hi> Mr. <hi>de la Motte,</hi>
and ſome others, but very few where Life and Converſation are without
Reproach. As for run away Monks their number is too great to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
to the bounds of a Letter, and Mr. <hi>de Mareſq</hi> has not exagerated
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59648:10"/>
in his Preface. For the laſt ſort we ſee to our great Grief and the ſhame
of the Church, <hi>Breval</hi>'s, <hi>Luzancy</hi>'s, <hi>Solomon</hi>'s, whoſe Manners are
a mixture of all Vices.</p>
            <p>I forgot one Reflexion upon <hi>Luzancy</hi>'s Letter to ſhew the <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orce of his
Judgment, he is ſo afraid one paſſage of his Writing to the Jeſuit ſhould
not be believed, becauſe the Jeſuite ſays it was not his, that he will
needs put in a word in his Letter to perſuade People of what he had affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in his famous Retractation, after he had drawn Mr. <hi>Breval</hi>'s Picture
in a hideous ſhape, which yet in Truth is very like him, he paſſes to
Mr. <hi>du Mareſq,</hi> whom he accuſed to love Wine and Tobacco. And
in the Letter which I am now examining, he unwarily ſays the ſame
thing, alledging for one of the reaſons why that Miniſter loves him not
that he neither loves Wine, nor the places where it cannot be drunk with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſcandal: He muſt be blind who cannot in this Conformity of Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
perceive a circumſtance which makes ſtrongly againſt <hi>Luzancy,</hi> &amp;
draw an evident proof that in the dealing betwixt him and the Jeſuit there
was nothing of force, ſince what he wrote at <hi>Oxford</hi> a li<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tle while ſince,
and with a ſettled Judgment has ſo much conformity with the Retracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which he' ſwore was extorted from him with a Dagger at his Throat.</p>
            <p>From all that has been ſaid it may in my opinion be eaſily gathered
that St. <hi>Germain</hi> the Jeſuite is innocent of the Capital Crime of which
he is accuſed: That the Counterfeit <hi>Luzancy</hi> is a bad Man who invented
the Calumny when he ſaw he could neither get the Retractation which he
had voluntarily given, back from the Jeſuite, nor money which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to carry him back into <hi>France,</hi> whether he had reſolved to return,
out of deſpair when he ſaw himſelf diſcover'd for the Son of <hi>Beau Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtean</hi>
the Player, a quality which he had always denyed, and that with
a Thouſand Oaths, chiefly at the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors when the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
affirmed the contrary, and <hi>Luzancy</hi> rather than acknowledg it,
choſe to deſert the Proteſtant Religion, For this was the true reaſon
which oblig'd him to make his Retractation which was not to have been
ſeen till after his departure. It may alſo be eaſily gather'd that in all this
Diabolical Invention he has made uſe of none but unworthy People,
whether for Councellors, Witneſſes, or Tranſcribers: That Mr. <hi>du
Mareſq</hi> had reaſon in his Sermon, his Preface, &amp; Diſcourſes to ſound the
depth of this horrible Tragedy: That Mr. <hi>Blancard</hi> did not ſuborn, the
Woman, nor her Husband, to Sign the Paper which has ſo much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
my Lord Biſhop of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:59648:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And laſtly, That the carriage and paſſion of that Biſhop were not
ſuitable to his birth and Character. God preſerve him from new Injuſtice,
and protecting <hi>Luzancy</hi> a ſecond time, if he befound ſo ill at <hi>Oxford</hi>
as at <hi>London,</hi> 'Tis feared his affection and unwillingneſs to ſee faults, will
incline him rather to cover his Crimes if he fall into new ones, then give
glory to Truth by diſcovering them, and having no more to do with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I have but one word more to ſay concerning</hi> Luzancy<hi>'s Confidence
when he ſpeaks to His Majeſty,</hi> After what I have ſaid to the King,
<hi>ſays he to the Taylors wife,</hi> If my Enemies be ſo certain of what they
report againſt me, let them appear in a Legal Tryal, let the Accuſes
produce his Proof if he can, and I be puniſh'd at the Stake, and if not,
let him undergo the ſame Penalty.</p>
            <p>If it come to ſuch a Tryal (the only way in my opinion to make at
end of ſo many diſputes) it will be ſeen who fears moſt, <hi>Luzancy,</hi> or
thoſe who accuſe him; however it be, tis a thing which good Men ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
deſire: They would gladly ſee an end of this buſineſs, and would
wiſh that Judges might without delay be appointed at <hi>London</hi> to take
full Cognizance of a matter which has hitherto produced nothing but
Diſorder and Scandal, and the clearing whereof would be ſo great <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
good to the Church, It being ſhe who had the greateſt Concern in it.</p>
            <p>I might Sir inlarge on a Subject ſo Copious, if I did not fear to urge
your patience to the utmoſt; I have but one Reflexion more to make on th<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
concluſion of his Letter. He tells the pretended Lady of Quality to whom
he writes, that only the <hi>French</hi> ſpeak ill of him, but that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
all inclin'd to favor him, after which he adds that this Nation is the moſt

the prejudice is ſo great that divers in imitation of the Biſhop, put <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 word">
