            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I Have taken Notice from those Letters you have done me
the Honour to write unto me the preceding Year, that
you Interest your self in the Affairs of the Sieur <hi>Raveneau
de Lussan;</hi> Wherefore, Sir, I have thought it my Duty to
Inform you of his Return from the South Sea, with Two
Hundred and Sixty of his Comrades, who got clear out of
that Country, by the performing of Wonderful Actions, the
Particulars whereof I shall not enter upon, since he will have
the Honour to give you an Exact and Faithful Account of
them himself, being the only Person of all the Company that
has kept a Journal.</p>
            <p>I was in hopes to have got him embarked in the King's
Ship, called the <hi>Marine,</hi> which was to be gone in two days,
and Monsieur <hi>de Beaugeau</hi> the Commander, promised me to
give him his Table upon your Account: But the said Sieur
<hi>de Lussan</hi> thinking the Frigate to be gone, stay'd with meat
<hi>Port-Paix,</hi> to wait an Opportunity of meeting with another
Ship that should be bound directly for <hi>Diep.</hi> I heartily wish,
Sir, I could meet with any Opportunity of serving you in

these Parts, I should do it with exceeding Pleasure, as being
with all Deference and Respect imaginable,</p>

how much concerned I am in the Satisfaction and Joy
you will have to see him return from so long and toylsom a
Voyage, as I am confident of your being sorry at present,
that I had not sent him home to you at the time you desired,
which yet I should not have failed to do, had he not been
absent, and at whose return I delivered him one of your
Letters, which I always preserved safe with those of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Lubert,</hi> He has no occasion to make use of me, tho'
I have made him an offer of my utmost Service. I may say,
without Vanity, that he has made the greatest and finest
Voyage in our Age, and that he has seen Countries, which
a great many People in the World content themselves to
view in Maps, without desiring any other sight of them,
tho' they had all the Riches thereof bestowed upon them for
their pains. Besides the Pleasure you will have to see your
Son again, you will have also that of hearing him Discourse,
pertinently enough, of his Voyages and Adventures, there
being no other besides himself of all the Company that can
give an exact Account thereof, as having all along applyed
himself to keep a very Punctual Journal of all Transactions,
which I am confident will be pleasing to my Lord Marquess
<hi>de Signelay:</hi> I have my self the Honour to write to him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it, that so I might engage your Son to go and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
it to him, which perhaps otherwise he would not have
adventured to do, out of the little Esteem himself has of
his own Work, This is what offers it self at present for me
to write to you, assuring you I should take a deal of Pleasure
to find my self in any Condition to serve him, and that I

            <head type="sub">A Iournal made by the Free-Booters into the
South-Sea, in 1684. and in the following
Years.</head>
            <p>IT is no very uncommon thing for a Child that is a
Native of <hi>Paris,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors first Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Disposition.</note> to go and seek his Fortune abroad,
and to entertain a fixed Design of becoming a Man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in hazardous Adventures. This City, within
which most of the Wonders of the World are contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and which is perhaps the greatest that can be
met with, ought, in my Opinion, to have the Prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of any other upon the Face of the Earth. But
who is he that can penetrate into the Secrets of Nature,
and give a Reason for some sort of Inclinations she
works in the Minds of Mortals? As for my self, I must
confess I am not able to give an Account of the Depth
of my Desires; and all that I can say, is, That I have
always had a most passionate Disposition for Travel.
Scarce was I Seven Years old, when, through some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Notions, whereof I had not the Mastery, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to steal out of my Father's House: It's true, my
first Rambles were not far, because my Age and
Strength would not allow them to be so; but they were
so much the more frequent; and I have often given my
Parents the trouble to look after me in the Suburbs,
and that Place we call <hi>la Vilette:</hi> However, as I grew
up, my Excursions were the larger, and by degrees I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
my self to lose a slght of <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This rambling sort of Humour was accompanied
with another, which I dare not dignifie with the Name
of a Martial one, but was such as wrought in me an
ardent Desire to see some Siege or Battel: I could not
hear the Noise of the Drum in the Streets without
those Transports of Mind, the remembrance whereof
does still operate a kind of a vigorous Heat and Joy in
me. It so fell out at length, that I met with an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,
with whom I had but a slender Acquaintance, but
my Warlike Genius quickly inclined me to make him
my Friend. I looked upon him as a Person who could
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65235:4"/>
be very serviceable to me in my Designs; and it was
with this Prospect I applied my self to manage him.
The Siege of <hi>Conde</hi> being happily commenced at this
time, and he being obliged to serve there with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
I made him the offer of a Sword that had hither
to done neither good not harm to any Man, but whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

I was passionately desirous to make use of. Here <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
was that he gave me the first Instances of his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
for he took me freely along with him, and kept
me all the Campaign; at the breaking up whereof <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

               </gap>
War, as the greatest part of them are, who have had
but just a Taste of it. And this I tell you was my first
Adventure.</p>
            <p>The second was not quite so good, for the Success
that attended it, tho it was alike agreeable to my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
and according to my Heart's Desire, I hapned to
become a Cadet in the Marine Regiment, but I fell in
to the Hands of a Captain, who was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wonderous skilful
to drain the Children of the Family of their Money;
so that this Campaign, wherein I hoped to have done
the King some Service, was worn away in Expence<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to be the best. For a Person never to get out of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Countrey, and to be ignorant how the rest of the
Earth stands, appear'd to me a matter that should be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
to a Woman only; Whereas it was my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
That a Man should never be confined to one
Place, and that nothing could suit him better than to
make himself acquainted with all those of his own <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

To travel by Land, I thought both long and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult,
and therefore I concluded I could sooner and
more safely accomplish my Designs by betaking my self
to the Sea; and now you find me ready to go on
board.</p>
            <p>There was nothing omitted on the part of Parents that
were full of tender Affections for an extravagant Child,
to divert me from my Resolution; But as to Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
such as I was, it may be said, as is usually done
of Womenkind, That <hi>what they will, God wills;</hi> and to
say the Truth, I was over-ruled by my Inclination
herein; wherefore when they perceived, that absolutely
to oppose my Humour, would make me but the more
opiniative; they proposed I should take a Voyage for
S. <hi>Domingo,</hi> where I should find Friends and Protection
in case of need; and as this exactly suited both with
my Desires and Designs, and that provided I could get
to Sea, I did not care whither bound; I very readily
obeyed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diep</hi> was the Place where I embarked,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Embarks at</hi> Diep <hi>for</hi> Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</note> and from
whence I parted on the 5th of <hi>March,</hi> 1679. with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Satisfaction of Mind than I am well able to express:
That Element; which, to the Generality of Men, seems
very frightful, appeared to me the most amiable and
delightful of any in the World. The Winds, if I May
say so, wrought in me some Delight; for I found that
almost every little Blast brought us happily onward on
our Way: And I was so overjoyed to find my self in
so desirable an Island, that I thought no more of the
Hazards my Voyage made me liable to. Let no Man
therefore be amazed thereat, if he finds none of them
contained in my Journal. And seeing there are other
Persons who have been particular enought in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
given of this Passage, I have this only to say, that
I safely arrived, through the Mercy of God, at S. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo;</hi>
and if any one has the Curiosity to follow me
in my remaining Expedition, he must begin from thence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:65235:5"/>
I continued there, however, for above three Years
not only in order to see the Countrey, but thro such
Conjunctures as would not admit me to go out of it; I
found my self chained there to a <hi>Frenchman;</hi> that was
so far from deserving the Name of one, that his harde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

There was no question to be made, but I could find
a Captain that would receive me; and I was not
long in making the Choice, since there was not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them at that time to pitch upon. <hi>Laurence de
Graff</hi> was the Man I most fancied, who would make
a special Corsair; and tho he had not been long ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived,
all that he wanted, was to be gone as well
as I. We were in a few hours time well satisfied
with each other, and became such Friends, as those
are wont to be, who are about to run the same Rifque
of Fortune, and apparently to die together. This last
indeed we should have reckoned upon with most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Reason, but it was what we least thought
of. My Departure took up all my Thoughts, I fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
my self with Arms and other small Necessaries,
at the Charge of Monsieur <hi>de Franquesnay,</hi> who was
very ready to advance me some Money, which I have
paid him since, and whose kindness I shall never forget.
At last the day came, and I must freely say, it was, in
my Opinion, one of the best in the Course of my
Life. On the 22d, of <hi>November,</hi> in the Year 1684.
we departed from <hi>Pettit-Guaves,</hi> on the Coast of St. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo,</hi>
to the number of 120 Men on Board a Prize
taken some time before by Captain <hi>Laurence de Graff,</hi>
from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which they sent as an Advice-boat
from <hi>Carthagena</hi> on the <hi>Terra Firma</hi> of <hi>America,</hi> to
<hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Design was to go and joyn our selves with a
Fleet of <hi>Free-Booters,</hi> which we were in hopes to meet
with before the <hi>Havana,</hi> a great City in the Isle of <hi>Cuba</hi>
to the <hi>North,</hi> and about fourteen Leagues distant from
St. <hi>Domingo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We anchored on the 4th of <hi>December</hi> at the <hi>Tortoise
Island</hi> to take in Water, and on the 6th sailed away in
order to return to the Coast of <hi>St. Domingo,</hi> which is
but Three Leagues off, and where we arrived the 12th,
casting Anchor at <hi>Cape Francis,</hi> where we took in our
full Store of Water and Wood. We left this Place
on the 17th, and were taken with a North-wind two
Leagues from the Road in such a manner, that we
lost our Shalloop, which was too big to be put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our Gibbet. Towards Evening we sailed back to
a Place of Safety, where we were obliged to stay
Two Days waiting for a Canoe we had sent to buy

And indeed we had a great deal of Reason
to be concerned for the Safety of those Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
who were in much Esteem with all the Colonies
of these Islands, because of the good Orders they
kept, the exact Justice they administred, and the Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The three and twentieth we steer'd our own Course
and in the Evening discovered a Ship to Leeward
of us, to whom we gave Chase, but she braced <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

being all scituated on the same Coast, and that day

            <p>On the Fourth we sailed in sight of <hi>la Mona,</hi> next
day coasted the Isle of <hi>Puerto Rico,</hi> and <hi>la Savona</hi>
and then steered South-East and by South, till the

Rendezvous of our Men of War to be, which we were
going to seek out.</p>
            <p>On the Thirteenth, at Seven in the Morning, we
discovered the main Land of <hi>America,</hi> and were
becalmed next Day, which continued to the Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
at Noon, when we had a fresh Gale, and
steered North North-East till the Seventeenth, when
about Moon-setting we descry'd Two Ships and Four
Boats to Windward of us, about a Cannon-Shot's
Distance, that had the Cape of us, which brought us
upon Deck to make all ready.</p>
            <p>One of those Boats on the Eighteenth by break

us; and as our Captain had a Commission from

Head of Two Barrels of Powder, in order to burn
our selves, and blow up the Ship, rather than fall

Quarter, but were wont to make us suffer all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Torments, they beginning usually with the
Captain, whom they hang with his Commission a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his Neck: But one of the Two Ships came up
with us in a Moment, and knowing what we were,
gave us a Signal, which was so much the more Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to us, that instead of Enemies, which we took
them to be, they proved to be not only Friends, but
those very Ships we were in quest of, which obliged
us to put in at the Cape, and spend that Day to visit
one another.</p>
            <p>One of these Two Ships belonged to Captain <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael

to take the Ships commanded as well by the
Captains, <hi>Laurence</hi> and <hi>Michael,</hi> as those of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
<hi>Iohn Quet</hi> and <hi>le Sage,</hi> were themselves taken
by those, whom they were about to become Masters
of: And as for the four Boats, they were commanded
by other Captains, whose Names were <hi>Rose Vigneron,
La Grade,</hi> and an <hi>English</hi> Traytor from <hi>Iamaica;</hi>
By them we were informed that they were watching
in that Place for the <hi>Patach</hi> of <hi>Marguerita,</hi> and a Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
of <hi>Spanish</hi> Ships, which they expected would
sail that way, in order to take them.</p>
            <p>On the Nineteenth we resolved to quit that Post,
and did all we could to get up with the Isle of
<hi>Curassol,</hi> a great part whereof belongs to the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers.</hi>
We sailed in sight of those of <hi>Bonuaira</hi> and
<hi>Roube<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>;</hi> and about Two in the Afternoon of the same
Day, we chased a <hi>Flemish</hi> Boat that came from the
Port of <hi>Guaira,</hi> on the Continent, and was returning
to the Town of <hi>Curassol,</hi> Two Leagues to Leeward of
which we anchored that Evening in the Port of <hi>Sanct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Barba.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the Twentieth we sent away a Boat, under
the Command of <hi>La Garde,</hi> to the Town to ask
the Governour leave to buy us Masts for Captain
<hi>Laurence</hi> his Ship, that had lost them in an Hurricane
near the Isle of St. <hi>Thomas.</hi> But this he absolutely
refused, and shut up the Gates against us. Upon the
Boat's Return, and Relation given us of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour's
Refusal, I carried him a Copy of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
hoping to engage him by that means to grant
us our Request; But he still persisted to deny <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
while a part of our Crew scrupled not in the mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
time to go ashore, and enter into the Town after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
left their Swords behind them at the Gate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:65235:7"/>
On the Twenty third our Ships weigh'd Anchor, in
order to sail for <hi>Sancta Crux,</hi> which stands seven
Leagues to Leeward of this Town, and in our Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
by the Fort we saluted it, who returned us Gun
for Gun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the Governour finding we were two
Hundred Men of us in the Town, informed us on the
twenty fourth by beat of Drum, that it was his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
we should be gone, and return forthwith on
board our Ships, and that he would give us Shallops
to carry us thither, provided we paid him two Pieces
of Eight a Man, I presently discerned it was his Will
we should not go back by Land, because we must for
that purpose cross a Lake that stands at the foot of the
Fort, which he had forbidden us to pass; And this
made me go and tell him, we gave him thanks for his
Shaloops, that if we were minded to go by Sea to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
our Ships, we had Pirogues to carry us thither;
and that we had no other design to get to them by
Land, but for a walk's sake: To which he answered,
That the Inhabitants there scrupled to let us see their
Island; but for all that, he would not let us pass over
the Lake, and so we were two days before we could
reach <hi>Sancta Crux,</hi> where our Ships were waiting for
us.</p>
            <p>We came afterwards to know the reason of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor's
Displeasure against us, which was, that Capt.
<hi>Laurence,</hi> and Captain <hi>Michael</hi>'s Ships had taken two
<hi>Dutch</hi> Ships before the <hi>Havana,</hi> that were fraught for
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> having two Hundred Thousand Pieces
of Eight on board, whereof one half belonged to the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Company, and the rest to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> These
last, with whom we were at War, being the only Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that were pillaged, were pillaged, were indempnified by the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> who had charge of the said Ships, and who
shared with them the other one Hundred Thousand
Pieces of Eight that belonged to their Company, which
the <hi>Free-Booters</hi> medled not with, being at Peaco with
that Nation; And they easily perswaded their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals
that all had been taken from them, and so we were
punished for the Knavery these <hi>Dutchmen</hi> practised to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their own People.</p>
            <p>Though this Island of <hi>Curassol</hi> be well enough known
in <hi>France,</hi>

               </note> I cannot but take notice, as I go along,
that the Temperature of its Air is the same with that

that the Land is almost level throughout, and the

produces little to the owners besides Maes and small

The Town that stands upon it, is small but very nea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
being encompassed with an high though very thin Wall;
There is a good and safe Port belongs to it, and the
Fort that commands it as well as the Town is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
fortified; the Inhabitants are of several sorts
of Religions, the exercise thereof being free, the chief
of which is that of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> of the <hi>Iews,</hi> as well as
of others; each of whom have their respective places
of Worship in the Town. The chief of their Trade
consists in Sugar that grows there, and of Wool which
comes from the Sheep which breed upon the place in
great Numbers: Besides the Skins of these Animals,
as also of a great many Oxen and Cows which they
keep in the lowest and best watered Grounds of this
Island, where it abounds in Pasture: they are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
affected to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Nation, with whom they
have the main of their Trade.</p>
            <p>On the twenty seventh we made ready and steered
our Course for <hi>Capella Vella,</hi> which is on the Continent
of <hi>America,</hi> where we designed to fix our selves in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to wait for the Patach of <hi>Marguerita,</hi> whereof I
have already spoken: The same day Captain <hi>Vigneron</hi>'s
boat left us to return to the Coast of St. <hi>Domingo,</hi>
because they had not Men enough to make any thing
of the Enterprize, there being no more than twenty on
board her.</p>
            <p>Being come to the Cape by the thirtieth, we ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
there; and our next care was to set a Vigie or
some Sentinels, to the Number of fifteen upon the top
of it, to give us notice when they discovered the Patach
but next day we thought it more adviseable to pursue
this following method to get Intelligence: We sent on
the first of <hi>February</hi> Captain <hi>Rose</hi>'s Boat to the Mouth
of the River <hi>la Ache</hi> on the Continent, inhabited by
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> and about twenty Leagues distant from the
Cape where we then were, under pretence of trading
with them, but in reality with a design to make some
Prisoners, that to we might be informed whether the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65235:8"/>
Patach was passed by that way or no; for it was usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
for her to take in part of her lading in that River.</p>
            <p>While we waited for the return of this Boat, I and
some others went a shore to view and observe the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
about the Cape. I understood it was inhabited by
a most cruel, barbarous and savage <hi>Indian</hi> Nation,
who are neither Friends to, nor have Society with any
other People whatsoever, no not even with the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
themselves, who live round about them. They
eat without any distinction whatever they can catch,
and are afraid of nothing but Swords and the like
Weapons; but as for Fire-Arms they matter them not
at all; we were satisfied to have a sight of them as we
returned, without having the Curiosity to make a trial
of their Teeth, by going farther up into a Country,
were there was nothing to be got.</p>
            <p>I am not able to forbear in this place to give a
strange Example of what I am speaking,<note place="margin">A strange Story of the Savages.</note> and of what
this People can do, whom I take to be the oldest <hi>Free-Booters</hi>
of <hi>America.</hi> The Marquiss of <hi>Maintenon,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of the Isle of <hi>Mary Gallant,</hi> who had the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of one of the King's Frigats called the <hi>Witch,</hi>
having taken a Prize of fourteen Guns, which he went
on Board, and finding himself one day separated from
his own Ship, was constrained, in order to take in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to cast Anchor at <hi>Boca del Drago</hi> on the <hi>Terra Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>
of <hi>America,</hi> which was inhabited by the same <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
People as live at Cape <hi>la Vella.</hi> He brought his
Ship as near the Shore as he could, and bringing all his
Cannon to bear on one side, he sent under the Covert
of them his Shalloop with two and twenty armed Men
to fill their Casks with Water. Now those Savages
lying in Ambush upon the Sea-side, did not give the
Shalloop time to land, but throwing themselves head-long
into the Water, and rushing upon them in spight
of the continual Fire made upon them from the
Cannon of the Man of War, they carried her with the
two and twenty Men for above fifty Paces to Land,
where after they had killed them, every one took his man
upon his Back, and moved them off; then they return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and swimming to cut the Cables of the Ship to
make her drive a-shoar, they hoped also to serve those
on board the same Sauce, but as good luck would have
it, they had time to loose their Sails and to make ready
to put farther off from the Shore.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:65235:9"/>
On the second we put our Ships into a Careening-Posture,
and on the eight <hi>Rose</hi>'s Boat returned to us,
and gave an account, that as soon as they had ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
at the Mouth of the River <hi>la Acha,</hi> they sent a
small Canoe with six <hi>Englishmen</hi> in it a-shore, they
being of our Crew, and at Peace then with the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
who agreed with them, that next Morning
about Sun-rising, they would fire a Gun to give the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
notice to come on board to traffick with them;
That in the night they had put thirty men a-shore to
surprize those of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that should pass to and
fro; But that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having discerned the Snare
that was laid for them, fired all night, which gave all
the Inhabitants the alarm; That next Morning our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
fired their Cannon of Signal according to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement,
and put out <hi>English</hi> Colours, but it was to
no purpose, for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> according to all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
had no inclination for those Goods they supposed
we would trade with them in, so that our Men finding
their design had miscarried, weighed Anchor and sailed
away to joyn us.</p>
            <p>As we were of opinion at last that there was no
hopes the Patach would pass that way,<note place="margin">The <hi>Free-Booters</hi> disagree and part.</note> we held a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
on board our Ship about forming another Design,
but not being able to agree with Captain <hi>Laurence,</hi>
(who was owner of two thirds of the <hi>Neptune</hi>) because
he would have imposed upon us; there were four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
and seven that quitted the Ship and went on
board the Prize in which we came from St. <hi>Domingo,</hi>
and so left him on the thirteenth. He weighed and
steered his Course thitherward; Captain <hi>Michael,</hi> and
Captain <hi>Iohn Rose</hi> weighed also, and sailed for <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gena,</hi>
and we who were irresolute what way to take,
followed the latter.</p>
            <p>On the 25th we had a hard Easterly Breeze, which
carried us beyond a River that runs on the <hi>Terra-Firma,</hi>
and is by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> called <hi>Rio-grande,</hi>
where we should have taken in Water which continues
sweet within the Sea for three or four Leagues from
the Mouth of it, for all it rains so little, and provided
you take that which runs on the Superficies. About three
of the same day in the Afternoon, we saw <hi>our Lady de
la Poupla</hi> which is also on the Continent, and the 16th
anchored at the Isles of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> from whence we
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65235:9"/>
parted in the Eveninig with three Pirogues only, in
order to get to windward of <hi>Carthagena,</hi> to endeavour
to seek us some Provision which they continually carry
to that place, and our Design had in effect the desired
success.</p>
            <p>We returned on the 18th with seven Pirogues laden
with Maes,<note place="margin">They take some Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes.</note> which we made good Prize: By the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
that were in them, we understood, that there
were two Galleons at <hi>Carthagena,</hi> and that the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Flota was at <hi>Porto Belo,</hi> and that two Ships, one car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
twenty and the other twenty four Guns would
quickly put out from thence; but we did not think
fit to wait for them, because they could not assign to
us any determinate time when they should sail.</p>
            <p>On the twenty second at Noon we weighed, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Evening discovered <hi>Point Picaron</hi> on the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
and the Isles of <hi>Palmas:</hi> About two Hours with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Night we doubled the greatest Point of these
Islands. The next Morning, which was the twenty
third, we found our selves separated from Captain <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi>
and Captain <hi>Rose,</hi> and then it was we took a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of attempting to cross over the Continent to
the end we might get into the <hi>South-Sea:</hi> In order
to which we sailed to the Bay of the Isle <hi>d'Or,</hi> which
is inhabited by the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Sambes,</hi> that so we might
know of them (who were our Friends) what success
the other Free-booters met with, who, we had been
told, were gone thither some Months before.</p>
            <p>From the twenty third at Night to the twenty fourth
we kept to the Cape, being afraid of entring into the
Gulph of <hi>Arian,</hi> and that Morning by break of Day
we made nearer the Shoar, to discover where we
were, and upon trial we found it to be a Point of the
Wind in that Gulph, which the Currents made us to
double.</p>
            <p>Between this Gulph and Cape <hi>Matance</hi> happened a
very remarkable Adventure;<note place="margin">A strange story of a Spanish Soldier.</note> we had on board our
Ship a Soldier belonging to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Galleons, whom
we had taken to windward of <hi>Carthagena,</hi> in one of
the Pirogues whereof we found the Maes before spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, who out of a despair to find himself made a
Prisoner, though he was very kindly used, took a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
as appeared by what followed, to throw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into the Sea, to which end he went five or six
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65235:10"/>
times upon Deck without being able to put his Design
in execution, and that in all likelyhood, out of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
resistance he found within himself to do it: But at
last, after several Attempts, he effected the same,
which exciting my Curiosity to enquire into the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
thereof, I found he had put off a Scapulary
or kind of Cloak he wore, and laid it under the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of one of our Guns: And what is yet more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
is, that contrary to what usually happens
in such cases, the Body which fell down with full force
into the Water, floated along time upon the Back by
the Ship's side, though to our apprehension he did all
he could to drown himself; But when out of Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to save his Life we threw out some of our Tackle
for him to catch hold on, he not only refused to make
use of them, but turned himself upon his Face and
plung'd to the bottom.</p>
            <p>On the Twenty fifth at Eleven in the Morning we
arriv'd and anchor'd at the Isle <hi>d'Or,</hi> or <hi>Goldeu Island<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
and at the same time fired a Gun to give the <hi>Indian</hi>
notice of our coming. Then we went a-shoar, to know
what that Flag was we discover'd at a distance from
us, where we found three Men belonging to Captain
<hi>Grognier</hi> and Captain <hi>Lescuier</hi>'s Crew, who told us,
that they had carried there because they would not go
with the other <hi>Free-Booters,</hi> who were on their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to the <hi>South-Sea,</hi> under the Conduct of those two
Captains, and that as soon as ever they saw us, they
had set up that Flag, as a Signal for us to come up to
them.</p>
            <p>The Six and twentieth came some <hi>Indians</hi> with Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
on Board us, which were directed to the first
<hi>Free-Booters</hi> that should Anchor in that Road, to give
them notice, that they were gone, to the number of
an hundred and seventy Men to that Sea, and some
small time before them an hundred and fifteen <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish;</hi>
Besides which they also set us some Instructions
how to demean our selves towards the <hi>Indians</hi> through
whose Territories we must pass, wherewith w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> were
fully confirmed in the Project we had already formed
of undertaking this Expedition: And though we were
but fourscore and seven Men, yet we made our
selves ready to be gone. In the mean time some other
<hi>Indians</hi> came also on Board us, by whom we were
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65235:10"/>
informed, that Captain <hi>Grogniet</hi> and Captain <hi>Lescuier</hi>
were still in their Territories, and not yet gone to the
<hi>South Sea,</hi> which made us write to them by one of
those two <hi>Indians,</hi> to let them know that we were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to them.</p>
            <p>On the Twenty seventh at Noon we saw Captain
<hi>Mitchel</hi> and Captain <hi>Rose</hi> turn in to the same Port,
which made us go presently on Board, to know what
made them come in and Anchor in that Road. They
told us they had been in Chase of a <hi>Spanish</hi> Ship nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Hardy</hi> come from St. <hi>Iago</hi> on the Coast of
<hi>Cuba</hi> and bound for <hi>Carthagena,</hi> but not being able
to come up with her, they were come into this Port,
as being the nighest, to take in Water. Then we shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>
them the Letters we had received, which wrought
a Desire in many of them to come and increase our
Number, insomuch that an hundred and eighteen
Men quitted <hi>Mitchel</hi>'s Ship, and the whole Crew of
Captain <hi>Rose,</hi> being Sixty four Men, who burnt their
Vessel, when they had paid the Owners the price of it:
We were not then for delaying, but on the Twenty
ninth quitted our Ships and went a-shoar, where we
encamped to the Number of Two hundred sixty and
four Persons; but as to the Ship belonging to our
particular Crew we left her in the Hands of Captain
<hi>Mitchel</hi> rather than burn her.</p>

here also a sort of Hogs, which they call <hi>Vents,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of an opening place they have in the form of a
Navel upon their Backs. We may farther take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of those Beasts they call <hi>Agoutills</hi> and <hi>Ovistitills,</hi>
which both the one and the other of them are very
like those Creatures we call <hi>Indian</hi> Pigs in <hi>France,</hi>
but much bigger. The Monkeys of this Country are
almost as big as Sheep, live in Forests, and seldom
come down from the Trees, where they always find
their Food. They are so hardy, that though you
shoot them with a Fusil in the Head, or through
both Shoulders, they shall not fall to the Ground, and
many times for all you can do, they have so much cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in their fall, as to twist their Tails, which are
very long about a Branch of a Tree, where they
hang and wast away, without any possibility of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

tallest Trees for the places of their Retreat.</p>
            <p>I cannot without smiling call to mind what I have
done to one of these Animals, which after I had made
several shots at him with my Fusil, that carried off part
of his Belly, insomuch that his Guts came out, held
himself by one of his Paws, or hands (if you will) to
the Branch of a Tree, while he put his Entrails with

            <p>There was another of them whom I shot with a

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65235:12"/>
we saw those Fowls called <hi>Oecos,</hi> which are pretty
like unto our <hi>Indian</hi> Turkey-Hens, but with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
that they have a small tuft of Feathers upon
their Heads that resembles a Cock's Comb, and a round
of yellow about their Eyes; they differ from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Colour; the Male's Feathers being inclinable
to red, whereas the Female's are blackish, but they
are never found a-sunder. Their Partridges are lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than our <hi>Europeans,</hi> and their Flesh is whiter but
not so good, and their Note is different from ours.
As to their Pheasants they are smaller than those in
<hi>Europe,</hi> and their Flesh nothing near so pallatable, but
their Note is much the same. Besides these, there are
in this Country a multitude of other Birds, with
whose Names I think it needless to swell this Journal;
because as the Islands of <hi>America</hi> are full of them,
there is already an exact account given of them in
those Relations that have been made of these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and it's enough that I give a Description of such
as are not to be found in these Islands, or of another
kind: Yet I shall say this farther, that Lizzards breed
here in abundance, and there are different Sizes of
them. They are Animals that resemble pretty near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
those whom we call <hi>Cayements,</hi> of whom I shall
have occasion to speak hereafter. Their Flesh is good
to eat, and their Eggs, which are as big as Pigeon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Eggs, have an excellent taft, and are much better
than our Hens Eggs. This hunting-bout was a great
Relief to us, against that hunger we had endured, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was the first repast we had met with since our
Journey; but this I reckon nothing in comparison of the
miseries which we were to suffer in a vast number of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Adventures.</p>
            <p>At last, after six Days painfull and wearisom tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling,
even beyond all that can well be imagined
we got to the River which the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Spaniard</hi>
call <hi>Boca del Chica,</hi> that discharges it self into the South
Sea.</p>
            <p>On the seventh the <hi>Indians</hi> of that place carried <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

of, in order to get down that River into the South
Sea; we presently fell to work upon them with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65235:12"/>
with us, after we had agreed with the Captains of these
<hi>Indians</hi> for furnishing us in the mean time with Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
which consisted in Maes, Potatoes, Banames and
Magniot-Roots, till we had done our work, upon
condition that we gave them Cloth, Knives, Thread,
Needles, Pins, Cissors, Hatchets, Bills, Combs, and
such like small Wares, which are in great esteem with
them: Though the Savages are not ignorant of
the advantage that doth arise to them from these
things.</p>
            <p>It was partly with these Toys that we lived, and
kept a good Correspondence with them during our
Passage through their Country; but what made the
Conjuncture still more favourable unto us, was the
Resentment they had at that time of the ill usage they
had received at the hands of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> against
whom they were so incensed, that they begged our
Assistance to be revenged on them. And had it not
been for this, it would have been a very difficult task
for us, if not impossible, to cross their Country against
their will, not only because of their Numbers, which
made them infallibly much stronger than we, but also
by reason of the many Forests, and difficult Passages
their Country's encombred with, which we could not
have gone through without we had some of themselves
for our Guides. But for all this, we did not think
our selves so safe amongst these Men, but that we kept
continually upon our Guard, because we were well
assured they were such Wretches, as were at the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
always of those that gave them most; and that
though they appeared one minute to be our Friends,
they might become the next the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who are nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
Neighbours to them. Their treacherous Dealings
have proved fatal to some <hi>Free-Booters,</hi> who have put
too much confidence in them, when a small number of
them passing through their Country, these People gave
notice thereof to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and that they might
give an exact account of their Number, they took them

of Maes into a Callabass for every man that passed by,
and when they had done, carried the Callabass to the
Enemy, who thereupon took their Measures according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

There is no sign of Religion, or of the Knowledge
of God amongst them; they holding that they have
Communion with the Devil, and in short, when they
would know any thing, they spend the Night in the

On the twenty eighth we received News again by
an <hi>Indian</hi> Captain, who had conducted Captain <hi>Groig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niet,</hi>
and Captain <hi>Esurier</hi> into the South-Sea, in a
Letter which they sent us, that they would stay for

we could use, our Conoes could not be finished
before the last of <hi>March,</hi> when we drew them into the

            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> the first we parted with fourteen Canoes car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
about twenty Oars apiece, guided by twenty
<hi>Indians,</hi> who made use of this opportunity in order to
participate of the Booty which they thought we were
about to take from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as soon as ever we
got into the South-Sea.</p>
            <p>We rested on the fourth to tarry for our Men, who
were behind, and to mend our Canoes that were
damnified by the Rocks and Flats we met with all
along that River. It cannot be believed what pains
we had to bring them to the great Water (as I may
call it) for we met with places where they rested dry,
so that we were in a manner forced to carry them.
This day died one of our Men of the Bloody Flux,
which was very rife amongst us, because we were
forced to fast so long, and by reason of the hard Feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we had, and our continual dabling in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>On the fifth we put on, and about Evening found
the River deeper, but so full of, and encumbred with
Trees, which the Floods had carried thither, that our
Canoes were in danger every Minute to be lost; and
this day died two of our Men.</p>
            <p>On the sixth we got to the great Water, where
the River is wider and deeper, and that day we spent
on the Banks of it to dry our Sacks, which were wet
through with the great Rains that fell the day before;
another of our Men died this day.</p>
            <p>From hence to the eleventh we did all we could to
get quickly to the Mouth of the River,<note place="margin">Good news of Provision sent them by the other Free-Booters.</note> where we
were informed by an <hi>Indian,</hi> that was come in a small
Vessel to meet us, the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>French Free-Boot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>

(that stands at the Mouth of that River) some

thither; for they could gather very well by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
who had been so straitned there for Provision,
whereabouts we must be, and indeed we had so little,
that we were reduced to an handfull of Raw Maes
for each Man a day.</p>
            <p>The same Day we received farther News, and by
other <hi>Indians,</hi> who gave our Guides notice to tell us
that a thousand <hi>Spaniards</hi> being informed of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent,
mounted up along this River by Land with a

ten made ready, but towards Noon the Heavens were
overcast to that degree, that you could scarce see a

was followed with such excessive Rains, that we
were afraid every Minute of being sunk, though we
employed two men in each Canoe continually to throw
out the Water; and during that time one of our Men
died.</p>

            <p>Its above ten Years since the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who dwell
on all this Continent, have not known what War
was. Here they lived in a profound Tranquillity,
and Fire-Arms was hardly in any use amongst them;
but since the time that we found out a way to go and
visit them, they brought the <hi>English</hi> from <hi>Iamaica</hi>
amonst them. But though they have a pretty ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them at present there, yet the Sequel of this
Discourse will shew that they are not much more
warlike for all that than they were before: But the
White <hi>Indians</hi> that inhabit a part of <hi>Chily,</hi> have
been always their Enemies, and these are a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of prodigious bulk and Tallness, who almost
infest them with continual War, and when they
happen to take any of them, they take off the plate
of their Breasts, as we do by a Tortoise, and cut out
their Hearts.</p>
            <p>On the twenty second, which was <hi>Easter-day,</hi> their
Fleet, who were gone before us into these Seas, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
at the <hi>Kings</hi> Isles where we were; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
of eight fail, which, together with the two
Barks, they had sent to wait for our Arrival, made
up in all ten Vessels. Of which take the following Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>The first served as Admiral, and was a Frigate
carrying 36 Guns,<note place="margin">A List of the <hi>Bucca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers</hi> Fleet and Commanders.</note> commanded by one Captain <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next was instead of Vice-Admiral, had 16
Guns, and was under the command of one whose
Name was <hi>Sammes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third and fourth were two Ships commanded
by Captain <hi>Townsley.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fifth was a Ship that could have carried thirty
Guns but had none, and was commanded by Captain
<hi>Groigniet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:65235:16"/>
The sixth was a small Ship commanded by <hi>Bra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The eighth was a long Bark commanded by a
Quarter-Master, with a Detachment of Men drawn
out of the Fleet.</p>
            <p>And the ninth and tenth were the two Barks that
came to meet us, whereof the one was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Peter Henry,</hi> and the other by a Quarter-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</p>
            <p>Of all these Commanders, Captain <hi>Grogniet</hi> was
the only <hi>Frenchman,</hi> all the rest being <hi>Englishmen,</hi>
except <hi>David,</hi> who was a <hi>Flemming.</hi> As to the
whole number of our Men, they were computed at
about eleven hundred, when they divided into
two Fleets: It remains therefore now that I
should say, according to the Information I have
received from all that were engaged in this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize,
how all these Ships fell into their Hands,
by what means, and at what time they came into
this Sea.</p>
            <p>In pursuance therefore to the order before obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<hi>I</hi> am to declare,<note place="margin">A brief ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>English</hi> Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in these Seas hitherto.</note> that the <hi>English</hi> were the
Owners of our Admiral, who in the Year 1682 on
the Coast of St. <hi>Domingo,</hi> surprized a long Bark
belonging to a <hi>French</hi> Captain, whose Name was
<hi>Tristan,</hi> who was then with some of his Ships Crew
a-shore, waiting for a fair Wind to sail together, to
make War upon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by Commission from
Monsieur <hi>Povansay,</hi> who was then Governour of
that Island. The <hi>English,</hi> who was superiour in
strength, drove the <hi>French</hi> out of the Bark, with
which they sailed to the Isle <hi>de la Torttille,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a great many Ships go every Year to take in Salt.
The next thing they did, was to take a <hi>Dutch</hi> Ship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
on which they went all on board, and sailed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to the Coast of <hi>Guinee,</hi> where they took seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Prizes more; but they reserved none of them save
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ship, which served as Admiral, and
wherein they sailed, when we left the South-Sea,
and was supposed to have been a Ship belonging
to <hi>Hamburg.</hi> These <hi>English</hi> became Pyrates un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Conduct of a Captain of their own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
grew so notoriously wic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed by a great many odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65235:16"/>
Actions, performed not only towards Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
but even those of their own Nation, when they
met with any of them, that to avoid being chased,
which they would infallibly have been, they passed
from the North to the South-Sea, by the Streight of
<hi>Magellan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They kept company for about eight Months with
a little Frigate of eighteen Guns, which they met
with there in a short time after their Arrival, and
whose Crew consisted of <hi>English, French</hi> and <hi>Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings:</hi>
But their good Correspondence with the
<hi>Corsair</hi> was of no long Duration, for hapning to
have some difference with him, as he was one Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
giving the other the good Morrow, according
to the <hi>English</hi> Mode, he saw all his Crew come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Deck; whereupon the little Frigate, who sailed
much better than the Pyrate came up with him,
and having brought all his Guns to bear, gave
him a broad-side, accompanied with a Volley
of small Shot, and then bore away, having slain
the Captain and twenty of his Men, in whose stead
the rest of the Crew chose <hi>David</hi> before-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>That little Frigate of sixteen Guns, got into the
South-Sea some time after the other, as also by the
same Streight of <hi>Magellan.</hi> I was told by one of
the Engineers on board her, that she belonged to his
Royal Highness the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and that under
pretence of coming to treat with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> she
was sent upon no other account, than to take a Plan
of those parts, the Situation of the Cities and Sea-Ports.
Now Captain <hi>David</hi> meeting with her, made
Captain <hi>Suams</hi> come on board him, and threatned
to take him, unless he would go and make Wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
with him; so that finding himself too weak to resist,
he chose rather to comply with the Pyrate, than
be taken; and these two together took a great many
Prizes, which, after they had taken out what was
for their turn, they burnt.</p>
            <p>About a Year after, Captain <hi>Townsley</hi> came o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Land with an hundred and fifteen <hi>English</hi>
into these Seas, and at the <hi>Kings</hi> Islands took
two Ships laden with Provision and other Refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65235:17"/>
whereof I have already spoken, coming from
<hi>Peru.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About a Month after, the Captains <hi>Groigniet</hi> and
<hi>l' Escuier</hi> went also thither over Land with two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and seventy Men, and who, being informed
that the <hi>English</hi> Fleet was before <hi>Panama,</hi> put ashore
one night at <hi>Tavoga,</hi> an Island two Leagues off
from whence they discerned a Ship on Fire, and by
break of day they saw the <hi>English</hi> under fail
They went on board them, and came to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that Captain <hi>David</hi> had taken a Ship called
the <hi>Saint Rose,</hi> laded with Corn and Wine, bound
from <hi>Truxillo</hi> for <hi>Panama;</hi> the President of which
last place had sent to him for to buy her, and
in order thereunto, gave him the meeting at the
Isles of <hi>Pericos,</hi> that are a League's distance from
the Port. But instead of sending him the Money
they had agreed upon for the Ship, he sent a Fire-Ship
to burn him, but the same, through the
Cowardice and Ignorance of the Commander, spent
herself without doing the other any hurt; and this
made Captain <hi>David</hi> give the Saint <hi>Rose</hi> to <hi>Groignie</hi>
and to <hi>l' Escuier</hi>'s Ships Crew, who had already lost
their Captain.</p>
            <p>As for the other five Ships commanded by <hi>Brands,
Samely, Peter Henry,</hi> and two Quarter-Masters,
they had been also taken from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them for those who came thither over Land. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
of all our Ships, there were none but the first two

in the South-Sea, where no body but themselves
had sailed a long time. And now having told you
what passed before this Fleet came together; we shall
now proceed to give an Account of our Adventures
since our Junction.</p>
            <p>On the twenty fifth of <hi>April</hi> we took an Advice-Boat
going to the Fleet of <hi>Peru,</hi> which was then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
Anchor in the Port of <hi>Callao,</hi> that was carrying some
Packets from <hi>Madrid</hi> to <hi>Panama,</hi> and Letters from
the Vice-Roy of <hi>Lima,</hi> wherein there was an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
given how many Men of War, Fire-Ships and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65235:17"/>
Merchant-men the Fleet consisted of, and about
what time the same might arrive at <hi>Panama.</hi>
Next day we examined the Commander of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice-Boat,
but we could get no particulars out of
him, saving, that when he saw himself like to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
he had thrown the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Packets,
and a Cascet of Jewels over-board.</p>
            <p>On the twenty seventh we put the same Questions
to the Pilot, who, according to the Example of his
Commander, would make no Discovery, because they
had taken an Oath together, rather to lose their Lives
than to divulge any secret, or to let the said Packet
fall into the hands of the <hi>Free-Booters.</hi> On the 28th
two of our Men died.</p>
            <p>On the Evening of the same day,<note place="margin">Geeeks <hi>here, who they are.</hi>
               </note> we departed
with two and twenty Canoes manned with five
hundred men, in order to go and take <hi>la Seppa,</hi>
which is a small Town seven Leagues to windward
of <hi>Panama;</hi> and on the twenty ninth about ten
in the Morning we discovered two Ships bearing up
to us, which when they came near, we found to
be two Pirogues mann'd with <hi>Greeks,</hi> which are
a People composed of divers Nations, to whom
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> gave this Name, and who serve them
in their Wars. These they brought some time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
from the North Sea to this Coast, to defend
them against us, because they look upon them to
be better Soldiers than themselves. We presently
sent out two of our best sailing Canoes manned with
twenty Men each to attack them. These <hi>Greeks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
who quickly took us to be really what we were, <hi>i. e.
Free-Booters,</hi> made no delay to save themselves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one of the Islands that stands in the Bay of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nama;</hi>
but upon their going a-shore, they lost one
of their Pirogues, that split in Pieces, and left us
the other; then they got upon a rising Ground, with
their Arms, and as much Ammunition as they could save,
and fought stifly against us under a Flag of Defiance.
And as the place where we landed, was exposed
to their Fire from the Ground where they had posted
themselves, and that the Ascent on that side where
we stood was very difficult,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Beaten by the</hi> Free-Booters.</note> we were forced to
take a great round to come at them another way,

where we found our Passage much easier. At <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

            <p>As I shall have frequent occasion to make mention
of the Word Vigie, it will not be improper in this
place to take notice, that by <hi>Vigier</hi> is no other thing
meant, than to set a Sentinel upon Land or Sea,
and those who are thus set, they call Vigies. The
<hi>Spaniards</hi> maintain a great number of them for
all their Cities, Towns, and Villages; and even
single Houses have Persons on purpose, whom they
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65235:18"/>
send to all the rising ground round about, and
River-sides, where they have their Horses ready
Night and Day, so that as soon as they discover an
Enemy, they hasten to give the <hi>Spaniards</hi> notice of
it; who forthwith prepare themselves not to fight.
but to save their Effects.</p>
            <p>On the first of <hi>May</hi> we rejoyned our Ships, who

about a League distant from the Mouth of
the River <hi>la Seppa,</hi> which makes up a kind of
Canal, that forms the Bay of <hi>Panama,</hi> and do
as it were, make a Bar all along, that divides
the Channel into two parts, one to the East and
the other to the West. Those Pleasures we met with
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n these parts, justly deserve a Remembrance,
whereof I shall give a little Description in this

            <p>I say then,<note place="margin">

delightfull, that they are usually called the Gardens
of <hi>Panama,</hi> and with very good reason, seeing
all People of Note in that City, have each of
them one of these Islands for themselves, and their
Houses of Pleasure there also, with curious Orchards,
watered with a great many Springs of running Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
adorned and imbelished with a wonderfull
Variety of Flowers and Arbours of Jessamine up
and down, and full almost of an infinite number
of all sorts of the Fruits of the Country, among
whom I have taken particular notice of four of
them which are called <hi>Sappota, Sappotilla, Avocata,</hi>
and <hi>las Cayemites.</hi>

            <p>The first is a Fruit almost like unto our Pears,<note place="margin">The Fruits growing there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

off, the Pulp is of a pure red Colour, very sweet,
and of an admirable Tast.</p>
            <p>The second is of the same form as the other, but no
bigger than a Russet Pear: It has an admirable tast,
and under the Rind is of a whitish Colour.</p>

back upon her, she gave us eighteen Guns, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
their own Fleet.</p>
            <p>Our Long Bark, having, during the Action, been
sorely handled; her Crew was forced to leave her,
and not having time to sink her, threw some Guns,
which our Admiral had put on board her, into the
Sea, and then saved themselves on board of one of
our other Ships. Now the <hi>Spanish</hi> Prisoners, who
we left behind, finding they were now at Liberty,
plied to put themselves into the hands of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
Admiral, but he taking this Bark for our Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
sunk her with his Cannon before she came near
him, not thinking their own People were on board
her.</p>
            <p>On the ninth we could see neither our own nor
the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet, which made us steer for the Isle
St. <hi>Iohn de Cueblo,</hi> four and twenty Leagues to the
West of <hi>Panama,</hi> where, by the favour of an Easter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Breeze, we arrived on the fourteenth; we ran
our selves presently a-shore, and it was high time,
for we had all along from the time of the Fight,
five Foot of Water in the Hold: We lost no time to
put our selves in a condition to get up again before
<hi>Panama,</hi> that we might know what became of our
Fleet, about which we were in great pain, which
we were put out of on the six and twentieth, when
we saw them coming to an Anchor in the same place
where we were, who told us they did not fight any
more after our Departure from them. That the
<hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet upon the ninth in the Evening, had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor'd
within Cannon Shot of ours, and that both the
one and the other having made ready on the tenth,
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> sailed away for the Port of <hi>Panama;</hi>
that Captain <hi>David</hi> had been hard plied by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
Cannon, especially with two Shots that carried
off half his Rudder, but that he had no more than six
of his Ships Crew wounded, and only one killed; that
Captain <hi>Sammes</hi> was no less put to it, that almost
all his Poop was sweept off, that he had received se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Shots between Wind and Water, that his Mate
had his Head shot off with a Cannon Ball, and that
he had no more than three Men wounded: And that
in short, the other lesser Vessels had lost never a Man,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65235:22"/>
and had but very few wounded. Here I may
truly say, and without exasperating the matter, that
it was a strange thing and next to a Miracle, that
we, who were so few in number, and had such pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
Ships of our own, should be able to bear the
Fire of, withstand and fight so considerable a Fleet,
in comparison of our own, consisting of such good
Ships, and manned so well as that of the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
was, whose Admiral was a Vessel of seventy Guns,
though she had but fifty six mounted, because she
was too old. Their Vice-Admiral had sorty, though
she was bored to carry sixty Guns; she was a very
fine Ship and an excellent Sailor, but also old. The
Patach was a Vessel of forty Guns, though she had
no more than eight and twenty mounted. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
had eighteen Guns, but was built as well as
the Patach, to carry forty. The other three were
almost as big; besides they had the advantage o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

first, we took a Sentinel, but another escaped,
which was the occasion of our being discovered.
We were obliged, in order to get at this Town, to
go up a very fine River two Leagues, and to make
use of the flowing of the Tide for that purpose; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we came at it, we found a Retrenchment made
for its Security, but ill guarded. The Town is none
of the best situated, though it stands upon the River<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
being surrounded every way with Marshes:
We found neither People nor Victuals there, and
so we left it on the third of <hi>Iuly;</hi> and next day as
we returned with our Canoes to rejoyn our Fleet,
we gave Chase to a Bark, which we took, and on the
fifth we got to our Ships.</p>
            <p>The <hi>English</hi> and we had a difference in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent
we made upon this Town,<note place="margin">The <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> and <hi>French</hi> fall out and part.</note> for they being more

of us, and be Masters of the whole, and that so
far, that Captain <hi>Townsley</hi> would have taken
Captain <hi>Groigniet</hi>'s Ship away, which Captain <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
had given him, and give him his own for her:
But as he found he had to do with men, who though
inferiour in number, would not tamely be thus put
upon, he was forced to give over his Pretensions;
Yet we finding still that they continued to pretend to
the same Dominion over us, we separated our selves
from them to the number of an hundred and thirty
<hi>Frenchmen</hi> without reckoning Captain <hi>Groigniet</hi>'s
Crew, who were two hundred more, and after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
banded our selves apart, we landed upon the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sland.</p>
            <p>One of the chief reasons that made us disagree, was
their Impiety against our Religion, for they made no
Scruple when they got into a Church, to cut down
the Arms of a Crucifix with their Sabres, or to shoot
them down with their Fusils and Pistols, bruising and
maiming the Images of the Saints with the same Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
in Derision to the Adoration we <hi>Frenchmen</hi> paid

On the ninth the <hi>English</hi> weighed, and came to
anchor about five or six Leagues to Leeward of the
place where we were building our Canoes, to fit up
others for themselves in Lieu of those they had lost
as well as we, during the Fight with the <hi>Spanish</hi>

and to that end went into a Wood, which in these
parts grows near to the Sea, of which we chose the
largest, which commonly are those Trees called

gone to the Isle of St. <hi>Iohn:</hi> The other <hi>English,</hi> who,
as I have already said, were gone to anchor about
five or six Leagues to Windward of us, had also
sent out a Canoe to know what this Bark was, which
came up with her as soon as we, and this made us
very uneasie; for this Bark being laden with Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
those <hi>English</hi> influenced these new Commers so far,
that they took them to anchor in the same place where
they were, except the eleven <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> who left them
and staid with us.</p>
            <p>This Island of St. <hi>Iohn Cueblo</hi> is about twelve
Leagues in Circumference,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>A Descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of St.</hi> John Cue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blo, &amp;c.</note> standing East and West,
and North and South, five Leagues distant from
the main Land, and separated by a narrow Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
(which is indeed no other than an Arm of the
Sea running in between two Lands) It is not inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited,
very mountainous, full of Wood, and water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with very fine Rivers. It stands in no stead to
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> besides supplying them with Masts for
their Shipping, which they have here in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.
When we stopt upon that Island, we were
in hopes to have fared well, so well stocked it was
with Deer, Monkeys, Agoutills, Lizards, and
Banks full of Tortoises; but we were deprived
of these Advantages by two Inconveniences we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
under; The first whereof was, that the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
in less than fifteen Days had made such a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of these Tortoises, that but very few of
them landed; The other respected our Hunting, which
after we had followed for a few days at first, we
were bound to decline; for having staid in this place
longer than we designed, we were under a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of preserving our Powder for fear, should we
have spent it, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would have been quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon us, so that we staid a whole Month upon
this Island to the number of three hundred and thirty
Men of us with eating no more than two Tortoises
in eight and forty Hours, and in seeking some Fruits
in the Woods wherewith to subsist, and with the eating
of which some of us died, as not knowing the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:65235:24"/>
There are a sort of Serpents upon this Island whose
stinging is so dangerous, that if any one has not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
certain Fruit by him, which he is to chew, an pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
to apply to the Wound, there is no escaping
present Death for him, as we found by Experience
by some of our Men whom we lost in this manner,
and who, in their dying endured terrible Pains
through the Activity and Violence of that Fire which
this Poison kindled in their Bodies. The Tree o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
which this Fruit grows, is to be found upon the same
place, as well as in the other parts of this Country,
being, as to its Leaves and Height very like unto
our Almond-Trees; But its Fruit resembles Sea-Ches<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts,
though its of a greyish, Colour, and of a some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
bitter tast, enclosing a whitish Almond in the
midst thereof. Its chewed altogether before the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
is made, and is known by no other Name
than the Serpents-Seed.</p>
            <p>Here also about two or three Leagues up the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
you have a great many <hi>Cayemans,</hi> which are a
kind of Crocodiles, that live both in the Sea, Rivers,
and on dry Land, and are of that ravenous Nature,
that some of our Men have been devoured by
them.</p>
            <p>On the seven and twentieth the <hi>English,</hi> who had
left us, sent a Quarter-Master to us to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we would joyn our selves with them, as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
they were too weak, to go and take the Town
of <hi>Leon,</hi> on which they had formed a Design. And
here we must acknowledge, that extream Misery
is so terrible a thing, that it is almost impossible,
when an opportunity presents it self of being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
that it should be let slip, notwithstanding
all the Repugnancy of our Reason to the contrary.
We had left the <hi>English</hi> by reason of their Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which we could not endure, and now we were
ready to comply with the Proposals they had made
us of rejoyning them again. The Provision was on
their side, and this was a charming Bait for People
that were ready to perish with Hunger. We pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
asked them for some Victuals: And as we
had but one Ship that could not hold us all, that
they should give us another, because we were not
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65235:24"/>
willing to be dispersed on board their Ships, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
but this they would not agree to. In the mean
while as we were resolved not to recede here-from,
Famine forced thirty of our Men to joyn themselves
with the <hi>English</hi> as being unable to bear with the Fasts
we were forced to keep. And on the fourth of <hi>August</hi>
four of our Men died.</p>
            <p>On the ninth, when we knew the <hi>English</hi> were
gone, we embarked to the number of an hundred
and twenty Men on board five Canoes command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Captain <hi>Groigniet,</hi> and lest two hundred
on board our Ship, and upon the Island, whom we
ordered to build more Canoes, and afterwards to
cross over to the Continent.</p>
            <p>Having made a Descent there on the thirteenth,
we came to an Hatto, which is a kind of a Farm,
where the <hi>Spaniards</hi> breed their Cattle: It was in
the Neighbourhood of a Town called St. <hi>Iago,</hi> which
is twenty Leagues distant from St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Island.
The People we found in this Hatto we made our
Prisoners, among whom, was the Master, who shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and conducted us to take a Sugar Plantation in
the River of St. <hi>Iago,</hi> where we were discovered.
We sounded our Prisoners one after another in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to know whether they understood any thing of
our Separation from the <hi>English,</hi> by telling them
we came from the North-Sea, and that they should
shew us where the <hi>Free-Booters</hi> were, which they
said were come into these Seas. They answered, they
were gone to St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Island to repair the Damage
the Fleet of <hi>Peru</hi> had done them, together with
other Circumstances, which we knew better than
they, without telling us one word of what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
between the <hi>English</hi> and us: Hence we conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured
they knew nothing of the matter, and we
could have been very well content that all the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> knew as little as they, for fear our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
might render them more forward to attack
us.</p>
            <p>After this Intelligence, we dispatch'd away a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noe
which we had taken in this River, to carry our
Men some Victuals, which we had found in this Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and to acquaint them, that we were going to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65235:25"/>
               <hi>Panama,</hi> to see whether we might meet with
an opportunity of seizing some Barks, that so we
might get out of St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Islands; Because,
as I have already said, our Ship was not big enough
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o hold us, and that as soon as the Canoes were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
they were to go and take <hi>Pueblo-Nuevo,</hi> in order
to get some Provision wherewith to subsist till our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
            <p>On the fifteenth we went a-shore forty Leagues
to Leeward of <hi>Panama,</hi> and though we had no
Guide, we got by Cock-crowing to a very pretty
<hi>Estancia</hi> as they call it, which was a lone House, and
where we took fifty Prisoners of both Sexes. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
these, there was a young Man and Woman
of Quality, who promised we should have a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
for them, and whom we carried to the Island
<hi>Ignuana,</hi> a Leagues distance from the great one,
and where there is no other but Rain-Water
to be had, which stands in the Cavities of the
Rocks.</p>
            <p>We staid for the fore-mention'd Ransom till the
eight and twentieth, when it was duly paid us, and
then went off, being first informed, that about eight
Leagues to Windward, there was a River, wherein
were two Barks laden with Maes, which on the nine
and twentieth in the Morning we boarded and
took. From thence we resumed our Course to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
and rejoyn our Men in St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Island, where we
arrived on the third of <hi>September.</hi> Here they told
us, that an Hundred of them, whereof ninety eight
were come back, had gone on the five and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
of the preceding Month, to <hi>Pueblo-Nuevo,</hi> as
we had ordered them, where they arrived on the
seven and twentieth; and though they were disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by the Centinels of the Town, they made
themselves masters of it, and staid there two days
for all the continual and various Attacks made
upon them by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> That the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the place came with a Trumpet to speak with
them, and asked, why they carried White Colours
seeing they were <hi>English</hi> (so he took them to be)
but without satisfying his Curiosity in the point,
they constrained him to be gone from whence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:65235:25"/>
came. That eight of them being gone some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from the place of Arms, there were two of
the number massacred by an hundred and fifty <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
who seeing so small a Company together,
bravely fell upon them; But with all the advantage
they had, they could not hinder the other six to recover
their Main-guard, who fought retreating with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Vigour.</p>
            <p>On the fourth we put out with six Canoes; and
an hundred and forty Men on board, whereof we
detached two to go to the Hatto, we had taken
on the eleventh of <hi>August,</hi> to look after the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
of the Master, whom we kept Prisoner, and
with the other four returned to that Sugar-Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in St. <hi>Iago,</hi> in order to get some Sugar-Caul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons,
whereof we had occasion. There we were
informed, that the Governor of St. <hi>Iago</hi> came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
after our Departure the first time we took it,
with eight hundred Men. We staid in this place
till the ninth, expecting the Answer of a Prisoner
whom we had sent to the Governor, and by whom
we sent him word, that if he were minded to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
with his eight hundred Men, we were ready;
but hearing no news of him, we departed thence, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
our two Canoes had rejoyned us; and on the
eleventh arrived on board our Ship and the two Barks
at the Island of St. <hi>Iohn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the fifth we carreened our Ships and took in
Water and Wood; we would have left this Island,
had it not been for the continual Rains that fell and
lasted eighteen days, and such bad Weather, that
it was impossible for us to appear upon Deck, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
never seen the Sun all this time: And for this
reason it is, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call the distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Bay of <hi>Gurgona,</hi> and this Island of St.
<hi>Iohn, The Droppings of the South-Sea.</hi> You have but
four Months of good Weather here throughout the
Year, and they are <hi>December, Ianuary, February,</hi>
and <hi>March;</hi> the other eight Months are incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with great Rains, which falls almost without
any Intermission, and which besides the bloody Flux
it brings, is so pernicious, that if a Man has been
wet with it two or three times, if he do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65235:26"/>
shift himself, it breeds large Worms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his Skin and his Flesh, in form some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
like unto a Quill, and about half a finger
long.</p>
            <p>The Weather clearing up, on the fourth of <hi>October,</hi>
we mended our Sails, which were almost rotten,
and made ready to be gone. And the same Day we
had one of our Men stung in the Leg by a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
who died of it presently, as not having taken
care to provide himself with the remedy we have
spoken of.</p>
            <p>On the eighth we made ready and sailed for <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leguo,</hi>
which is both a Port and Town an hundred
and fourscore Leagues to the West and by North
West of the Isle of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and two hundred and
sixty West of <hi>Panama.</hi> We had a small South East
Wind till the eleventh, and on the twelfth and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
we steered West North West, and that Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
descryed Land. On the fourteenth we had a
boisterous South Wind, which made us take in all
our Sails, till Mid-night, and then came a Calm, till
the seventeenth, when towards Noon we were surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
with a South West Blast, attended with great
Rains, which separated us from our two Barks: It
blew so very hard, that the Sea appeared present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
very frightfull, and put us so to it, that we began
to be very apprehensive we should be all cast away:
But the Weather, (as God would have it) proving
fair again, we spent the nineteenth to set our Vessel in
order, as well as to mend our Sails with our Shirts
and Drawers, wherewith we were already but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
indifferently provided. Towards Evening we
discovered Land, and knew it to be the Bay of
<hi>Caldaira,</hi> whereof I shall give an account by and
by. On the twentieth we sailed in sight of that of
<hi>Colebra;</hi> from thence we had moderate Weather,
and a South-East Wind; and on the one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
we got to the Height of the <hi>Morns,</hi> which the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> call <hi>Papegaya</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:65235:26"/>
On the two and twentieth we found our selves
over against <hi>Realeguo,</hi> a place very remarkable for
the high Mountains that surround it; and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for a high Sulphurous Hill that burns continually,
and whose Smoak reaches a great way, but the
Tides next Night put us twenty Leagues to Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of it. On the four and twentieth we put out
four Canoes with an hundred men in them, in order
to take some Prisoners, that we might receive some
Information concerning this Coast, where we never
were before.</p>
            <p>On the five and twentieth we put to the Shoar
and landed, and after a March of three Hours, came
to an Hatto, where we surprized the People, who
gave us to understand, that the <hi>English</hi> had taken
the Town of <hi>Leon,</hi> and burnt that of <hi>Realeguo:</hi> That
the Inhabitants of <hi>Legoria, Granada, Sansonnat,</hi>
St. <hi>Michell,</hi> St. <hi>Salvador,</hi> and <hi>Villa-Nueva,</hi> which
are Neighbouring Towns to the two fore-mention'd
ones, had sent a considerable Re-inforcement of
Men to those of the Town of <hi>Leon,</hi> who yet durst
not attack the <hi>English,</hi> who staid there three whole
days; during which time they had sent several Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
to these Re-inforcements to require them to
fight in the <hi>Race Savana,</hi> which the other still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused,
saying, they were not yet all come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that is, that they were hitherto no more than
six to one, and that they staid till they were doubly
increased.</p>
            <p>On the six and twentieth, one of our Quarter-Masters,
who was a <hi>Catalonian</hi> by Birth,<note place="margin">One of the <hi>Bucca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers</hi> Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Masters deserts to the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards.</hi>
               </note> fled to
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which hindred us at this time from
going to take the Town of <hi>Granada,</hi> of which I shall
speak in its due place, for we did not doubt, but
that he had given them an account of the Design we
had formed upon that place.</p>
            <p>On the seven and twentieth we went on board our
Canoes again, and made for the Port of <hi>Realeguo,</hi>
where the Rendezvous of our Ship was to be:
We could land no where all along the Coast, because
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65235:27"/>
the Sea breaks with so much Violence there, when
'tis a Southerly Wind, that it is impossible to come
near it. However six of our Men swum with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to fill some Casks with Water, which we were
in want of, but they could not do it, for the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
followed us by Land all along the Bank, and
so it sell out, that one of our Men was unfortunately
drowned.</p>
            <p>On the first of <hi>November</hi> we arrived at the Port
of <hi>Realeguo,</hi> where we found our Ship at Anchor.
There are two Passages to this Port, whereof that
to Windward is best. It's very narrow, and besides
this, has two <hi>Mornes</hi> or little Mountains, that form
the two points thereof. Upon one of which the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
had a design to build a Fort. There is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fine River runs into this Haven, that bears the
same Name with the Town, It's safe from any
Winds, and contains within it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ive Islands that are
very good to carreen Ships in; there are but three
Leagues from thence up the River before you come
at the Town: But before we got there with our
Canoes, we met three very strong Retrenchments,

lieu of that, it is at least a douzen Leagues within Land,
and comprehends a great many Islands of different sizes
within it; there is none but an <hi>Easterly</hi> Wind that can
hurt it; the bottom of the Bay is open, by means of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fine Rivers that run into it, and by which you may
ascend to several Villages, Hattos and Sugar Plantations,
whereof this Country is full. You may choose your place
of Anchorage, according to the length of the Cable, that
is from six Fathom, increasing to any Hundred, and the
bottom is very good: I forgot to observe that the six
Magazines of <hi>Caldaira,</hi> whereof I have spoken, were
partly built by the Inhabitants of <hi>Carthage,</hi> who make
use of that for their Port, for facilitating the Traffick
they drive with those living on the Coast of <hi>Peru,</hi> before

            <p>Having on the <hi>10th.</hi> gone on Board our Canoes, we
went to a great Bananery that stood in the same Bay; its
a set of Fruit Trees which they call Bananiers, and the
Fruit thereof Bananes, with which we loaded our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes

rows of Coco-Trees that run along the Bank for above
fifteen Leagues in length, and that in so orderly a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,

they seem as if they had been all planted on a Line.</p>
            <p>This Fruit, which upon several occasions was so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful

begness of it, for there are some of these Fruits that
weigh twelve or fifteen Pounds, the Shell is very hard,
and thick enough; its wrapped up in a kind of thick cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
made up all of Filaments, with which the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
use to caulker their Ships, it being much better then
Tow, which rots in the Water in less then an Years
time, whereas the other is fed by it and waxeth Green. If
you bore an hole in this Nut, there runs out a quantity

of greenish Liquor, which somewhat resembles the colo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

or what is equivalent thereto, of the thickness of a Man's
Finger, very white and nourishing, which sticks very
close to the inside. We left this place on the twentieth,
keeping our Course still all along the Continent.</p>

by going ashoar on that side of the River, whereas
we should have gone on the other: This was cold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

as it was Night, we made no more ado, than to return
to our Canoes, wherein we passed that River: when
we were got on the other side, we took the Town-Watch,

but as it was a little too late, we eased them
of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that trouble also. Of them we learnt, that there was
a small Frigat up the River, which having touched in
going out upon a Bank of Sand, that lay at the mouth
thereof, was forced to go back, and so put the Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

an hundred and twenty more came out of a little nook
where they had concealed themselves, and beset us in
such a manner, that finding no likelyhood of escaping,
we resolved never to be taken alive, but to sell our Lives

back to back, that we might face the Enemy every way,
and in this posture we fought them above an hour and
an half, at the expiration whereof there being no more
then two of us in a condition to fight, God was pleased
that some of our Men who were upon the Guard should
come to our Relief, being driven thither by the Firings,
for they thought before they heard these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

save our Lives, for the Enemy having already

we should hold out against such a shower of

it was necessary we should build large Pirogues, seeing
we could make no farther use of our Ship, for want of
Sails, and we had nothing left to make them with, and
still were less able to take Ships from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> on

            <p>On the <hi>27th.</hi> we descry'd seven sail of Ships out a

of us; we gave our Men notice of it without delay, and
at the same time, resolved to put all we had on Board
our Ship, into our Bark, and to go into that River
where our Docks were, there to wait the coming of our
Enemy, where they could not come to attack us, without
losing a great many Men. This project we put forthwi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet sailed away, and left us at ease to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nish
our Work, upon which we spent the remainder <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
the Month.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:65235:32"/>
We understood afterwards that the Admiral of this
Fleet had orders to put some Field-pieces ashoar to demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
those Fortifications which they thought we had made
upon the Island, being induced to believe it was so, by
by the report the Prisoners, which we sent them, made
of our Intentions. We to impose upon them, having ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
whether there were any Masons among them that
could do our Work, and sometimes obliged them to give
as Brick for their Ransom, though we had no need of
them: there were no less then fourteen of our Men dyed
in the Month of <hi>February.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the <hi>14th.</hi> of <hi>March</hi> we departed from the Isle of
St. <hi>Iohn</hi> with our two Barks, an half Gally of 40 Oars,
ten great Pyrogues, and ten small Canoes, all built of
Mapou-Timber, except our two Barks; we gained the
Windward point of the Island to take a review of our
Men, and found our Selves weaker by no less then thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Persons, since our separation from the English: But
we formed a design anew at the same time which had
been put by for above four Months, which was to go
and take the Town of <hi>Granada,</hi> distant now from us,
about two hundred Leagues. To effect this Work, it was
necessary we should be furnished with Provision where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to subsist us during the Voyage, and we having
none, this made us send away our half Galley and four
Canoes, to seek for some at <hi>Pueblo Nueoo</hi> while the rest
of the Company went to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arry for us at the Isle of St.
<hi>Peter,</hi> which is two Leagues to Windward of the River
<hi>Chiriquita,</hi> and to finish somewhat that was still wanting
to the compleat Equipment of our Canoes.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>6th.</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> about three hours before day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
we were got near to the River of <hi>Pueblo Nuevo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>They fight the</hi> Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards <hi>by Sea.</hi>
               </note>
and by a clear light of the Moon we discerned a small
Prigat at its Mouth, as also a long Bark, and a Pyrogue.
We came within Pistol shot of them, as supposing them to
be our <hi>English Freebooters,</hi> from whom we had separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
But we found our selves quickly mistaken, for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
we had haled them, they answered us with an intire
Volley of great and small shot, which made us now
conjecture that they were, and it was too true, a detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
left by the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet in that place, when they
left us at St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Island, as a guard to two small Ships,
which we knew they were lading with Provisions at the
Port of this Town, in order to transport the same to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nama.</hi>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:65235:33"/>
Our mistake was the reason that we had twenty
Men disabled to fight, by this first Discharge of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
before we know well where we were, but after we
were a little recovered out of the surprize this adventure
put us to, we fought them stifly for the space of two
hours, though we had the use of no other Arms than
our Fuzees, and not one Cannon to discharge upon
them; And they on their part defended themselves so much
the more vigorously in that they believed, we, after
such a surprize as we had been exposed to, would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
slacken our Courage and give way. They did all
they could to make ready during the Fight, but we hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
them, and no Man could appear in the Shroud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
but we brought them down, as well as their Granadeers
from their Round Tops. But finding the light of the
Moon now gone, we put off out of the reach of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
Cannon, as well to take care of our wounded Men,
which amounted to thirty three, besides four who were
killed out right, as to wait for day light, in order to
terminate this Affair, which we were not willing to
leave undecided. But the Enemy did in the mean time
retire under the covert of a Retrenchment, which I have
said already, they had upon the Banks of this River,
where the Country People who had heard the noise of
the Fight in the Night, were also come, which made
us conclude, that if we went to attack them in that
place, we could not have that advantage there, we had
resolved to take of them; So upon approach of day, we
steered our Course to go and rejoyn our Canoes at the
Isle of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> where we arrived on the Eighth.</p>
            <p>On the ninth we found our Selves in great want of
Victuals, having now nothing at all to eat, and this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
us hard to it, more especially our wounded Men, who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
we sent by our half Gally, (for their better convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy)
on board our two Barks, whom we had appointed
to Rendesvouz in the Bay of <hi>Boca-del-Toro.</hi> When this
was done, we went ashoar to a Town ten Leagues to
Leeward of <hi>Chiriquita,</hi> where finding none, we left it,
and on the Eleventh in our return to our Canoes, we
found, in order to strengthen us under the languishme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
which Hunger had reduced us to, a regale of an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buscade
of five hundred Men laid for us, against whom
for all our weakness, we made so good a defence, that we
obliged them to leave us free Passage, but yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65235:33"/>
the loss of two of our Men. We went on Board in
the Evening, to go joyn our Barks in the Bay of <hi>Boca-del-T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ro,</hi>
where we arrived the thirteenth, and went ashoar;
spending, our Time to the sixteenth in hunting more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
for the subsistance of our wounded Men, and here we
found the same sort of Deer and Birds, as I have taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of in our passage over the Continent, in great plenty.</p>
            <p>On the same day we departed for the Bay of <hi>Caldaira,</hi>
after having renewed our Enterprize upon the little
Town of <hi>Lesparso,</hi> of which I have already spoken, On
the <hi>19th.</hi> being arrived in the Bay, we went ashoar two
hours before Day light, and reached the Town; About
Eleven in the Morning, we found the place was in a
manner intirely abandoned from the time we had taken
the Sentinels, who, as I have already observed, divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us from going thither by the account they gave of the
Reinforcement that was come to them from <hi>Carthage:</hi>
However we took some Prisoners, who told us all the
People were retired to this last Town, which is four and
twenty Leagues off; so that finding our endeavours all
frustrated, we returned on the <hi>20th.</hi> to the Sea side to
rejoyn our Canoes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lesparso</hi> is reckoned to be three Leagues distant from
the Sea-side, and the way thither very bad, you cannot
travel the length of a Gun-shot in even Ground, but the
same is every where rugged, and full of little Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
and Hills, though beyond them the Country ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to be very good and delightful. The Town is
built upon an Eminence, from whence one may easily
see all that comes in and goes out of the Bay; This
Town is in a manner encompassed with a Rivulet that
runs round it: Between it and <hi>Carthage,</hi> are very curious
Plains, with royal ways made through them, and that
as well as any in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 21st. we victuall'd our selves with the Fruit of a
Bananery in this Bay, wherein our two Barks came to
joyn us, and next day we summoned our People ashoar
upon this Island as well to consult how we should attack
the Town of <hi>Granada,</hi> which we had a design upon, as
to take an account of what powder they had, as fearing
many of them might use it in hunting: Here we enacted
orders whereby those were condemned to lose their share
of the Booty got in the place, that should be found
guilty of Cowardice, Violence, Drunkeness, Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65235:34"/>
Theft, and straggling from the Main Body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
orders. When this was over, we left the Bay the
same Evening, and a strong Easterly Wind surprizing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
in the Night, separated our Vessels from one another:
At break of day, we told thirteen Sail, wherewith we
were amazed, knowing we had no more than a dozen,
and this made us give our Canoes the signal to chase,
as well as we, that Vessel that did not belong to us, be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

had been, and went with his five Canoes to find out some
Bananes, having very little Provision on Board. He told
us that Captain <hi>David,</hi> with his Fleet was on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
number, we readily consented to such a Reinforcement
as must needs be useful to us.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>25th.</hi> we departed all together <hi>French</hi> and
<hi>English</hi> in our Pirogues and Canoes, leaving their Ship
and our two Barks under the covert of <hi>Cape Blanck,</hi> which
is twenty Leagues to Windward of the place where we
were to go ashoar, and gave orders to those that were
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65235:34"/>
appointed to guard them, to sail away six days after,
and to coast it till they came to an Anchor, at the place
where we should leave our Canoes.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>7th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> we went ashoar on a flat Coast,
to the number of three hundred and forty five Men, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the conduct of a very good Guide, who lead us cross
a Wood that we might not be discovered. We marched
on Night and Day till the Ninth, but notwithstanding
all the precautions we took, we could not hinder our being
discovered by the Inhabitants of the Town of <hi>Granada,</hi>
who were fishing in a River about fifteen Leagues off, and
though they made all the hast they could to advertise the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> of our March, they could not have been there
time enough to have given the People Notice to remove
all their effects, considering the expedition we used to
follow them, had not they (unhappily upon our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count)
notice given them of us three weeks before by the
Inhabitants of <hi>Lesparso,</hi> who having seen the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Canoes we had, as we passed by there, grew sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious
of our design.</p>
            <p>The fatigue we had undergone during our March, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the sharp Hunger that pressed us, obliged us
to halt and rest the Ninth in the Evening in a great Sugar
Plantation, that is about four Leagues distant from <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada,</hi>
and was in our way thither. It belonged to a
Knight of St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s, who upon our arrival, we failed
in take Prisoner, our Leggs being at that time much
more disposed to rest, then to run after him. On the <hi>10th.</hi>
we set out, and upon our approach near the Town, we
observed an Eminence above it about a League off, and
two Ships upon the lake of <hi>Nicaragua,</hi> that carryed, as
we were since informed, all the wealth of the Town in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an Island two Leagues off. We took a Prisoner in a
Village that was in our way, who told us the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the Town had intrenched themselves upon the
place of Arms, and compassed it with a strong Wall,
since our Quarter-master who had run away to them,
had given information that we designed to come amongst
them: He told us farther, that that Place was guarded
with fourteen pieces of Cannon, and six Petereroes, and
lastly, that they had detatched six Troops of Horse to

their Walls, contributed yet even more then the other,

As soon as our People who were got upon the said Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65235:36"/>
the Officers and Inhabitants were in Consultation about
it, but that one of our Men whom they had taken as be
lagged behind, through weariness upon the Road, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Officer that brought up our Rear, his having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of it, assured them we would not burn it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
our design was to pass some Months after to the
North-Sea, by the Lake there, and to furnish our selves
in this Town with necessaries for our Journey, which we
should not meet with if we fired the Place: So that the
said Man having given them such assurance, they would
no longer trouble themselves about giving an Answer
to the Proposal we had made for their ransoming the
Town,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>They fire</hi> Granada.</note> which at last constrained some of us to set fire
to the Houses out of meer Spight and Revenge.</p>
            <p>The opportunity which now offered it self unto us of
passing through the Lake to the North-Sea, was not at
this time over favourable, and we should not have failed
to make use of it, if we had had Canoes ready in this
place to go and take two Ships, and the wealth of the
Town, which the Inhabitants had carryed for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
securing of them into the Island which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

the term of Dangers and Miseries which our destiny had
still in store for us, being not yet come, we could not
take the Advantage of so favourable an Opportunity to
get out of those parts of the World, which though
very charming and agreeable to those who are settled
there, yet did not appear to be so to an handful of Men,
as we were, without Shipping, the most part of our time
without Victuals, and wandering amidst a multitude of
Enemies, against whom we were obliged to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
upon our Guard, and who did all that in them lay
to deprive us of Subsistance.</p>

you may see a great many fine Sugar Plantations, which
are more like unto so many Villages, then single Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and among the rest is that belonging to the Knight
of St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s, where we lay in our March to the Town,
where there is a very pretty and rich Church.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>10th.</hi> we left the City, and took along with
us one piece of Cannon, with sour Petereroes, as not
questioning but we should meet with Opposition in our
way, before we came to the Sea-side, from which we
were near twenty Leagues distant, and therein we were
not deceived; seeing the <hi>Spaniards</hi> waited for us, to
the number of two thousand five hundred Men, within a
quarter of a League of the Town, and presently charged
us: But not dreaming that we had brought any of their
Artillery along with us, they were so terrifyed when
we had fired two Cannon shot upon their first Ambus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade,
that they left us a free passage in this place only, for
though they saw a great many of their Men sprawling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Ground, they ceased not all the way at certain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
to lay new Ambushes for us, where they had no
more success then at first. We took one of them Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
who told us, there was a Million and an
half of pieces of Eight long since ordered for the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soming
of their Town, in case the same should be taken,
and that the same was buryed in the Wall, so as that it
could not be seen: But we had no inclination to go
back in search of this Money, seeing we found difficulty
enough to rid our selves out of the Hands of so conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
a number of Enemies as we had already to deal
with.</p>
            <p>We were forced that Evening to leave our Cannon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind

that drew them were dead for want of Water, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
travelled several Leagues through very great heats,
without one drop of Water, and through such a Dust, as
choaked both Man and Beast. But we reserved our
Petereroes, which were carryed by Mules, who could
better bear this inconveniency. At last we lay in a very
pretty Village, called <hi>Massaya,</hi> that stands upon the side
of the Lake, but from hence to the Water there is so
great a descent, that a Man of full growth appears to be
no bigger then a Child: We were received by the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
in this place with open Arms, but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that
had retired thither, knowing the extream thirst where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

               </gap>licted, had spoilt all the Water that
was in the Village, hoping thereby to reduce us to such
necessity, that we might go by Night to drink to the Lake
that so they might lay some Ambush for us: But these
<hi>Indians</hi> that came to meet, and pray us not to burn their
Village, remedyed this Evil, in assuring us, they would
supply us with whatever we had occasion for, as long
as we staid there, and particularly with Water. Taken
with this their Submission, we granted them their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
so much the more willingly, seeing they gave us
to understand upon several occasions, that they were
more our Friends, then they were the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>

practised towards them, to make them forgetful of those
Cruelties and Tyrannies they had heretofore exercised in
those parts, and which they are not wanting still to keep
in remembrance. They have at present a pretty number of
them there, whom they have brought down from those
Mountains where they had refugiated themselves and
brought them to submit in this manner. They have given
them places to build Burroughs and Villages upon, but all
their Labour redounds to the advantage of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi>
So that being used as Slaves by them, they are so weary of
their Dominion, and the Barbarity sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

fight us, that if we had been People fit to receive them;
as often as they made an offer to take our parts, we
should have formed a very considerable Army, and it is
certain, that if they had but Arms and Protection, they
would have infallibly shaken off the Yoke of their piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

another Father from us, who was one of our
Prisoners, who had taken up Arms against us, and had
his Pockets full of poysoned Bullets: We required in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change

for him one of our Men, whom they had taken,
which they would by no Means agree to, so that we
carryed the latter along with us, as far as the Sea-side.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>17th.</hi> we left this Burrough, and lay in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

passed next day, and as we came out of a Forrest to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into a Plain, we discovered five hundred Men upon
an ascent, waiting for our coming, commanded by the
abovementioned <hi>Catalonian</hi> Quarter-master, that had
deserted us: They had put up Bloody Colours, to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
they would give no quarter, which obliged us to lay
by our white Colours, and display our Red as well as
they. We marched directly to the place where they
were without stopping, though they fired very thick
upon us, and when we came within Musket-shot, we
detatched our Van-Guard to beat them off their
Ground, which they did with wonderful Bravery;
Here we took about fifty Horses, the Enemy in their
flight, cowardly left part of their Arms behind them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
their dead and wounded Men, by which last we
understood that these People were the reinforcement which
the Inhabitants of the Town of <hi>Leon</hi> had sent to the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of <hi>Granada</hi> against us, and who were returned
home.</p>
            <p>After we had rested about an hour, we continued our
March, and lay at a little Town which the Inhabitants
had forsaken. On the <hi>19th.</hi> we lay in a Hatto, and
the next day in an <hi>Estancia,</hi> where we rested some days
to refresh our selves, and to salt our Provisions to carry
on Board our Ships, where we knew very well there
could be no Victuals left. I always went before with an

looked after our Vessels with our Return. On the <hi>26th.</hi>
the rest of our Men came to the Sea-side, where we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imbarked

               </gap>inder us to proceed and arrive at the place about Noon;
The <hi>Spaniards</hi> who had heard of our coming, fled every
where, but the heats are so excessive in these parts, that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65235:38"/>
you cannot travel there this time of day, and this made
us go and see rather for some shade or tufts of Grass
whereon to set our Feet, then to run after the Enemy,
however we took some Prisoners. We tarryed there but
two days, and after we had gathered as much Provision
as we could find in the Houses, and sent out a party to
see for some Horses, whereof they brought us an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
we departed on the first of <hi>May,</hi> and carryed
our Provision to the River side at <hi>Realeguo,</hi> where our
Canoes were, who carryed the same afterwards on Board
our Ships, while we went out to seek for more, that so
we might get together a good quantity, and not be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to consume it as we brought it in.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>2d.</hi> we went to a Sugar Plantation to fetch off
six Caldrons which we brought away next day, and on
the fourth set out for a Burrough two Leagues from
<hi>Realeguo,</hi> which they call <hi>Ginandego,</hi> which some of
the Inhabitants a few days before pray'd us by way of
Raillery to go and Visit, as thinking themselves sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
secured by a Rerrenchment cast up at the Avenue
leading to it, and that was defended by two hundred Men:
We got thither on the fifth, by break of day; But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
discovered by the Sentinel, he carryed the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
notice thereof, who gave us no occasion to desire them
to quit it, after they had given us a few Musquet-shot;
so that to punish their Rhodomontades, we burn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
place down to the Ground: We took one of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Prisoner, by whom we understood that the <hi>Coregidor</hi>
of <hi>Leon,</hi> who was very desirous to drive us away from
that Coast, had ordered all the <hi>Tements,</hi> as soon as we
got to any Place, to burn all the Provision they had,
which to our sorrow was but to well executed, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
here, but every where else, and was the cause also of
that Hunger and extraordinary toyl which we were
forced to endure in these Seas, as long as we staid
there.</p>
            <p>The same day about Noon, came about eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Men into a <hi>Savana</hi> from <hi>Leon</hi> to fight us, the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel
which we had placed on the top of the Steeple, rung
the Alarum-Bell to give us notice to get together, and
come out of the Houses where we were dispersed:
Whereupon we marched in a body of an hundred and
fifty Men, with red Colours to fight them, but as they
could not endure to let us come within Musket-shot of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65235:38"/>
them, for they fled without any more ado, we were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd
to retire, and on the <hi>6th.</hi> went away to go on
Board our Ships, which we careened next day, as we
also cleaned our Canoes.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>9th.</hi> we had a consultation together, about
what way we should take, and here we found our selves
of <hi>two</hi> Opinions, one party was for going up before <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nama,</hi>
being in hopes they had begun their Navigation
again, as knowing we were far enough from them; But
the rest represented, that many times they had such Years
on that Coast, whereof that might be one of them, that

Rains, and Southerly Winds which reign there,
and that therefore it would be more advisable to go low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Westward, and winter upon some Island or other, and
there to wait for fair Weather.</p>
            <p>Now these different Sentiments were pursued by us,<note place="margin">They disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and steer diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Course <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and every Man having made choice of his side; Next
day our Chirurgeons had orders to give in an account of
those among the wounded, who were crippled, to the

They told us we had four Men crippled, and six
hurt, to which we gave six hundred pieces of Eight a
Man, and a thousand to those that were crippled, as it
was our constant custom in those Seas, and it was exactly
all the Money we had got together, that was applyed to
that use: We made a Division of the Barks and Canoes
on the <hi>12th.</hi> and we found our selves to be an hundred
and forty eight <hi>French</hi>-Men, ready to go up towards <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nama</hi>
(without comprehending the <hi>English</hi> under Captain
<hi>Townsley,</hi>) and the same number of <hi>French</hi> failed also to
the <hi>Westward.</hi> Next day our Provision was shared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, and now it was that we divided into two
parts; those who were for the <hi>Westward,</hi> put themselves
under the Conduct of Captain <hi>Grogniet,</hi> and we that
were bound for <hi>Panama,</hi> were commanded by Captain
<hi>Townsley;</hi> And then we went to Anchor at an Island
(half a League distant from that we left) to take in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

us his Quarter-master to desire us to put none of our Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners

of Land, but it was so hazy, that we could not tell
where we were, however we steered <hi>East</hi> by <hi>South-East,</hi>
to come near. The Weather being now somewhat clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up, we found we were between the Bay of <hi>Boca-del-Toro,</hi>
and the Point called <hi>Barica,</hi> when we sailed <hi>South</hi>

On the <hi>7th,</hi> we put in at the Isle of <hi>Montosa,</hi> six

out three Canoes, with which we coasted round about
this last, and our Ships anchored at another little Island,

round St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Island with our Canoes, we found
nothing there but one of our Prisoners, who having
made his escape from us when we were there, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not able to get to the Continent, returned to us:
On the <hi>10th.</hi> we went back to our Ships, and next
day took in our store of Water and Wood, and cleaned
our Ships: There arose the succeeding Night a North
Wind that tore our Cables, and made us think we should
be thrown ashoar; But as good Luck would have it, it
came about and gave us an opportunity to make ready,
and to cast Anchor farther from the Shoar. By the
favour of the Lightning we discovered our Canoes, and

and knew it to be the Cape called <hi>Morn a Puercos,</hi> then
we bore off to Sea with a hard Wind till the Evening, when
the Weather grew so very bad, that we did nothing till
the <hi>18th.</hi> but let our Ships drive with a <hi>South-West</hi> Wind,
having terrible Rain all the while till Noon, when the
Weather grew better, and being cleared up, we dicserned
three Rocks, which are called the <hi>Three Brothers,</hi> stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

of the Arrival of two Ships laden with Meal, which were
to carry also the Pay of their Soldiers from <hi>Limas; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which Information we sent out our Half-Galley, which
was now finished, to scout without the Islands; On
the <hi>30th.</hi> we departed with our Canoes, and went ashoar
upon one of these Islands, where we surprized a Person
that was come from <hi>Panama,</hi> whose Master was
Captain of those Greek <hi>Pirogues,</hi> whereof we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
spoken, who came on purpose thither to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
to the end he might endeavour by Artificial ways

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> an
account. This Man immediately pretended a great deal
of sincerity, in telling us several things, which he knew
we were not ignorant of, and some others, which we
could not quickly and easily come to know; and among
the rest, that there were in the River of <hi>Seppa,</hi> two
Merchant Barks, and a <hi>Pirogue</hi> with sixty <hi>Indians</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o
Board, whom the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had armed since they made
a Peace with them; That besides, the Governor of <hi>Villia</hi>
had acquainted the President of <hi>Panama,</hi> that one of
our Men whom they had taken, had assured him that
thirty more of us, who had not been informed, of the
Peace, and good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> understanding, there was between
the <hi>Indians</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> were about to pass from
this Sea to that of the North, by the same way we all
of us had come into the South-Sea; And that upon this
Information, the President had sent an hundred Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the River of <hi>Boca del Chica</hi> to wait for them: But to
compass his Design, which was to draw us under the
Forts of <hi>Panama,</hi> he told us in the last place, that they
had a little Frigat which came laden into that Port,
and a Gaily that was sent out every Evening upon the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65235:43"/>
solved to take the Advantage of this Information
which we took to be candid and real, and not to
neglect this opportunity of getting some Vessels for
our selves, whereof we stood in great need.</p>
            <p>On the 1st. of <hi>August</hi> we sent our Galley for
this purpose into the River of <hi>Seppa,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Greek Captains Stratagem discovered, and he killed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> in order to take
one of the Barks our Captain spoke of, and at the
same time we departed also with four Canoes to go
and seize those Ships in the port of <hi>Panama,</hi> being
accompanyed by our Greek Intelligencer, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be our Guide upon this occasion. He
brought us two hours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before day light before the
Town, and as the Moon shone very bright, we staid
for some Cloud to obscure it, to facilitate our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
undiscovered to the Ships in the Port,
whereof we saw one already, which to our think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
had her Sails loose: And here was the lure and
snare to which the Captain lead us, but by the effect
of meer chance, or rather our own good Fortune,
we turned away to a Ship which we unexpectedly
saw going out of the Port, and gave her chase, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
the same to be the Galley that usually went
out to scout, as we had been told: We took her
without a Gun shot, and upon Examination of the
Captain who commanded her, he discovered unto
us, that the President of <hi>Panama</hi> had sent us a
Greeck, who was to suffer himself to be taken by us,
and to whom he had promised a very great Reward,
if he succeeded in the project he had formed of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
us, that the means that had been agreed upon
to effect it, were to bring us under the Forts of
that Town, allured with the hopes of taking those
Ships there wherewith he had amused us, and
whereof that which seemed to us to have her Sails
loose, was but a sham Ship, a Pistol shot from the
Port, which was built upon firm Land, of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orty Planks
ill set together, in which they had set up Masts, and
adorned her with some Sails: And as this was the most
apparent Object, and the first that offered it self in
sight; it was not to be questioned, but that we who
must believe the same to have been on the Water, being
deceived with the darkness of the Night; would not
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65235:44"/>
have sailed (being so greedy as we were to take her)
to row up to her, where our Canoes must infallibly
run far ashoar, and that in the time that must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
have been spent in getting them off, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
would have leasure to fall upon us, where they
did not doubt, but so great a number of Men as they
had in so considerable a Town as that was, would
quickly overpower and destroy us.</p>
            <p>This Information which came so seasonably, that
it saved us from the certain danger we were going to
throw our selves into, was not so advantagious to our
Greek Captain, who being known by the Captain
of the Bark, for the same Person, of whose treachery
he had now advertised us; we paid him for his
Trouble, by sending him to the other World, where
he designed to have sent us, after which we went
to take the Island of <hi>Tavoga,</hi> which had been rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
since we had left the Coast of <hi>Panama.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the second at Night to the third, we left this
Island, and went to take that of <hi>Ottoqua</hi> which is
two Leagues North and South from it, and which we
found peopled again: We made ready on the fourth
to go and joyn our Galley, whom we had appointed
to Rendesvouz at the Isle of <hi>Sipilla,</hi> but we found
her in our passage with a Prize she had taken, being
one of the Barks that were in the River of <hi>Seppa,</hi> from
whence in coming out, she had met with an Ambus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade
that killed her two Men, and broke the Arm of
another.</p>
            <p>On the fifth we saw five Sail between <hi>Tavoga</hi> and
<hi>Panama,</hi> we presently bore up to them, and found
they were our own Ships that had given chase to a
Bark come from <hi>Nata,</hi> laden with Provision. The
Master thereof finding he could not defend it, threw
himself into the Water and swam ashoar, after he had
made some discharges with his small Arms upon
them: On the sixth we went with our Prizes to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
at <hi>Tavoga,</hi> and from thence writ to the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of <hi>Panama,</hi> that if he would not give up the five
<hi>English</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Prisoners, he had in that place,
we would cut off the Heads of fifty <hi>Spaniards</hi> we had
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:65235:44"/>
in our Hands: But hearing no News of him, on the
seventh we weighed, and sailed for the <hi>king</hi>'s-<hi>Islands:</hi>
We anchored on the ninth, to stop the Leaks of our
Ships, and while that was doing, we departed with
our Galley and four Canoes for the River <hi>Boca

               </gap>dians of <hi>Sambe</hi> had made Peace with
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as we had been assured, as to go and
burn all that was built of the Town called <hi>Terrible</hi>
upon this fine River, that it might be a defence to a
Gold Mine they had near. We went also to fight the
hundred Men, which the Greek told us lay in wait
for thirty of our <hi>Free Booters</hi> that were to pass into the
North Sea.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>11th.</hi> we arrived at the mouth of the
River <hi>Boca del Chica:</hi> We lay at Anchor there till
Midnight, when we weighed, and as the Sea swell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
we suffered our selves to be carryed up the River
at the pleasure of the Current. About two in the
Morning our Guide still believing we were far
from the place whither he was conducting us, made
us put on apace, which did us great harm, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of going to surprize others, we were surprized
our selves; For about a quarter of an hour after,
we saw Fire, but there was no going back now, for the
River made a Bow, from whence the rapidness of
the Tide coming in, threw us in spight of our Teeth
upon these Fires, which we came quickly to know
were kindled by those hundred Men we were in quest
of, for they presently asked us from whence our
Canoes were bound, and being answered by our
Guide pursuant to our Order from <hi>Panama,</hi> they
asked again who was the Commander, and we
being long in pitching upon a <hi>Spanish</hi> Name, they
gave us a full Volley: But two Petereroe-shot
which we made at them, having forced them to
quit their Ground, we passed on, and Anchored out
of the reach of their Arms, to wait for the ebb of
tide, that we might get out again, for as we could
find no place to go ashoar above them, for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
was full of Marthes, except at the place where
they were, we resolved to take them lower down,
and so an hour before day light we went back be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:65235:45"/>
their Entrenchment, after we had put all our
Men under Deck, and fired four Peterero-shots,
wherewith we saluted them so opportunely, that we
wounded them a great many Men, and they made no
great firing upon us.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>12th.</hi>

ashoar with an intention to attack the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from
behind their Intrenchments, which commanded the
River only; But they presently sent out their <hi>Pirogu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi>
to take ours, which made us expeditiously return on
board our Vessels to defend them and to alter the
manner of our attack, by resolving to go to them
before their Court of Guard, at the Foot whereof
we went ashoar in spight of all the fire they made
upon us, which lasted not long: For our Petereroe and
Musket-shot killed them a great many Men, which
made them quickly fly and leave us their Intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where we found a great many Dead and
Wounded Men, and took some Prisoners, among
whom there was one named <hi>Alfier.</hi> He was an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi>
who out of a blind Zeal he had for the Interests
of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> took us for them as we were going
on board our Canoes, and reproached us highly, but
we quickly disabused my Gentleman, letting the
Traytor know, to whom we had before been so
kind in our passage by the same River, that we were
become his Enemies since he was become ours, and
then put him out of a condition ever to serve the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> or to injure us.</p>
            <p>Those whom we took Prisoners, informed
us that we were discover'd at the New Town
<hi>La Terrible,</hi> and confirmed the account we had
before of the Massacre of the three parties alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
mentioned, as well those who would have
gone to the South-Seas, as the other who were min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to return by the way of that River to the North.
Within this Entrenchment we found a Letter writ by

            <p>Here it may be said that the Prisoners whom we
took, were highly useful to us, as well by giving us
means to subsist in these parts, as to deliver us from a
great many 'Ambushes and Dangers, whereinto had it
not been for them, we must have fallen; witness this
same, where the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would have spared our thirty
Men the pains of going to the North-Sea: At last
when we had burnt their Court of Guard, we took
their <hi>Pirogue</hi> with some pounds of Gold-dust we
found there, and then went down the River: As for
those three <hi>Indians</hi> whom we took in the Boat,
we sent them to tell their Comrades, that we
had killed him who was with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but
that we had given them quarter, because they were
not amongst them, and this we did to endeavour to
make them kind to us, and so disunite and separate
them from the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being got down on the <hi>13th.</hi> at Noon to the mouth
of the River, we met with one of our Barks, whom
we had ordered to come and attend us thither. Those
within her told us, that while they waited there,
two <hi>Indian Pirogues</hi> being deceived with the sight
of three or four <hi>Spanish</hi> Prisoners whom they had
put upon the Deck for that purpose, came of their
own accord and delivered themselves up into their
Hands, with some Pounds of Gold they had found
there; and that one of those <hi>Indians</hi> who bore
great sway amongst his own Nation, had a Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the President of <hi>Panama,</hi> to arm several
<hi>Pirogues,</hi> and to make War upon us: We weigh'd

               </gap> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes,
which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had hid thereabouts, they
made use of them to get off, and to go to <hi>Panama</hi> to
inform the Governor of the course we were to take,
and that the Ships we had left there were but
weakly manned, which induced the President to send
some force to attack them: But God was pleased
so to order it, that we were returned with them to
the rest of our Company.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>20th.</hi> we made ready to go to cruise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Tavoga,</hi> and that Evening anchored before the
Port of <hi>Panama,</hi> in order to learn some News: We
saw two Ships in the Road, whither the Town Canoes
went and came all along without Intermission; but
not dreaming they armed them against us, we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored
on the <hi>21st.</hi> at <hi>Tavoga.</hi>

            <p>On the <hi>21st.</hi> by break of day,<note place="margin">They took two Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Ships</note> we descry'd three
Sail just upon us, which we could not discover be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
because of one of the Points of the Island,
which kept them out of our Sight, insomuch that one
of our Ships that had not time to weigh Anchor,
slipped her Cable. As soon as they saw us make rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
they gave us some Guns, and as they had the

               </gap>ge, they did not spare to make use of the

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> they had over us. We made five racks to
get to Windward of them, and they could not hinder
us, but they lost the wind for want of Resolution, not
daring to pass between the Island of <hi>Tavaguilla</hi> and
a Rock, where there was indeed passage for no
more than one Ship, but we ventured it, and
at last got the Weather-gage: We fought them till
Noon, and knew not on which side the advantage
lay, and though they plyed our Decks very close, we
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65235:46"/>
still persisted to keep them clear of them, which was
the occasion that they lost a grand opportunity of
mending their tackling. We threw a great many
Granadoes into their biggest Ship, one of which had
so good an effect, as to set fire to some loose Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
they had, which burnt a great many Men, and
this brought the Fight to end sooner then otherwise
could have been expected: For we came up at
the same time with the said Ship now all on Fire,
and boldly boarded her, where notwithstanding
the vigorous resistance they made from the Stern,
whither they had all retired, we at last forced them
to beg for quarter, and made our selves master of the
Ship: At the same time one of our Barks boarded
one of theirs, and took it: The third that was a
kind of a Galley, who staid to the last, before she
began to make her escape, as trusting to her good
Sailing, soeing her self now pursued by our Galley,
and two <hi>Pirogues,</hi> ran her self ashoar, where she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
staved to pieces, and but very few of her crew
were saved.</p>
            <p>They had in their little Frigat fourscore Men killed
and wounded, out of an hundred and twenty that were
on Board: As for the Bark there were no more out
of seventy, then eighteen unhurt: Neither could we
see above ten or a dozen in all that swam ashoar
from the other Vessel that was staved: All their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
were either killed or wounded, and among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
the Captain, who received five Musquet-shot.
He was the same Person that fought so stoutly at <hi>Pue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blo
Nuevo,</hi> where he had received five more, and that
had also laid an Ambuscade for us at <hi>La Villia:</hi> But
this last engagement rid us of him, for he dyed some
time after.</p>
            <p>While we were busie in mending the rigging of
those Ships we had taken, and throwing the Dead
over-board we discovered two Sail more come from
<hi>Panama,</hi> which bore up towards us, whereupon we
interrogated our Prisoners, in order to know what
they should be: They said they did not question but
this was the relief they sent them: At the same time
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65235:47"/>
we bethought our selves of a stratagem to amuse and
make them believe we were taken, which was by
putting up <hi>Spanish</hi> Colours in our own Ships and in
the Prizes, with <hi>English</hi> and <hi>French</hi> ones under them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
As soon as these two Ships approached, they came up
to our Ship, who received them quite after another
manner then they expected:<note place="margin">They decoy two <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> Ships more.</note> Being thus surprized, they
fired upon us with precipitation, and made off towards
the little Frigat which they supposed still to be
theirs, who calling to them to lye by, and the others
not doing it, they threw some Granadoes into one
of their Barks, which sent her to the bottom, while
one of our <hi>Pirogues</hi> boarded the other, wherein they
found four packs of Cords, but all of the same length,
which they had made ready to eye us up with: But
they reckoned their Chickens before they were well
hatched, and these Ropes was the occasion that no
quarter was given to those in the Bark, where they
were found: We afterwards read the Commission of
the Captain of the little Frigat, which imported he
should chase us as far as St. <hi>Iohns Island,</hi> and that
when they boarded us, they should spare none they
found upon Deck, but only our Chirurgions whom
they were willing to save; and that Troops of Horse
should march along the shoar to take care that none
of us made our escape to land in any Canoe.</p>
            <p>On the 23d. as we sailed away to go Anchor at
<hi>Tavoga,</hi> we discovered another Sail going back to
<hi>Panama,</hi> whom we chased and took: She was a
Shalloop whom the President had sent to fetch off
our Anchor, which we had not time to hale<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> up the
day before, which he came to know by the means
of a Canoe, who passing that way, saw the Buoy.
But for all the fatigues we had undergone in these
Adventures we could not but scoff and laugh at the
President, who had sent us Ropes to hang his Men,
and also sent away to take this Anchor, wherewith to
Anchor our Ship in his Port, which he believed his
Men would bring in: We anchored this Evening at
<hi>Tavoga.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:65235:47"/>
We had but one Man killed in all the Fight,
but there were twenty of us wounded, among whom
was Captain <hi>Townsley,</hi> who dyed most of them of
their Wounds: On the <hi>24th.</hi> one of our Men dyed,
and the same Evening we sent one of our Prisoners
to the President of <hi>Panama</hi> to carry him a Letter,
wherein we required his giving up the five <hi>Free-Booters</hi>
who were his Prisoners, and to send us some
Medicines for (as we said) the use of his own People,
(though in truth it was for our own) we also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
heavily of the little quarter they had given
to the three parties whereof I have spoken, whom
they had inhumanly Massacred. He sent to us that
Night the Commander of <hi>Seppa,</hi> who spoke a little

We ordered the said Officer to carry him our
answer by word of Mouth, that if they would not
send us our Prisoners, we would send them the Heads
of all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in our Possession. On the 25th.
we weighed Anchor, and sailed away, for fear they
should for an Answer, send a Fireship, as they had
done by the <hi>English</hi> two Years before, and burn us:
On the <hi>26th.</hi> in the Morning we Anchored at the
Isles of <hi>Pericos,</hi> that are not above a League distant
from <hi>Panama.</hi> Towards Noon we discovered a Ship
under Sail, and sent out our Galley to know what
she was; It was our own long Bark that was come
from Careening, wherein were sixty Men that were
not present in the Fight. This day two of our woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

confirmed us in the account we had of the Massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cring
of the three fore-mentioned Parties in the River
of <hi>Boca del Chica,</hi> whereof they themselves were Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witnesses.
About twelve a Clock of the same day,
which was the 28th. we weighed, and anchored again at
<hi>Tavoga</hi> to take in Water: And whilst Matters were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
on between the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and us in respect to the
ransoming of their people, we required they should come
to a Treaty with us, which they consented to, and sent
us daily divers Canoes full of Merchandize and other
Refreshments, all which we had Dog-cheap of them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
Meal, Bisket, Meat, and other Provisions which
they Kept back, the reason whereof might be easily gues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

On the <hi>29th.</hi> their Messenger returned, who gave us
an account that he had been about the City to get the
Ransom, and that they had not got above six thousand
pieces of Eight together, but as we were eager to be
gone, we told them they must send us ten thousand pieces
of Eight, or else we would go into the City to fetch them
the effect of this blustering was, that on the first of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi>
came a Canoe to tell us, that a Bark would bring
us next day the Summ we demanded; and on the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi>

               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:65235:50"/>
The same day at Noon Captain <hi>Townsley</hi> dyed of his
Wounds: We threw his Body into the Sea according
to his defire, with such Ceremonies as are usual upon
these occasions: On the tenth we weighed and came to
an Anchor at <hi>Kings-Islands,</hi> and two days after, dyed
one of our wounded Men. On the Seventeenth we put
out with the little Frigat and long Bark, to sail to the port
of <hi>Panama,</hi> to see whether they had any Ships there that
might come to insult us, while our Vessels were a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reening:
We had a North-West-Wind, so that we could
not reach the Isles of <hi>Pericos</hi> before the tenth, when we
found our selves under the forts of that Town. We
furled our low Sails, and as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> saw us
bring to, they gave us three Guns, after they put up
<hi>Burgundian</hi> Colours upon the Windward Bastion: But
when we understood there was no Ship in that place,
whereof we might be afraid, we went out a Cruising
between <hi>Tavoga</hi> and <hi>Sippilla,</hi> we being resolved to
watch those two Ships that were to come from <hi>Lima,</hi>
and in the mean time we sent one of our <hi>Pirogues</hi> to bid
our Men careen the Vessels with all Expedition, and
that they need fear no danger from <hi>Panama.</hi> We had
very bad Weather in this Channel; It blew round all
the points of the Compass, with such violent Whirlwinds,
that the Sea grew very boisterous: But on the <hi>28th.</hi> the
Weather proving more moderate, we discovered a Ship
sailing all along the Coast of the main Land, after which
we sent two <hi>Pirogues</hi> in chase: She would have entred
into the Port of <hi>Panama,</hi> but they firing upon her from
the Fort, as believing she was one of our Ships, she pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by, and our <hi>Pirogues</hi> took her: She came from <hi>Nato,</hi>
and was laden with Provisions and Sugars, which she
was carrying to our Enemies, who had the Charity to
put her back to us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:65235:51"/>
On the Eleventh, being not able to see any thing of
what we waited for, we failed for the <hi>King's Islands,</hi>
and as the Moon shone bright, we found the Currents
very strong there also, which obliged us to anchor in
the Channel, with all the Tides contrary to us, from
twenty to forty fathom Water: We arrived on the 16<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
at the Island where our Ships were careening, and found
them all ready done.</p>
            <p>The Sea round about these <hi>Kings Islands</hi> whereof I
have spoken so much, is full of a great many very large
Whales, who are infested by a Fish they call <hi>Espad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

that assaults them continually with a kind of Fish-bone,
like unto a Sabre, fastened to their Heads, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

makes those monstrous Animals to give such Leapt
and Rebounds, that they raise themselves continually abovt
the Water: But to return from a great Fish to a small
one, I shall say, that besides <hi>Pearl-Oysters,</hi> which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
to be found in those parts in great numbers, there are
also others that are exceeding good, and so large, that
they are forced to cut them into four parts to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:65235:51"/>
We departed on the 18th. and sailed for those Islands
that are in the Main, where we came to an Anchor on
the Nineteenth in the Morning, and on the Twentieth
put out with our Galley and two Pirogues to go to a
Sugar Plantation which stands two Leagues to Leeward
of <hi>panarna,</hi> giving Orders at the same time to our Ships to
come and Anchor there Three Days after us. We pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
our selves of the said Plantation, and seized all the
People belonging thereto, who told us there was a Courier
come from <hi>Chiriquita</hi> to <hi>Panama,</hi> who reported he had
seen Two Ships, and as many Barks, belonging to the
Freebooters, Anchor at the Port of that Town, who
came for Provision there, wherewith we were somewhat

to get into the Town, before they had time to make
themselves ready: But our Guide having lead us out of

who no sooner saw us, but they made all the hast they
could to get away, yet we fired upon them presently,
which dismounted three of them and one we took Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner,

from <hi>la Villia,</hi> and that we were gone out of our way,
that all the People there were at their Arms, and that
they had had a Reinforcement of Six hundred Men
sent them from <hi>Panama.</hi> Upon this information we

that so we lost all our Labour. Before we went on

steered South South-East, as near the Wind as we could
till the Sixth, that we were brought back to the Shoar;
about the middle of the following Night, we discovered
a Vessel under sail and joyned her: It was the Bark we
had sent to <hi>Chiriquita,</hi> who meeting with very bad Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
was constrained to put back under the <hi>Morn</hi> or
Cape of <hi>Puercos:</hi> On the Seventh being not able to
double the <hi>Morn</hi> because of the contrary West Winds,
we sent our Galley to <hi>Chiriquita,</hi> instead of our Bark;
we could not double the <hi>Morn</hi> before the Twelfth:
and we had a blast of Wind in the Night that in it self
was favourable enough for our Course, but the Currents
carried us so to Leeward, that we were still on the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Six Leagues to Leeward of the <hi>Morn.</hi> We
steered West North-West, bearing upon the <hi>Isle of Tygers,</hi>
the which stands Six Leagues North and South from the
Continent, between the River of St. <hi>Iames</hi> and this
<hi>Morn</hi> or Cape of <hi>Puercos:</hi> on the Fourteenth at Night
we were apprehensive least we should be drove too
near the Shoar.</p>
            <p>On the 16th. we arrived at St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Island, where we
met with our Galley returned from <hi>Chiriquita,</hi> having
found nothing of what she sought for in that Place,
which still increased the Suspition we had already enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
that the President of <hi>Panama</hi> had caused a false
Report to be spread abroad, that some Freebooters had
been there, that so he might get us to quit his Port, and
make way by our absence for those Ships that were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from <hi>Peru,</hi> to enter into <hi>Panama,</hi> and this so
much the more heightened our Courage, in that we came
to understand one Day after another the cowardize and
dastardly Nature of this proud Nation, who with her
Three Deckt Ships mounted each of them with Eighteen
pieces of Cannon, and having Four hundred Men on
Board, were afraid of pitiful Barks, who had but
Four Guns and some Petereroes in all, with which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we waited for them.</p>
            <p>On the Eighteenth we brought our Galleys and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes
a Shoar in order to clean them; two Days after we
departed with an intention to take some Prisoners, from
whom we might obtain certain Intelligence of the Truth
or Falshood of any Freebooters having been at <hi>Chiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quita,</hi>
for they might have been gone before we had sent
thither, and upon our departure we appointed our Ships
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:65235:53"/>
to Rendezvous at the Isle of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> there to tarry till
we returned. On the Morning of the 24th. we went a
Shoar, Two Leagues to Leeward of the River <hi>Pueblo
Nuevo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>booters take St. <hi>Lorenzo.</hi>
               </note> where, after we had travelled till about Four in
the Afternoon to discover some Houses, we saw Two
Horsemen, one of whom we dismounted but he made his
Escape, and took the other, of whom we asked where we
were; And being informed that there was about half a
League from thence to a Burrough called St. <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> we
went that way and arrived there in the Twilight: Here
we took a great many Prisoners, who told us they had
heard of no Freebooters from the time we had taken
<hi>Chiriquita,</hi> which now fully confirmed us in a belief of
the Amusement the President of <hi>Panama</hi> had entertained
us with: on the 26th. we returned to the Sea-side with
our Prisoners, and discovered our Ships that were sailing
to the Place of Rendezvous, to whom we sent a Canoe to
give them Notice to come and Anchor at an Island
which is over-against, and Three quarters of a League di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant

adjacent, as for the course and disposition of the Rivers,
wherewith it is watered.</p>
            <p>On the 26th. in the Evening, we went on Board our
Ships with our Prisoners, and agreed with them upon
what quantity of Provision they were to give us for
their Ransom; on the 27th. we sent the <hi>Father</hi> or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

of the Ships and Artillery we had taken, as being
desirous to be in a Ship by themselves, which was
presently done: On the First of <hi>December,</hi> we sent a
Canoe to the Continent, and the Men that were in her
told us, they had seen a Troop of Horse who threatned
them at a distance with their Cutlasses, which made us
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65235:53"/>
at Night to the number of a Hundred Men go a Shoar
to see them: on the Second we waited for them in their
Town of St. <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> but no body appearing, we
burnt it. As soon as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> saw the Fire, the
Commander of the Place came to offer us a Summ of
Money for the Ransom of the Prisoners, which we refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
because we had much more need of Provision: We
told them if they did not send us the same, pursuant to
the Agreement we had already made with their People,
they should have no more to do than to send for their
Heads away from the Island. In the said Commander's
House we found the following Letter writ by the Teni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
of <hi>Chiriquita.</hi>

            <floatingText type="letter">

which I could get together:<note place="margin">The Teni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of <hi>Chiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quita</hi>'s Letter, to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of St. <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo</hi>

take one or other of the Enemy, to the end we may
know what they design to do, about which our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
are mightily concerned: Order the Cattle, to be
drove away from the Sea-side, and put them into a
Place fit to lay an Ambuscade, to the end that the
Enemy severing from one another according to their
usual manner in order to kill them; It may be so
much the more easie for you to secure some one of
them: But if you cannot do that, lay an Ambuscade
at a Place where you think they will put our Prisoners
a Shoar, and let them shew you those Persons whom
they have observed to be most respected on Ship Board;
so that if God gives us the Advantage over them, do
not you cut them off, but send them to me; especially
interrogate the Women, that you may know whether
they have met with some weak Fellow that hath made
any Discovery unto them.</p>

            <p>This Letter made us keep more upon our Guard than
otherwise we would have done, and we returned on Board
our Ships that Evening: On the Third we went in a
Canoe a Shoar, to see whether they had brought the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
agreed upon for the Ransom of their People, but
instead of that we saw them busie in raising an Entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:65235:54"/>
near the Place where they expected we should
make our Descent, which gave us to understand they
pursued the Orders prescribed to them by the foresaid
Letter. On the Fourth, we put those Prisoners ashoar
upon the Island where we had anchored, and left them
there, without any further expecting of their Ransom,
that so we might secure our selves against that Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buscade
whereunto we must have fallen, had we sent
them to the same Place where we took them.</p>
            <p>In the Evening we weighed and sailed for the Bay of
<hi>Boca del Toro,</hi> with an Easterly Breeze that put us for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
on the Fifth we doubled the Point of <hi>Porica,</hi>
which is Ten Leagues to Leeward of that Bay; at the
height whereof we were becalmed till the Tenth; when
towards Evening a small Wind blowing from the Sea
arose,<note place="margin">The <hi>Buca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers</hi> in great danger of being Ship-wracked.</note> which brought us to the Mouth of the Bay: But
the same was followed by so Terrible a Tempest, that
our Ship lay for an Hour in such a manner that she was
under Water as far as her great Scuttle; and what ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
us was, that our Ropes, Sheets, and Clulings, were cut
so cleverly as if the same had been done with an Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet:
However, this tearing of our Rigging served us in
good stead, for had it not been for that, we had quickly
gone to be Meat for Fishes: for our Sails being held by
no other than the Wind and Arms alone, the Sails, Yards,
yet stretched themselves out along the Masts, and our
Ship by little and little happily recovered her self: The
Wind was allay'd in the Dusk of the Evening by a great
deal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that fell, wherewith we were becalmed;
and on the Eleventh we had a Southerly Wind, which
brought us to an Anchor in the Bottom of the Bay.</p>
            <p>The Mouth of this Bay of <hi>Boca del Toro,</hi> is about Four
or Five Leagues in extent from one Point to another,
and Eight in depth. If you would enter into it with
safety, you must keep the Whip of your Rudder to
Starboard, because 'tis dangerous to keep to the East
side. Here is good Anchorage every where, and also a
Covert; one may anchor in the bottom of the Bay,
within Pistol shot of Land.</p>
            <p>There are Four Islands contained in it, that stand very
near unto the main Land to the East and North-East,
but it is not safe to lie near them, because of the many
Rocks that are there. Several Fine Rivers discharge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into it, and lead us up them to diverse <hi>Indian</hi> Carbets,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65235:54"/>
who have neither Peace nor are in amity with any Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
whatsoever, no more than those whom I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
when I spoke of Cape <hi>la Vella</hi> and <hi>Boca del Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go;</hi>
which yet does not hinder the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
their Caravans through the midst of their Country,
when they come from <hi>Costa Rica</hi> to <hi>Panama:</hi> But then
they must be very well guarded; and the great Road
through which they pass, is not above Six Leagues from
the Sea-side.</p>
            <p>On the Twelfth we went to find out Trees fit both to
make Canoes of for carrying our Water, and Canoes of
War: on the 25th. being <hi>Christmas</hi>-Day after we had,
according to Custom, said our Prayers in the Night, one
of our Quarter-Masters being gone a Shoar, in order to
take care about our eating some Victuals, (for our Ships
being a careening, all our Provisions were then put out)
one of our Prisoners, who served us as Cook, stabbed him
with a Knife in Six several places, wherewith crying out
he was presently relieved, and the Assassine punished
with Death.</p>

in 1687.</head>
            <p>ON the First of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> 1687. our Canoes being
ready, we left this Bay and failed for that of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daira,</hi>
that we might victual there, and make an end of
careening our Ships: we left them there on the Second,
after we had given Orders to those who had the charge
of them, to come and joyn us in the Bay, and we embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Two hundred Men in our Canoes, to crossover to
<hi>la Cagna,</hi> which is a small Island very inconvenient to
draw near to, and stands about a League North and
South from the main Land, between <hi>Boca del Toro</hi> and
<hi>Caldaira.</hi> We were six days in our passage before we could
get thither, having only put forward in the Night for
fear of being discovered: Being come on the Sixth at
Night into the Bay, our Guide made us put in under a
Covert, and told us that to prevent our being discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65235:55"/>
we should go a Shoar in that Place,<note place="margin">A pretty adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>booters.</note> which we had
no sooner done, but we were conducted into a Marish,
in the sou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dest places whereof we sunk in the Mud to
the very Middle, insomuch that Five of our Men of
whom we could see no more than their Heads, did not
give us a small trouble to pull them out with Cords we
made fast to Mangles, which are Trees of that Name
growing in this Marish: So that not knowing how we
should be able to free our selves from this wretched
Place, we lifted up our Guide to the top of a Tree, to
endeavour by the help of Moon-light to discover how
far we might be from sound Land: But he finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
now at liberty, skipped like a Monkey from Tree to
Tree, and railed all the while at us, who could neither
see him nor do any more that threaten him, which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he little mattered. We spent the rest of the Night
in making about an Hundred steps in this sweet Place,
where we exactly went the Rounds, and from whence
we could not come out till break of Day, and not then
neither, without being bedaubed all over from top to
toe, and having our Arms laden with Mud. When we
were in a Condition to reflect a little upon our selves,
and that we saw Two hundred Men in the same Habit,
and so curiously equipped, there was not one of us who
forgot not his Toyle, to laugh at the posture he found
both himself and the rest in. At length, after having
inveighed against our Guide who had so cunningly saved
himself, when he saw us stuck fast in the Mire, we went
into our Canoes again, where we cleaned our selves as
well as we could, as we did also our Arms, and after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
left our Covert we met with a very pretty River,
whereinto we entered and went up it about Two
Leagues, where we landed at an Entrenchment. There
we found the remains of the Two Ships which the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> had burnt, when an <hi>English</hi> Freebooter, whose
Name was <hi>Betsharp,</hi> came to careen in this Bay, which
made us suppose,<note place="margin">They take <hi>Sancta Catalina,</hi> the Town of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coya,</hi> and a good Booty.</note> according to the Relation that had
been given us concerning it, that it was the Embarking
Place belonging to <hi>Nicoya.</hi> We followed the Road we
found there, and marching about Two Leagues, at the
end of them we entered, by the help of the barking of
the Dogs, into a Burrough called <hi>Sancta Catalina,</hi> where
we took all the Inhabitants Prisoners. Now as we were
informed by them there, that there was no more than
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65235:55"/>
three Leagues to <hi>Nicoya,</hi> we mounted sixty Men on
Horseback, in order to go thither; but we met half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with two Horsemen, whom we could not reach,
and who returning back with full Speed, gave the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
notice of our March towards them, in so much
that by the time we were got thither, they had already
hid all their Effects, and were expecting our coming
upon the Place of Arms, from whence we drove them,
after we had sustained their first discharge, with which
they neither killed nor wounded one of our Men. While
we were gathering what Provision we could together,
we sent out small Parties into the Neighbouring Places,
who brought us some Money, and among other things,
the Governour's Plate, and all his Moveables.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>8th.</hi> we left the Town, and went to rejoyn
our People at <hi>Sancta Catalina,</hi> where we staid the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder

Enemy's Sentinels thither, one of whom we killed; for
they, not knowing we were in the Town, were come
to give the <hi>Spaniards</hi> notice that they saw three Sail of
Ships enter into the Bay, and that they were Enemies;
but this Intelligence came too late. On the <hi>9th.</hi> we left
this Place to go joyn our Canoes again, on which being
embarked, we left one of our Prisoners ashoar to go
and raise the Ransom of those we carryed along with
us; and on the <hi>10th.</hi> we got on board our Ships that

                  <p>THis Letter is to let you know of the taking of
our dear Town of <hi>Granada</hi> by Pirates on the
Tenth of the last Month:<note place="margin">The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Costa Rica</hi> his Letter to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident of <hi>Panama.</hi>
                     </note> They came ashoar at a
Place where we had no Sentinels, we supposing there
was no occasion for it, because the Sea is so high there;
they passed on cross a Wood like so many Wild Beasts:
We had the good Fortune to have notice of it by our
Fishermen, tho' we were already upon our Guard
ever since the News we had concerning them from
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:65235:56"/>
                     <hi>Lesparso</hi> and <hi>Nicoya.</hi> They lay on the Ninth at the
fine House of Don <hi>Diego Ravalo,</hi> Knight of St. <hi>Iames,</hi>
we were very well prepared to receive them; but the
way of Fighting practised by these Men did so much
astonish ours, that we could not make that Resistance
we had promised our selves we should do: They fell
on briskly, singing and dancing, as if they had been
going to a Feast; at length, after we had been fought
bravely by them, they won the place of Arms, with
the loss of Thirty of their Men, according to the
Estimate of Don <hi>Antonio de Fortuna,</hi> a Person of
good Experience in War, who came to us some Months
before. We are also of Opinion that they have lost
their General, for we saw a Man, that distinguished
himself from the rest by his Habit, fall.</p>
                  <p>After they had staid for the space of four Days in
our Fort, they sent to require us to Ransom the Town
and Prisoners they had taken; but we being not very
forward to return an Answer to their Proposal, they
burnt it, and went their ways: Seignior Don <hi>Iohn de
Castilla,</hi> Sergeant-Major, went out to observe them
with his Men; but not knowing they took away our
Artillery, he attacked these Enemies of God and
Goodness about a Mile from the Town; but they
being resolved to make their way through, or to die
upon the spot, slew so great a Number of his Men,
that the rest fled, and left their Commanders alone.</p>
                  <p>We have taken one of their Men, who told us,
they came to our Province upon no other Design,
than to know the strength of it, tho' it's not to be
doubted, if they had found our Vessels at Anchor,
but they would have made use of them to pass, by
the way of our Lake, to the North Sea, and have
abandoned their Comrades, who looked after their
Ships, and their way would have been infallibly by
<hi>Carthage.</hi> Monsieur the Governour takes his Measures
thereupon, and continues to Fortifie his Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
I shall give you a more ample Account of
this Business by the first Caravan.</p>

Belo.</hi> The King of <hi>France</hi> supposing he had received
some Affront from our Nation, sent Eight Sail of
ill sorts before <hi>Calix,</hi> to demand Contribution; and
seeing there was so vast an inequality of Force upon
this Occasion, we agreed to give him half a Million,
to withdraw his Ships, and return to their Ports.</p>
                  <p>You know that my Lord Bishop on the <hi>22d.</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust</hi>
forced me to send out three Ships to fight the
Pirates, that continued still before our Port, and took
all the Barks and Canoes that were coming in. Our
Ships surprized them at break of Day, which made
one of the Pirates slip his Cable, and this was done,
not for to fly away; but through the Skill of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander.
I saw the Fight from my Ramparts, the
Honour whereof I thought infallibly to have apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
unto us. Having seen them draw near the
Shoar, I Sent a Chaloop to bring away the Anchor of
that Vessel that had slipped her Cable, in order to
fasten her in our Port. As soon as ever I saw them
ungrappled, I dispatched away two long Barks or
Galleys to go and learn the News, and to bring those
of the Enemy that survived before me, tho' my Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
were, that no Quarter should be given to any
that were found upon Deck, to the end we might rid
the World of these Enemies of God and his Saints,
who Profane his Churches, and destroy his Servants.
In the Evening they sent one of our Men to require
me to give up five Men of theirs, that I had Prisoners
in my Town, and as my Prince forbad me to do so,
I refused it; but these new <hi>Turks</hi> sent me Twenty
Heads, and I bethought my self, that for the prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the slaughter of so many Christians, I ought
to send them their Men, with Ten Thousand Pieces
of Eight, for the Ransom of Ninety of our People,
that were almost all wounded, which they sent us out
of Three Hundred and Thirty they had taken with
them. Thus you see how God is pleased to afflict us
on all sides, let us take all for the sake of his Suffering
for us.</p>

We had no need of that, for where-ever these Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Wretches set their Feet on Land, they always
win the Victory. If you please, let them have free
Passage, that we may be at rest; they came ten or

would not have us be impatient, if we received not the
same as soon as we desired it, because they having no
Canoes, whereby to send the Money to us by Sea, which
might have been done in half a day's time (the Passaage
was so short that way) had been obliged to have it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
on Mules backs by Land, which was four days Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
When we had received this Answer, we sent again
to tell him, that our Intention was to have been gone

we went our ways on the seventeenth.</p>

Sea-Side, over-against the Place where our Vessels lay at
Anchor, and brought us the Ransom they had promised
for the Prisoners, whom we sent ashoar at the same

us know when his Reinforcement came, we should not
fail to attend him, and that in the mean time, if he did
not send us so many Horse-load of Biscuit and Maes as

might assure himself we should go and burn it.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>20th.</hi> we weighed Anchor, and went to one
of the Islands in this Bay to careen our Vessels. On the

with our Ships than were necessary to Careen them, and
sought out some Hatto's, where we might get necessary
Subsistance, to the end we might lay by, and keep in

of an Enterprize we had formed upon the Town of

            <p>On the <hi>23d.</hi> we had the Curiosity, or rather Humour
to pursue the first Road that offered it self to our view

upon our Flank, and in our Rear: A <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who was
advanced before the rest, made a thousand Mouths at
us, and reviled us as much, which gave us an occasion
to hide five of our Men, that were behind the rest, in
the Grass, that was exceeding high upon both sides of
the way, and leave our main Body to march on; so that
when our <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who still followed our People, went
to pass forwards, he was quickly dismounted, and we made
him make a Grimace in good earnest: We questioned
him according to our usual Ceremony, that is to say,
by putting him on the Rack, about the place where we
were: He told us, we were on the High-way of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage,</hi>
and that all Places were quite forsaken from thence
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:65235:58"/>
to this Town, which was no less than Seven and Twenty
Leagues, out of an Apprehension his Country had, left
we should go and force them to grant us Passage to the
North Sea, as their chief Officers had caused it to be
reported among them. He also gave us Information,
that they had Four Hundred Men making their Rounds,
whereof the Two Hundred we saw, were of that Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
being detatch'd to observe the time of our Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that so they might retire to a strong Retrenchment
they had six Leagues on this side the Town, for to beat
us back in case we made that way. Being thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admonished,
we thought it not convenient to go any
further, our Design being no other then, than to know
the Country, and to get us some Victuals; so we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>Lesparso,</hi> and on the <hi>24th.</hi> rejoyned our
Canoes.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>26th.</hi> we went ashoar, under the Guidance
of our new Prisoner, who brought us to a Sugar Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
where we divided into two Companies to go to
two Hatto's, and took all the People we could meet
with there, who informed us, that several other Hatlo's
and Sugar Plantations in the Neighbourhood, had all<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>together
set out Two Hundred armed Men, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
gone in the Evening to beat back the Crew of three of
the Enemy's Canoes, that had landed at <hi>Colebra,</hi> where
they had killed and wounded divers <hi>Spaniards,</hi> We
presently imagined it must have been Captain <hi>Grognist</hi>
that was come up that Coast, and therein we were not
mistaken; we immediately returned back to the Sea-side,
to go with our Canoes to meet him, and in our
way heard the noise of several Cannon-shot and small
Arms, towards the Place where we had left our Ship-Careening,
which made us double our Pace, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imbark
in our Canoes.</p>
            <p>As soon as we were got on Board our Ships,<note place="margin">Captain <hi>Grogniet</hi> rejoyns the other Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>booters.</note> we found
Captain <hi>Grogniet</hi> with three Canoes there, who with his
Crew had been conducted to the said Place by one of
our Canoes, whom they had fortunately met in crossing
this Bay; and the Firing we had heard, was made by
the one and the other for Joy of their meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Grogniet</hi> told us,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Grog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niet</hi>'s Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures.</note> that he came up this Coast with an
Intention to find out an uninhabited Place, to the end
he might Land without Opposition, and to fetch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

compass cross the Country, to get the North Sea.
We laid the Danger whereunto he must necessarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
so small a Number of Men before him, (they being
no more than Sixty in all) that if he were resolved to
undertake so dangerous an Enterprize, it were better he
would stay with us until we found a favourable Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to repass together to that Sea, as being better able
conjoyntly to surmount those Difficulties which we
might be exposed to thereby. Being overcome with our
Reasons, he staid with us; and after we had given him
an Account of the Adventures we had had since our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
from him, he also in his turn entertained us
with a recital of his, and told us, he had made several
Descents in the Bay of <hi>Napalla</hi> with various Success, and
that among other things in one of those Descents, the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> had taken three of his Men, who had been
exchanged some time after for other Prisoners: But
that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had so far corrupted those three Men
with the fine Promises they made them, while they
were in their Custody, that upon their Return, they
insinuated into their Comrades, in order to betray, they
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>sinuated into their Comrades, in order to betray them,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>design of going to a very considerable Gold Mine, which
was Fourteen Leagues off from the Sea-side, and as many
from <hi>Tinsigal,</hi> and that being pre-possess'd of making
their Fortunes there, they had left the Island where they
were, to the Number of an Hundred and Twelve Men,
and went ashoar upon the Continent, with an Intention
to go to that Mine, under the Guidance of the Prisoners,
who knew the way, and towards which they journyed
only in the Night-time, for fear of being discovered;
that those three Men who had been exchanged, and sold
their Friends to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> pretended they were
weary, and had occasion to rest, that so they might not
go with the rest; that for all this, they departed two
hours after, bringing to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who waited in
a convenient Place for them, all the Prisoners that were
ashoar in the said Bay, and after some time, carryed off
the Arms and Ammunition of all the rest of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
that staid behind upon the Island, who had no
mistrust of them, whereof they laded a Canoe; but
that the Treachery in the mean time had not had all
the projected effect, and that he and his Men got to the
Mine without Opposition, because the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who
had made all things ready for Massacring of them, when
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:65235:59"/>
going ashoar, got thither later than they should have
done, and that through the fault of our Renegadoes,
who had too much precipitated the departure of their
Comrades, whom they thus saved by pressing them on
to their ruin: That they had got no great Purchase at
the Mines, because there had been Orders given before
for saving their Treasure; tho after all, it was not above
an hour's space that they had got away Four Hundred
and Fifty Pounds of Gold, that was all ready prepared.
That yet they found some Pounds still left, and took
some Prisoners, who were surprized by them, as not
expeeting their Company so soon, and that they also
did believe they had been defeated by the way, as the
Design had been formed against them.</p>
            <p>That when they had staid two days at this Mine, and
being intent upon returning with his Men to the Sea-side,
he met with a Body of <hi>Spaniards</hi> on the way,
waiting his coming, and making a meen as if they
would now upon his Return, make amends for the fault
they had committed, in not preventing his Descent.
Their Commander sent a Trumpet to Captain <hi>Grogniet,</hi>
to know if he were minded to fight; who being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that he desired nothing more: The <hi>Spaniards</hi>
sent a second time to tell him, that if he would give up
his Prisoners, they would grant him free Passage; But
he boldly answered, That if they desired to have them,
they must come and fetch them by the help of their
Arms; and as for the Passage, he would open his way
through in spight of them. That having made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
ready, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had not the Courage to stay
for them, contenting themselves only with firing a few
Mosquets at a distance, and so fairly took to their
Heels, while he pursued his March towards his Canoes,
which had, as Good Luck would have it, been left in a
Place, where the Renegadoes could not shew them to the
Enemy.</p>
            <p>He told us moreover, that some time after his return
from that Mine, they had been at <hi>Pueblo Viego,</hi> by the
way of a River that runs not above four Leagues, and
discharges her self into the Bay of <hi>Napalla;</hi> that they
had surprized the Town, and that after having rested
there for some days, as they were coming back to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
their Canoes, they had met with an Ambuscade,
laid for them under the Covert of a Retrenchment,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65235:59"/>
guarded by Six Hundred Men out of the Garrison of
<hi>Realeguo,</hi> which began to be inhabited again, with whom
they had fought a long time: But finding the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
stood to it more tightly than ordinary, they threw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into their Retrenchment, where killing all about
them that made any resistance, they wrought a great
Slaughter amongst them; That one part of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Prisoners; while the other fled without any more
ado, and forsook their Retrenchment as well as the
three Colours they had set up there: That the <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

had lost no more than three Men, but that the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> in the heat of the Action killed several Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the one and the other Sex, which the other had
brought away from the Town, who after this went on
board their Vessels: That some Months after, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring

            <p>But though we were forced to chastise the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
in this manner, we shewed our selves very exact in the
Preservation of the Churches, into which we carried the
Pictures and Images of the Saints which we found in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Houses, that they might not be exposed to the rage
and burning of the <hi>English,</hi> who were not much pleased
with these sorts of Precautions; they being Men that
took more satisfaction and pleasure to see one Church
burnt, than all the Houses of <hi>America</hi> put together.
But as it was our turn now to be the stronger Party,
they durst do nothing that derogated from that respect
we bore to all those things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nicoya</hi> was a small Town,<note place="margin">A De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coya.</hi>

Its Churches are very fine, and the Houses as

one half of the Town round; but when one is
within, you cannot know which way it is you have
entered, nor how to go out, because of the height of the
Mountains wherewith it is surrounded every way.</p>
            <p>We were no sooner gone from this Town, but the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> sent to set Fire to the Roads through which
we were to pass, which yet we happily escaped, because
they had but just begun to do it: We took one of this
Men who was hemmed in between us and the Fire, and
who conducted us to several <hi>Estancia's,</hi> from which we

            <p>Some Men perhaps may be amazed at what I have

               </gap>
when the former were set on Fire, whose Grass was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
as high as our Heads, and also as dry in a manner

may see, according to the course of the Wind, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
for several Leagues burnt in a little time, to which
the dryness of things doth very much contribute,<note place="margin">They part from the <hi>English,</hi> and <hi>Grog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niet</hi> again.</note> the
Sun being exceeding hot at that Season.</p>
            <p>On the Twenty third we sent our Quarter-Master on
Board the <hi>English,</hi> to make an agreement with them:
we proposed to go in Conjunction with them to take
<hi>Queaquilla</hi> (where the <hi>Spaniards</hi> drove a great Trade by
<hi>Sea</hi>) upon Condition that if we took Two Ships, we
should cast Lots who should chose, and that in case there
were but one taken, that then we would put Fifty Men
of each Nation on board her, till such time as we could
take another, which they would not agree to, as insisting
upon the First choice: So that seeing we could not
bring them to comply, we parted as well from them as
from Captain <hi>Grogniet</hi> and Fifty of our Men who staid
on board him; so that they had an Hundred and forty
two Men in their Ship, and we an Hundred and Sixty
two in our Frigate, and long Bark.</p>
            <p>On the Twenty fourth we weighed and set fail for
<hi>Queaquilla,</hi> which is the First maritime Town on the
South Coast as you go thither from <hi>Panama;</hi> we made
all the sail we could to get thither before the <hi>English,</hi>
who had formed the same Design as we had done; we
lay by till the 25th. to get out of the Bay, and in
passing from the <hi>White Cape,</hi> we steered South South-West,
South and by South-West, and directly South to
the 28th. in the Evening, that we had on our Starboard
side a West North-West Wind, bearing us to the South,
which lasted till the 29th. when we were becalmed in the
Night: On the First of <hi>March</hi> towards Noon arose a
pretty fresh Gale from the North, which made us bear
South South-West, and South South-East, till the 4th.
in the Morning, when an Easterly Breeze took us and
made us bear South; on the Fifth arose a North-West
Wind; and on the Eighth at Noon we passed the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial
Line, leaving the Isles of <hi>Galapa,</hi> which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
to the West, a douzen Leagues to Leeward.</p>
            <p>These are Eight Islands that stand North and South of
the <hi>Whihe Cape,</hi> and East and West from <hi>Queaquilla;</hi>
they are full of Sea Tortoises that land there every Hour
of the Day, and you cannot find a Place to tread on or
walk along in the Woods, for the great numbers of land
Tortoises, Lizards, and Agoutils, that retire thither:
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:65235:61"/>
The Sea thereabouts is also so fruitful in the production
of Fish, that they come to the very Sands to die there,
but these advantages on the other hand are encountred
with the want of Water, whereof these Islands are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
destitute.</p>
            <p>The Wind towards Evening came to North North-East,
and made us bear East and by South-East to keep
to the Continent; the Weather on the Tenth in the
Morning grew very dark, and we having a Southerly
Blast, we bore East, and East and by South-East till
the Eleventh, when we were becalmed: on the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
arose an East Wind, and we bore to the South
South-East upon a tack, and North North-East, and
then lay by for some time, because we did not know the
Currents: On the 14th. having a North East Wind, we
bore East South-East, and accordingly as it blew fresh we
steered East and by South-East, and East: on the Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Two Hours before Day-light we had a Storm and
then a South Wind, we steered East all that Day, but
we had such bad Weather the following Night, that we
could not carry our Sails; next Day about Noon the
Weather grew better, and an Easterly Breeze presented;
we lay by till the Eighteenth at Noon, when we disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
a Ship to Windward of us, to whom we gave
chase till the Evening; she proved to be the <hi>English</hi>
Ship that had parted from us when we came out of the
Bay of <hi>Caldaira,</hi> who knowing who we were, put into
the Cape, we came to Leeward of her; but she spread
out her Sails and got to Leeward of us; after we had
given one another this salutation, we put out for Two
Hours to see which sailed best, but knowing at last
they were the better Sailors, and fearing they might
reach <hi>Queaquilla</hi> before us, we desired them to joyn
with us in our Design, to which when they agreed, we set
fail together; we found our selves much perplext to
know what Latitude we might be in, since we had not
seen the Sun for Ten Days together. But it happily fell
out, that it appeared on the Nineteenth; our Pilots
computed we might be about Five and twenty Leagues
to Windward of <hi>Queaquilla,</hi> and Sixty Leagues from
Land; but the Winds varied to that degree, that
we could make no way, and many times went contrary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>On the 20th. we had a West Wind, and steered East
and by South-East till the 21st, when we were becalmed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:65235:61"/>
On the 24th. arose a South Wind, and on the 26th. an
Easterly Breeze: at last the Wind persisting to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
we were reduced to great want of Victuals, for
we had already been upon our passage longer than our
Provision would allow us, to which we may add, that Fish
had till now been so scarce, and hard to catch, that we
had but little support from them: So that having on the
28th. taken an Accompt of the remainder of our Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alling,
we were forced to retrench our selves so far as to
eat but once in Forty eight Hours: we also wanted Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and had it not been for the help of Rain, we had
certainly died of thirst; but what made us amends for
one part of our wants, was that we found our selves all
of a sudden in a Kingdom of large Fishes, such as Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors,
Tunnies, Germons, Galdenies, Negros, Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes,
and several others, to whom we gave no quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
no more that to the Sea Wolfs, who for all their ill
smell could not escape us. During that time we bore to
the North-East, the Wind not allowing us to keep on our
designed Course, that if the worst came to the worst, we
might by this course reach the Isle of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> pursuant
to the Design we had formed upon meeting with this
contrary Wind, of putting in there, in case the same
continued all the way: On the 29th. after we had taken
the Latitude, our Pilots computed us to be opposite to
the Isle of <hi>Platta,</hi> Thirty Leagues to Leeward of <hi>Quea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilla:</hi>
on the 30th. being <hi>Easter</hi>-Day, we were but one
degree North Latitude; in the Twi light the Wind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to blow fresh, and bore us East North-East: next
Day the Wind came South South-West, we steering
East, East and by South-East, and East South-East:
On the 3d. of <hi>April</hi> we were becalmed; and as we had
for the space of Two Days, by the computation of our
Pilots, sailed towards Land; they were of Opinion that
the Currents deceived them, of which we made our
selves satisfied by the following manner: On the Fourth
the Weather being very calm we furled our Sails, and
put out one of our Pirogues, about whose Fore-Castle
we spun Sixty Fathom of our smallest Rope, made fast
unto a Grapling Iron, and from that Coast she made
from, the Tide ran along her side with as much swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
as the Current of a River, and bore to the North-East:
on the Fifth we caulked our Ships; towards Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
a South-West Wind presented it self, and we bore
South-East.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:65235:62"/>
On the 6th. in the Morning we discovered Land both
to Windward and Leeward of us, we veered to, least
we should be brought too near, and steered South:
On the 8th. we were about Four or Five Leagues off,
and our coasting Pilots knew the Place to be Cape <hi>Pastao,</hi>
which is under the Line Thirty Leagues to Leeward of
the Isle of <hi>Platta;</hi> we had all hands aloft, and steered
South: On the 9th. we bore to the South South-East
till the Evening, and to the South-West till Ten at
Night, when we steered to the South South-East: and
on the IIth. we were got to the heighth of the Isle of
<hi>Platta,</hi> Eighteen Leagues out at Sea.</p>
            <p>On the 12th. at Noon we saw the Point of <hi>Sancta
Helena,</hi>
               <note place="margin">An Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures.</note> which is Fifteen Leagues to Leeward of <hi>Quea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilla,</hi>
and forms the beginning of the Bay that bears
the Name of that Town: On the 12th. at Night we
saw Fire to Windward of us; we lay by till break of
Day, when we discovered a Ship Three Leagues to Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of us, and as we were becalmed, we sent Three
Pirogues to know what she was; they found her to be
a Prize, laden with Wine and Corn, which Captain <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
had taken as she came out of <hi>Nasca,</hi> and which was
separated from him; he had put Eight <hi>English</hi> Men on
Board to Conduct her, who were to have their Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
in case of a separation, at the Isle of <hi>Platta:</hi> These
Men told us that after they had left St <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Island, they
made several Descents, and in several Parts of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
among others at <hi>Sagua, Arrica,</hi> and <hi>Pisca,</hi> that in
the last of these Places, a Relation of the Vice-Roy of
<hi>Lima,</hi> came at the Head of Eight hundred Men to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
them with Sword in hand, but that they were vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
repulsed, that they had also taken a great many
Ships, which, when they pillaged, they let go again; so
that finding they had got to the value of Five thousand
pieces of Eight a Man, they had resolved to return to
the North Sea, and that as they sailed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> away for the
Streights of <hi>Magellan</hi> they fell to gaming, whereat
many lost all they had got; that they had anchored in
the Road which leads to the Isles of <hi>Dom Fernandez,</hi>
that stand upon the brink of the Streight, to which Place
came Captain <hi>Willnet,</hi> an <hi>English</hi> Man, who had left
them long before, and was come thither upon the same
Design with themselves of repassing into the North Seas
by the same Streights; but that Captain <hi>David</hi> had
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:65235:62"/>
altered his Resolution, for that those of his Crew who
had lost their Money, were not willing to leave these Seas
nor the Ship till they had taken another; That as for
those who had won, they went on Board Captain <hi>Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi>
out of which Ship went also, at the same time,
such of his Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w as were without Money, in order to go
and get some with Captain <hi>David,</hi> and that so they were
come back into the South Sea, to the number of Sixty
<hi>English,</hi> and Twenty <hi>French,</hi> as <hi>Willnet</hi> was gone through
the Streight, for the North Sea; that Captain <hi>Peter
Henry</hi> was gone for the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> presently after Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Suams;</hi> and lastly they told us (tho' we had been
informed thereof before) that the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet was a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reening
at <hi>Puerto Callao,</hi> which, as I have already said,
is the Place of Embarking, that belongs to <hi>Lima.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As these Eight <hi>English</hi> Men did not think that Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>David</hi>'s Frigate would rejoyn them so quickly at
the Place of Rendezvous, they proposed going with us
to <hi>Queaquilla,</hi> which we so much the more willingly
agreed to, in that they gave us a share of their Victuals
and Drink, and a little revived amongst us, that usual
meriment that had now for some time been exiled from
us, by the abstinences we were forced to undergo, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
we were extreamly weakned; Then we sailed all
Night in their Company steering South-East and by
East.</p>
            <p>On the 14th. we furled all our Sails for fear of being
discovered from Land, near unto which we were: About
two arose a Fog, by favour whereof we made use of our
main Sail of all, as well to come ready Rigged into the
Bay, which is Thirty Leagues in length, as to get to
Windward of the River <hi>Queaquilla,</hi> and to spare our
selves also the Labour of rowing so much, for being so
extraordinary weak we had not strength to do it.</p>
            <p>We steered all Night South-East; And on the 11th.
discovered the <hi>White Cape,</hi> which is the Windward Cape
of this Bay; about Ten in the Morning, we embarked
to the number of Two hundred and Sixty Men on Board
our Canoes, after having given our Ships Orders to lay
by in the Bay, till they heard News from us. We steered
all Day long for the Island <hi>Sancta Clara,</hi> with which we
came up at Sun setting; this little Island is in reality no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but a Rock, standing East and West, Six
Leagues distant from the Continent; we were obliged
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65235:63"/>
to cast Anchor with all the Tides contrary to us, it being
impossible to put into this Bay against the Currents,
where we found Six Fathom Water: And on the 16th.
we found our selves between <hi>Sancta Clara</hi> and <hi>la Puna,</hi>
about Five Leagues from the Shoar.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>La Puna</hi> is a very pretty Island,<note place="margin">A De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the Isle of <hi>Puna.</hi>

in circumference, and stands East and West, Two
Leagues from the Continent, and over-against the Mouth
of the River <hi>Queaquilla;</hi> There is a large Burrough
built upon it, where, in former times, were kept the
King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Magazines: Great Ships, that is, such<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as are Two or Three Deck'd ones, that cannot come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the River, Anchor between it and the Island: We
hid our selves in this Island all Day, and that with the
good Luck of not being discovered by the Sentinels, who
were there to the number of Forty of them, though
we knew nothing of it: We departed in the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and got more Southerly, that we might not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
from the Continent.</p>
            <p>On the 17th. we hid our selves again in a Covert Place
upon the same Island; where after we had got an exact
Account from our Prisoners of the State, Situation, and
Disposition of the Town of <hi>Queaquilla,</hi> which we were
about to go and take, we disposed of our Forces in the
following Order: There were Fifty Men making the
Forlorn Hope, led by Captain <hi>Picard,</hi> who commanded
our Frigate, to attack the great Fort: Fourscore Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadiers,
commanded by the Captain of our Bark, were
to be in the nature of Reserves, and to serve any where
as there should be Occasion for them: Captain <hi>Grogni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
with the main Body, was to make himself Master of
the Town and Port: And Captain <hi>George Hewit,</hi> who
was Commander of the <hi>English</hi> Ship, with Fifty of
his Men, was to attack the little Fort, and a Thousand
Pieces of Eight was promised to any one of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
whereof I was one, that should pitch the First
Colours upon the great Fort: Things being thus regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
we left our Covert in the Evening, believing we
might be able to enter into the River of <hi>Queaquilla</hi> that
Night, before Day light appear'd; but for all that, all
we could do was to gain one of the Points of the Island,
which is over-against the River, for we could have the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:65235:63"/>
advantage of the Tyde's coming in but for three Hours,
which was the Reason, that on the 18th. as we put off
again, that we might the more readily get under the
Covert of the Island; Day overtook us, and so discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
us to a Sentinel, who set a Cottage on Fire as a Signal
to the other Sentinels, that were posted at convenient
distances on both sides the River, that he saw us, that
so these same might advertise the Town of it: As soon
as we got a Shoar, we marched cross a Wood to get to
the said Fire, where we found some of those that had
kindled it; whereof Two were killed, as they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed to
save themselves, and a Third was taken, but we could
get no Intelligence from him, for he was but a little
Boy.</p>
            <p>This day we discovered a Ship entring into the River,
we let her pass, being unwilling to come out from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our Covert to fall upon her, for fear of being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
by those on the main Land, who we supposed
knew nothing of us; Because the Inhabitants of <hi>Quea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilla</hi>
had not answered the Fire-Signal which the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel
of <hi>La Puna</hi> had given them. Upon the approach
of Night, we made ready, and entred into the River
of <hi>Queaquilla</hi> by one of the two Mouths we found
there, and by which goes in and out with the Tyde so
rapid a Current, that it is enough to carry a Canoe two
Leagues in an hour, so that we made four in the space
of two hours.</p>
            <p>There are two very fine Islands in the two largest parts
of this River (which may be about half a League over)
under the Covert whereof we hid our selves on the <hi>19th.</hi>
all day long. We made ready in the Evening, and had
the pleasure to be carryed up by the Current without
the use of our Oars, for fear lest the Sentinels, who
are always placed on this River's sides, should hear the
noise of our Rowing: The Design of our Guide was to

in the Day time, in one of the Houses of the Town,
came to the Court of Guard in the Evening without
extinguishing of it; so that at Night it set the Town
on Fire; but the fear we were in least the same should
reach our Court of Guard, whereon was lodged all the
Powder in the Place, and part of the Merchandize and
Riches of the Town, we were obliged to get all carried
on Board the Barks that were in the Port, and to bring
all our Prisoners into the Fort; and when that was done,

to pay the Ransom agreed on for the Town, because
of this Accident, we having promised by our Treaty

they were the cause of it, and sent them a Letter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

at their manner of procedure; That they should af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
our Agreement with them, come with a mischievous
Intention to burn the Merchandize and Corn that were
of so much use to us, and that we repented we had not
left all the Town to be burnt: That if they did not pay
us what we had suffered by the Fire, we should send

excused the Matter to us, saying they must be some ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

would take care to satisfie us.</p>
            <p>On the 23d. the Governour furnished us with a coast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Pilot, whom we sent in one of our Canoes to see foe
our Ships, (to whom we had given Orders they should
lay by in the Bay) to bring them to an Anchor at the
Isle of <hi>Puna,</hi> whither we were to go at our departure
from <hi>Queaquilla,</hi> to wait, for the promised Ransoms:
On the 24th. finding one of our Men was Sick with the
Stench which the dead Carcasses, to the number of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
nine hundred, lying up and down the Town, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned:

Five hundred Prisoners, being the best of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
along with us, into our Barks; wherein we arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

            <p>The time allowed for the payment of the Ransom of

us not to be impatient, for the Ransom would be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
paid: Now this Dilatoriness made us begin to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
very much that there was some treachery in the
Case, and that they entertained us with hopes for no
other end than to amuse us, till such time as the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
were reinforced. And our guess was right enough,
as will appear hereafter; insomuch that we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to use such severity towards our Prisoners, which
we knew would strike a Terror into our Enemies. We
made them through Dice for their Lives, and the Lot
falling upon the Heads of Four, we cut them off pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently,
and sent them to <hi>Queaquilla</hi> in the same Vessel
that had brought the said Officer unto us, by whom we
let the Tenient understand, that if the Ransom did not
come within four Days, we would send them the Heads
of all the rest of the People that were in our Power.</p>
            <p>Our Galley on the 14th. returned from the Isle of
<hi>Platta,</hi> and related that she had been chased about the
Point of <hi>Sancta Helena</hi> by Two Ships, which she could
not discover what they were, and this made us
that Evening send out one of our Canoes that sailed well
to see what those Ships might be: On the 16th. she
found they came to joyn us, they being Captain <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s
Frigate and a Prize he had taken after the other
had been separated from them, which we met before we
went to <hi>Queaquilla;</hi> they came with full Resolution to
make a Descent at <hi>Paita,</hi> in order to get some Refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for their Men, who had been wounded in a Fight
they had had with a <hi>Spanish</hi> Ship called <hi>Catalina,</hi> which
they met Fifty Leagues to Leeward of <hi>Lima,</hi> and was
one of those that we had for so long a time waited for
before that Town.</p>
            <p>This Ship <hi>Catalina</hi> was separated from Two more with
whom she was returning to the Port of <hi>Callao,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Captain <hi>David</hi> worsts the the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> at Sea.</note> when
unfortunately for her she met with Captain <hi>David</hi>'s Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,
that sailed much better than she, and could have
taken her, without making as he did Two Days Fight or
it, had it not been that the greatest part of his Crew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
continually Drunk, failed Twenty times to come up
close to board her, and sufferred themselves to fall to
Leeward because of their ill rigging, as often as they
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:65235:67"/>
found themselves to Windward of her; which being obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they thought by putting up a bloody
Flag, they would be quickly brought to strike, but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they were mistaken, and the quite contrary fell out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For <hi>David</hi>'s People growing sober on the Third Day
and putting their Tackle and Rigging into better order
than before, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were so terrifyed thereat, that
they ran a Shoar where their Ship did not keep whole
Two Hours: <hi>David</hi>'s Men in a Canoe went to save Two
<hi>Spaniards</hi> who were about swiming to Land, and now
having escaped the danger of Drowing, told them that
their Captain having had his Thigh shot off with a
Cannon Ball, had desired his Lieutenant before his Death
to lose no time, but to go without tarrying, to acquaint
the Viceroy of <hi>Lima,</hi> of the dangerous Estate the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
was reduced to, that he might send without delay
to her assistance.</p>
            <p>Our Canoe which on the 22d. came to rejoyn us, and
gave the foresaid Information, brought also along with
her Captain <hi>David</hi>'s Prize, which he had sent to desire
us to get a Main Mast to be brought him from <hi>Quea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilla,</hi>
as somewhat of our Ransom, his having been very
much damnified in the last Engagement; And that till it
came, he would Cruise without the Bay to prevent our
being surprized by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>

            <p>I forgot to take notice that this Ship's Crew had at

to <hi>Lima</hi> the third time, to carry the following Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

the suspitions we had entertained before, that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
deferred to pay us the promised Ransom, that
they might have time to prepare themselves to come
and pay us in a sort of Coyn we had no Occasion for,

this Lady: But however the matter was, I was resolved,
in spight of the Grief and Tears of this pretty Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
to prefer the continuance of my Troubles (with
a Ray of hope I had of seeing <hi>France</hi> again) before the
perpetual Suspicion I should have had of some Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
designed against me. Thus I rejected her Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals,
but so, as to assure her I should retain, even as
long as I lived, a lively Resentment of her Affections
and good Inclinations towards me.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>23d.</hi> we sent one of our Canoes to <hi>Queaquilla</hi>
to carry one of the <hi>Fathers</hi> thither, they being a People
as much obeyed and respected by that Nation, as the
Viceroys themselves. The Governour gave this Man a
full Power to act as he pleased, even in opposition to
the Obstructions which the Tenient made against the
Payment of the Ransom afore-mentioned. After his
departure came a Bark which brought us Four and
Twenty Sacks of Meal, and to the value of Twenty
Thousand Pieces of Eight in Gold: They desired us
moreover, to grant them three days time for the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the rest, which we allowed them, but withal
threatned, that upon their failure therein, we should
seize upon their Fort, and burn their Town and Ships.</p>
            <p>Our Canoe returned on the <hi>25th.</hi> who gave us an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
they would pay no more than Two and Twenty
Thousand Pieces of Eight for the rest of the Ransom,
and that the Tenient would pursue his Prince's Orders,
who forbad the payment of any; That he had Five
Thousand Men at hand, with which he waited to see if
we would put our Threats in Execution. Upon this

                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ce and bold Answer, we had a Consultation together,
whether we should cut off the Heads of all the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
The Plurality of Voices, together with mine,
was, That it were better we should go and look after
the Two and Twenty Thousand Pieces of Eight, than
shed any more Blood; seeing also that our Design being
to leave these Seas, we had no farther occasion for these
Executions to make us be feared; and that after all, we
were but too well assured by the Tenient's Letter, that
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were setting all things in Order, to come
and act their utmost Effort against us, which perhaps
would administer matter of Repentance unto us, if we
still persisted in our Resolution: That therefore we
ought to accept of the Offer, and to give up unto them
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:65235:69"/>
no other than the meanest of the Prisoners, without
divesting our selves of those of Quality, who would
be a Security unto us for the rest: That while we waited
for them, it was our best way to take them along with
us, and put off from the Shoar, steering towards the
Point of St. <hi>Helena,</hi> where we should be out of danger
of the surprizes of our Enemies, whose Motions we
could every way discover at a distance. Things being
thus concluded on, we sent our Canoe to <hi>Queaquilla,</hi>
who returned again the <hi>25th.</hi> and told us, that next day,
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would without fail bring us the Two and
Twenty Thousand Pieces of Eight to the Isle of <hi>Puna,</hi>
where we then were.</p>
            <p>We put the same day Fifty of our best Prisoners on
board our Ships, and at the same time weighed Anchor,
and quitted our good Winter Quarters, where we left
the rest of our Prisoners, with two Canoes to Guard
them, and to wait for the Money promised us; giving
our Men Orders to tell those that brought it, that they
should send us the remainder of what was agreed on,
to the Point of St. <hi>Helena,</hi> and upon default thereof,
that they should see their People no more. Our Canoes
on the <hi>26th.</hi> in the Evening came to joyn us, as we lay
by to get out of this Bay, and brought us the Two and
Twenty Thousand Pieces of Eight.</p>

               </gap>ourscore of our Men on board of

manage his Guns; and as we had not Men enough to
manage our Prizes, we reserved only but two Ships,
and a long Bark, and sent the rest with our Pirogues
upon the Flats, where the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ships could not come,
as drawing more Water than they did. We lay by till<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Noon, to get the Weather-gage, which yet we could not
do, because at this time of the Year the Winds blow
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:65235:69"/>
from the Sea, and are very fixed, and that besides, as
we came out of the bottom of the Bay we could not
well hope to gain it, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being at the Mouth
thereof.</p>
            <p>About Noon our Enemies came upon us, and so we
sought till the Evening with our Cannon, which the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> call Gallant Fighting, without much hurting
of one another: We cast Anchor upon the approach of
Night, as they did also about a League to Windward of
us: We fired a Gun for our Prizes to come up, which
they did, and cast Anchor near us, for their greater Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</p>
            <p>We sent them back about an hour before Day-light
to their former Station, and as soon as ever Light ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
we made ready, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did the same,
but no sooner were we got under Sail, but we were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calmed:
Unhappily it fell out that we were without
our Pirogues to tow us to Windward, because we
had sent them back with our Prizes, to avoid the trouble
they might have caused us, and therefore all we could
do now, was to make use of our little Canoes, which
we had still with us; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> also towed to Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
to dispute the matter with us, however, with
much ado we got a Cannot-shot to Windward of them;
But as they knew better how to bear close up to the
Wind in these Seas than we, in half an hour's time they
recovered the Weather-gage of us. We lay by till Two
in the Afternoon, and seeing we could do no good with
them, we put in to the Cape, to wait for two of our
Ships, that were behind. In the mean time these <hi>Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilla's</hi>
bore up to us, and when they had got within a
good Cannon-shot, we fought till it was dark Night,
they very much shattered us, yet wounded but one
Man; we anchored in the Evening as we had done the
day before, and they did the same also to Windward of
us.</p>
            <p>We remained at Anchor on the <hi>29th.</hi> as well as they,
till Three in the Afternoon, when they weighed to go
and attack the biggest of our Prizes, because she had
anchored only on the side of the Shallows, and we made
ready to defend her: We came to such a close Fight
with them, that our Small Arms, as well as Great Guns,
came into play on both sides; yet we lost not one Man,
tho' they on their side had a great many killed, which
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65235:70"/>
we knew by the Blood that ran out of their Skupper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes,
and at our parting they cryed, <hi>A la manana la
partida;</hi> that is, <hi>To Morrow to it again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the <hi>30th.</hi> both they and we prepared to put out
of the Bay, and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were still to Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
did all they could to hinder us to get the Weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage.
We came to an Anchor towards Noon, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm
one of our Prizes, that sailed very badly, and to
fit up another in the room of her, which Captain <hi>David</hi>
gave us, as well as the Twenty <hi>Frenchmen</hi> that made
part of his Crew, and were minded to leave him. We
wrought all Night to unrigg her, and when we had so
done, we sent her into the Bottom. We put our selves
under Sail on the <hi>31st.</hi> and about Two in the Afternoon
came to an Anchor, because of the Tyde's being against
us: Presently after, the two <hi>Armadilla's</hi> came up with
us, which made us weigh, and then to put in at the
Cape, to wait for one of our Prizes, that was far from
us, which not being able to joyn us as soon as the Enemy,
her Crew left her, and went into her Pirogue, wherein
they came to throw themselves on board one of our
Men of War: They had left four <hi>Spaniards</hi> in that
same Prize, who, by the favour of a good Wind, put
back into the River of <hi>Queaquilla,</hi> where they made
their Escape, and, what was worst of all, took along
with them almost all our Provisions that was in her.</p>
            <p>When we were got within half Cannon-shot of our
Enemies Ships, we fired upon one another, and that
without intermission, till an hour within Night: We
received several Cannon-shot in our Sides, during this
Engagement, had almost all our Tackle spoiled, and
our Sails sifted, because the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did all that ever
they could to bring our Masts by the board, and indeed
the Fore-Mast of the Frigate received five Cannot-shot,
and the Main-Mast three, but they came only slanting,
and, as good luck would have it, we had not one Man
killed nor wounded.</p>
            <p>We saw the Enemy on the first of <hi>Iune</hi> by break
of Day, a League's distance from us; we were not
slow to do all we could to put out: About Ten they
lengthen'd their Boltspring-Sails, and returned upon us,
but as we saw them bear up towards our Frigate, we
thought they intended to board her, and this made us
presently put into her the Crew of our long Bark, by
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65235:70"/>
way of Reinforcement. As soon as ever the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
were come up, they put out their <hi>Burgundian</hi> Colours,
having till then put out none: When we were come
pretty near, they gave us a Volley of Musquet-shot,
together with a discharge of their Cannon, laden with
Cartouches, but we got clear of them, so that they
could not come to grapple with us.</p>
            <p>After we had left them to make all the Fire they
could, we gave them a Discharge of all our Cannon,
and a full Volley with our small Arms in our turn, and
then we were ready to board them; but they finding
themselves much damaged, very readily got aloof to
hinder us.</p>
            <p>They took up an hour's time to refit, then bore up
to us again, renewing the Fight, which lasted till Night;
but they had been so well banged; that they had no
mind to feel us this time so near, and that day we had
three Men wounded.</p>
            <p>On the second by break of Day they were still to
Windward of us at about two Leagues distance, and
bore up to us; We having a fresh Gale, put into the
Cape, and when they were come within a good Cannot-shot
of us, they plyed us very tightly with their Great
Guns, and then approached within Musquet-shot of us,
as believing we were now out of Condition to make any
longer Resistance: But as we had a better Advantage of
using our Fusils, we made so great a fire upon them,
that they were forced to close up their Port-holes, and
bear up to the Wind. We received Sixty Cannon shot
this day in our Sides, whereof two Thirds were between
Wind and Water; besides which, all our Rigging was
torn, and we had two Men wounded, whereof my self
was one.</p>
            <p>About two hours within Night they made a shew of
coming to board us, but finding we were as well prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to receive them by Night as by Day, they bore upon
the Wind: We spent some part of this Night at Anchor
to stop up our Cannons Mouths, which otherwise might
have sent us into the Deep.</p>
            <p>We were astonished next Morning at break of Day
that we could not set sight of the two <hi>Armadilla's,</hi> with
whom we had made our selves ready to renew the Fight,
and in all appearance they grew weary of it before us,
tho' they had so great an Advantage as that of the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:65235:71"/>
Wind, which yet, as we heard since, could not secure
them from losing a great many Men, and having their
Ships at least as much shattered as ours: So that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
well with our selves that they had steered their
Course to Port <hi>Calla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Plaita,</hi> where we anchored in the Evening, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
there two Days to caulker our Ships.</p>
            <p>We had, during th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who durst not enter our Ships, tho they came Board
and Board with us twice.</p>
            <p>We weighed on the sixth, and sailed along the Coast,
that we might find a convenient Place to take in Water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
This Coast is very level, safe, and very good to Land up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is the reason that the same is throughout, as
far as <hi>Barbacoa,</hi> inhabited by the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> We Ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
between Cape <hi>Pastoa</hi> and that of St. <hi>Francisco.</hi> On the

               </gap>o go to the Point <hi>St. Hele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
to see whether their Ransom was come, which I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
would have been to little purpose, for those two
<hi>Armadilla</hi>'s had been sent to pay us with Cannon-Ball.</p>
            <p>On the 11th.<note place="margin">They divided their Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> we went about dividing the Gold, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Stones and Pearls we had found in <hi>Queaquilla;</hi>
but as these things could not be divided, nor easily
valued, the Gold not being Coyned, and the Stones of
different value, we put up all by way of Auction, that
those who had Silver might bid for them, and so every
Man have his part according as he bad; and as there
were several among us who having got considerable sums
of Money at Play, were sure, that if it pleased God they
should once get safe out of these Seas, their way
must be no other than over Land, where the weight of
their Silver must hinder or retard their going; they bid
for those lewels that kept but little Room, and weigh'd
not much, so excessive a Price, that the Gold alone that
was Coyned was worth Eighty and an hundred Pieces of
Eight an Ounce, and each Pistol Fifteen of the said
Pieces: But though these things were sold so dear, we
made no more a Division of the Booty of that Town
than what came to Four hundred Pieces of Eight a Man,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:65235:71"/>
the whole might amount to about Five hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Pieces of Eight, or Fifteen hundred thousand Livers;
which Money, as we were out of hopes to carry along
with us, served us to play for on Board our Ships for our
Diversion: So that in the Descents we made, we sought
now for nothing but Gold and precious Stones, which
we did not find so plentiful as Silver; of which, I must
be plain, we made so little account, that we thought it
not worth our while to take along with us a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Plate and other things, whereof the Town of
<hi>Queaquilla</hi> was full: We also neglected to send a Canoe
after the hundred Caons of Coyned Silver, each consisting
of Eleven thousand Pieces of Eight, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
had sent away to the other side of the River, when we
were engaged with them, and which were yet in sight
of us when the Fight was over. There is such a vast
quantity of that rich Mettal in this Country, that most
of those things we make in <hi>France</hi> out of Steel, Copper,
and Iron, are made by them in Silver: This indifference
in us gave some of their People many times occasion to
intermix with us, to Pillage from their own fellow Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
what we neglected, and of which they were not so
squeamish as we, or rather so put to it for the Carriage
of them, they being in their own Country, and we far
from ours.</p>
            <p>On the 12th. Captain <hi>Davids</hi>'s Frigate left us,<note place="margin">Captain <hi>David</hi> sails for the North Sea.</note> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing

could they also, contain such a quantity of Water
as we had occasion for, which is very hard to come
by on that Coast, where you must go two or three
Leagues up the Country before you can meet with any.
These Difficulties made us resolve to return to the Western
Coast, that so we might endeavour to find out a way also
to return to the North Sea, but that must be no other
than over Land.</p>

               </note> I cannot but take Notice,
that <hi>Peru</hi> is one of the richest Countries in the World,
not only in respect to the great quantity of Gold and
Silver which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> dig out of the Mines they
possess there, but also upon account of the great Fertility
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:65235:72"/>
of the Earth, that produceth to the Tillers of it three
Crops every Year, as well of Corn as Wine; and that
besides those Fruits that are peculiar to all <hi>America,</hi> you
have also many of those here which grow in <hi>France,</hi> in
so much that this great Diversity of Species's is the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
that you have continual Supplies of fresh Fruits in
all the Seasons of the Year.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of this Country reckon but two Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
which divide the whole Year into a Summer of
Nine Months, and a Winter of three, during which, it
freezes oftentimes very hard on the Mountains, though
the same is hardly discernable in the Plains: Amongst
their other Cattle they breed Sheep, that weigh two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and fifty, or three hundred Pound-weight: These
Animals are of great use to them, having the very same
Instinct as Camels. They make them carry Jarrs of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Oyl, or Wine, which are a sort of Earthen-ware
made like Sugar-pans, two of which holds about five
and thirty Quarts, and when empty, weigh as much as
the Liquor that fills them: When they are minded to
fill them, these Sheep will kneel down, and as soon as
they are full, get up very gently; when they are come
to the place whither they are to carry them, they lay
them down in the same manner, and so continue till they
are discharged of their Burthen.</p>
            <p>We weigh'd on the 13th. and on the 15th. Anchored
twenty Leagues to Windward of <hi>Point Mangla,</hi> we put
ashoar in a Canoe, where we surprized a Watch of
fifteen <hi>Spanish</hi> Soldiers, who were set upon the side of a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
River; the Entertainment we gave them, forced
them to own unto us that they were to guard the River,
which they called <hi>Elmeralda,</hi> because of the many Rocks,
or great pieces of Emeralds which their Country-men
take up there, and that we might in the space of Eight
Hours go very easily from the Mouth of it in our Canoes,
to surprize the Town of <hi>Quitto,</hi> but not so by Land, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
then we must fetch a Compass of Fourscore

would not fail to oppose us; and for these Reasons it
was that they endeavoured all they could to keep from
Strangers the Knowledge of these Advantages: This

We Anchor'd on the 20th. at the Isle of <hi>Gallapo,</hi> where we
examined the Prisoners we had taken in the said Bark,
who told us, that the Galley of <hi>Panama</hi> was gone into
the Bay of <hi>Mapallo</hi> in quest of the <hi>French</hi> Men that
were gone ashoar upon those Islands, which I have already

'twas the Isle of <hi>Malpalla</hi> that stands forty Leagues

sailed to the Bay of <hi>Mapalla</hi> instead of going to the Isle

we had no more than two of the least and weakest of
our Ships left together, but we did not lose sight of the

overtaken with a Calm. In the mean time we Ancho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>On the 24th. about Eight in the Morning we disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
three Sail of Ships that doubled the Point of <hi>Harina,</hi>

As soon as they were come on Board, we made ready and

            <p>Those three Vessels, which were a Galley and two

and the two Pirogues that sailed better than the Galley,
got behind us, and fired fifteen Cannon-shot upon us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but as our Arms could reach them, these Pirogues were
forced to fall a Stern, and to wait for their Galley: When
she had joyned them, they held a Council, and then put
out to Attack us, our Ships not being able to give us any
Relief, put to the Cape to wait for us; we fought them
all along till we had rejoyned our Vessels, which we did
about two in the Afternoon, when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> left us,
to go bury their Dead upon the Island where we had been
to take in Water when we first discovered them; they
did us some Damage in our main Mast and Rigging, and
wounded few of our Men: Towards Evening a Wind
arose from the Sea, and we sailed in quest of them, but
they kept to the Shoar.</p>

On the 25th. we passed round the Island in search for
our Canoes, which the Enemy's Galley sought for also,
rightly imagining they were ashoar, as not having seen

they discovered us, and coming out from under
their Covert, gave us the Signal, which we on our part
answered; they had hid themselves there for four Hours,
expecting our coming, and had a full sight of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,

who saw us take them with us, durst not hinder it,
though they were at Anchor very near them, then we
attempted with one of our Ships to Board the Enemy's
Galley, but she saved her self upon the Flats, where our
Ships could not come near her. On the 26th. we An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored
at an Island in the Bay, where we put two of our
Vessels to Careen, while the other three guarded them.
On the 28th. we saw a Canoe under white Colours,
crossing from the main Land to the Islands, where one
of ours met and took her: It was a <hi>Spanish</hi> Captain, who
believing us to be his own People, came to congratulate
the Commander upon the Victory, which he from the
Shoar thought they had got over us. We put him upon
the Wrack, to know whether he came not by some wile
or other to draw us into a Snare laid for us by the Galley,

               <note place="margin">Other Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures.</note> one of our Men, who was
Hunting upon the Island where we were Careening,
found two Men who had been there for the space of
Eight Days to observe our Motions, and who taking us
to be <hi>Spaniards,</hi> durst not come near us: They were two
<hi>French</hi> Men belonging to the Pirogue of which the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Officer spoke to us, and who had defended
themselves so valiantly against the six hundred <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards;</hi>
we found them to be of the number of Fourscore
and five, who had separated themselves under Captain
<hi>Grogniet,</hi> to go to <hi>Callinfornia;</hi> they presently gave No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
to the other Eight and twenty, who came and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us, and of whom we learnt that they had saved
themselves upon this Island, after they had been chased a
whole Night by the <hi>Spanish</hi> Galley, that did not sail so
well as their Pirogue. They told us also they had gone
down a matter of forty Leagues to Windward of <hi>Acapul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi>
without being able any more than once to go ashoar,
and that then they ran a great risque, so boisterous is the
Sea in those Parts, wherewith they were so discouraged,
that they had forsaken fifty five of their Companions,
in order to come and find us out, and left them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
their Course for <hi>Callinfornia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having made an end of our Careening, on the 10th.
we made every thing ready for our Departure, after we
had given those thirty Men room in our Ships: We sailed
from the Coast of <hi>Acapulto</hi> with a design to find out the
other fifty five Men spoken of, who were to make a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent
there, and to rid them from a miserable state where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
in all appearance, they had gone to plunge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
without any hopes of Retrieve, being too small a
Company to find out Provisions (whereof they stood in
great need) in the best Peopl'd Country upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
where also it could not be believed they should
arrive, having but a little sorry Bark under them, that
could not carry them far without splitting in two.</p>
            <p>We had at our Departure an Easterly breeze, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
we were favoured till we came to the height of
<hi>Sansonnat;</hi> from the Fifteenth to the One and twentieth
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:65235:74"/>
we were be calmed all along in the Day-time, and the
Winds were so high in the Nights, that we could not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
our Sails; on the 22d. we had a pretty good Gale from
the South-East; and on the 27th. we drew near Land,
to know where we were: We found our selves to Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of the Bay of <hi>Tecoantepequa,</hi> and put out our
Canoes to go in thither, while at the same time we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
our Ships to Rendezvouz in the Port of <hi>Vatulco,</hi>
which is twenty Leagues to Leeward: We came very
near Land in the Evening, but the Sea runs so high along
that Coast, that it was impossible to go ashoar.</p>
            <p>On the 29th, we found an Embarking-place, where
there was a very strong Entrenchment guarded by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
number of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and supposing it would
cost us dear to go ashoar in that place, we sailed two
Leagues to Leeward, where the Sea was somewhat more

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ick, but found here also about three hundred Men
upon an Eminence waiting for us: We detached fifty of
ours to go and meet them, but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made a foolish Discharge fled; However, we took
two of their Number, and asked them, whither that
way led, upon which we were; they told us it would
bring us to the Town of <hi>Tecoantepequa,</hi> according to
whose Name that Bay was called, and that we had
but four Leagues to it: We lay next Night upon the
Road, under the Canopy of Heaven, according to our
usual Custom; next day, which was the thirtieth, we
resolved to go to the said Town, and directed our Course
that way, in such a manner, that about two in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon
we had a sight of the place from an Ascent,
which is about half a League off.</p>
            <p>As it is encompassed and beset every way with Eight

time deliberating with our selves whether so small a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
as we were ought to go thither, as being no more
than an hundred and fourscore Men, whereas there was
three thousand of the Enemy in the place: In the mean
time the extream necessity we were reduced to for want
of Provisions, pressed us to advance, and would not
let us deliberate long upon the Danger that lay before
us, so that all our Apprehensions being reduced to the
fear we had of starving to Death, we pursued our March
to go and confront our Enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:65235:75"/>
When we had marched about half an hour, we found
our selves near the Town, and upon the brink of a great
and very rapid River, which separates it from four of the
<hi>Suburbs</hi> that adjoyn to it; this River we crost over, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up in the Water to the middle, in spight of the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> who were intrenched on the other side, to
dispute the Passage with us, which they were forced to
leave open for us, after a good hours sharp Dispute:
As soon as we were Masters of the Intrenchment, we
entered the Town, where after we had fought hand in
hand with the Enemy, like Men enraged with Hunger,
we became Masters of the place of Arms about four in
the Afternoon: But our Work was not yet done, for
the Enemy having again entrenched themselves in a
very fine Abbey, built in the manner of a Platform that
commanded the Town; we went to the number of
Fourscore Men to dislodge them, which was so readily
executed, that having chased them thence, we made
our Court of Guard of it, and then every one endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to satisfie that Hunger wherewith we were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
pinched.</p>
            <p>When we were got into this Town,<note place="margin">A De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of Teco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua.</note> we found it yet
much more spacious and larger than it appeared to be
unto us, from the forementioned Ascent; its Houses
are well built, the Streets very strait, and the Churches
exceeding stately and Ornamental: The Abbey of St.
<hi>Francis,</hi> from whence we drove the Enemy, appear'd
more like unto a Fort than a Religious Convent, and it
was built to serve for that use in case of need.</p>
            <p>On the 31st. we sent to require them to Ransom their
Town, or else we would burn it; we had no Answer
return'd, which made us conjecture they had a mind to
come and Attack us, for which they had so much the
more Advantage, in that the River which began from
the time that we passed it, to overflow, was about to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> us in; wherefore we decamped and lay in one of
the <hi>Suburbs</hi> that stands on the other side, where we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to the third of <hi>September;</hi> when we departed to
return to our Canoes, without reaping any Advantage by
the taking of this Town: We reimbarked on the fifth,
and went to joyn our Ships in the Port of <hi>Vatulco,</hi> where
we arrived the Ninth: On the 15th. we went off again
in our Canoes without a Guide, and having landed,
marched ten or a dozen Leagues up the Country, where
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:65235:75"/>
we took divers Villages, and in one of them the old
Governour of <hi>Merida</hi> with his Family, who was retired
to this place, and who promised us a quantity of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
for his Ransom, in expectation whereof we car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
him on Shipboard, where we arrived on the 25th.
The same day about Ten in the Morning we discovered
a Ship, and put out with our Canoes to know what she
was; she bare to the Cape, and put up <hi>Spanish</hi> Colours,
but as the Sea ran very high, and that our Canoe could
not well weather it, we returned again into Port. Now
this Ship believed 'twas her Colours that hindred us
to come on Board her, wherefore she took the same
down, and put up a white Flag in the room of them; we
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the same time fitted up our Galley to go and hale her,
but she could never get out of the Port, whereupon she
failed away, and as our Ships were much out of order,
we could not follow her. She was, undoubtedly, a Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e
built in the North-Sea, but it was impossible for us
to know what Nation she belonged to.</p>
            <p>The Sea being calm on the 26th. we went with our
Galley about twenty Leagues to Windward of <hi>Acapulto,</hi>
to see if the abovementioned Ship were not put in to
Port, we judging by her Rigging she wanted to put in
some-where to Land; But we returned without any News of
her: We waited till the fourth of <hi>November</hi> for the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
of the Governour, which we did not overmuch press
for, as finding in this Port and Parts adjacent, plenty of
Victuals, particularly of Tortoises, which we had there
in great Numbers, and <hi>Hatto</hi>'s, that are to be met with
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

            <p>It's impossible to go ashoar from <hi>Sansonat</hi> to <hi>Acapulto,</hi>

the <hi>Hourqua</hi> of <hi>Acapulco</hi> that went to the <hi>East-Indies,</hi>

the richest Vessels that sails upon the Ocean; it's of a

of nothing but Land and Fire, she is provided with forty
of pieces Cannons, whereof one half is of no use to her, for
her Lading makes her sink so deep in the Water, that her
Battery between the two Decks is rendred useless: She
goes out yearly from the Port of <hi>Acapulco,</hi> convoy'd
with a <hi>Patach</hi> of Twenty-eight Guns, and laden with
several sorts of Merchandizes that she carries to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants

            <p>Four Leagues lower there is another Port where you

seven or eight Men in it to their <hi>Embarking-place,</hi> where

when they cut into pieces, or burn the dead
Body of an Enemy; and we were assured, that when
we buried any of our Men in their Country, they dig
them up when we were gone, if they knew the place,
for to exercise their Cruelty upon those Carcasses, which
when alive they could not make us feel.</p>
            <p>We returned on the 16th. aboard our Ships, and on

News of the Five and Fifty Men we were in quest of
we weigh'd Anchor, and directed our Course for the Bay

for a place where the Sea was Calmer; next day one of
our Men being more in patient than the rest, and egged
on with Drought that tormented him four days, swam
to Land, but thinking to return in the same manner,
he was drowned without our being able to succour him,
notwithstanding all the cry he made unto us to save him:
On the 9th. in the beginning of the Night we thought
to have seen a little Bay, before which we Anchored,
that we might know in the Morning what it was, during
which time we heard the firing of about six hundred
Mosquets on the Land. As soon as Day<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>light appeared,
on the 10th. we saw that what we took for a Bay was a
kind of a Covert that stands Fifteen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>Leagues to Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of <hi>Sansonnat,</hi> where we could see no likelihood of
entring in. In the mean time we saw a very pretty Ship
upon the Stocks in that place, which made us conclude
there must of necessity be a Passage for her to come out;
we Anchored pretty near the Rock, to wait for a Tyde,
during which time, a Wind blew from the Sea, and we
adventur'd with the help of our Sails and Oars to
get in, where we were saluted with three Waves that
half filled our Pirogue in the very sight of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi>
who watched our entring in.</p>
            <p>We put up to one side of the said Covert, and fired
for the space of half an hour upon their Magazines,
built by the side thereof, without their returning us one
single shot; But at last we being tormented with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Drought, which we were desirous to allay what
ever it cost us, we hois'd up our Sail, and run up our
Pirogue before them, who believing we were going to
their Town, that was but half a League off, they went
off. But as we were no more than two and twenty Men,
instead of running after them, we improved their Flight,
in filling our Casks with Water, and to furnish our
selves with what Provision we found in the Magazines,
and some of that Ship's Rigging which were more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for ours; but not daring all at once to lade our
Pirogue with them, for fear of sinking in her Passage
out; we spent the Night on the other side of those Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines,
that we might be under Covert from the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes
of our Enemies, for we computed very well by
the six hundred Musquet shot we had heard, that there
was a great many Armed Men in that place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:65235:78"/>
On the 11th. we departed from under the Covert, to

            <p>I am to observe, that as long as we were going up

blew Winds from the Land,<note place="margin">Some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Winds in these parts.</note> which were very favourable
to Sailors, provided they were not far out at Sea, for
Ten Leagues off there could be but very little of it felt,

that they are obliged to lower their Sails, and even to
furle: On the 17th.<note place="margin">Consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about returning to the North-Sea.</note> we had a Consultation together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
what Passage, according to the Prisoner's Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
was less dangerous for us, to return to the North-Sea
over Land; it was thought our best way was by <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>govid,</hi>
seeing we had no more than sixty Leagues to go
before we came to the head of a River, upon which
they told us, we might go down to the North-Sea
whereunto it discharged it self; and that in the way we
were to take by Land, we could have no more than five or
six thousand Men to deal with, and that the way was
very good to carry our wounded and sick Men along
with us: But we were not fully convinced of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
of this Advice, we sent two of our Canoes to
Shear to take some other Prisoners, that so we might see
whether they should confirm, or contradict this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
and thereby be the more fully instructed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
those things that might be an Obstruction to
our Passage, and others that might facilitate the same.</p>
            <p>We went a Shoar on the 18th. to the number of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
Men, and marched all day long without meeting
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:65235:78"/>
one Soul, as we did also the next day till Noon, without
any more discovery than in the preceding one, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
we were so fatigu'd, that we resolved to return
back again; And here we may add, that the greatest
part of our Men were not overcontent to repass by Land
to the North-Sea, because of the five or six thousand
Men wherewith we were threaten'd, wherefore we left
those that were minded, to return to their Canoes, and
Eighteen of us, who found our selves less weary than
the rest, staid behind: We followed a great Road which
we met with soon after they had left us, and had not
walked above an hour, when we took three Horse-men,
whom, when we had asked where we were, they told
us, that about a quarter of a League off there was a
little Town, called <hi>Chiloteca,</hi> wherein there were four
hundred white Men, besides <hi>Negroes, Mulaters,</hi> and
<hi>Indians,</hi> and assured us, we had not been yet discovered:
We had a mind to run after our Men, to acquaint them
with this Account,<note place="margin">A handful of <hi>Free-booters</hi> take Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loteca,</note> and engage them to go back with
us to the Town; but the Apprehensions we were under
of being discovered, and thereby giving the Inhabitants
time to put themselves into a posture of Defence, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
us to do so, and made us undertake perhaps the
boldest, most resolute, and if you will, the rashest
Action that could be thought of; which was, that being
no more of us than Eighteen Men, as I have said before,
we should adventurously enter that Town, where we
surpriz'd and frighten'd the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to that Degree,
that we took the Tenient and other Officers, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
in all of fifty Persons, including the Women, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners:
They were seized with such a pannick fear, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
us to be far more numerous than we were, that
all the rest would doubtless have been taken and
bound by us, had it not been for their Horses, which
are always at hand, which they mounted to ride away
upon. And so it was as we would have it, for if they had
had the Courage to stay behind, they might have cut
out Work for us, whereof we had already but too much,
which was to watch our Prisoners.</p>
            <p>We ask'd the Tenient where the Galley of <hi>Panama</hi> was,<note place="margin">Being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tackt by the <hi>Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards,</hi> they kill their Prisoners</note>

what number of Men we should have occasion for to
guard us, if we should stay there, he told us, there
would be six hundred Men next day there, but that they
had no more Fire-Arms than for two hundred. The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
who, during this time, were a little recover'd
of their Astonishment, being got together, enter'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Town again, and after we have several times con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
with them, we entrenched our selves in the
Church, where we had put our Prisoners, who seeing
us go in with Precipitation, believed their People pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su'd
us close, and were just upon falling on us; which
made them so bold, as to run to the Swords, and other
Arms we had got together, wherewith they wounded
us one Man. We presently got to the Doors, and from
thence fired upon them so long, till there were no more
than four Men and their Wives left alive of them: At
the same time we mounted the Horses which we had
taken, and with our four Prisoners of each Sex, went
away with as little noise as we could, which the other
<hi>Spaniards</hi> observing, they sent one to treat with us, but
we refused, and fired upon him, for fear, if he came
too near us, he should come to know how few we went.

insomuch, that being no longer daunted at the dangers
we were to run in this Passage, and being perswaded it
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:65235:79"/>
would be better for us to die with our Swords in our
Hands, than to pine away with Hunger; We made all
things ready for this Journey, and to the end we might
cut off from the most Timerous, any desires they might
have to return to their Ships, if their Minds should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
in reference to their going along with us, we ran our
Vessels ashoar, except our Galley and Pirogues, which
we reserved to carry us off the Island where we were to
the Continent.</p>
            <p>On the 25th. we formed four Companies consisting
of seventy Men each, making altogether two hundred
and fourscore; and as for the forlorn <hi>Hope,</hi> we agreed
for to draw out ten Men out of each, and to relieve
them every Morning: We also made a Contract among
our selves, that those who should be lamed in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters
we might have with the Enemy in our way,
should have the same Recompence as formerly, that is,

            <p>Before I leave these Seas,<note place="margin">The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> I'll spare the Reader the trouble
of asking how we came to endure so much Hunger, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series,
and Fatigues in these parts, since I have said upon
several occasions, that the Country is so good and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
as well as fruitful in the Production of all tings
necessary for the support and confort of human Life:
As to this, there needs no more than observing that since
our separation from the <hi>English</hi> at the Isle of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi>
we were all along so illy accommodated with Shipping,
that we were forced to keep continually to the Coast, and
by consequence in sight of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
even the least Motions we made, had almost always
time to remove all their Effects out of the way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we made our Descent, and left us nothing but what
they could not carry away, which was many times but
very inconsiderable, whereas, had we had but one good
Ship to put out far to Sea, they could not have discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
us, and we should have surprized them continually
in our Descents, where we could have wanted nothing,
not only that was necessary, but also pleasurable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Wealth we must have carried away in a short
time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:65235:80"/>
This want of Shipping, under which we laboured, we
so advantagious to our Enemies, and the consequence
thereof they knew so well, that the People of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
sent no more Ships to the Western Coast where we were
for fear some of them might fall into our Hands
and Traded with one another no otherwise than by
Land.</p>
            <p>The same Reason also hindred us to go up to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
Coast of <hi>Peru,</hi> where we could not have failed of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Ships, seeing they sailed up and down there every
day, and drove a great Trade with one another, as
knowing we were not so near unto their Country; So
that it is easie from what I have remarked to conjecture,
that for want of these helps which were of so much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
to us in these Seas; we must also very often
stand in need of all those things which we could not but
with the greatest difficulty have without them, wherefore
to make any thing of it in these Climates, and to raise a
considerable Fortune, without much danger and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings;
there needs no more than to be provided with a
good Ship, and for the better conveniency, Victualled
for some time, that so there may be no necessity of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ashoar to seek it.</p>
            <p>On the 27th. we discovered a Ship passing along be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Islands, which made us send our Galley and
Pirogue to see what she was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>,
but as soon as we came <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

               </gap>hot of her, she
took down the white Flag, and put out <hi>Spanish</hi> Colour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
and withal, gave us ten or a dozen Guns; we returned
to the Shoar to give our People notice of it; not
doubting, but if that Ship came to an Anchor in the
same place, she would destroy our Pirogues: We sent
them with our Baggage and Prisoners up to the Flats
that are behind the Island where we were.</p>
            <p>This Vessel about Noon came in with the Tyde, and
Anchored within half a Cannon-shot of ours that were
run ashoar, under the Covert of which we fought against
them with two pieces of Cannon till it was night, but
as the Enemy had no other aim then to ruin our Ships,
they put them this first day out of a condition to sail,
(which was what our selves had a mind to) and then
put farther off form the Shoar.</p>
            <p>On the 28th. in the Morning they drew nearer again,
and began to fight us, which made us shelter our selves
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:65235:80"/>
behind the Points of the Rocks that run out into the Sea,
from whence our Arms carried aboard them; upon this
they were forced to send their shallop under the favour
of their Cannon, to take away an Anchor that was nearer
to Shoar than their Ship, but being prevented therein,
they cut off the Cable that held it, and put off again;
At last, concluding with our selves that this Ship would
not leave us so hastily, we sent an hundred Men in the
Evening to the Continent before us, that they might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to take some Horses, on which we might lay
our disabled Men, with orders afterwards to return and
wait for us upon the Sea-side in the same place where they
went ashoar, (which was a kind of a Port we had as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
them) in case they had returned before our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
there. And for fear the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ship should suspect,
from the running of ours a ground, the design we had
to go to the North-Sea, and that the Men on Board her
would send to the Continent to give the People notice
to put themselves in a readiness to hinder us; we coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited
all night long the caulking of our Ships, that
so we might fully possess them with a belief, that we
were careening them, which wrought so effectually up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, that in the Morning they failed not to come up
to destroy with their Cannon, the Work they fancied
we had been doing during the night.</p>
            <p>On the 29th. their Ship took Fire, which made them
put farther off,<note place="margin">A notable amuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to facilitate their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>30th.</hi> we made use of a new Stratagem to amuse our
Enemies, and take away all manner of suspition from
them, that we designed to be gone, which was to charge
our Guns, Granadoes, and four pieces of Cannon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
we tied lighted Matches of different lengths, that
so having their effect in our Absence one after another,
the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ship's Crew might still believe we were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Island, from whence we parted in the Twilight, as
secretly as ever we could, with all our Prisoners, whom
we reserved for no other use than to carry our Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on's
Medicines, Carpenter's Tools, and the wounded
Men we might have in this Passage.</p>
            <p>On the Ist. of <hi>Ianuary,</hi>
               <note place="margin">They Provide for their Iourney.</note> in the year 1688, we arrived
on the Continent, and on the Evening of the same day,
the Party which we had sent before to look for Horses,
came thither likewise: They had taken Sixty Eight with
several Prisoners, who, without any Violence offered

through: But as we had already resolved upon the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and that our Ships could be of no longer use unto us
all that they could say to the contrary, did not hinder us
to persevere therein. All our People at the same time
packed up every Man his Charge, and put their Silver
into Bags, which they thought they could carry with
their Ammunition: Those who had too much of the
former, gave it to those who had lost theirs at Play, for
to carry, conditioning with them, that they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
the one half back to the Owner, in case it should

yet it was not for all that less considerable for the value,
seeing I had converted thirty thousand pieces of Eight

it by some Friends, which did not a little disquiet my
Mind, for it was a very difficult Task, for a Man, during
so long a Journey, to be able to secure himself from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

directed unto us in these Words:</p>
            <p>WE are very glad that you have made choice
of our Province for your Passage through,<note place="margin">

            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:65235:82"/>
We saw clearly by this Letter, that they knew nothing
of the Death of <hi>Grogniet,</hi> since they believed he was still
our Commander, and that they had no knowledge of
him, but by the Account that had been given them by
the three Men that had run away from him to them,
when they failed of getting the Gold of the Mines of

            </p>
            <p>On the 7th. we met with an Ambuscade of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,<note place="margin">The <hi>Spaniards</hi> burn the Road.</note>
whom our Van-Guard forced to retire, and
lay in the Evening at an Hatto: The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who

we were very much incommoded, and our Horses were
even stifled with the Smoak: As we were sometimes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to stay till the Fire had burnt up all, to go forwards,
this very much retarded our March, and this was the
chief thing the <hi>Spaniards</hi> aim'd at, that their Men might
have leisure to finish a Retrenchment, whereof I shall
quickly have occasion to speak, which they erected un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to us at some distance off upon our Road, to
which also the Work they cut out for us to remove the
Barricadoes of Trees, wherewith they had encumber'd
the way, contributed very much; Insomuch, that not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to penetrate into their Designs, we perswaded
our selves that they did all this with no other intent
than to chagreen us only, as being not able to do worse
unto us; or I should have rather said, having not the
Courage for it.</p>
            <p>On the 8th. we passed on to a very fine Sugar-Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and as we were very desirous to take some Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
who might inform us of what was done, all our
Company filed off, and twenty of us staid behind in an
House, after they had set it on Fire, to oblige the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
to come and put it out, when they saw our Men
at a distance from them, and this they failed not to do:
But our Impatience being the means of discovering of us
too soon, they thereupon fled; yet we firing upon them,
wounded one, and took him, by whom we understood
that all their Reinforcements were coming together to
dispute our Passage, and that we were going to meet

our main Body, who had halted to wait for us,
and then jogged on till we came to a great Burrough,
where we found those three hundred Men, who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
were our continual Guard, for they gave us
Morning and Evening the Diversion of their Trumpets,
but 'twas like the Musick of the Enchanted Palace of
<hi>Psicha,</hi> who heard it without seeing the Musicians, for
ours marched on each side of us in places so covered with
Pine-Trees, that it was impossible to perceive them.</p>
            <p>We lay this Evening about a quarter of a League from
the said Burrough, upon an Ascent according to our usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
manner, who never incamped but upon high ground,
or in the Race of <hi>Savannas,</hi> for fear of being hemmed
in. We decamped on the 9th. in the Morning, after we
had reinforced our advanced Guard with forty Men more,
who were appointed to fire their Musquets at the Entries,
or Avenues of the Woods, that we might have a sight of
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in case they laid any Ambuscades for us:
in the mean time, about ten in the Morning we passed
on to a place that was so thin set with Wood, that we
might see a considerable distance from us, and seeing no
Enemy appear, we did not fire at all: But we did not
dream that we were seeking for that far before us, which
we had at the sides of us, for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who were
ranged to the Right and Left of our way, lying
on their Bellies, made their Discharges with so much
Precipitation, that there was no more than one half of
our advanced Guard who had time to answer their firing.
They killed us two Men presently, who were turned out
of the way, to pass undiscover'd of the Enemy; after
which we went to refresh our selves in a little Town that
was in our way, and lay half a League beyond it.</p>
            <p>We met with another Ambuscade on the 10th. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we were before-hand with our Enemies, and made
them leave us their Horses, then went to bait at another

we met with a new Ambuscade a little on this side
it, and when we had forced them with our Fusils to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
we went into the said Town, being resolved, and
disposed to Fight stoutly, as believing if the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
were minded to try us, they would use their greatest
Effort in the place, but they contented themselves with

firing only a few Musquet-shot at us from under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert

which encompass the Town whither they were retired:
We found nothing there to eat, because they had burnt
all the Provision in the place.</p>
            <p>By good luck we took a Prisoner to conduct us to the

off; for as much as those who had been our Guides as

Prison; the Churches here are but very indifferently
built, and the place of Arms is both very considerable,
and very fine; it's an Inland place forty Leagues off
from the South-Sea. The way that leads to it from the
place where we were, is very difficult, being all Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of a prodigious height, to the tops whereof we
must creep with great danger, and the Valleys conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
are so very narrow here, that for a League of
even Ground you pass over, you have six Leagues of
Mountains to go: When we had past these Mountains
we felt a very sharp Cold, and were taken with so thick
a Fog, that even when day appear'd, we could not know
one another no otherwise than by our Voices; but that
lasted not till above ten in the Morning, when the Wei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Heat which succeeds the Cold, becomes there very great,

of Quagmires in others, and embarassed with a great
many Trees that had dropped down to the Ground with
Age: And tho' after all, we should have found out a
way to escape a-cross so many Obstacles, there was still
an indispensible necessity that we should fight with the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> that we might be at quiet for the rest of our
Journey. This they all agreed to; but, as they objected
unto me, that it was to no purpose to represent these
Difficulties, which of themselves were but too appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
without proposing some Method to surmount them,
nor to give Counsel without facilitating the execution
thereof:<note place="margin">The Author's Advice about forcing them.</note> I told them, that for my part, I could not see
what else we could do, but go cross those Woods, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices,
Mountains, and Rocks, how unaccessible soever
they appeared to be, and endeavour to surprize the
Enemy in the Rear, and to gain the Advantage of the
Ground from them, by getting above them, where
surely we were not expected; and that I would answer
for the Success of the same at the Peril of my Life, if
they would undertake it: That as for our Prisoners,
Horses, and Baggage, wherewith we were incumbred,
we ought not to leave them defenceless, to the Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those Three Hundred Men, who always kept
close to us in our March, and encamped every Evening
about a Musquet-shot off; That we ought to leave
Fourscore Men to Guard them with all necessary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution,
as you'll hear by and by, and that such a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
was enough to fight with so many <hi>Spaniards</hi> four
times told.</p>
            <p>We took some time to deliberate hereupon, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
length these Expedients, how hazardous soever they
were, being found the most suitable to the Condition
we were in, and I may say, the only ones we had left
us, we resolved to lay hold of them, and put the same
in execution.</p>
            <p>Sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rce had we projected the Design, and considered
the Ascent where we were, the Situation of the opposite
Mountain, where the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had made their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments,
but that above the highest of them we
saw a Road, which we took to be the Continuation of
that which they had shut up against us, and turning to
the Right, went winding about the side of the same
Mountain, which yet we could not discover but with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
and by Lights peeping in between the Trees,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:65235:84"/>
which would allow us to see but some traces at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

            <p>As we had not hitherto resolved upon which side to
pitch, in order to get behind those Intrenchments, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

well satisfied, that if we could but once cross it, it would

had already seized upon a considerable Ascent of the
Mountain, by clambering up to it in great silence, and
leaving the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Retrenchments on our left, we
saw their Party that went the Rounds; who, thanks to
the Foggs that are very rife in this Country (as I have
already said) till Ten a Clock, did not discover us. As
soon as they were gone by, we went directly to the Place
where we saw them, and found it to be exactly the
Road we were minded to seize on: When we had made
an Halt for about half an hour to take breath, and that
we had a little Day-light to facilitate our March, we
followed this Road by the Voice of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who
were at their Morning Prayers, and we were but just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
our March, when unfortunately we met with
two Out-Sentinels, on whom we were forced to Fire,
and this gave the <hi>Spaniards</hi> notice, who thought of
nothing less than to see us come down from above them
upon their Retrenchment, since they expected us no
other way than from below: So that those who had the
Guard thereof, and were in Number about Five Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Men, finding themselves on the outside, when they
thought they had been within, and consequently open
without any Covert, took the Alarm so hot, that
falling all on upon them at the same time, we made
them quit the Place in a moment, and make their Escape
by the favour of the Fogg.</p>
            <p>This so much unexpected Morning Musick disturbed
the whole Oeconomy of their Designs,<note place="margin">They prevail against the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
               </note> and so thwarted
their whole Contrivance, that those of the other two
Retrenchments drew all without the lowermost, where
they prepared to defend themselves; We fought with
them a whole hour from under the Covert of the first
Retrenchment, which we had got of them, and which
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:65235:85"/>
exactly commanded them, because of its elevated Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
upon the Mountain: But as they gave no Ground,
we began to think that the Shot we discharged, did not
reach them, because of the Fogg which hindred us to
discover them, and that we could not Fire but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Discharges that came from them; so that
being resolved to lose our Aim no longer, we advanced,
and fell directly upon the Place from whence they fired:
There we fought them stoutly, and they did not quit
the Place, 'till such time as they saw the butts of our
Musquets, and that near them, the sight whereof the
Mist had till then taken from them; But then being
much terrified, they left us all, and ran that way which
was before their Retrenchments, which proved very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious
for them; because that being the only
Place by which they thought we could come at them,
they had cut down all the Trees that grew there, and
in the adjacent Parts, as well because they might obstruct
their sight in this Bottom, as hinder us to come
on under the covert of them: And thus the Precaution
which they had taken against us, by a quire contrary
Effect was turned upon themselves, insomuch that we
had so clear a view of them from the Retrenchments
we had taken, that we did Execution almost with every
Piece we shot. We pursued them after that for some time,
still beating them, but at length being weary, both of
running and killing, we returned to the Retrenchments
where the Five Hundred Men, whom we had put to
flight at first, being come back, endeavoured to break
in upon those whom we had left to Guard them, but we
made them like the rest quickly run away. We were
also fatigued mightily in pursuing of them, for besides
that the Ground was so extraordinary bad, and hard to
pass, they had also augmented the Difficulties, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
use of the Trees which they had fell'd down, to
barricade and stop up even the least Avenue that was
near the Place round about.</p>
            <p>We found these <hi>Spaniards</hi> had so little Mind to give us
Quarter,<note place="margin">The strange <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </note> if they should have the upper hand of us, that
even when we took any of them, they would not as much
as ask it at our hands, and to some of them we gave
Quarter in spite of their Teeth, tho' they did other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
all that ever they could to save themselves out of
our hands: But at this no man ought to wonder, for
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:65235:86"/>
it's a Maxim amongst them in these Parts, and whereof
we have had Experience upon several Occasions,
whether it proceed from Pride, or natural Fierceness of
Temper, or because of an Oath they take before their
Commander, before they go to Fight, that they will
never submit to ask Quarter of those, to whom, they
have swore they would give none: But we in the mean
time being affected with Compassion upon sight of the
great quantity of Blood we saw running down into the
Rivulet, spared the rest, and went a second time into
our Intrenchments, having lost all this while but one
Man, and two only wounded. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> among
others, lost their General, who was an old <hi>Walloon</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer,
who had given them the Plan of this Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that would infallibly have prevailed against us,
had we attacked them by the way they expected. In
the mean time another old Captain had advised him to
secure their Rear, but he saw so little likelihood of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
on that side, that he answered, we must be either
Men or Devils; that if we were Men, he defied us to
get over any way in Eight days time; but if we were
Devils, tho he should take never so much care of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
he must still be taken.</p>
            <p>However, at the sollicitation of the said Officer, he
sent a Party that way to go the Rounds, and to Post
the two Sentinels we spoke of, as they thought most
convenient. The General being searched, there were
several Letters found in his Pockets, which had been
writ to him by the Governours of the Province, that
set forth particularly the Number of Men they had sent
him; and one, among others, from the General of <hi>Costa

                  <p>I Thought I had made a good Choice,<note place="margin">The General of <hi>Costa Rica</hi> his Letter to the Chief Officer.</note> when I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to you the Conduct of an Affair which
ought to re-establish our Reputation, if you have th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
better of the Enemy, as you induce me to believe you
will; I was preparing to send you Eight Thousand
Men, if you had not sent me word that Fifteen Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:65235:86"/>
was enough. I do not doubt but a Person that
hath served so long as you have done, will take care of
your Men, especially since you have to do with a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
from whom there will no Honour redound to you
by over-doing them.</p>
                  <p>According to the Relation you have given me of
your Retrenchments, it's impossible but those People,
with the help of God, must be destroyed: I Advise
you to put a Thousand Men into them, and Two
Hundred near unto the River, by which they hope to
get unto the North Sea. In case any of them save
themselves cross the Mountains, Don <hi>Rodrigo Sarmado,</hi>
the new Governour of <hi>Tuisigal,</hi> ought to be at the
Head of Three Hundred Men, to fall upon the Rear,
as soon as ever they are engaged, for certainly their
Baggage must be there. Take good Measures, for
those Devils have a Cunning and Subtilty that is not
in use amongst us.</p>
                  <p>When you find them advance within the shot of
your Harquebusses, let not your Men fire but by
Twenties, to the end your firing may not be in vain,
and when you find them weakened, raise a Shout to
frighten them, and fall in with your Swords; while
Don <hi>Rodrigo</hi> Attacks them in the Rear. I hope God
will favour our Designs, since they are no other than
for his Glory, and the Destruction of these new sort
of <hi>Turks;</hi> Hearten up your Men, tho' they may have
enough of that according to your Example; They
shall be rewarded in Heaven, and if they get the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
they will have Gold and Silver enough, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
these Thieves are laden.</p>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>After we had sung <hi>Te Deum</hi> upon the Field of Battle,
by way of Thanks unto God for this Victory, we
mounted Sixty Men on Horseback to go and give notice
to our other People of the Success the Almighty was
pleased to give us. We found them ready to begin
another Engagement against the Three Hundred <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
whereof we have spoken, who, as soon as they
heard that Action at the Retrenchments begin, and saw
how few Men we had left behind in our Camp,
were easily induced to believe we had made our Attack
by that disadvantageous way I have spoke of, as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
it impossible for us to do it in any other Place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:65235:87"/>
and that therefore our Ruin must be inevitable; Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that instead of entring directly into the Place,
which, considering their Number, they could have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
in a moment, they had so little Courage, that they
contented themselves to send an Officer to our Men
that guarded the Baggage, to Parley with them, whom
they stopped for a time, in expectation of some News
from us, that so they might return an Answer conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Intelligence they received. And thus the
Platform I had laid whereon to ground the sufficiency
of Fourscore of our Men for that Work, or rather the
Cowardize of the Enemy, was fully confirmed.</p>
            <p>They told us, that as soon as we had begun the Fight,
those Three Hundred <hi>Spaniards</hi> advanced a little, and
having got upon an Emmence that commanded our
Camp, they alighted, and sent them the said Officer to
make the following Harangue to them.</p>
            <p>I come hither from my General;<note place="margin">A <hi>Spanish</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer's Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ch to a part of the <hi>Free booters.</hi>
               </note> you say, you do
not question but you have Force enough, and that
you are Men of Courage, which you have let us know
whenever you have been minded to make your selves
Masters of our Country; yet you are not to doubt but
the great numbers of Men we have got together, will
over-power you. We are to let you understand, there are
a Thousand Men in that Retrenchment against whom
they are gone to fight, where they are worsted; that
we are Three Hundred Men in this Place, and that
Two Hundred are posted near to the River you go and
seek, to wait for those of you who escape out of the
Fight: Wherefore if you will give your selves up Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners
of War into the Power of our General, who is
a Man of Honour, we will be Friends, and we will let
you pass to your own Country: But as to those of
your Men whom ours have taken alive, their Almoner,
yesterday after Prayers, begged Quarter for them, for
the Honour of the Holy Sacrament, and Glorious
Virgin, which has been promised unto them.</p>
            <p>Our Men hearing him talk at this rate, were already
somewhat alarmed, as fearing what he said was true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but as soon as they saw us come at a distance, they took
Courage, and returned him as fierce an Answer, like
Men who had no fear upon them, to this purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:65235:87"/>
Though you had had Force enough to destroy two
thirds of our Number,<note place="margin">Their bold Answer.</note> we should not fail still to
fight with the remaining part; yea, tho there were but
one Man of us left, he should fight still against you
all.</p>
            <p>When we put ashoar, and left the South Sea, we
all resolved to pass through your Country, or die in
the Attempt; and tho' there were as many <hi>Spaniards</hi>
of you as there is Grass in this <hi>Savanna,</hi> we should
not be afraid, but look upon you always in our Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
Cowards, and we will pass on, and go where we
will in spight of your Teeth.</p>
            <p>The Officer being dismiss'd upon our arrival, mounted
his Horse to return from whence he came, and observing
we were booted, and mounted upon his Companions
Horses who guarded the Retrenchments, he shrunk up
his shoulders, by way of amazement, and rode as fast as
he could to carry the News to his own Party. As soon
as he was got to them, who were not above a Musquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot
off, we advanced, and fell upon them, to put them
out of Condition all at once to follow us any more: We
received their first Firing, to which we made no return
otherwise than with our Pistols and Cutlasses,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>They defeat the</hi> Spaniards.</note> and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily
for them who had not yet got upon their Horses,
for we cut a great many of them to pieces, insomuch
that God crowning all the Advantages we had had in
the rest of our Engagements, by the Success we had in
this last, we let the rest go, detaining only their Horses;
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> when we had broken all their Arms, we with our
Baggage rejoyned our main Body, who staid still upon
the Place to Guard the Retrenchments. We had no
more than one Man killed in this Engagement (as 'twas
in the other) and two maimed.</p>
            <p>We asked some of the Prisoners, whom we had taken,
several Questions, and they told us, among other things,
that we should still meet with another Retrenchment
upon the Road, about six Leagues distant from those
we quitted, which made us fear, with very great reason,
lest the Fugitives should go and possess themselves of
it, with a design to dispute our Passage once more: And
indeed we saw Fire upon the top of a great Mountain,
which they had made for a Signal to gather their scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
Troops together, and those who out of the fear
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:65235:88"/>
they were in, might perhaps hide themselves for Eight
Days together, had it not been for this, as believing us
still at their heels: But we prevented their Design, so
we lay two Leagues from thence to cut off their Passage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
there being no other way than this by which they might
get thither, and whose sides were still less accessible the
farther you went on, than they were behither the same
We had cut the Hams of Nine Hundred of their Horse
before, that so they might be made unfit to pursue us;
we took much about the same Number of them with us
to ease our Journey, till we came at the River we were
in quest of, and to kill and salt them upon our arrival,
that so they might serve us for Food in that long
Passage.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>15th.</hi> we passed by the forementioned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment,<note place="margin">They get to a River, and build Piperies.</note>
which was not yet finished, without any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
this proceeding in all appearance from the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
which the noise of our Victory had struck into the
People, and lay at an Hatto three Leagues beyond it.
On the <hi>16th.</hi> we lay at another six Leagues farther; and
at last, on the <hi>17th.</hi> which was the sixteenth day sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
our setting out, we came to the so much desired River,
and presently entred into the Woods that grow upon
the Banks thereof, where every one fell to work in good
earnest to cut down Trees to build Piperies, wherein
we might go down the same.</p>
            <p>Some perhaps may think that these were some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
Vessels, wherein to carry us with ease down the
River, but there was nothing less than that in it. What
we called Piperies, were four or five Stocks of one kind
of Tree, which they called <hi>Mahot;</hi> it's a light floating
sort of Wood, which, after we have taken off the Bark,
we joyn and tye together, instead of Cords, with a sort
of Lines that grow in these Woods, and cling like Ivy
unto every thing that is near them, and especially to
Trees, to the height whereof they mount; and when
these Pieces are set together, they put two or three Men
upon them, according to the bigness of the Pipery, and
this is all the Equipment we make thereof.</p>
            <p>The surest posture we can find our selves to be in, is to
stand upright thereon, tho' they sink two or three Foot
under Water; and you may judge by what follows, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the continual apprehensions of Danger we were in,
were well or ill grounded.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:65235:88"/>
We built ours no bigger than to hold two Men, that
so they might the more easily pass between those very
harrow Rocks we foresaw, by those that already pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
themselves to our view, we must meet with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we got unto the Sea-side. When this pretty Flota
was in a condition to put out, we dragged it to the
River-side, after we had furnish'd our selves with long
Poles, to keep up from being driven too violently upon
the Rocks, where we were apprehensive we should be
carryed by the violence of the Stream, as it came also
frequently to pass.</p>
            <p>This River springs in the Mountains of <hi>Segovia,</hi> and
discharges it self into the North Sea at Cape <hi>Gracias a
Dios,</hi> after having run a very long way in a most rapid
manner cross a vast number of Rocks of a prodigious
bigness, and by the most frightful Precipices that can
be thought of, besides a great many Falls of Water, to
the Number of at least an Hundred of all sorts, which
it's impossible for a Man to look on without trembling,
and making the Head of the most fearless to turn round,
when he sees and hears the Water fall from such an
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eight into those tremendous Whirlpools. In short, the
whole is so formidable, that there are none but those
who have some Experience, can have right conceptions
of it: But for me, who have passed these Places, and
who, as long as I live, shall have my Mind filled with
those Risques I have run, it's impossible I should give
such an Idea hereof but what will come far short of
what I have really known of them.</p>
            <p>'Twas therefore upon this dangerous River that we
went down,<note place="margin">A strange way of floating down the River.</note> suffering our selves to be carryed along at
the will of the Stream, in these pitiful Machines, whereof
the greatest part was under Water, as has been said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
two or three Foot, insomuch that we were almost
always up to the middle therein: But this was nothing
in comparison of the rapidity of it, which many times
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urried us, in spight of all the resistance we could make,
into the bublings of foaming Water, where we now
and then found our selves buried with our pieces of Wood,
which made many of our Men tye themselves thereon,
as being in hopes, the Wood, that floated, would bear
them up still upon the Water, but in this some of them
were mistaken.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:65235:89"/>
But as for those great Falls, they had, to our good
Fortunes, at their entrance and goings out, a great Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin
of still Water, which gave us the Opportunity to
get upon the Banks of the River, and draw our Piperies
ashoar, to take off those things we had laid on them,
which, as wet as we were, we carryed with us, leaping
from Rock to Rock, till we came to the end of the
Fall, from whence one of us afterwards returned to put
our Pipery into the Water, and let her swim along to
him who waited for her below: But if he failed to catch
hold (by swimming) of those pieces of Wood, before they
got out of the Bason below, the violence of the Stream
would carry them away to rights, and the Men must
then be necessitated to go and pick out Trees to make
another.</p>
            <p>We thought at our setting out to go down the Water
all together, to the end, that in case of any Accident<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
one might give Assistance to the other; But at the end
of three days, when I knew the danger we exposed our
selves to in this way of Swimming together, which had
already been the occasion of our losing many Piperies,
I set my self against the design of our continuing thus
together, by demonstrating to all our Men; That now
we had no <hi>Spaniards</hi> in these Parts to conflict with, but
only the Difficulties of this dangerous River, it was
convenient on the contrary to allow every Crew of us to
advance a little before the other, and to keep as it were
in a Line successively, that so in case the first were ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
(as indeed it came to pass) by the violence of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
Stream upon the Rocks on the brink of the Water,
whereof the River is full in an infinity of places; they
might have time at least to get off before the arrival of
the next Pipery, which had already wrought so much
Disorder by the Wrecks that had been occasioned by their
falling foul on one another, that all of us were in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
danger of perishing.</p>
            <p>I afterwards found, as well as several others of our
People, who had made Tryal hereof, that this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
was not useless to us; for my Pipery happening to
be cast upon such a Place, I was forced to untye the
pieces of Wood, and to straddle upon one piece, while
my Companion did the same upon another, and so leave
our selves to be carryed down in this manner at the
pleasure of the Stream, till it pleased God that we should
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:65235:89"/>
meet with a Place, as we did indeed, that was not so
ripid, where we could go upon the Bank of the River,
which we could not have done if others had immediately
followed us. I also advised, that those who went down
first, should take care to set up in the most dangerous
Places a Flag or Banner at the top of a long Pole, that
so we might discern it afar off, not so much to give
notice to those who were hindermost, that there was a
Fall in such a Place, for these would make themselves
to be heard almost a League off, but to signifie to them
what side they were to put to land, which should be
that where the Flag stood. These Methods being put in
practice, saved the Lives of a great many Men, though
for all these Precautions, several were also lost.</p>
            <p>The many Bananiers which we found along the Banks
of this River,<note place="margin">Their Food.</note> was almost the only Food that kept us
from starving; for our Arms being continually wet, and
our Powder all spoil'd, we could not possibly go a Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
tho' there is very good Game there; For as to the
Horse-Flesh which we had salted, we were forced to
throw it away in two days time, for it would not keep
in the Water any longer.</p>
            <p>These Bananiers have partly been planted by the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi>
who dwell along the sides of this River, and
partly by the overflowing of the Waters, which having
dragged them along, and then left them dry, they took
Root again, and so have multiplyed.</p>
            <p>Some days after we found,<note place="margin">Of the <hi>Indians</hi> in these Parts.</note> when we began to go
down the River, some Carbets of an <hi>Indian</hi> Nation, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Albaouins,</hi> whom we chased to get their Victuals;
there are a multitude of others, who dwell farther from
the brink thereof on the opposite side to the former,
and those of the one Bank have neither War nor Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
with those of the other.</p>
            <p>It was in this Place that those of our Men who had
lost their Money by Gaming,<note place="margin">The <hi>Freebooters</hi> Murder one another for their Money.</note> put their cruel Design in
Execution, and where I came to know that the warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
formerly given me, was too true: For these Wretches
being gone before, went and hid themselves behind the
Rocks that are upon the brink of this River, by which
we must necessarily pass. As every Man endeavoured to
save himself as well as he could, and that for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
already given, we went down the River at a distance
one from another, and without any mistrust, they had
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:65235:90"/>
but too much Time and Conveniency to pick out and
Murder five <hi>English-men,</hi> whom they knew to be some
of the best furnished with Booty, of which these As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sassines
entirely deprived them. My Companion and I
found their Bodies upon the Rivers side; and I must
freely confess, that such a Spectacle would have struck
no small Terror into me, if I had been still the bearer
of my winnings; I bless God with all my Heart, that
inspired me with a Design to quit my Treasure, being
then exposed, in going down the River as I was last after
the <hi>English,</hi> to the Treachery of those Villains, where
I must infallibly have run the same risque as they had
done. None of our People knew any thing of this
Murder, but when we were got all together farther
down, I told them what I had seen, which was fully
confirmed, as well by the absence of the dead Men, as
by that of the Assassines, who durst not come and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
us, and whom we never saw from thence-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>20th.</hi> of <hi>February</hi> we found the River large<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
and more spacious than before, and met with no more
Falls therein; But the same was so incumbred with
Trees and Bamboes, which the Floods carryed thither,
that our wretched Machines could not be kept from over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning;
but the depth of the Water in these Parts
being a means to moderate the rapidness of it, there
were not many drowned.</p>
            <p>At last,<note place="margin">The River proving good, they build Canoes.</note> when we were gone down some Leagues
farther, we found the River very good, the Stream very
gentle, and no likelihood of our meeting any more
Rocks nor Trees, tho' we had still above Sixty Leagues
to the Sea-side. Wherefore now finding our selves freed
from those Perils and Dangers which we had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to in such terrible Places, where Death in the
most frightful shape presented it self continually to our
view, every one began to resume fresh Courage, and
conceive good hopes of the remainder of the Voyage;
insomuch that being now all of us assembled together
in the same Place where those who had gone before staid
for them that came after, and that we had now before
us how we should go quite through with the rest of our
Voyage, we agreed to divide our selves into several Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
each consisting of Sixty Men, to build Canoes
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:65235:90"/>
out of <hi>Mapou</hi> Wood, which sort of Trees grow in great
numbers upon the Banks of the said River.</p>
            <p>Having with wonderful Diligence finished four Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes
by the first of <hi>March,</hi> for the use of an Hundred
and Twenty Men that were of us in one Canton, we
put them into the Water, and embarked thereon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
staying for an Hundred and Forty more, who were
finishing theirs; the ardent desire we had to be as soon
is possibly satisfied, whether we should really be able to
reach the North Sea, egged us mightily to put on; for
according to the Idea we had conceived of our Passage,
we were apprehensive of being carryed back into that of
the South, as not being able to think we could be so
Happy as to recover the sight of a Sea by which we
might be carryed home to our Native Countries, and
which we had for so considerable a time longed for.</p>
            <p>The <hi>English,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>English</hi> get first to the Sea-side.</note> who would not make any Canoes, had
got in their Piperies before us to the Sea-side: Here they
met with an <hi>English</hi> Boat from <hi>Iamaica</hi> at Anchor, whom
they were very forward to press to go and ask Leave
of the Governour of that Island for their safe coming
thither, because they had gone out without any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission;
but that Vessel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> being unwilling to go thither,
without they laid down Six Thousand Pounds <hi>Sterling</hi>
by way of Advance, and they being not in a condition
to run the hazard of such a Sum, because many of them
had lost their Money, as several amongst us had done,
which they would have carryed with them, by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setting
of the Piperies, they staid with the <hi>Moustick
Indians,</hi> that dwell some Leagues to Windward of the
Mouth of this River, and who are very kind to them,
because of the Trinkets they bring them from <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>a.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus that Boat proving to be of no use to these <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi>
they politickly bethought themselves to send us
word hereof, as hoping we, in acknowledgment of this
Kindness, would obtain leave of the Governour of St.
<hi>Domingo</hi> for them to retire, and be proteceted in that
Island. This News we received by two <hi>Moustick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi>
whom in a Boat they sent to meet us Forty
Leagues up the River, and who told us, that there should
no more than Forty Men only come down, because that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hip could contain no more, by reason of the smalness
of it, and its scantiness of Provision: But for all this,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:65235:91"/>
the Hundred and Twenty that made up one of our
Companies, went down together, for every one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be of the number of the said Forty.</p>
            <p>Though this River we are now leaving, is by some
<hi>Spanish</hi> Maps made to run directly fourscore Leagues,<note place="margin">The length of the River.</note> and
then to fall into the North Sea, yet we have computed
the same to run above Three Hundred, being almost
always carryed to the South-East for to go to the North.</p>
            <p>We happily arrived on the <hi>9th.</hi> at the Mouth of the
River at Cape <hi>Gracia de Dios,</hi> and entred into the Sea,
which with much Satisfaction we knew to be that of
the North, where we were obliged to wait for the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Ship that was at the Isles of <hi>Pearls,</hi> which are a
dozen Leagues distant from that Cape to the East:
Here we staid till the <hi>14th.</hi> with the <hi>Mulasters</hi> that live
in these Parts, and who fed us for some days with Fish.</p>
            <p>This Cape, which stands on the Continent, hath been
inhabited for a long time by these <hi>Mulasters</hi> and <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>A De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of Cape</hi> Gracia de Dios.</note>
both Men and Women, who have greatly mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied
there, since a <hi>Spanish</hi> Ship, bound from <hi>Guinea,</hi>
freighted with their Fathers, was lost by coming too
near the Shoar, which is very dangerous in these Party:
Now, those who had escaped the Shipwrack were cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously
received by the <hi>Moustick Indians</hi> living about
this Canton, who were well pleased with the loss of that
Ship, and of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> their Enemies that were in
it.</p>
            <p>Those <hi>Indians</hi> assigned their new Guests a place to
grub up,<note place="margin">Of the <hi>Indians</hi> of these Parts, and their manner of Living.</note> where they built themselves Cottages in the
finest Country of <hi>Savanna's,</hi> that reach along the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
from the Mouth of it for five or six Leagues up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
Here for their Sustenance they Plant <hi>Maes,
Bananiers,</hi> and <hi>Magniots,</hi> which the <hi>Indians</hi> gave them;
They also taught them to make a most Nourishing sort
of Drink, which they call <hi>Hoon;</hi> they prepare the same
of a Fruit that is produced on the top of a kind of a
Palm-Tree, which grows naturally in these Woods, and
never exceeds ten Foot in height: Each of these Trees
bears no more than one Bunch or Grape, but most of
them are a full Load for one Man: Its Grain is of the
same form and thickness as an Olive; some of them are
yellowish, others reddish, and containing in a very hard
stone an exceeding oily Kernel: They pound the Fruit,
Stone, and Kernel all together, boyling the same after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:65235:91"/>
in Water, and this makes up all the Composition:
When the same is grown cold, or but lukewarm, they
put what quantity they are minded to drink into a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labass
pierced through with small holes like unto a
Skimmer; this Drink, besides that it is very Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and fattens very much, is also a pleasanter Liquor
than any that is to be met with among the other <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
the same being only peculiar to this Nation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Mulasters</hi> are all a very tall People, and go al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
naked, saving their Privy-Parts, which they
cover, Nature having provided for them upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
a kind of greyish stuff, which they pull from a
Tree, called the <hi>Bastard-Palm,</hi> the top of whose Stock
is wrapped up in some Fathoms of it, from the first
rising of its Branches some feet downwards, according
to the thickness of each of these Trees: This stuff is
also a great help to them to make Coverlets, wherewith
to cover them in the Night; and some of those People
who live more at ease, wear Shirts and Drawers, which the
<hi>English</hi> bring them from <hi>Iamaica.</hi> They are the boldest
People in the World for exposing themselves to the
Perils of the Sea, and undoubtedly the most expert in
the Art of Fishing: They'll commit themselves to the
Waves in these little Boats, or such like, which an able
Seaman will scarce venture to do, and here they will stay
for three or four days together, being no more concerned,
let the Weather be what it will, than if they were made
of the same piece as their Boat; and provided they can
but once set sight of the Fish, tho' swimming never so
low in the Water, they will not fail to take him, so
dextrous are they at this Work.</p>
            <p>They many times do our <hi>Freebooters</hi> a Kindness,
when they take them on Board with them, upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of letting them have a share of what Booty is
got, which must be exactly performed unto them: For
if you once deceive them, you must no longer expect
their Assistance; and this Temper is peculiar almost to
all the <hi>Indian</hi> Nations in these Parts, that they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
go again, when once you have broke your Word
with them.</p>
            <p>The Ancient <hi>Mousticks,</hi> who gave these Men I have
spoken of, Entertainment, live about ten or a dozen

But about Fifty of us, for all that, being more

thinking it unadviseable to go ashoar again, to commit

for to prevent a greater Number from entring in, we
being already piled as it were on the top of one another,
we weighed Anchor, and departed.</p>

surprized the Hunters belonging to that Place, whom we
obliged to sell us the Victuals they had took, by giving
them their own Price for it: But this our Liberality to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

that we were uncertain whether our Nation was at Peace or

they flew to their Arms to fire upon them, as imagining
they were Enemies, tho' we assured them we were now

return without any more ado to our own Country;
Whereunto I cannot but farther add, that for my own

could not, for the space of Fifteen Days, take my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn

                  <p>A Relation of the Voyage made by Captain <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauband,</hi>
commonly called <hi>Montauban,</hi> is at last
come to my hands, and I have sent you the same in
print: There is no doubt but you will admire, as well
as I, how much his Prudence and Courage have been
instrumental to deliver him from many unhappy Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,
where another must infallibly have perish'd.
You will remember as soon as you begin to read, to
have seen some of his Men at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> in the Year
One Thousand Six Hundred Ninety and Four; from
thence it was he departed the following Year to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the Voyage you are here presented with: He
gave chase to several Ships he met with in his way;
he fought with a Frigate carrying Thirty sour Guns,
at Cape <hi>Verde;</hi> he met with an <hi>English</hi> Ship of Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Guns, at Cape <hi>St. Iohn,</hi> which he took after a short
Fight; after which, he took a <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> Caper,
and sailed away for <hi>Angola;</hi> near the Shoar he met
with the <hi>English</hi> Guardship, being a Frigate carrying
Fifty four Pieces of Cannon, this Ship he fought
for Five or Six Hours, and both of them very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ravely
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:65235:94"/>
boarded one another, and as he was about to make
himself Master of the said Ship, the <hi>English</hi> Captain
set fire to his Powder, and so both the Ships blew up
into the Air with a terrible crack.</p>
                  <p>You will have the pleasure to contemplate, in the
Perusal of this Book, (as if you stood upon the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,)
this tremendous Shipwrack; as also, see how
the Sieur <hi>de Montauban,</hi> together with Fifteen or
Sixteen of his Men were saved. He suffered Hunger
for above Three Days together, and at last arrived at
<hi>Cape Lopez,</hi> from whence he went to visit the King of
that Country, of whose Court and Kingdom he has
given us here a Description: He speaks also of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
and advances a Project how to settle the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholick Faith in those Parts: He stood for Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
at the baptizing of a Son of Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> the
foresaid King's Son. He went on board a <hi>Portuguese</hi>
Ship, in order to his Passage to <hi>Europe;</hi> An <hi>English</hi>
Man that was his Friend, took him aboard his Vessel,
and carried him to <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> where he was confined
to his Chamber by Colonel <hi>Russel</hi> who was Governour
of those Islands: He was freed from thence, and went
to <hi>Martinico,</hi> where he saw Monsieur <hi>de Frontenas,</hi>
General of the <hi>French</hi> Islands. From thence he got
into <hi>France,</hi> being very uncertain whether he shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to Sea again. But, Sir, all these Adventures are
set forth in so natural and easie a Style, that you cannot
but infallibly observe the Sincerity and Generosityo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the
Author. It's true, our Seafaring Men are not so polite
as those that live ashoar, and that proceeds for want of
Society and Conversation; but to make amends for that,
they are an hundred fold more sincere than the other.
And thus, Sir, do not think a Seafaring Man will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
upon you; for my self, I have several times heard
<hi>Montauban</hi> in Person give a Relation of this same
Voyage, but I could never observe that he vary'd in
any one thing at any time; and the free and generous
Air wherewith he deliver'd those brave Actions he has
performed in Fight, would perswade you of the Truth
of what he hath related. It's not for any Ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that he has written this Account; he has in the
very beginning thereof declared openly enough, that
he had no other End in doing it, than to give a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of State an Account (as he calls it) of his Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne.
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:65235:94"/>
In short, if you are dubious in respect to the
Fight where the Sieur <hi>de Montauban</hi> was Shipwracked,
you may recollect your self, and find you have read
the same in the <hi>Gazettes</hi> of <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October</hi> this

by an adverse Fortune lost all that Wealth which
with so much Care and Trouble I had amassed together,
I should take no manner of pleasure in this place to call

of the last Campagne, had not a desire of serving
still both the publick and particular Persons, as well as
to let His Majesty know the Affection and Weddedness
I have always had for his Service, made me take Pen in
hand to give Monsieur <hi>de Phelipeaux</hi> an Account of such
Observations as I have made; wherein he may also find
with what eagerness I have penetrated to the remotest
Colonies of our Enemies, in order to destroy them and
ruine their Trade.</p>
               <p>I was not willing to swell up this Relation with an

<hi>Cape Verd,</hi> which last Place I had been at Twenty
Years ago, having begun to use the Seas at the Age of
Sixteen.</p>
               <p>I could also have added hereunto the Campaign I
have made in One Thousand Six Hundred Ninety and
One, when being Commander of the Ship called the

the great River <hi>Serelion,</hi> and took a Fort from the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:65235:95"/>
where they had Four and twenty Pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non;
which I caused to be split, that they might be of
no farther use unto them.</p>
               <p>But I am desirous to confine my self to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of my last Voyage, because it is the nearest,
and that which is yet fresh in the Memory of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
Notice and some Information having been given
thereof by the Noise made in <hi>France</hi> and elsewhere, of
the burning of my Ship, and the terrible Crack it made
in the Air.</p>
               <p>In the Year One Thousand Six Hundred and Ninty
Four, after I had ravaged the Coast of <hi>Caraqua,</hi> I went
up to Windward towards <hi>St. Croix,</hi> where I understood
that there were some Merchant Ships, with a Convoy,
to come from <hi>Barbadoes</hi> and <hi>Nevis,</hi> and bound for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and upon the same Information I resolved to sail
up to the height of the <hi>Bermudos,</hi> hoping to take this
small Fleet, and so to make a good Booty of it. I was
scarce got thither, but that I saw them appear, and sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
directly towards me, without any Apprehensions of
Danger upon them: But I presently attack'd their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,
called the <hi>Wolf,</hi> and took her, with Two more of
the Merchant Ships laden with Sugar, the rest having
made their Escape during the Fight. As I was carrying
my Prize into <hi>France,</hi> I met with another <hi>English</hi> Ship
of Sixteen Guns, coming from <hi>Spain,</hi> and bound also
for <hi>England,</hi> that after a short Fight struck, and which
I carried to <hi>Rochel,</hi> where the Admiralty adjudged the
same to be good Prize. When I had sold this Ship, I
carried my Three other Vessels to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> where I
arrived in <hi>September,</hi> One Thousand Six Hundred Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Four; and these last also being condemned as
good Prizes, I made it my Business presently to find out
Merchants that would buy them.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, my <hi>Freebooters,</hi> who had not seen
<hi>France</hi> in a long time, finding themselves now in a great
City, where Pleasure and Plenty reigned, were not back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to refresh themselves after the Fatigues they had
endured while so long absent from their native Country.
They spent a world of Money here, and proved horribly
Extravagant. The Merchants, and their Hosts, made
no Scruple to advance them Money, or lend them as
much as they pleased, upon the Reputation of their
Wealth, and the Noise there was throughout the City
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:65235:95"/>
of the valuable Prizes whereof they had a share: All
the Nights they spent in such Divertisements as pleased
them best, and the Days in running up and down the
Town in Masquerade, causing themselves to be carried
in Chairs, with lighted Flambeaux's at Noon Day; of
which Debauches some died, while Four of my Crew
fairly deserted me: So that now seeing I lost my Men,
notwithstanding all the Care I had taken, and strict In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions
I had laid upon them, I thought it advisable
for me to be gone from thence as soon as I could, that I
might keep the rest together.</p>
               <p>In the first place I supplied the room of those whom
I had lost, with as many <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> young Men, who
in a short time became as expert as the old ones; for
you are to observe, I made it my continual Care and
Business to teach my Men to shoot, and my so frequent
exercising of them, rendered them in a short time as
capable of Shooting and handling their Arms as the ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
Sea <hi>Freebooters,</hi> or the best Fowlers by Land.</p>
               <p>When I had revictualled my Ship, that carried no
more than Thirty four Pieces of Cannon, I left <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi>
in the Month of <hi>February,</hi> in the Year One
Thousand Six Hundred Ninety and Five, with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to go and cruise on the Coast of <hi>Guiney</hi> in <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</hi>
I got up to the <hi>Azores,</hi> which are Thirty seven Degrees
North Latitude, and cruised thereabouts for the space of
Eight Days, without any Purchase: From thence I passed
to the Canary Islands, which are in Twenty five Degrees
North Latitude: We discovered the Peak of <hi>Tenariff</hi>
a great way off, which they say is the highest Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in the World. They report these Mountains had
their Names from <hi>Dogs,</hi> which the <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>tins</hi> call <hi>Canis,</hi>
and which the <hi>Portugu se</hi> found here in great Numbers
upon their first Arrival. I cruised round about them for
Fourteen Days, in expectation of meeting with some
<hi>Dutch</hi> Ships which I was informed were to come that
way; and it proved to be really so: For the said Ships
came thither, but they got into Port before I could
reach them; and this made me sail away for the <hi>White
Cape,</hi> and the Isles of <hi>Cape Verd,</hi> that are between Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
and Eighteen Degrees North Latitude. Upon my
Arrival there, I found Two. <hi>English</hi> Ships lying at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
in the Road of the Isle of <hi>May,</hi> which made me
put out my Shallop to know what they were, and the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:65235:96"/>
same informed me that they were Two Interlope<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
carrying about Thirty Guns each. I resolved to board
and take them; to this end I lay by to come nearer
them, but as we bore upon one of the Points of this
Island, these Ships did not think fit to tarry for my co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
up; but smelling my Design, they made all ready,
and left their Cables and Anchors in the Road at which
their Shallops lay.</p>
               <p>I pursued them all Day, but Night coming on, I
lost sight of them, and returned to the Road from
whence they were gone, in order to take away the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and Anchors, and to sink the Shallops fastened by
them. When I had so done, I sailed away for the Isle
of <hi>St. Vincent,</hi> to caulker my Vessel in that Place, and
to take in Water and Wood. This Island also is one of
those of <hi>Cape Verd.</hi> Here I stay'd for the space of
Eight Days, at the end whereof, understanding by a
<hi>Portuguese</hi> Bark, that there were Two <hi>English</hi> Ships,
carrying from Twenty to Thirty Guns, at the Isle of
<hi>Fugo,</hi> one of which was resitting there, because of a
Fight she had been engaged in with some other Ships,
I presently weigh'd Anchor, and sailed away for the
said Island, which is not far distant from that of <hi>St. Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi>
being in hopes to meet with the Enemy in that
Place: But upon my Arrival, I understood by a <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guese,</hi>
that they were gone away, Four or Five Days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
in the Night, without saying any thing of the
Place whither they were bound, from the said Island of
<hi>Fugo,</hi> or <hi>Fire-Island.</hi> I thereupon steered my course
for t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Coast of <hi>Guiney,</hi> and first discovered the <hi>Cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
of Three Points,</hi> where I met with the Guardship, which
was a <hi>Dutch</hi> Frigate, carrying Thirty four Guns, and
cruised out at Sea. She quickly discovered me, and
made directly towards me, in order to know what I
was: As I had also on my part perceived her, and was in
hopes to come close and fight her, I hung up <hi>Dutch</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
that I might not frighten her away, but give her
an Opportunity to come up within Cannon-shot of me.
When I saw her near enough, I put up <hi>French</hi> Colours,
and gave her a Signal to strike, but instead thereof, she,
without any more ado, very bravely gave me a Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
and at the same time received one from me. We
continued to fight one another, in this manner, from
Morning till Four in the Afternoon, without my being
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:65235:96"/>
able to get the Weathergage, nor come up near enough
unto her, to make use, to any purpose, of my Fusils,
which are the chief Arms in such Ships as ours be; nor
to hinder her by the Favour of the Wind which she had
of me, to go and Anchor under the Fort of the <hi>Cape of
Three Points,</hi> where there were Two <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships more
fitted out for Men of War, one whereof carried Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
and the other Twenty eight Pieces of Cannon. I
presently thought these Three Ships had joined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in order to come out to fight me, which made me
lie by thereabouts, for a whole Day, in expectation of
them. I anchored also within a League of the Shoar,
hoping at length, that they, being spighted at my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting
of them in this manner, would be eager for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge:
But all this to no purpose; and in all Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
the Guardship had already found her self so ill
treated, that she had no occasion for a second Fight.
A small <hi>Portuguese</hi> Ship that passed by soon after, told
me these Ships were the same that had forced the
Sieur <hi>Rey,</hi> Captain of the King's Flute, called the <hi>Deep,</hi>
to leave that Coast; which also was confirmed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
unto me by the Sieur <hi>Rey</hi> himself, at the <hi>Prince's
Island,</hi> where I met him.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore that the Enemy would not fight,
and considering with my self it was not advisable for
me to attack them under the Cannon of the Fort, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to go to <hi>Cape Lopez,</hi> and to <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>St. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Isles:</hi> In my Passage I discovered <hi>Cape St. Iohn</hi> that
stands on the Continent of <hi>Guiney,</hi> as well as the <hi>Cape
of Three Points,</hi> and I happened to meet with an <hi>English</hi>
Ship of Twenty Guns, that had Three hundred and Fifty
Negro's, Elephants Teeth, and Wax on board it, which did
not cost me much pains to take her. The Captain told me
he was come from <hi>Ardra,</hi> where he had taken Five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and fifty Negro's on board, but that they had slain
some of them, because they had mutined against his
Ship's Crew, and that some more of them had made
their Escape to Land in his Shallop which they secretly
stole from him. <hi>Ardra</hi> is one of the principal Town<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
in <hi>Guiney,</hi> standing upon the Sea-side, and the usual
Residence of a Prince who governs a great Country in
this Part of the World.</p>
               <p>From thence I went to <hi>Prince's Isle,</hi> in sight whereof
I took a small <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> Caper, mounted with
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:65235:97"/>
Eight Pieces of Cannon, and carrying Sixty Men. She
cruised about this Latitude, and took all the Barks she
could light on, without distinction of Nation or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.
When I had done this, I went into the Port, in
order to clean my Ship, which was foul enough, and
that I might clear my self of the <hi>English</hi> Prize I had
taken, I sent her away to <hi>St. Domingo,</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> to
have the same condemned, under the Command of the
Sieur <hi>de Nave,</hi> and a sufficient Number of Men in her,
whom I picked out of my own Crew. But some time
after, I understood she was retaken by some <hi>English</hi> Men
of War that were before <hi>Little Goara.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time, that my Men might not be idle, I
gave my Officers Orders to see my Ship careened, while
I my self with the <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> Caper which I had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and Ninety Men whom I put on board her, went
out to cruise, and continued at it for Six Weeks, upon
the Coast of <hi>Guiney,</hi> or about the <hi>Prince's</hi> and <hi>St. Omer's
Islands,</hi> without meeting any Enemy. Whereupon I
retu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n'd back into the Road of the first of these Isles,
where I revictualled my Ship as soon as possibly I could;
and when all things were ready, I weigh'd Anchor, and
sailed directly for the Isle of <hi>St. Thomas,</hi> there either to
sell, or truck the Caper I had taken, which last I chose
to do for some Provisions, because I had not enough to
go and cruise long upon the Coasts of <hi>Angola,</hi> whither
I had resolved to go and spend Five or Six Months, in
order to avoid the <hi>English</hi> Ships they were fitting out
at the same Town of <hi>Guiney,</hi> which consisted of Three
Men of War, and a Fireship, and were designed to go
in quest of me, cruising about <hi>St. Thomas,</hi> where they
thought I should continue.</p>
               <p>As I left <hi>St. Thomas,</hi> I saw a Ship at Anchor, sailed
towards her, and gave her chase a long time; but I
could not prevent her getting to land at the Isle of
<hi>St. Omer,</hi> and staving to pieces in striving to take her; I
lose an Hundred and fifty Pounds of Gold Dust which
this <hi>Dutch</hi> Interloper had got in trading on this
Coast.</p>
               <p>This being over, I sailed for the Coasts of <hi>Angola,</hi>
which is Two hundred and fifty Leagues on the other
side of the Line: There I arrived on the Twenty second
of <hi>September,</hi> and understood, when I came within
Three Leagues of the Port of <hi>Cabinda,</hi> that there were
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:65235:97"/>
Two <hi>English</hi> Ships with Negro's on board in that place.
As I was to Leeward of that Port, I bore out to Sea, in
hopes next Day to have a South-West Wind that usually
blows from the Seaward, to help to recover the Port.
When Day appeared, I saw a Ship under <hi>English</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
bearing upon me, whom I did not presently take
to be a Man of War. But some time after, I discovered
she carried no less than Four and fifty Guns. I used all
the Art I could to amuse her, and for that end, I hung
out <hi>Dutch</hi> Colours, that I might also the more easily
come near her, while she on her part was not back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to amuse me, and by the Guns she fired from time
to time to assure me of her Friendship, endeavoured to
come up with me. When I perceived my Enemy's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
I took upon me to make a shew of waiting for
him, and sailed but very slowly, that I might make
him believe my Ship was heavy laden, or that I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred
for want of Sails and Hands. We kept in this
manner, from Break of Day till Ten in the Forenoon.
He gave me a Gun, from time to time, without Ball, to
assure me what he was, and as he supposed my Friend;
but finding at last I did not answer him, on my part,
in the same manner, and that we were now within Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-shot
of one another, he gave me one again with Ball,
which made me presently put up <hi>French</hi> Colours, and
answer him with another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hereupon the <hi>English</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
without any more ado, gave me Two Broadsides,
which I received without returning him one again, tho'
he had killed me Seven Men; for I was in hopes, if I
could have got somewhat nearer to him, to put him out
of Condition ever to get away from me: I endeavoured
to come within a Fusil-shot of him, and was desirous to
give him an Opportunity to shew his Courage, in board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me, since I could not so well do the same by him,
as being to Leeward. At last, being come by degrees
nearer, and found him within the reach of my Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sils,
which for that end I kept concealed upon the Deck
from his sight, they were discharged upon him,
and my Men continued to make so great a Fire with
them, that the Enemy on their part began quickly to
flag.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, as their Ship's Crew consisted of
above Three hundred Men, and that they saw their
Cannon could not do their Work for them, they resolved
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:65235:98"/>
to board us; which they did, with a great Shout, and
terrible Threatnings of giving no Quarter, if we did
not surrender. Their grappling Irons failing to catch
the Stern of my Ship, made theirs run in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that their Stern run upon my Boltsprit, and broke
it. Having observed my Enemy thus incumbred, my
Men plied them briskly with their Small-shot, and made
so terrible a Fire upon them, for an Hour and an half,
that being unable to resist any longer, and having lost a
great many Men, they left the Sport, and ran down
between Decks, and I saw them presently after make
Signals with their Hats of crying out for Quarter. I
caused my Men thereupon to give over their firing, and
commanded the <hi>English</hi> to embark in their Shallops,
and come on board of me, while I made some of my
Crew at the same time leap into the Enemies Ship, and
sieze her, and so prevent any Surprize from them. I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
rejoyced within my self for the taking of such a
considerable Prize, and so much the more, in that I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
that after having taken this Vessel that was the
Guardship of <hi>Angola,</hi> and the largest the <hi>English</hi> had in
those Seas, I should find my self in a Condition still to
take better Prizes, and attack any Man of War I should
meet with. My Ship's Crew were also as joyful as my
self and did the Work they were engaged in with a
great deal of pleasure; but the Enemy's Powder sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
taking fire, by the means of a Match the Captain
had left burning of purpose<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as hoping he might escape
with his Two Shallops, blew both the Ships into the
Air, and made the most terrible Crack that was ever
heard. It's impossible to set forth this horrid Spectacle
to the Life; the Spectators were themselves the Actors
of this bloody Scene, not knowing whether they saw
or saw it not, and not being able to judge of that
which themselves felt. Wherefore leaving the Reader to
imagine the Horror which the blowing up of two Ships
above Two hundred Fathom into the Air must work in
us, where there was formed as it were a Mountain of
Water, Fire, wrack of the Ships, Cordages, Cannon, Men,
with a most terrible Clap made, what with the Cannon
that went off in the Air, and the Waves of the Sea that
were tossed up thither; to which we may add the crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Masts and Boards, the rending of the Sails and
Ropes, the Cries of Men, and the Breaking of Bones:
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:65235:98"/>
I say, leaving these things to the Imagination of the
Reader, I shall only take notice of what befel my self,
and by what good Fortune it was that I escaped.</p>
               <p>When the Fire first began, I was upon the fore Deck
of my own Ship, where I gave the necessary Orders;
now I was carried up upon part of the said Deck so
high, that I fancy it was the height alone that prevented
my being involved in the Wreck of the Ships, where I
must have infallibly perish'd, and being cut into a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
pieces, I fell back into the Sea (you may be sure)
giddy headed enough, and continued a long time under
Water without being able to get up to the Surface of it.
At last, falling into a Debate with the Water, as a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
who was afraid of being drowned, I got upon the
face of it, and laid hold of a broken piece of a Mast
that I found near me. I called to some of my Men
who I saw swimming round about me, and exhorted
them to take Courage, hoping we might yet save our
Lives if we could alight upon any one of our Shallops.
But what yet afflicted me more than my very Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
was, to see Two half Bodies who had still some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of Life remaining in them, from time to time
mount up to the face of the Water, and leave the place
where they appeared all dyed with Blood. It was also
much the same thing, to see round about me a vast
number of Members and scattered Parts of Mens Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and most of them spitted upon Splinters of Wood.
At last, one of my Men having met with a whole Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop
among all that Wreck that swam up and down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Water, came to tell me that we must endeavour
to stop some Holes therein, and to take out the Canoe
that lay on board her: We got to the number of Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
or Sixteen of us who had escaped, near unto this
Shallop, every Man upon his piece of Wood, and took
the pains to loosen our Canoe, which at length we ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.
We went all on board her, and after we had
got in, saved our chief Gunner who in the Fight had
had his Leg broke. We took up Three or Four Oars,
or pieces of Boards which served us for that purpose;
and when we had done that, we sought out for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to make us a Sail, and a little Mast; and having
sitted up all things as well as possibly we could, we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
our selves to the Divine Providence who alone
could give us Life and Deliverance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:65235:99"/>
As soon as I had done working, I found my self all
over besmeared with Blood, that ran from a Wound I
had received in my Head at the time of my fall; we
made some Lint out of my Handkerchief, and a Fillet to
bind it withal out of my Shirt, after I had first washed
the Wound with Urine: The same thing was done to
the rest that had been wounded, and our Shallop in the
mean while sailed along, without making Land, or our
knowing where we were going: And what was still
more sad, was, that we had no Victuals, and we had
already spent three days without either eating or drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
One of our Men being greatly afflicted both with
Hunger and Thirst at the same time, drunk so much
Salt Water, that he died of it: Most of our Men vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
continually, whether it were that they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoded
with the Water that got into them when
they fell into the Sea, as it will happen if they drink of
it out of meer Necessity. As for my self, I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoded
for a long time: I afterwards swelled up
mightily, and my Excrements came from me in the
form of small Buttons; and I attribute to a Quartan
Ague, that seized on me soon after, the Cure of my
Dropsie, and Recovery of my Health, that by degrees
returned to me: I make no enumeration of the other
Inconveniencies which so dangerous a Fall brought upon
me, such being unavoidable to a Man that fell into so
great a Fire: All my Hair, Face, and one side of me
were burnt with the Powder; and the same Fate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
me, as usually does Bombardiers at Sea, and that
was, to bleed at the Nose, Ears, and Mouth. I do not
know whether this be the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ect of the Powder or no,
by swelling up those Vessels which contain the Blood in
our Bodies, to such an extraordinary degree, that the
ends of the Veins open and let it out; or that the great
noise, and violent motion that is wrought in those Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
makes the same happen. But let it come which
way it will, since there is no room here for a Consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Physicians, as long as we were dying of
Hunger, nor to enquire what became of the <hi>English,</hi>
when we had so much difficulty, and hardly could save
our selves, we continued our Course up the Current
with the help of our Oars, because we knew the same
came from the Port of <hi>Cabinda:</hi> But as the Wind was
against us, we could never get thither, and were forced
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:65235:99"/>
to be satisfied to get to the Cape of <hi>Corsa</hi> if we could,
which stands a dozen Leagues from that of <hi>Cathersna,</hi>
where we could not Land because of a Bar, that renders
the Coast unaccessible. That was our Design, but Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
hindred us to put the same in Execution, and we
were forced even to overcome the Obstacles which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
laid in our way, by running ashoar in spight of the
Bar: This we performed at last (after much difficulty)
being in hopes to find there some Negroes that might
furnish us with Victuals. One of our Company pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
landed, in order to go and seek out somewhat to
satisfie our Hunger; and by good Fortune found in a
Pond sticking to the Branches of Trees, some Oysters,
whereof he came presently to give us notice. We went
all up to the very Pond along a Channel of the Sea,
where we were no sooner come, but we eat lustily of the
Oysters with a very good Appetite: We opened them
with the few Knives we found in our Pockets, lending
the same from one to another very charitably and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily.
When we had spent two days in that Place, I divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
my Men into three small Companies, and sent them
up into the Country to seek for Victuals and Houses,
with Orders to return again in the Evening to the Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loop:
I went out my self also as the rest did; but we
could find neither any House, nor the least sign of any
Men in those Parts. All that we could see were great
Herds of Bufflers, as large as Oxen, who fled so fast
from us, that we could not possibly come near them:
Wherefore having spent all the Day in this manner, and
got nothing, we returned to our Shalloop to eat Oysters
again, and resolved next day to leave this Place, and go
to Cape <hi>Corsa,</hi> to Leeward of which there is a large
Port, where Ships that sail that way put in to furnish
themselves with Water and Wood. The Negroes that
live in the Country having notice of the coming in of
Ships by the firing of Cannon, come thither also with
Provisions, and Barter the same for Brandy, Knives, and
Hatchets. They are forced to live remote from the Sea,

were got to the said Cape, we heard a great noise, made

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:65235:100"/>
Refreshments in the course of my former Voyages, I
was in hopes to find some or other that would know
me again: But tho' I knew several of them, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for me to perswade any of them that I was
Captain <hi>Montauban,</hi> so much was I disfigured with my
late Misfortune; and all of them took me for a Man
that would impose the belief of it upon them: I thought
fit to tell them in their own Language, whereof I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
a little, that I was ready to die with Famine,
and prayed them to give me somewhat to eat, but it
signified nothing; so I desired them to carry me to
Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> who is Son to the King of that Country,
as hoping he might call to mind the favours I had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
shewed him.</p>
               <p>I carryed all my Company with me to that Prince;
we were first brought to the Dwellings of those Negroes,
where they began to be a little more tractable, and gave
us some Bananiers to eat, which are a sort of Figs longer
than a Man's Hand. Next day we got to the Princes
Habitation, but I was in so pitiful a Condition, that I
could never by the signs I gave, make him know me,
tho' I spoke to him in his own Language, as also in the
<hi>Portuguese</hi> Tongue, which he understood very well.
It fortuned one day that going together to bath our
selves, he saw a Scar upon my Thigh, that was the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of a Wound I had received with a Musquet-ball;
he told me that he must immediately know, whether I
was Captain <hi>Montauban</hi> or no; and that if I were not
the Man, he would cut off my Head: He asked if ever<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
I had a Scar with a Musquet-shot in my Thigh, which
when I had shewed him, he presently embraced me, and
said, he was exceeding sorry to see me in that Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and immediately caused Victuals to be distributed
among my Men, and divided them into several Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
with strict Orders to the Negroes, with whom
they were quartered, to take the greatest care they could
of them. As for me, he kept me with himself, and
made me always eat at his own Table: When I was a
little brought into Order, he said, he would carry me
to see the King his Father, who lived five or six Leagues
off, that is, about ten or a dozen from the Sea-side. I
let him know how great the Favour and Honour was
he did me, and prayed him at the same time that I
might have the Liberty to let my <hi>Freebooters</hi> go along
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:65235:100"/>
with me, and grant us some Pieces of Stuffs, to put our
selves in as good Equipage as we could, in order to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
before so great a Prince; all which he allowed me,
and three days after, we went all together in a great
Canoe, and passed up the River of Cape <hi>Lopez,</hi> because
the Country is so full of Marshes, that you cannot go
by Land.</p>
               <p>Being arrived at the King's Habitation, which is a
Village consisting of Three Hundred Booths, covered
with Palm-leaves, wherein the King keeps his Wives,
Family, Relations, and some other Negro Families,
whom he loves best; I was lodged in Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> his
House, and all my Men were distributed into other Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations.
We found all the People in great Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
because the Chief of their Religion, whom
they call <hi>Papa,</hi> had died that day, when they were to
begin the Funeral Obsequies, which were usually to
last for seven days for Priests of that Quality. This
same Person was had in great Esteem and Veneration
by all the People, they looking upon him to be an Holy
Man. As the King is in Mourning, and sees no body all
the While that this Funeral Ceremony lasts; Prince
<hi>Thomas</hi> bid me have patience, and not to go out of my
Lodgings for to see the King, because that was the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of his Nation.</p>
               <p>However, I could not forbear going to see the Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Solemnity, where I saw nothing else but a great
Concourse of People standing round the dead Corpse.
I was in the mean time very well fed by Prince <hi>Thomas</hi>
his Orders, who was gone to see his Father: They did
not let me want Bananiers, Elephants Flesh, and River
Fish, tho' all of it came without either Bread or Wine,
as you may well suppose. My Men were treated in the
same manner in their respective Quarters all the time we
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               <p>At the Eight Days end, Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> came, in order
to carry us before the King: He is a large Negro, well
enough made, and about Fifty Years old, who, to do
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>eive
me, and advanced some steps to meet me. He was

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pported by four or five Women, which gave him a
kind of an Air of Grandeur in a very cumbersom and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>antastick manner: He was guarded by several Negroes,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:65235:101"/>
who were armed with Lances and Fusils, which they
discharged from time to time with no great Order:
There were several Trumpets and Drums marched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, at the Head of which Company there were
also several Standards carryed, alike in colour to those
used in <hi>Holland.</hi> He had no other Cloaths than a piece
of Cotton Stuff, streaked with white and blue, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
part of his Body was covered, the same being se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times folded round about him.</p>
               <p>He gave me many Demonstrations of his Friendship,
he also stretched out his Hand to me, saying, it was the
first time he had ever done so to any Man before me.
Being come to his House, he sate at his Door, and made
me take Place on the one side of him, as his Son did on
the other. He asked me several Questions concerning
the Greatness and Power of the King my Master; and
when I had told him, that he alone waged War against
the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> whom himself knew, as having
seen them often at the Cape of <hi>Lopez,</hi> that he also warred
against the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were more
Potent Nations than the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch;</hi> He told
me, he was pleased with my Account, and that he would
drink the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Health. Presently they brought
him some Palm-Wine, which is not unpleasant to
drink, and his Wives served him in a great Crystal Glass.
As soon as he began to take the Glass, the Negro Men
and Women lifted up the Right Arm, and held the
same in that posture very silently till he had done drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
But when it was over, they made a great noise
with their Trumpets and Drums, and discharged all
their Musquets, or I should have rather said, Fusils.</p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> then asked me what the King of
<hi>France</hi>'s Name was, and having told him, <hi>Lewis
le Grand,</hi> he said he had a mind I should hold <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  </gap>
Baptism, and that I should give him the Name of <hi>Lewis
le Grand,</hi> which made me smile a little at the Humour.
He told me also, that the first Voyage I should make
into his Country, he would give the Child to carry to
<hi>France</hi> for a Present for the King, to whose Service <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
of so great a Prince. I also promised on my part, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
the first time I came to the Coast of <hi>Guiney,</hi> I shou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:65235:101"/>
not fail to come and put him in mind of his Promise,
that so, upon my Return into <hi>France,</hi> I might be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of making the greatest Present that could be unto
the King, in presenting him with the Son of Prince
<hi>Thomas.</hi> And assure him, said the same Prince, that I
am his Friend, and that if he has occasion for my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
I'll go my self into <hi>France</hi> with all the Lances
and Fusils belonging to the King my Father, which was
as much as to say, with all the Force of the Kingdom.
The King presently pursued the Discourse, and assured
me he would go thither in Person, if there was need
for it; and with that, all the Negro Men and Women
raised such a Shout as much surprized me; and this was
scarce over, when the Fusileers made a general Discharge
of their Arms, the Trumpets and Drums went to it
again, and those who carried the Lances set themselves
a running from one side to another with such horrible
Outcries as frighted me. I was really ignorant of the
meaning of all this, and could not be satisfied till I saw
the King drink the <hi>French</hi> King's Health a second time,
with the same Ceremonies as at first. Prince <hi>Thomas</hi>
drank it also, and all of us were commanded to do the
same. This being over, the King ordered Two Wax
Cakes to be brought, whereof he made me a Present,
desiring me to accept of them as a Token of his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and then he went into his House.</p>
               <p>The Audience being thus over, Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> carried
me along with him into all the Parts of the Village whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he went to visit his Friends, and we went the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Days to see several other Villages that are scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
up and down the Country at about Five Leagues
distance from each other.</p>
               <p>These People, the greatest part of whom had never
been at the Sea-side, and consequently had not seen any
White People, ran from all Quarters to see us, and
brought us more Fruit, with Bufflers and Elephants
Flesh, than we could eat. As for the Elephants of this
Country, they are not altogether like unto those in the
<hi>East-Indies,</hi> whereof they are a different Species, as are
also those of <hi>Cafala,</hi> near <hi>Zanguebar,</hi> on the Eastern Coasts
of <hi>Aethiopia:</hi> The Negro's eat of their Flesh with a
good Appetite, and like the same better than any other;
hereof they provide their best Feasts, and those who
were minded to honour us most; brought it unto us
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:65235:102"/>
instead of that of Bufflers which I prefer much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it.</p>
               <p>As they were not able to comprehend the Difference
there was between the Colour of their Faces and ours,
they would frequently put their Hands upon our Faces
to see if the white Colour would go off; and it was the
Fortune of many of us, to meet with Hands scrub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
with Knifes, so as that many times we were hurt
with them, which yet we durst not complain of. Prince
<hi>Thomas,</hi> when he saw that, commanded all his Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
that they should suffer none to come to rub and
scrape us with their Fingers in that manner, and spoke
aloud to all the People that came to see us, that all
Strangers were White as we were; and that if the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro's
went into another Country, they would seem to
be as odd coloured there as we were in <hi>Guiney.</hi> He
laughed also from time to time to see the People run in
that Fashion after us, as if we had been some unknown
Animal; And I am not certain whether he were sorry to
see us thus incommoded with the Importunities of those
Negro's, or that he took some pleasure to see the Folly
of his Country Men, as I have done many a time, to
behold all their extravagant Humours.</p>
               <p>At last, after a Journey and Diversion together of
Three Days, the Prince brought me back by another
way to take my Leave of his Father: The King cares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
me a thousand times, after a most obliging manner,
according to the Custom of his Country, and made me
promise I should give him a Visit the first time I returned
into <hi>Guiney.</hi> Then we embarked in our Canoes, and
next Day came to Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> his Village, where he
continued to treat us after the manner he had been used
to do. Here he spake to me again, that he would have
me stand Witness for his Son at his Baptism, which I
did with so much the more pleasure in that I was help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to make a Christian, and sanctify a Soul.</p>
               <p>But as I was dubious whether the Priest of the Town
knew how to baptize the Child, or that he could remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the Words he ought to say at the Administration of
that Sacrament, I desired the Prince to send for a Priest
out of one of the <hi>Portuguese</hi> Ships, which he presently
did, to <hi>Cape Lopez:</hi> So that one came from thence in
Two Days time. The <hi>Portuguese</hi> were the People that
brought the Christian Religion first into these Countries.
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:65235:102"/>
It's true, they have not kept the same up there as they
ought to have done; but the Difficulties that obstruct
that good Establishment, proceeds, without doubt, from
hence, that Men must dwell in a Country that is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than Savage, where the Air and their Victuals are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot
so agreeable to Strangers. To give Religion a sure
footing in these Regions, it's necessary that the <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans</hi>
have fixed Habitations, or build Towns there;
that they instruct the Negro's in the Truths of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith, and that they send out Missionaries from
time to time among these poor Wretches. This might
very easily be done, because these People are very do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible,
and readily apprehend the Truths which you
would teach them, as having lived without any Faith at
all or any Idea of another Religion, for a long time. These
Negro's being once become Christians, you might make
Priests amongst them of their own Nation, who might
be furnished with Books for the Ceremonies of the
Church, and a Catechism for the Rule of their Faith,
until they were capable to read the <hi>New Testament.</hi> It
is necessary also, that a Bishop were constituted in this
Town, who should take care to send Priests to the Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
of the Negro's, up and down the Countries, and to
build Oratories in the most populous Places. The
Christian Religion might in this manner be settled in
<hi>Guiney,</hi> and so become less subject to be ruined by the
Wars which Strangers make there. The Christians also
who dwell in the Kingdoms of <hi>Fess</hi> and <hi>Marocco</hi> might
be reformed, and a Correspondence settled between the
Priests of that Nation and those of <hi>Guiney,</hi> that so they
might be assisting to one another, for the keeping up of
Religion on all the Coasts of <hi>Africa.</hi> It was in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
not unlike unto this, that Christianity establish'd
it self among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were an hundred fold
more averse to our Faith than the Negro's of <hi>Guiney.</hi>
The Priests of this Country are for the most part no
Priests at all, as having never been Ordained by any
Bishop, and constituted themselves in the room of those
that were deceased in their Country. And thus it is that
they have nothing in a manner that savours of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
tho' they have Ceremonies enough, and some
appearance of a Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>But to return to our Baptism: The <hi>Portuguese</hi> Priest
being come, Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> his Son was baptized, and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:65235:103"/>
named <hi>Lewis le Grand,</hi> in pursuance to the Intention of
his Father: A Negro Woman, and one of his Relations,
served as Godmother, and I for Godfather. I was told this
Lady was called <hi>Antonia,</hi> and that she had been thus na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by the Wife of a <hi>Portuguese</hi> Captain at her Baptism.</p>
               <p>Two or Three Days after this Ceremony was over,
which was performed with all the Magnificence the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro's
were capable of, Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> his Guards which
he kept at <hi>Cape de Lopez</hi> to give him notice of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
of any Ships, came to tell him there was an <hi>English</hi>
Ship come thither. I desired him to let me go on board
her, that I might return to my own Country, to free my
self from those many Inconveniences I still laboured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
But he would not have me commit my self into the
hands of mine Enemies, and desired me to have a little
Patience till the Arrival of some <hi>Portuguese</hi> Ships with
which he would let me go. In the mean time the Prince
went to <hi>Cape Lopez,</hi> there to exchange Elephants Teeth,
Bees-wax, and Negro's, for Iron, Arms, and Brandy, and
returned from thence in Ten or Twelve Days.</p>
               <p>He told me, when he came back, that there was a
<hi>Portuguese</hi> Ship come to Anchor at <hi>Cape de Lopez,</hi> and
that I should go down in his Canoe in order to go on
board her; that he had recommended me to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and that I should want nothing that was necessary
for my Voyage into <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I presently gathered my Men together, except Two
whom I did not think fit to wait for; for they were
gone up into the Country Five or Six Days before, and
I knew not where to find them. We therefore embark'd
on board this Prince's Canoes, after I had taken my
leave of him; and upon our Arrival at Cape <hi>Lopez,</hi> I
found the <hi>Portuguese</hi> Commander to be one of my
Friends, with whom I had contracted Acquaintance at
the Isle of St. <hi>Thomas.</hi> I went on board him, and three
days after, we anchored at the said Island, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
whereof shewed me and my Men a Thousand Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities
during a Month's space that we were forced to
tarry in that Port. At the expiration of that time
came in an <hi>English</hi> Ship, that had been out upon the
<hi>Gold-Coast:</hi> I made Acquaintance with the Captain, and
we grew to be such Friends, that I thought my self ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
in Honour to accept of the Offers he made me:
He pray'd me to go on board his Ship, and assured me I
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:65235:103"/>
should find all the help imaginable at <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he was bound, because there were very good <hi>Iewish</hi>
Physicians in that Island of his Acquaintance. I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked
therefore on his Ship, with all my Men, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all the Reasons given me by the Governour of
the Island, to make me suspicious of the <hi>English-man,</hi>
who was undoubtedly as honest a Man as any of his
Country: He was so civil as to give me his own Cabin,
with all the Pleasure and Diversion he could think of,
for the solacing of my Spirits, under the Afflictions I
had from time to time endured.</p>
               <p>Ten days after our departure from St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> a blast
of Wind unhappily made us lose our Rudder, in the
room whereof we were forced to set up a spare Top-Mast,
and this proved very detrimental to our Voyage,
which lasted no less than three Months.</p>
               <p>Provisions began to be scarce before our Arrival at
<hi>Barbadoes,</hi> so that when we came there, we had no more
than what would have served us for three days longer,
insomuch that the Captain being concerned that he had
taken our Men on Board, ordered our Allowance to be
lessened three fourths of what it should be. When we
were got to Port, the Captain went to wait upon Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<hi>Russel,</hi> who is General there, related to him my
whole Adventure with the Guardship of <hi>Angola,</hi> and
was much blamed for bringing me to <hi>Barbadoes.</hi> When
the Captain returned on board his Ship, he told me
what the Governour had said, who had forbid him upon
pain of Death, to let me go ashoar: However, he said
nothing to me of this Prohibition, but contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with only desiring me not go ashoar, that it might
create no Suspicion in the Governour; which I promised
exactly to perform, having no great Concern upon me
of seeing a Place again, that I had known so long ago,
and being unwilling to create my Captain any Trouble.</p>
               <p>Next day, several <hi>Iews,</hi> that had been driven away
from <hi>Martinico,</hi> having heard of my Arrival, came to
see me, and finding I was very crazy, and much out of
Order, they sent some Physicians of their Nation to me,
who said, I could not be cured, if I were not carryed
ashoar, and thereupon offered to sollicite the Governour
on my behalf, for giving me leave to go lie in an House
in the Town. I drew up a Petition to him, praying him
to grant me that Liberty, and promising I would not
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:65235:104"/>
stir out of the Chamber where I was placed, till I were
to reimbark to go for <hi>Martinico.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Physicians themselves were obliged to be my
Securities, and I was at length carryed to Mr. <hi>Iacob
Lewis</hi> his House, where I was very well looked after all
the time I staid there. Three days after I was brought
thither, the Major-General came to see me from Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<hi>Russel</hi> the Governour; he very civilly offered me
his Protection, and all those things that could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive
for the recovery of my Health: The same Major,
as also the Captain of the Garrison, came also to Visit
me from time to time, tho' I apprehended they came
not so much to inspect into the state of my health, as
to see if I were in a Condition to be transported out of
that Island. Colonel <hi>Russel</hi> also himself, about ten or
twelve days after my Arrival, came to see if I was so bad
as they said I was: He came again about seven or eight
days after in the Evening, and caused me to be carryed
out of the <hi>Iew</hi>'s House, where I was, to an <hi>English</hi>
Merchant's. He told me, I should be better accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
there than at <hi>Iacob Lewis</hi>'s; but I thought it was
to the intent I might be watched more narrowly, and
not converse with so many People. He came to see
me next day, and asked, how I liked my new Lodging?
I rendred him many Thanks for the Civilities and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
he shewed me, and that he might have no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to suspect my Men, I prayed him to shut them up
in the Cittadel, that they might not run about the Island,
and to prevent their making of their Escape.</p>
               <p>He said, he would take care of it, but that I was to
understand they were Prisoners of War as well as my
self. I made answer, I knew that, and that I thought
my self an happy Man, to have fallen into his hands:
But that the <hi>English</hi> Captain, who had brought me to
<hi>Barbadoes,</hi> had given me his Word, I should not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
nor any of my Men; That it was upon his Faith
given me, and the tenders of Service he made me, that
I had embarked, as firmly relying upon those Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of his Friendship he had given me. Then I desired
him to grant me and my Men our Liberty, promising I
should ever be mindful of the Favour done me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were by restoring of the Prisoners I might take
belonging to the Islands, or paying him such a Ransom
as he required.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:65235:104"/>
No, said the Governour, I will have neither your
Ransom, nor your Prisoners, and you are too brave a
Man, for me to have no Compassion upon your many
Misfortunes: I desire, on the contrary, that you would
accept of these Forty Pistoles, which I present you with,
to supply your present occasion: He gave them me in
a Purse, which he had doubtless brought along with
him for that purpose; and when he left me, he said, he
went to give Orders for to bring my Men together.
Next day he sent me two of them, who said, they
knew not what was become of the rest, and that they
had Orders from the Governour to stay with me. I
had the Liberty to send them abroad to get me Necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
and at last, finding my self somewhat recovered
by the care my Landlord took of me, I told the Officer
that came daily to see me, that I desired the Governour
to let me go on board the first Vessel that was bound to
<hi>Martinico.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Three days after, came a Bark, which the Count <hi>de
Blenac,</hi> General of the <hi>French</hi> Islands, had sent thither
about the exchange of Prisoners: Colonel <hi>Russel</hi> sent
me word she was come, and that I should prepare to
be gone. Then it was I had the Liberty to go to his
House, to render him Thanks for all the Civilities he
had shewed me: He told me, he was sorry that by the
Laws of War he was bound to allow me no more Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
than I had, and that he pray'd me to use the
<hi>English</hi> kindly, then should happen to fall into my
Hands. This being done, I went on board the <hi>French</hi>
Bark, which was commanded by the Sieur <hi>Courpon,</hi>
formerly an Inhabitant of St. <hi>Christophers,</hi> and I could
never find any more of my <hi>Freebooters</hi> than those two
I have spoken of, whom the Governour sent me.</p>
               <p>We went ashoar at <hi>Port Royal</hi> in <hi>Martinico,</hi> and I
went with my Men to the Town to wait upon Monsieur
<hi>de Blenac,</hi> who was then sick of that Distemper he died
of. I gave him a Relation of all my Adventures, and
I am sure he was surprized to hear the Particulars of so
many Misfortunes: As he would have me stay at his
House all the time I tarryed in <hi>Martinico,</hi> he made me
every day repeat unto him the manner of my Fight
with the <hi>English</hi> Man of War, and at last finding an
Opportunity of getting me transported into <hi>France,</hi> he
sent for the Captain of the Ship who was bound thither,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:65235:105"/>
and recommended me to him. He would also have writ
Letters by me to Monsieur <hi>Phelipeaux,</hi> to recommend
me to some Employ, but the day before my departure
he was taken so very ill, that he could not write, and
that day, which was the Tenth of <hi>Iune,</hi> in the Evening
he died: I was mightily troubled at his Death for seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Reasons. He was a Person that took delight in serving
every body, who had great Compassion on such as had
been persecuted by an Evil Fate, as was my Case, who went
forwards with what he knew, who of himself made an
offer of those Favours he was minded to bestow, before
they were asked of him, and who, in short, was brave
as to his Person, Skilful in Maritine Affairs, a good Sea-man,
knew all the Coasts and heights of Lands in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi>
was in great Esteem with the King for his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity,
Wisdom, Justice, and for all his great Services he
had done the Government in the way of Commerce, and
Discovery of Islands. The day after his Death I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked
on board the <hi>Virgin,</hi> a Ship belonging to <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi>
and which had been built there, in which Port,
after a Passage of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot many days, I arrived at last with
many different Thoughts, and contrary Sentiments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
me. I do not know whether I have bid the Sea
adieu, so much has my last Misfortune terrified me; or
whether I shall go out again to be revenged on the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi>
who have done me so much Mischief; or go and
traverse the Seas with a Design to get me a little Wealth,
or rest quiet, and eat up what my Relations have left
me. There is a strange Inclination in Men to undertake
Voyages, as there is to Gaming; whatever Misfortunes
befal them, they do not believe they will be always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy,
and therefore they will play on. Thus it is as
to the Sea, whatever Accidents befal us, we are in hopes
to find a favourable Opportunity to make us amends
for all our Losses. I believe whoever reads this Account,
will find it an hard Task to give me Counsel thereupon,
or to take the same himself.</p>
