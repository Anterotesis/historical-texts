            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Scope of the Following Treatise may be read in the Tittle. The true Design hereof is to direct to <hi>True Felicity,</hi> to shew wherein it consists, and what is our Duty, that is, what are the necessary Means we should use in order to the obtaining it. And as their is little said, but what is subservient to the <hi>Main Design;</hi> so the Treatise being chiefly intended for Common use, therefore 'twas Judged fit to study Plainnesse and Perspicuity, rather then fine Language, or quaint Expressions; and therefore also the Proofs and Evidences of what was necessary to be said on this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, are drawn from obvious things, which are neither so abstract from common obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance as to be gainsaid, nor yet so abstruse and perplext, as to need much Learning,
<pb facs="tcp:55045:4"/>
and more then Ordinary Capacity to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand them. Nothing is delivered but what may be easily understood; and if the least serious Attention be given in reading the same; I am confident they will go away fully convinced of the Truth thereof.</p>
            <p>It is true, no new discovery is pretended here, all which is here said of <hi>Mans Felicity and Duty,</hi> are <hi>Old and known Truths:</hi> But however, People have need to be taught them, to be put in mind of them, and to be stirred up to a due Observance of them; and that not only because thy are Necessary and Important things, but also because they are very ready to forget them, and meet with many things Dayly which divert the sense and Practice of what thus evidently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to their <hi>Felicity.</hi> Folly and Errour, <hi>Atheisime</hi> and <hi>ungodliness,</hi> take Men off the way of Happinesse, and they are day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie abounding, and many Pamphlets and Discourses spread which help forward their
<pb facs="tcp:55045:4"/>
growth: Common <hi>Charity</hi> therefore oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every one to do what he can to stay and extirpate these, to discover the Mischief of them, and to contribute such Help as he is able to the maintenance of Truth, Virtue and Piety which are the foundations of our <hi>Present Peace, and Future blisse.</hi> Out of this respect to the Common Good of Mankind, I have been induc'd to publish this Discourse such as it is, and <hi>I Heartily Pray GOD,</hi> to carry home the Convictions of what is here handled upon the Reader, that he may be as Dutifull as is here Directed, and by being so, arrive at all the <hi>Felicity</hi> here mentioned, which certainly is all that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, and even as much as heart can wish.</p>

                     <hi>CHAPTER I.</hi> The occasion of this Vow, of Vows in general, their Use, what should be the Matter of them, and how necessary it is to keep them.</head>
                  <p>THE Occasion of <hi>Iacob's</hi> making this Vow, was this, his Parents had sent him away to <hi>Padan-aram</hi> for fear of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55045:8"/>
his being corrupted by the Inhabitants of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> where they lived, and enticed to take one of their daughters to wife, like as his Brother <hi>Esau</hi> had done: Now as he was on his journey he happened upon a certain place (afterwards called <hi>Bethel</hi>) where he tarried all night, the Sun having set upon him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came thither, and the <hi>Canaanites</hi> not being so courteous as to invite him into their houses, he was necessitate to lodge in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen field: but though men denied him entertainment, yet he found what was much better and more comfortable, that he was highly favoured of GOD, for there He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him in a dream, and made him the promise of large and great blessings; as you may see in the 13, 14, 15, Verses. Upon which, when <hi>Iacob</hi> awakened and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered it, <hi>the fear and dread of GOD fell upon him,</hi> and to testifie his gratitude and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness to GOD, who had thus graciously appeared unto him, he spake these words, and vowed this Vow, by which he bound and oblidged himself to serve, honour and worship GOD, if so be that he did these things which were promised.</p>
                  <p>This vow was not made rashly and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideratly, but upon serious and mature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, nor is the matter thereof light
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55045:8"/>
and trivial, but weighty and important. It is certainly worthy our consideration, and hereby we may be instructed in very matte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial points, <hi>viz.</hi> Wherein our felicity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists, what is the thing we should aim at while in this world, and what is our duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards GOD: What <hi>Iacob</hi> asked, teacheth the one; and what he promised, sheweth the other, as will appear afterwards. But first we will take occasion to treat of Vows in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, as to their matter, use, and observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and thereafter we shall handle this <hi>vow of Iacob's</hi> in particular.</p>
                  <p>First then in general, a <hi>Vow</hi> is an holy and religious promise made to GOD, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for some mercy and favour, or upon the desire of some blessing, as here: And there be many instances in Scripture, of Prayers put up to GOD, by way of <hi>Vows,</hi> when our Prayers are accompanied with <hi>Vows,</hi> it doth be-speak a belief of power, and good-will, and particular knowledge on GOD'S part; and earnestness, importunity, and a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Disposition on ours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which are things GOD very much delights in. And this may be the reason why they are ordinarily so effectuall and so succesfull; For 'tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable that such Prayers prevaile very much with GOD, and do almost alwayes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55045:9"/>
obtain not only a Blessing, but even the very same thing prayed for. Thus <hi>Iacob</hi> obtained his whole desire. Thus <hi>Iephthah</hi> however rash in the matter of his <hi>Vow,</hi> yet out of a Devout Acknowledgement, having vowed to the LORD, got a Victory over the <hi>Ammonites;</hi> So likewise <hi>Hannah</hi> received a Child of the LORD, after that She had made a <hi>Vow.</hi> And thus we have read and heard of many, who upon their <hi>Vows</hi> have been delivered from great Straits and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, recovered of sore and Dangerous Sicknesses, and been Blessed with signal Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Favours. All which teacheth us, that in cases of great need, or the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Dangers, upon the various and great changes of our Life, in all great and weighty enterprises, whose success doth very much concern us, and in all our most solemn Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to GOD, <hi>I</hi> say, that in <hi>these,</hi> or the <hi>like cases,</hi> it may not be amiss, but good and proper to back and strengthen our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by some Pious and Religious <hi>Vow:</hi> For hereby we testifie, that we believe GOD able to grant what we ask, and that we our selves will retain a grateful sense of His Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, if so be he do it; and besides, this will awaken our minds to a due and serious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and add Fervour and Earnestness to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55045:9"/>
our Devotions, which endeareth both us and them to GOD, and so probably will wrest a Blessing from Him. We should never offer to ask any thing of GOD without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving to serve him better, or glorifie Him more upon the granting our Desires and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests; as we would wish him to do us good, so we should lay obligations upon our selves to do him all Acceptable Service; and it is but impudence and mockery to endeavour to get God to befriend us, without think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to become thereby the more dutiful to him. Wherefore every one of our Prayers and Addresses to GOD do contain vows im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, although we make no express men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, for they imply alwayes a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise and resolution to endeavour to please God, without which they were but meer ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ominations unto him.</p>
                  <p>But as it is good sometimes to make par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Vows, when we pray for any special blessing, and alwayes necessary upon all our Addresses to GOD, to resolve in the general to serve him and to do His will; so it is not good to be rash and inconsiderat in making of Vows: There is nothing about which we should deliberat more, and therefore it is that young Persons, and such as are not come to maturity of age, or understanding, are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55045:10"/>
by all Casuists from the making of vows, because their ignorance and want of knowledge may make them readily erre in this matter, and Vow what is not lawfull or convenient to be vowed. Good Religious and lawful vows doe honour GOD, and are very acceptable to him: But if they be rash, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerat, and in matters either not lawfull, or not fit, and proper, they do but displease him. If we be to <hi>Vow,</hi> then we must both use all Caution and Prudence in the making of them, and likewise see carefully to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving of them, otherwise we had better not <hi>Vow</hi> at all.</p>
                  <p>First in the making of <hi>Vows,</hi> we should shun all rashness and inconsideration, and ought to take heed, that both the thing we promise to GOD, and that which we make the Condition of it be Lawfull, and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his will, for if this be wanting, we offer but the Sacrifice of Fooles, and both our Prayers and <hi>Vows</hi> become an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto GOD. What we aske, must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be something he hath commanded, or Allowed us to seek; It must neither thwart his Will, nor be unworthy of Him to grant; and how earnest soever we be, yet our desires must always be attended with a Submission to his Holy Will and Pleasure, for 'tis then
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55045:10"/>
only that we are to be confident GOD will hear us, when <hi>we ask according to his Will.</hi> And as we must thus use Modesty and Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our Prayers, taking heed that what we pray for, be not offensive to GOD, so we ought to shew great Prudence and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion in these <hi>Vows</hi> &amp; <hi>Promises</hi> we make to <hi>God</hi> upon the granting our Prayers: we must see that the thing promised be both War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable in it self, and convenient for us in particular. Many have brought themselves with <hi>Iephthah</hi> into great snares and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by their <hi>Vows,</hi> because they did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the matter of them before hand.</p>
                  <p>This we should chiefly look to, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we may not make our <hi>Vows</hi> a last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing snare to our selves, we shall do well ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to keep within some branch of our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as the doing such and such a thing which we are already oblidg'd to, either by our <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Callings</hi> as <hi>Christians,</hi> or by our <hi>particular Calling</hi> as being in such a place or station; the doing of some such thing, I say, in a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent manner, with a greater inclination of the Will, with a more fervent repetition of the Act, with some more noble Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, with a fuller assent of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, or such like thing; for by this <hi>Vow of Iacobs,</hi> it is clear that it is neither im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55045:11"/>
nor impertinent to pitch upon what we are already tied to by <hi>prior obligations:</hi> Or if we have a mind to tie our selves to any thing uncommanded, or to which we are not necessarily oblidged, as it is proper and requisite to do in our more <hi>Solemn and Special Vows;</hi> then let us make choise of something useful and Serious, Grave and Weighty, something that tends to the Glory of GOD, the Benefit of others, or the bettering of our own Souls; at least, let it have an indirect subserviency to some of these ends, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us in greater capacity to advance them, otherwise our <hi>Vows</hi> degenerat into <hi>abominable superstition.</hi> As for example, It is but super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, and doth not at all please GOD, if we tie our selves to forbear such a kind of Meat or Drink, unless it be because we have found our selves provoked to lust upon the use thereof, or that we do fear this effect of it. And it avails very little to <hi>vow</hi> the fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or not working such or such a day, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we imploy that time we thus redeem from Meat and Labour, in the exercises of <hi>Piety and Devotion,</hi> and the improvement of our selves in Christian Wisdom and Vertue. <hi>Bodily exercises profiteth nothing,</hi> as saith the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. Corporal Austerities are not acceptable to GOD in themselves, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55045:11"/>
he must have mean thoughts of him who thinks it: but only in so far as they serve and are instrumental <hi>to mortifie the flesh, with the lusts thereof, such as Pride, Vain Glory, Uncleanness, Effininacy, Wrath, Anger,</hi> and the rest. It is the end and effect of these and the like observations which make them either acceptable or unacceptable to GOD, if they prove to His Glory, or render us more capable to advance it, if they promote the works of Religion in us, and further us in doing good to others, <hi>GOD</hi> is well pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But if the fruits of them appear little this way, He doth little regard them.</p>
                  <p>And hence it doth appear; how little <hi>true Piety</hi> there is in many of these <hi>Vows</hi> which are usually allowed and enjoined in the <hi>Romish Church;</hi> For first, the matter of some of them is so mean, and trivial, that it is a Scandal upon Religion to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of them, as the vowing a <hi>Pilgrimage</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to visit such a Chappel, or such an Image there, not to eat of the head of any Animal in honour of <hi>Iohn the Baptist,</hi> or broiled Fish in respect to St <hi>Laurence,</hi> or to give some wax Candles, Silver Puppets, or the like Childish conceits to be kept, or hung up in some Church or Chappel; when peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are taught and suffered to place Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55045:12"/>
in such small things, it cannot but lessen their esteem of GOD, and contribute to make them think meanly of him, even as we of <hi>Europe</hi> look with disdain upon the Kings and Princes of the late discovered World, when we read how brass pins, and glass beads, and such like silly toys please them, and gain their favour. Solemn pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents to Kings ought to answer their dignity, otherwise they are dishonoured, and so God is dishonoured when the matter of our <hi>Vows</hi> is a meer trifle, or some naughty thing, which was the reason why under the Law, He discharged <hi>to bring the hire of a Whore, or the price of a dog, into the house of the Lord thy God for any Vow, Deut.</hi> 23. 18. But secondly, there be other Vows of the <hi>Romish Church</hi> whose mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter indeed is grave enough, which yet must be reckoned among <hi>unlawful Vows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> because of their pernicious consequence: And these are their <hi>Monastical Vows, of Celibacy, Implicite and absolute Obediences, and external poverty;</hi> or rather the abandoning all honest and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil imployments used to gain a livelyhood in the World. They place Religion so much in these Vows, that the name of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is appropriat to them, and they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among them are called <hi>Religious</hi> who have taken on them such <hi>Vows:</hi> When
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55045:12"/>
yet it is certain that these things are not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely good in themselves, or pleasing to <hi>GOD;</hi> And seing they who marry, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low secular Imployments, not onely do not sin, but also thereby observe the <hi>Ordinances of GOD</hi> and his <hi>Providence;</hi> I cannot see a Reason why the title of <hi>Religious</hi> should be denied them, and not thought as much due to them, if so be other things requisite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre to make them deserve it. And it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, but that Persons may serve <hi>GOD</hi> the one way, as well as the other, for these examples which the Scripture sets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, are drawn not from <hi>Monkish</hi> or <hi>Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered Persons,</hi> but from such as were Married, and did commonly Traffique and entertain Commerce with the World; Which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever are more useful for teaching solid Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Piety, than the lives of their <hi>Saint Francis, Saint Laurence, Saint Teresa,</hi> or any other Ancient or Modern, which they can produce from their <hi>Monastries.</hi> But that we may take a particular view of these <hi>Vows</hi> severally, That of <hi>blind and absolute Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> cannot be lawfully promised to any Creature: <hi>GOD</hi> ought to be obeyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reservation, the plain intimation of his Will oblidgeth to Obedience, though the Reason thereof be not apparent, because
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55045:13"/>
we owe our selves and all we have to him: But as this is due to <hi>GOD,</hi> so to none else, because none other hath <hi>Absolute Dominion</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us. Therefore to obey any blindly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out considering whether it be good or evil, which they enjoyne, is to pay <hi>Divine Honour</hi> to Man. Our subjection to others should be alwayes with a subordination to <hi>GOD,</hi> and with a respect to his Glory; and seing no man is so infallibly wise, but he may mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take evil for good, nor so certainly good, but that he may enjoine evil though he know it, therefore we ought not to do every thing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other bids us, until we have examined the same, and found it no wise offenssive to <hi>GOD,</hi> by being contrary to his Will. And even to make a <hi>Religion</hi> of obeying ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in things not evil, but as to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture indifferent, is to destroy our <hi>Christian liberty,</hi> and to cast our selves again into an <hi>useless bondage;</hi> As to the <hi>vow of external povertie</hi> which proves to be either the renouncing of <hi>secular imployments,</hi> and these Arts &amp; Trades whereby men ordinarly are necessitat to seek their living, this can be no acceptable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to God, seeing it runs counter to his express ordinance, <hi>in the sweat of thy brows thou shalt eat thy bread,</hi> if men can free themselves of the necessity of eating and drinking, they
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55045:13"/>
may cast off all honest care and endeavours for these supplies, otherwise they ought not, for St. <hi>Paul</hi> commands, <hi>that if any would not work, neither should he eat,</hi> and such as work not at all, he saith, <hi>that they walk disorderly,</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 10. Sick and Malmed persons who cannot work for their own Maintenance, should be supplied by others Charity, but not these who are Able and Healthy, but resolved to live idly and uselessly to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. And herein the present <hi>Monks</hi> of the <hi>Romish Church</hi> differs much from those of the <hi>Primitive times,</hi> for the <hi>Ancient Monks</hi> did not eat their breadin idleness, but did labour, that they might help others to live, every one should study to be <hi>poor in Spirit, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified in his affections to the World,</hi> but these may be done in outward possessions. Finaly, as to the <hi>Vows of Celibacy</hi> and a <hi>total retirement,</hi> they are too important things to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by any rashly; and they are such as young Persons should not be suffered at all to engage in: for they cannot well know either the Temper of their Spirit, or the Constitution of their Body, how they will agree therewith. If their disposition be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, then they involve themselves into a sad inconveniency, and almost insuperable difficulties of pleasing GOD; which might
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55045:14"/>
be easily avoided by taking a course more sutable to their natural disposition. Not to speak of <hi>Celibacy,</hi> every ones humour even will not sute with that Solitude and retirement, which by the Laws of <hi>Monastries</hi> they are oblidged to: who are naturally Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, thoughtful, and a little Melanchollie, may like it well enough, and also fall upon methods for improving it to their grouth in Vertue and Piety. But such as are active and sprightly weary, of it and count it a burden; And as their nature inclines them to action<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so when they are any consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time without business, their fancy runs out upon vain projects and airy contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, neither profitable to themselves, nor others; and which prove an Impediment to Spiritual devotion as much, yea more, then outward innocent actions. He who in his retirements bethinks with himself how he would rule the world, if he had place and power, and what he would doe or have done in such and such cases, spends his time more idly, then if he were actually versant in Wordly affairs; And there be few active Spirits, but have their retirements (if long) Spoiled with such devices and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> seems to have foreseen the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55045:14"/>
of <hi>Monasticall Vows,</hi> &amp; to guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, in that a year of probation is allowed: But it is evident from experience, and many instances, that a year is not proof sufficient, especially when arts and tricks are used to delude Novices, and to wheedle them into a belief that things are otherwise then what afterwards they find them. If Vows were not imposed, and that a free <hi>exit</hi> were allowed to such as pleased, and found a change convenient; I verily believe <hi>Monastries</hi> might be very usefull both for <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> both for the civil good of the Nation, and the Spiritual good of mens Souls. All men are oblidged to be chaste, but chastity may be preserved in a married State, as well as in a single life, and every ones constitution doth not sute therewith. It would be good and proper for every man, though never so much engaged in worldly affairs, to retire himself frequently for the excercise of Religion, and the considering the state of his soul: Buthardly any can stay their minds altogether<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon these exercises for whole years, much less all there lifetime, nor is their any necessity thereof, seing men may goe about the affairs of the world without crossing these of Religion, and ply the things of this life without prejudice to the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:55045:15"/>GOD is not pleased with our vows, when they have not a tendency to his Glory, our Neighbours good, and our own Spiritual Advantage: and he cannot be but highly displeased, when by our vows we tie our selves to doe something which is unlawfull in it self, or which may be the occasion of some sin to our selves or others; Or to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear another thing which is good or usefull, and which is or may become our duty;</p>
                  <p>What is sinful or evil, can never honour GOD, but doth dishonour him, and it do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth bewray a gross ignorance to seek the pleasing of God by doing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> contrary to His will: Unlawful <hi>Vows</hi> should not be made, and if made, they ought not to be kept, it is a sin to make them, but a greater to observe them, such <hi>Vows</hi> lay no obligation upon us, except to repentance, and mourning for our rashness and folly. <hi>Herod</hi> was no wayes ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to cut off the head of <hi>Iohn the Baptist</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of his <hi>vow,</hi> for that would never excuse the murder of that innocent man: neither was the plot against <hi>Pauls</hi> life any whit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuated because the <hi>forty men</hi> had bound themselves thereto under a curse. It is a very bad reason for one not to come to Church and to refuse to hear such a Minister, because he hath sworn it. There is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55045:15"/>
in breaking of these <hi>Vows,</hi> the Perjury is in the first making of them, because they are contrary to those other general <hi>vows of Baptism, &amp;c.</hi> Whereby we are tyed not to do any thing that is evil, but <hi>what ever is good and praise worthy.</hi> Wherefore I wonder much how ever it could have slipt from the Author of that excellent Book, entituled, <hi>The whole Duty of Man,</hi> to say, <hi>That he who rashly swears to kill another, if he do it, he is guilty of murder, and if he do it not, of perjury, and so is under a necessity of sining.</hi> If this be true, it might prove a shrewd tentation to the keeping of unlawful <hi>Vows;</hi> For where one of two evils is necessary or unavoidable, men are at liberty to choose which they will, or what they think least: And there be some who have perjury in greater abhorrencie then anyother wicked act, &amp; therefore if such have once sworn a thing though never so evil, they will do it, for fear of drawing on them the guilt of <hi>perjury.</hi> This Doctrine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may be of very bad consequence; but however such a necessity of sinning cannot be admitted, unlesse we make the nature of sin alterable, and that a sinful Act may sometimes cease to be sinful. One cannot be oblidged by any Law to impossibilities, and therefore not to contrary Acts, as to do,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55045:16"/>
and not to do the same thing, at one and the same time, for to observe both is impossible. Wherefore if the doing a thing be sin, there is onely an Obligation upon us not to do it; and if the not doing thereof be a sin, then the Obligation is onely to do it; We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be oblidged to both, and so both cannot be sins. If it be objected, <hi>that though one and the same obligation cannot bind to contrary things, yet we may be bound thereto by different Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as in the present case:</hi> But to this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, That we are not under any Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but what the Law of GOD layeth upon us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or doth allow; and seeing the Law of GOD requireth us alwayes to do good, and forbiddeth to do any evil, therefore a Man can never be said to sin, by the doing of a good Action, or the forbearance of what is evil, though he hath never so preremptorly <hi>Vowed</hi> the one, and sworn against the other: For his Vows and Resolutions cannot take away his Obligation to obey GOD, and his Law. I have insisted the longer on this head, because some are so tenacious of their rash and unlawful Oaths, and think it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse enough for their continuance in a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked course, that they have sworn and resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it.</p>
                  <p>Religion certainly will never hallow an

wicked or ungodly act, and it is an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to God to offer to worship and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him by any thing sinful or unlawful: neither out of pretence of <hi>Vows,</hi> must we withdraw our selves from the duty and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience we owe to others; for no <hi>Vow</hi> can take away that obligation which is upon Wife's to obey their Husbands, Children their Parents, Servants their Masters, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects their Prince; and which is upon one man to do good, and to shew acts of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and charity to another. Our Saviour taxed the <hi>Scribes and Pharisees</hi> for breaking <hi>the fifth Commandment,</hi> in not relieving their Parents when in want, upon the pretence that their goods were <hi>Corban,</hi> that is, they had Vowed and Devoted all they could spare, to the Temple, or other Pious uses, <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 7, 11. What we Vow and Devot to GOD must be our own, absolutely at our dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, and no wayes tending to the detriment, or prejudice of others; else we cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that it should be acceptable. Thus therefore it is not lawful for a Servant while he is a Servant to devote, and set apart whole days for private Prayer, Meditation, or other exercises of Religion, unless his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster concede and yield thereto: He may indeed if he please allow some portion of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55045:17"/>
his meat to the poor, or some part of the time he should eat or sleep for Spiritual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises, for that is his own; but as for dayes or half dayes or any considerable quantity of time, belongs to his Master, and it would be a defrauding of him to take the same a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way without his consent and approbation. That which falls under anothers jurisdiction, must not be disposed off without their leave, for that were down right usurpation and robbery, wherefore GOD <hi>Num:</hi> 30. Gives the <hi>Husband</hi> power to dissolve the <hi>Wife's Vow,</hi> and the <hi>Father</hi> the <hi>Child's,</hi> And for the same reason the same Liberty must be assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to other <hi>Superiours,</hi> whether <hi>Masters</hi> or <hi>Magistrats.</hi> And hence doth appear the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulness of that Oath which hath so much troubled this Nation; viz. <hi>The Solemn League and Covenant.</hi> For besides what may be said to the <hi>Matter thereof,</hi> it was an incroachment upon the <hi>Magistrats right,</hi> and did engage <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat Persons</hi> to that which was not within their Sphere, but did properly belong to the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Magistrat,</hi> and the other <hi>Governours of the Church.</hi> When <hi>Inferiours</hi> make Vows to the prejudice of their <hi>Superiours,</hi> and in the <hi>particulars</hi> wherein they are <hi>subjected</hi> unto them, the Vows are <hi>ipso facto</hi> null and void; and the Superiours hath full power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55045:17"/>
to annull and dispense with them.</p>
                  <p>The sum of what hath been said, is, that we must use consideration in the making of our <hi>Vows,</hi> and must look that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition required be lawful and agreeable to GOD'S Word, and also the thing promised on our part not sinful and unlawful, a thing improper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and unbecoming us, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honours GOD, prejudges others, and wrongs our own Souls, but that it be a thing lawful and allowable in it self, within our power and at our disposal, and designed and used by us for GOD'S Glory, our Neighbour's advantage, and our own Spirituall good especially. And <hi>finally,</hi> we ought to weigh well our strength and ability, and to have some ground to hope, that through GOD'S Grace it will match and master all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, we may encounter in observing such a particular as thus we tie our selves to. If we observe these directions and be thus cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect in making of <hi>Vows,</hi> we do a thing well pleasing to GOD, but if we proceed not with this caution and discretion, they lose both of their Worth and Efficacy.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, as we must use caution in making of <hi>Vows,</hi> so we must shew care to keep them in every particular, when they are made; Our care of the one must be as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55045:18"/>
great as the other, otherwise we had rather a thousand times not make any at all. You may see how straightly both <hi>Moses</hi> &amp; <hi>Solomon</hi> enjoyned the punctuall observing of such <hi>Vows</hi> as are made to GOD, the one <hi>Deut:</hi> 23. 21. The other <hi>Eccl:</hi> 4: 5: When we break our <hi>Vows,</hi> or swerve in any point from them, we draw upon us the guilt both of <hi>Perjury</hi> and <hi>Ingratitude,</hi> the most abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable of all sins, which have been ever most odious both to GOD and man, and which seldom pass unpunished, even in this life. All know what a dreadfull Judgment befell <hi>Ananias</hi> and his Wife <hi>Saphira,</hi> it was only because they <hi>lied unto GOD, and kept back from him what they had sworn to give.</hi> Nay, 'tis even observable of this same <hi>Iacob,</hi> who, for as dear as he was unto GOD, was yet afflicted with several sad disasters in his Family, because of his delaying the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this <hi>Vow:</hi> After his return to <hi>Canaan</hi> he did not presently (as he promised here) <hi>worship GOD in this place,</hi> but took up his residence elsewhere; and then fell out the Ravishment of his Daughter, <hi>Dinah,</hi> and the slaughter of the <hi>Sichemites</hi> by his two Sons <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi;</hi> and that it was his not keeping of his <hi>Vow</hi> which occasioned GOD thus to punish him, may appear
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55045:18"/>
from this, that GOD immediatly enjoyned him the going up to <hi>Bethel</hi> as a redress of these troubles, as you may see <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 1. There are many more sad instances almost in every History, how GOD had plagued those who Vowed to him in their troubles, but forgat him when he had delivered them out of their distresses; and though God may spare his rode a while in this life, yet they shall not escape altogether unpunished, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the life to come.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore that we may draw to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of this point, I would seriously be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech every one to consider and call to mind what <hi>Vows</hi> they have at any time made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to GOD, when they were seeking any thing of importance from him, or when the fears of Death, or some other Danger were upon them, or when they were sitting at his Table and receiving pledges of his Love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In such and the like cases and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, We are all ready enough to make Vows and Promises; I know not if we be all as ready to perform and accomplish them. It's to be feared, that too many are like bad Debitors, who either alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refuse the payment of their debt, or else shift it off from day to day, and thereby do declare their folly and disingenuity, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55045:19"/>
monstruous ingratitude. If GOD hath been so gracious as to hear us, should not we also be faithful in keeping the Promises we made to Him; following <hi>Davids</hi> practice, <hi>Psalm</hi> 66. 13. where he saith, <hi>I will go into thy house with burnt offerings, I will pay Thee my Vows which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken when I was in trouble;</hi> And again, <hi>Psalm</hi> 116. 12. having asked himself, <hi>What shall I render unto the LORD, for all His benefits to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me?</hi> His answer &amp; resolution was, <hi>I will take the Cup of Salvation, and call upon the Name of the LORD, I will pay my Vows unto the LORD, in the presence of all His People.</hi> See and consider then I pray you, what have been your particular <hi>Vows</hi> and <hi>Promises</hi> at any time, and labour now to keep them faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; Did you promise to be more Holy? to have a greater Love and Zeal for GOD? Did you <hi>Vow</hi> to be more studious to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his Glory? to be more Just and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest in your Dealings, more kind to your Neighbours, and more Charitable to the Poor? Did you at any time pass your word that you would Pray oftner, and more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently in privat by your selves, and take a care that the Worship of GOD be observed in your Family? That you would forbear Swearing and Drinking, loose and prophane
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55045:19"/>
company? did you promise greater Sobriety &amp; temperance? Did you engage to bridle your passion? To be watchfull against Anger and Wrath, and to study Calmness and Peace? Did you engage to be more contented with your Allowances, and more thankfull for them? Did you vow to keep the Church better? To be a more Devout and attentive Hearer of GOD'S Word, and of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions of his Servants? Have ye devot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any particular time for privat retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Converse with GOD, or any particular Moity of your Estates for Pious uses; Whether these, or whatever else have been the matter of your <hi>Vows,</hi> see that ye both Remember them, and also give diligence to observe them, neither mince thy <hi>Vows,</hi> nor defer the paying of them. Let it not be said that thou art libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall in thy promises, but sparing in thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances: Like him, who when he was in Hazard of perishing at Sea, promised a rich offering, but when he came to land, put it off with a penny matter. Keep thy Word to GOD, and doe it chearfully without grudging; Let not our present Ease and Prosperity blot out the Sense and Memory of his past Loving Kindness, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let us account any thing too good for
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55045:20"/>
God, or too much to be given him: We can give him nothing but what is his own, for all that we have, we received from him, and we can do nothing to him, but what is our bounden duty. And withall let us Remember, that we may have yet need of his Kindness: We may yet fall into straits and trouble, be seized with Sickness and in fear of Death, and then how much will it concern us to have him our friend? but how, and with what confidence, can we cry unto him? if we now deal deceitfully with God, and break the word which we have uttered. That therefore we may avoid the Divine Vengeance and Displeasure, and also <hi>have GOD to be our refuge, and a present help in the time of trouble, let us Vow and pay our Vows unto the LORD,</hi> and keep every thing which hath gone out of our lips.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have spoken of <hi>Vows</hi> in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, have shewed the Nature of them, what Obligation there is on us to make them, what Caution should be used in the making of them, and what care to keep them when they are made.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of <hi>Jacob's</hi> Requests, Mens Wisdom discernable by the matter of their Desires; GOD deny's no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, but what are unreasonable and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, all that is necessary to compleat ones Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness is contained in the particulars which <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> here askes of the first, viz. the <hi>Divine Presence,</hi> what it is, and how excellent a Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, with an Exhortation to seek after it.</head>
                  <p>HAving taken occasion in the former Chapter upon <hi>Iacobs Vowing,</hi> to speak of <hi>Vows in general;</hi> we come next to treat of this <hi>Vow in particular,</hi> in which we have to consider these two things, <hi>viz.</hi> What he promised unto GOD, and what he craves of him as the condition of the Performance of that Promise. This last stands first in the <hi>Text,</hi> and therefore we shall handle it first.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Iacob</hi> craves here three things of GOD, first, that <hi>GOD would be with him,</hi> that is his Presence; Secondly, that <hi>he would keep him in his way,</hi> which is his Protection; Thirdly, that he would <hi>afford him his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary maintenance</hi> of <hi>Food and Raiment;</hi> these are his desires; And in the <hi>fourth place,</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:55045:21"/>
you have the end for which he asks these things, and it is that he may be brought <hi>back to his Fathers house in peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iacob</hi> may seem at first to ask no great matter, his requests look not very big; and 'tis true they are modest and reasonable: But yet if they be duely considered and seriously canvass'd, they will be found to comprehend all that is necessary to compleat ones Happiness. There is nothing that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers men more than their Requests and Petitions, for they do certainly speak out the <hi>sentiments of their mind,</hi> and what it is their Hearts set most value upon. It was once wittily said to a young man, <hi>speak that I may see thee,</hi> thereby signifying, that we know Men better by their Words than by their Faces: But this especially holds true, when their Words express their Desires. A Fool may be known by his desires, and a Wise man by his; For by these we may perceive easily what Knowledge and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding one hath, and what Inclinations and Dispositions, whether they have taken up right Measures of things, and do judge according to their true Nature, or only according to their outward appearance. Fools look only to the outward appearance, and if a thing glister, or make any big or
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55045:21"/>
splendid shew, they covet it, whatever it be in it self; But Wise men peirce through into the <hi>inward nature</hi> of things, &amp; seek only what is Solide and Substantial, Good and Useful, like as the <hi>Patriarch</hi> did here. For in that he sought these and no other things from GOD, it shews him to have been Wise and Understanding, that he had e're this time weighed and pondered all things as they relate to Man, and found out what was Good, Proper and necessary for him.</p>
                  <p>And truely, would we restrain our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to these things <hi>Iacob</hi> here mentions, if we would make these all we aime at in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to this Life, we should both Act more wisely than ordinarly we do, and should also find it much better with us; If we would put up such Requests as these unto GOD, he would certainly grant them, and in granting them we should find all that Comfort and Good which our Hearts can wish. It is not for want of Will or Power in GOD that our Petitions and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests are not granted, for he is both <hi>able and willing to do us good beyond the largest of our desires:</hi> But it is because they deserve not to be granted, they are neither reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in themselves, nor put up for Good ends and Purposes, and so do carrie a reason of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55045:22"/>
their refusal in their very bosome. A Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent denies his Child what he cryes for, not for want of Love, but out of the Tender regard he hath to him, because he knows it would hurt him; and a Physitian doth not allow his Patient the Meat and Drink which he asks, not because he doth not desire his Health and Recovery: But because he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives his Appetite vitiat, and disordered; and knows that the thing required would hinder his Health, and increase his Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. It is even so with GOD, the Reason why he heareth not our Prayers, is because they are not Reasonable, and that we do not wisely consider what we speak: <hi>Ye ask, and receive not, (saith St. Iames) Because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts,</hi> Iam. 4. 3. GOD cannot hear these Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which are prompted by Lust, Sensuality, Pride, Ambition, Vain glory, covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and the other disorders of our Corrupt Nature, which should rather be starved and stifled, than fostered and encouraged; and we may be sure GOD will never furnish us with Weapons to rebel against himself. But as GOD designes the good and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Creatures, so if we intend no more than that, he will not deny us; if we seek really that which is good for us, and which
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55045:22"/>
may help forward the happiness we were Created for, He will freely bestow it: for he only rejects and upbraids these Prayers which respect not the Right end, neither observe the right means or measures, otherwise <hi>he gives to all men liberally and willingly.</hi> The advice therefore of the <hi>Poet</hi> is good,</p>

                     <l>But to the Omniscient <hi>Deity,</hi> alone,</l>
                     <l>What Wives, what Children we shall have, is known.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>Now there is no more necessary to compleat our Happiness then what <hi>Iacob</hi> craves here, all things else are superfluous, this alone is sufficient to afford us all the comfort &amp; satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction we would be at, in these things lye that good which men so much desires, but know not how to find, as we may discern by taking a particular view of them.</p>
                  <p>And first of the <hi>Divine Presence,</hi> which the <hi>Patriarch</hi> here requires to accompany him. A Staff and a Companion are very necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in a Journey; It is a comfortless thing to travel vvithout something to aid &amp; support us, and vvithout a friend vvith vvhom vve may advise and consult, and in vvhose so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55045:23"/>
and Fellowship, we may Refresh and Solace our selves upon all Occasions. This <hi>Iacob</hi> perceived, and therefore he desired not to Travel alone, but intreated that GOD might accompany him. All com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany is not good, better want altogether than have some; And therefore Wise men use to make choice, and to look well whom they admit into Familiarity or an intimat Friendship; The better our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions be, their company is still the more profitable, and we have the greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in it; And if we would know where, and how to make choice of a True, Good, and Useful Friend, alwayes to go along with us, we may receive Direction from <hi>Iacob</hi> here; For he indeed hath pitched upon him. And this doth sufficiently Evince, what Wisdom and Knowledge this man had even at this time, when in the first place, and before all things he prayed that <hi>God might he with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here some may ask and say, what needed <hi>Iacob</hi> ask the <hi>Divine Presence</hi> as a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and Peculiar Favour? Seeing that GOD <hi>is every where present, even with all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> Did he think GOD, a local God, tied or confined to any place, or who being in one place, cannot be in another? No cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55045:24"/>
this Holy Man had no such mean and low thoughts of GOD; He was better instructed than to be so Ignorant of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitness and Immensity, he understood well enough <hi>that the Heaven of Heavens could not containe Him, and that His Presence, Power and Glory filled both Heaven, and Earth,</hi> he was a better <hi>Philosopher</hi> than not to know that His Presence and the actual Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of His Power was requisit to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of all and every one of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and that nothing could subsist with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him. But it was not this generall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, which every Creature enjoyes that <hi>Iacob</hi> begged, it was a more speciall presence whereby he might shew that he was interes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in Him, and concerned for him, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Special Favour, Love, and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to be present, as to let it appear that he cared for him and studied his good: This is the Presence of GOD which <hi>Iacob</hi> requires and the Reason why he so earnestly asks it, and doth thus prefer it in the first place, is no doubt because he had learn'd from his <hi>Fathers Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Isaac,</hi> that it was this that made them so Thrive and Prosper in the World: The Reason why they were so Singularly Blessed above others, was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause GOD was with them. Thus also the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55045:24"/>
good luck which <hi>Ioseph</hi> had, is ascribed to the Lords being with him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 3. and this likewise is made the cause of <hi>Davids</hi> Wisdom, Courage and Success, as you may see 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 14, 28. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 10. and it was a thing very useful with the <hi>Ancients,</hi> when they would express how well and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py a man was, to say, that <hi>GOD was with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed how can it be but well with that Person, <hi>whom GOD is with,</hi> what can he want who hath him to be his Friend; He who hath the <hi>Divine Presence</hi> accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him withersoever he goeth is Richer, and Happier, than if he had all the treasures of the world carried about with him: For <hi>God is the Author and Fountain of all Good, from Him every Good, and perfect Gift doth come,</hi> he can easily command any desirable thing where, when, and to whom He pleases: So that he who enjoys GOD hath enough, and needs not fear or care for the want of any thing, for <hi>GOD</hi> will be to him in stead of all things. And in having Him he may say truly as that <hi>Philosopher</hi> said, <hi>Omnia mea mecum porto,</hi> that is, <hi>I carrie about with me all things proper,</hi> all things necessary or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisit, either for my Support or Comfort, for <hi>GOD</hi> is all that. It was a vain and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55045:25"/>
proud boast of <hi>Cesars</hi> to the <hi>Mariner,</hi> who was wafting him over the <hi>Adriatick</hi> to <hi>Italy,</hi> when he perceived him seized with Fear and ready to turn back, <hi>Perge audacter, ne timeas, Caesarem vehis, Caesarisque fortunam,</hi> be not afraid you carrie with you <hi>Cesar</hi> and his Fortune: But truly every one that hath <hi>GOD</hi> with them, may with reason confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say to himself, <hi>be not afraid, sad or dejected, Deum habes ejusque favorem, you have GOD &amp; his favour;</hi> and having that, what cause can there be of Fear or Dejection? For He is Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Power, all Goodness, and All-suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie it self, and therefore He is a True Aid, and Support, and a sure Rock to build on, which will never fail. <hi>Blessed are all they that put their trust in Him,</hi> Psal. 2. 12. <hi>Though I walk,</hi> saith David, <hi>through the valley &amp; shaddow of death, yet will I fear no evil, for thou art with me, thy Rod and thy Staff they comfort me.</hi> Psal. 23. 4. The very hopes of this special Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and Favour of <hi>GOD,</hi> did mightily chear up the <hi>Psalmist's</hi> Spirit, when he was like to be overwhelmed with trouble, he chides and is in a chaff with himself, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any wayes troubled, having this hope, <hi>Why art thou cast down,</hi> saith he, <hi>O my Soul, and why art thou disquieted in me? Hope thou in GOD, for I shall yet praise Him, who is the</hi>

                     <hi>health of my countenance and my GOD,</hi> which he repeats twice, <hi>Psal.</hi> 42. and once, <hi>Psal.</hi> 43.</p>
                  <p>Many excellent Blessings and advantages follow him <hi>whom GOD is with.</hi> First. he is sure of Counsel and Direction which is a very necessary and desireable thing: The life of man while in this World is for the most part Dark, Intricate and full of Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, 'tis like a <hi>Labyrinth</hi> full of perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, we cannot well discern the outgate; We know not what certain course to Steer for our profit and advantage: As the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> saith, <hi>the way of man is not in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, it is not in him that walketh to direct his steps, Ierem.</hi> 10. 23. It is not safe to follow our own Devices, things ordinarly succeed worse when we do so; the wittiest Men have sometimes befooled themselves by leaning too much to their own Wit. No Mans Wit and Judgement can be sufficient of it self to guide him, and oft-times we are not much better of others, for they are short sighted too as well as our selves, and may mistake things as well as we: we can never therefore be sure that we are right, but when we follow the Counsel and Direction of GOD, when we are guided by him who cannot erre, because <hi>his understanding is infinit.</hi> But if he be with us, his Counsel will be with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55045:26"/>
us too, if he hath set his Heart upon, and chosen us for his Friend, he will also guide and instruct us, and shew us the way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we should walk; <hi>What man is he,</hi> saith <hi>David, that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in the way he shall choose, Psal.</hi> 25. 12.</p>
                  <p>But here some may ask, How doth GOD teach us? And what way are we to expect Direction from Him? Must we look for Revelations, Dreams, and Visions? Indeed this was not unusual under the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> GOD did then very ordinarly this way ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest himself to the Patriarchs, and others his Eminent Servants; but now it pleases Him to forbear it, at least, that so common use thereof; and we are neither to ask nor to look for Advice and Counsel this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary way. But however, if we wait on GOD, we may be confident of Direction from him, which he will communicat to us two manner of wayes: First, by the inward suggestions of his Spirit, he will not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten our minds, and clear our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with wisdom &amp; knowledge, so that in the general we shall be able to know what is good and right; but he will also help us to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern what is fit and proper in that particular case &amp; circumstance wherein we stand, &amp; will secretly incline and draw us whither his
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55045:26"/>
Wisdom sees it fit for his Glory, &amp; our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. This is no idle Fancy, or Delusion, it is no piece of <hi>Fanaticism,</hi> or a Dream of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiastical persons,</hi> but a certain real Truth, which all Good and Holy Persons have felt from their experience; Though these words of the Prophet, <hi>Isa.</hi> 30. 21. <hi>Thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saving, this is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left;</hi> are not altogether to be restricted to an <hi>inward inspiration,</hi> but also to be understood that <hi>external Voice in the Word, and by the Ministry of His Servants:</hi> Yet <hi>Solomon</hi> seems to hold out this, when he saith, <hi>in all thy wayes acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths, Prov.</hi> 3. 6. This also must be the meaning of <hi>Elihu,</hi> in these words, <hi>There is a Spirit in Man, and the Inspiration of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty giveth them understanding, Iob</hi> 32. 8. This Voice is inward, and therefore not audible, or perceptible by our outward Senses, but however it may prove effectual enough for to move and sway us: <q>And though as one says, this secret Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Almighty GOD</hi> is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally<note place="margin">Halls Cont. of the fear of GOD.</note> seen in matters relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the good of the Soul, yet it may be also found in the great and Momentous Concerns of this
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55045:27"/>
life, which a good Man that fears GOD, and begs his Direction, shall very often, if not at all times find.</q> 
                     <hi>I</hi> hope none will be so injurious as to think, I intend to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance or authorise those who father hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid impieties and most impertinent extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies upon GOD, pretending they are carried thereto by a secret impulse of the Spirit. I know and would have every one to assure himself that <hi>God</hi> is never the author of what is evil, foolish or ridiculous, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever comes from him is worthy of him, that is to say, sutable to <hi>infinite Wisdom and Goodness;</hi> neither doth GOD shew himself thus to any mean trivial things, but in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of serious Importance. But because some have been so far out of purpose, as to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>Inspiration</hi> for every thing, and to lay such things upon GOD, as are inconsistent with the <hi>true notions of a Diety,</hi> therefore to deny all such Commerce betwixt GOD and Men, or that he ever doth suggest Counsel or Advice to any in any matter, I think very unreasonable; both these are Extrems, which I desire to shun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I doubt not but good &amp; vertuous Persons, who commit themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to the <hi>Divine Conduct</hi> may, and do find themselves sometimes extraordinarly directed in Weighty and Important Cases, especially
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55045:27"/>
when their own Wit and Reason is at a stand. To this purpose I was told a remarkable Passage, when <hi>Dundee</hi> was stormed and taken by the <hi>English,</hi> in our late Revolutions; <hi>This Town being fancied foolishly to be a place of strength, and able to hold out, therefore many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorted thither, and among the rest, a certain Citizen of</hi> Edinburgh, <hi>with his Wife and Apprentise, who finding themselves sadly disappointed upon the entry of the Enemy, and sacking of the Town, were in great anguish of Spirit, and concluded themselves lost, and therefore they recommended their Souls to GOD'S Mercy; but the Woman was extraordinarly moved to go down to the street, and no entreaties of her Husband could disswade her; when down, the first she espied was one of a goodly countenance, whom she laid hold on, desiring he might go with her; When he comes to the house she falls on her knees, and said, Sir, you shall have all my goods, only save my Husband's life, which he granted, telling her withall, thát Providence had directed her to him, for the last Fight he was at, he received a courtesie from a</hi> Scots Man, <hi>which made him swear, to save the first that sought quarters in this. This had not well passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, when the enraged Souldiers thronged in upon them, and if it ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> not been for him, they had undoubtedly perished.</hi> This was a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular <hi>Providence,</hi> and I had it from the good
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55045:28"/>
Woman her self, who stills remembers it as an instance of GOD'S kindness, and which among other things she makes the Matter of her Devout, and thankfull Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement. A second way whereby GOD directeth us, is <hi>External,</hi> viz: By the Wise and Happy Occurrences of <hi>his Providence,</hi> ordering the Circumstances of things so happily together, and making several things to fall out so well at one time, as that we are necessarily and in a manner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares engaged into that course he Designes we should take, which will always be for our well, if we <hi>commit our selves unto him.</hi> Thus he made <hi>Abrahams</hi> Servant to light very happily upon the house of his <hi>Masters Brethren,</hi> and the Woman whom he should choose for his Master's Son's Wife; and thus also he directed <hi>Iacob</hi> to <hi>Laban,</hi> and <hi>Ruth</hi> to <hi>Boaz. The steps of a good man,</hi> saith the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist, are ordered by the LORD, Psal:</hi> 37: 23: He by his <hi>secret Providence</hi> doth so dispose of him, and engageth him to such a conduct in his affairs, that his Good, Peace and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, Credit and Comfort is carried on better than he desired, or could have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and by wayes and means which he could never foresee. These methods of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence,</hi> sometimes look not Fair and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55045:28"/>
Favourable, at the beginning they may look as if he frowned and threatned us: But the issue of them even then proves most happy, as we see in <hi>Ioseph's</hi> case. Who so is wise as to observe the tract of his own life, and GOD'S dealings with himself &amp; others, shall come sufficiently to understand both this <hi>Wisdom and Loving Kindnesse of the</hi> LORD.</p>
                  <p>But secondly, GOD'S Presence is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable for Counsel and Direction only, but upon many other accounts: nay there is no Reason which may move us to desire any thing whatsoever, but the same should excite us to this: For either he can give the good, which we desire, or he can supplie the want thereof; He hath every thing at His disposal, and whatever Vertue or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty any Creature hath is from Him; Neither can they produce even their most Natural effects without him, but when he pleases he can work his will without them. It is not Bread alone which preserveth our Life, but his Blessing upon it, and he can easily when he sees it fit, maintain our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Life, and vigour without all Food, as he did to <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Elijah,</hi> and our <hi>Saviour.</hi> It is not Medicine nor Physick which reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers our Health, but his Blessing in our use
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55045:29"/>
of them, and even when these Means are wanting, yet his Hand is not shortned; but that he can make Whole and restore Health without them. It is not our Labour and Industry or any Endeavours we can use, which will make us compasse the ends we would be at, unless He act and concur with us; For if he give not the Blessing, if he speak not the Word, all that we can do will be in vain. <hi>It is in vain for you,</hi> saith the <hi>Psalmist, to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows, for it is he who giveth his Beloved sleep. Psal.</hi> 127. 2. And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Haggai</hi> tells us plainly, <hi>that men may sow much, and yet bring in but little, they may eat, and not have enough, drink, and not be filled, they may be cloathed, and yet not warm, and earn wages but put it into a bag with holes, Hag.</hi> 1. 6. So that the Favourable <hi>Presence of GOD</hi> is desireable, both to supply what we want, and to make these things which we have useful and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He that hath GOD with him, hath not only a <hi>Wise Friend,</hi> but a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful one, <hi>who can do whatsoever he pleaseth in Heaven or in Earth,</hi> who can oblidge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Angels and all Creatures to Serve and Minister unto him whom he loveth: Thus he caused the Ravens to feed the Prophet <hi>Elijah;</hi> These Foules by Nature are more
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55045:29"/>
ready to steal and take away then to give, and yet at the Command of GOD, they <hi>brought him Bread and Flesh in the morning, and Bread and Flesh in the evening,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 6: He made the jaw bone of an Ass to afford drink unto <hi>Sampson</hi> when he was ready to to faint for thirst. He caused the Heavens to rain down Bread to his People in the Wilderness, and gave them Quails in great abundance, so that even then they were fed to the full: And in a word, as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing impossible unto GOD, as by his Power he can do all things whatsoever he pleaseth, so he will never fail to work Mightily and Wonderfully for those whom he loveth, when his Glory or their Good requires it, he will withhold nothing from them which their necessity or comfort calls for, and will make all things, even what seems most rough, severe, and adverse, <hi>to work together for their good,</hi> as the Apostle speaks, <hi>Rom</hi> 8. 28. and as may be easily made appea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Though neither <hi>privat Persons</hi> nor <hi>publick States,</hi> are now to expect to be maintained &amp; supported by Miracles and <hi>extraordinary mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festations</hi> of the <hi>Divine Power,</hi> so much and so frequently as the <hi>Children of Israel</hi> were of old,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55045:30"/>
yet <hi>particular Providences</hi> must not be denyed; We must not think that GOD hath now abstracted himself from the Government of the World, and from taking care of such as love and fear Him, <hi>His eyes are still upon the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men;</hi> He interesseth himself in their Affairs, and hath the chief hand in the disposal thereof, <hi>His eyes are still upon the Righteous, and his ears are open to their cry;</hi> now as much as formerly, he still shews a special care of his own, and when <hi>ordinary means</hi> and <hi>methods</hi> fail, and prove ineffectual for compassing their good; He inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth himself by Wayes and Means extraordinary, as might be made evident from the lives of some who have been eminently Holy and Pious. I doubt not but who will be at the pains to make Collections, may find many Instances almost parallel to those we read of in <hi>Sacred Writ;</hi> I shall mention some which may perhaps help to the remembrance of others; and that deserves the first place, which the Reverend Archbishop <hi>Spotswood</hi> tells us of Mr. <hi>Iohn Craig; (Spots: Hist. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 462) This eminent Person having fallen upon <hi>Calvins Institutions</hi> at <hi>Bononia,</hi> by which Means, he came not only to know the Doctrine of the <hi>Protestants,</hi> but also to be perswaded of the truth thereof, which being discovered, he was thereupon delat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and sent to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was tryed by the <hi>Court of Inquisition,</hi> who condemned him to be burnt as an <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</hi> But it pleased GOD, before the day of his Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to remove <hi>Pope Paul</hi> the 4th, whose death occasioned an uproar in the City, and several disorders amongst the rest, the Prison doors were broken open, which afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Mr. <hi>Craig</hi> the opportunity of an escape; And as he fled he met with two remarkable Instances of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence;</hi> For first, <hi>Passing through the Suburbs of</hi> Rome, <hi>a company of</hi> Banditi <hi>met him, one of whom accosted him, and asked if he knew him, which Mr.</hi> Craig <hi>denying, the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred him of a Courtesie he formerly received at</hi> Bononia, <hi>and for which he not only bestowed on Mr.</hi> Craig <hi>some Money, but also conveyed him safe sorth of the City, and directed him in the right way to</hi> Bononia, <hi>whither he intended. But not finding that good Reception there he expected; he resolved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

Millan, <hi>without either knowledge of the way, or the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary means of a support for a Traveller; and while he lay pensive at the side of a little Brook, he received a second in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of GOD'S special Favour and Providence; for a Dog came to him with a purse of Money in his mouth.</hi> This (as the Reverend Historian sayes) may seem somewhat incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible; yet I cannot see how the truth thereof should be rejected, seing Mr. <hi>Craig</hi> himself did frequently relate the story; for both the holiness of his life, frees him from all suspition of Forgery, and any design of Imposing upon Men; and also the eminent Imployments he was honoured with, both before and after his Conversion to the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> shews him to have been far from the simplicity of being cheated and deluded himself. It is also reported of D. <hi>Barnaby Potter,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That after he had passed the ordinary time<note place="margin">See Wilkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Treat: of GODS alsufficiency.</note> of his Studies in the University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> he was like to have missed his Degrees, for want of Money to defray the Charges thereof, upon which he retired to his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and vented his grief in Prayers and Tears before GOD; and while he was at Prayer, <hi>One came knocking at the door, and required him to come and speak with the Vice-Chancelour, who bestowed on him as much Money as his present necessity called for.</hi> To these I shall subjoyne two or three more of latter date, which <hi>I</hi> have from very good hands. And first, it is reporred of a worthy Divine of our Neighbour Nation, who was redacted in times of the late Troubles to great Straits; And one time espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, <hi>he and his Family had been a day or two without victuals; and being much moved with their looks and speeches, by a secret suggestion of the Spirit, he commanded the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant-Maid, to go with her basket to the Mercat, (albeit he had no money to give with her.) When she came there, passing up and down without offering to buy any thing, she was espy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by some who were drinking nigh by, They invited her in, and began to make merry with her; but she not being in a disposition for it; told them sadly,</hi>

A <hi>Second Instance</hi> shal be of a Widow-Gentle-Woman in this same Countrey, who was left with several small Children, but little or nothing to maintain them with; and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in these troublesome Times wherein there was little occasion for shewing Industry, or using honest Shifts, this made her condition the more hard: <hi>One day, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

By these Instances and others which Men may gather from their Experience and Reading, it doth appear what GOD is able to do for us, and how many things he may contrive, and make to occur for relieving us out of the Straits and Troubles we fall into. But for preventing Mens mistakes, it will not be amiss to add a Caution, and it is this, That we do not think that we are only beholden to GOD and his Providence, when we meet with such extraordinary occurrences, for GOD must still be acknowledged the Author of all our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, when they come to us in wayes Ordinar and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as well as when they are brought about by Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Means and Methods, He is the Preserver of our Life and Health, when we Eat, Drink and Sleep, no less then if we should live without either of these: Our Prosperity is to be ascribed to him, when it follows our Diligence and Industry in our Imployments, no less then when it falls out by Wayes and Methods extraordinary, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought of, to convince us of which, GOD doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times blast Natural Means, for that shews the Effects doth not wholly depend upon them. And as GOD must still be acknowledged the Author of all the good we enjoy, by what ever Means or Instruments it comes to us, so we must not expect any extraordinary manifestation of his favour and Providence but in extraordinary cases, that is to say, when ordinary means and methods fail, and that such special and singular instances of the <hi>Divine Power and goodness,</hi> are requisit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And though even in these cases GOD should not interpose himself thus extraordinarly on our behalf, yet there were no Reason to complain of the Want of special Care of us; we must not think they are all desert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of GOD, who do not find Miraculous help and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief upon the want of Ordinary Means, for GOD may see it as much for their Spiritual good to leave them in

these straits and difficulties, then it would be for their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral good to be relieved out of them, so his Love is as great the one way as the other.</p>
                  <p>But thirdly, though the <hi>Divine Presence</hi> should not thus signally manifest it self in procuring <hi>External Successes and Advantages,</hi> yet it rendereth one happy, in that, Peace and Tranquillity, Joy and Gladness doth ever flow from it, and the sense thereof. Inward Peace and Contentment and Gladness of Heart every man covets, but few rightly understand where or how it is to be had: It doth not flow from an abundance of <hi>Temporal things</hi> and an Affluence of <hi>Worldly enjoyments;</hi> one may have as much of these as heart can wish, and yet be without inward peace and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and however it is but a weak and brittle peace, a very slender comfort which a man can suck from these <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>perishing enjoyments;</hi> when these things are not considered as tokens and expressions of the <hi>Divine Favour,</hi> they can yield no more but <hi>vanity and vexation of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> as <hi>Soloman</hi> proves, by his manifold expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences. True Peace and Joy can be built upon no other foundation then GOD Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, it results only from the enjoyment of him, and a sense and Assurance of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Love, if he be with us, he both can and will give us a Peace, which the whole World cannot give, and which none can take from us. <hi>Thou will keep him,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>in perfect Peace, whose mind is stayed on thee, because he trusteth in thee, Isa.</hi> 26. 3 when others were earnestly craving and gap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for this, and the other Worldly delight, saying, <hi>who will shew us any good: David</hi>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:55045:32"/>
prayes seriously, <hi>LORD lift up the light of thy Countenance upon us.</hi> And he adds the reason why he desired this so much above all other things, because saith he, <hi>Thou hast put Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in my heart, more then in the time that their Corn and Wine encreased, Psal.</hi> 4. 6. 7. That is, he had more Joy from GOD'S Presence &amp; Favour, then Men use to have in the time of Harvest when all things most abound with them. This Peace and Comfort, which GOD giveth, is not necessarily annexed to outward Plenty and Prosperity, nor alwayes attended with it: There may be outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nothing but Want and Poverty, Sickness and Distress, Trouble and Affliction, and yet even in this case, GOD may inwardly afford <hi>a joy unspeakable,</hi> and a <hi>peace which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth all understanding.</hi> Wherefore Christ tells his Disciples, that <hi>in the World they should have trouble, but in me ye shal have peace,</hi> as if he had said be not afraid, for the trouble you meet with in the World, shall not bereave you of that peace I promise; and therefore also <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> saith <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 14. <hi>That a good man shall be satisfied from himself,</hi> that is, his satisfaction &amp; comfort depends not <hi>on External enjoyments,</hi> or things without him, but he can draw it from within, through the intimat presence of GOD which doth alwaies attend him. And
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55045:33"/>
thus you see how desireable a thing the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of</hi> GOD is, and how happy he must needs <hi>bewhom GOD is with.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore let all of us be so wise as to imitat <hi>Iacob,</hi> to seek this in the first place, and to prefer it before all things; Let us Pray to GOD that he may be with us, and even convenant with him, as <hi>Iacob</hi> doth here for this end; that in him, and by him, we may be supported. Doth not our experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tell every one of us that we are not able to sustaine our selves? and that we must be propt and upholden, or else we cannot choose but droup and fall. Man is like unto the Hop or Ivie, and such other weak Plants, which cannot stand of themselves, nor bear their own weight, but must have something to lean to: How miserable would we be if we were left to our selves, and destitute of all <hi>external help?</hi> how insignificant would one be if he had no other supplies, but what he could furnish from, and by himself? We have certainly no sufficiency or subsistence of our selves, and therefore we ought to cleave unto him, who only can stay and support us: If we lay the stress and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of our Souls upon any other thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides GOD, it will be but like the Hop or Ivie's clasping about a Thistle, or Nittle, for

                  <p>IN the preceeding Chapter we have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to <hi>Iacob's</hi> first Request, and have shewed what it is <hi>to have the</hi> LORD <hi>with one,</hi> and how large and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive a Blessing it is; for in effect it contains not only the other two which follow, but all other things else, which one can reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably desire: All the good that a man hath or which he can desire, is meerly the effect of GOD'S <hi>favourable presence.</hi> And so <hi>Iacob</hi>

                  <p>The second Request <hi>Iacob</hi> here made, is in these words, <hi>If he will keep me in the way that I goe;</hi> Which words speak out, that he was both apprehensive of Dangers, and that he thought none but GOD could truly defend him from them, or deliver him out of them. And indeed, first it was no wonder that he was apprehensive of Dangers, the fear of his brother <hi>Esau's</hi> wrath was one Principal Reason, why he left his Father's house, and seeing Friends and so near Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations bore him such ill will, and were ready to do him mischief, what might he expect from Strangers, who were no wayes tied or obliged unto him? if <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Father <hi>Isaac</hi> were in such fear of their Lives when they sojourned, that they deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

As he passed through the Waters, they might overwhelme him; the excessive heat of the Day, or the cold frosts of the Night, might bring on heavy Sicknesses and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases. It's impossible to reckon up all the evils which may befall a man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or to point at all the Sources from whence they flow; For we are lyabe to Dangers from all the Elements, and from every part of the Creation; A thousand Mischances and Accidents may happen to put an end to our life, or to render it miserable.

thousands; some Vineyards and Gardens have been taken away by the innundations of Rivers, but more by Covetousness; As some Merchants and Seamen have been brought to ruine by Storms and Tempests, so others by Pirats and Theeves and the Barbarity of those to whom they run for Shelter. And thus upon many accounts it is true, <hi>That Man that is born of a Woman, is of few dayes and full of trouble,</hi> as <hi>Iob</hi> saith; which <hi>Iacob</hi> might now understand by his Reason, as afterwards he spoke it to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> from his experience, <hi>Gen.</hi> 47. 9.

For he shall give his Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy wayes, they shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a Stone.

But the thing which GOD promised to do for his Own, and which all who sincerely seek him may look for, is, that either <hi>first</hi> he will prevent and keep off Dangers, and such evils as are threatned by men, or which we may have cause to fear from other things; or <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> that he will abate the Severity and Rigour of them when they come, &amp; keep us from feeling too much the smart of them,

by sending something or other at the same time, which may Ease and Comfort our Minds, that we may be the better able to bear it; or <hi>thirdly,</hi> he will procure us a Happy Issue and outgate so that we may not altogether be swallowed up by them; nay <hi>fourthly,</hi> that he will even make the Evils and Mischiefs threatned, &amp; inflicted, to turn to our Good, and to prove instrumental either to our <hi>Spirituall</hi> or our <hi>Temporal advantage;</hi> That even upon this account we may have reason to rejoyce for the dayes wherein we have seen evil.

                     </gap>ur Minds with the hopes of this, he hath not only given us his Promises; But laid before us several excellent examples of his <hi>Providence,</hi> towards his Saints and Servants in the Disposal of their Calamities and Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Thus though <hi>Abraham</hi> was in hazard by coming to the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> for being a Stranger, the Inhabitants might have been jealous of him, and have thought it their interest to hinder his settlement, yet GOD suffered no man to do him harme. With every disaster that befell <hi>Ioseph,</hi> GOD grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him some comfort, for he made him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to find favour in the sight of those he
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55045:40"/>
was among. <hi>Moses</hi> was exposed to perish in the waters, but he ordained <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to step in, and take him up, which occasioned him to get a more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Liberal and noble Education, than what his Parents could have given him. <hi>David</hi> was often in danger both from Men and Beasts, yet the LORD delivered him out of them all. The three Children were cast into <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar's</hi> fiery furnace; but he suffered not the <hi>fire to have power upon their bodies, nor was a hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor had the smell of the fire passed on them; Dan.</hi> 3. 27. <hi>Daniel</hi> also was thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lions Den, but GOD sent his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, and shut the Lions mouths that they did him no hurt, Chap. 6. 22. And this same <hi>Iacob</hi> though he was hated by his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and his Sons, and hotly pursued by them, yet when they overtook him, the LORD suffered them not to speak either good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil against him, or to do him any manner of mischief. His Brother <hi>Esau</hi> also, when he heard of his coming homewards, came out with four hundred Men against him, for to cut him and his off; but when they met, in steed of Fighting, they kissed each other, and gave mutual expressions and assurance of Kindness. So that as <hi>Solomon</hi> observeth,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55045:40"/>
                     <hi>When a Man's wayes please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him; Prov.</hi> 16. 7. that is, He will either turn their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into Love, and their Malice into Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, or He will so bridle their Wrath, that they can do him no hurt, but be oblidged to behave themselves as to the Outward part civilly. Of this we have many Proofs in all Ages throughout the World, but it is especially evident in the Revolution of States: for in these turns of Affairs, it hath been often seen, that some have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served and suffered to live in Peace, when in all Humane appearance, the contrary might been expected, yea was actually look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for by all; because the letting them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, was so little agreeable to the inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and interests of those who had grasped the Power into their hands.</p>
                  <p>From all these therefore let us learn, <hi>First,</hi> when we apprehend any cause of Fear, or foresee any Evil coming, from whatsoever Airth it be, let us, I say, seek GOD as <hi>Iacob</hi> did here, and shelter our selves under His Protection; we may indeed and ought to use Prudent and Ordinary Means, but take heed that our chiefest confidence be in <hi>GOD,</hi> and his Help: Let us not be taken up with any thing we our selves can do, or with
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55045:41"/>
any Refuge we may expect from others, as to forget to depend upon the LORD; and to call upon Him for His Aid and Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; <hi>I will,</hi> saith the <hi>Psalmist, lift up mine eyes unto the Hills from whence cometh my help;</hi> And that we may know what Hills these were he meant of, he addeth, <hi>my help cometh from the LORD, which made Heaven and Earth; Psal.</hi> 121. 1, 2. If thou wilt run to the <hi>LORD,</hi> he will certainly keep thee; other Keepers may fail thee, or they may be asleep when thine Enemy comes upon thee, as <hi>Abner</hi> was and all the Host with him, when <hi>David</hi> stole in upon <hi>Saul.</hi> But if GOD keep thee, thy Keeper will not slumber. <hi>Behold,</hi> saith the <hi>Psalmist, He that keepeth Israel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shall neither slumber nor sleep,</hi> in the forecited place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let us consider whither we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy any Safety, have we escaped any Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and Evils which were threatned us? Are the Storms and Clouds dispelled which we feared? Do we at present enjoy any Ease and Quiet? If so, we may learn from what hath been said, whom we are obliged to for this, and whom we must thank, even GOD, for He and none other is the Author of all this; For whoever or whatever were the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat Instruments, He was the <hi>Supreme Cause</hi> and <hi>Director.</hi> Owest thou any thing to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55045:41"/>
the Favour and Good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will of Men? It is he and he only, who turns their Hearts towards thee, it is GOD who Ordered and Contrived all these Favourable Circumstances which occasion thy present Peace and Safety: It is the LORD who is thy Keeper, He is thy Shade upon thy Right Hand; and therefore see that thou do acknowledge it by Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Him thy Hearty thanks, and ascrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Praise of all to his <hi>Almighty Power</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> and take heed lest your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulness make him who hath hitherto been thy Friend, to turn thy Foe, and to give thee up to the will of thine Enemies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> and lastly, Doth any man want Peace? Hath his life been still full of disquiet and trouble? Wants he the Hearts and Good will of those he lives among? Where ever he goeth, and whatever he doth, doth he still find Enemies and Persons who bear him Malice and Ill will? Doth one Cross and Danger come upon the back of another, so that he hath no Rest or Security? Such an one may learn by what hath been said also where the fault lies, and who is to be blamed for it: 'tis perhaps because he hath never sought the LORD, nor studied so to order his Wayes, as to Please GOD, he hath trusted too much to himself, His Wit
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55045:42"/>
and Industry, his Wealth, Power, or Friends, because of these he hath thought with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that it should be alwayes well with him, and therefore he hath not cared much for GOD; and therefore GOD hath set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to vex and trouble him. For as the <hi>Eyes of the LORD are upon the Righteous, and his Ears are open unto their cry: so the Face of the LORD is against them that do eVil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the Earth; Psal.</hi> 34. 15, 16. Because <hi>DaVid</hi> displeased the LORD in the matter of <hi>Uriah,</hi> therefore 'tis said, <hi>That He raised him up many Enemies.</hi> Let every Man therefore Try and Examine himself, let him search his wayes, and see what sin lyeth at his door, and repent of it; and let him turn unto the LORD, and He will cause His Face to shine Favourably upon him, happy shall he be, and it shall be well with him. Make GOD thy Friend, and <hi>He shall preserVe thee from all eVil: He shall preserVe thy Soul. The LORD shall preserVe thy going out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thy coming in, from this time forth and eVen foreVermore; Psal.</hi> 121<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7. 8.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. IV. Jacob's</hi> third Request considered, in respect of himself; Though the generality of Men ask more, yet all wise Heathens and Iews have preferred this Portion to all Others. The confining our Desires to this, is shewed by seVerall instances to be Wise and Reasonable; and that therefore eVery one ought to content himself with his Competency. All Mens Competency is not the same. What is the Duty of him, who hath got his Competency? what of him who hath less? and what his, who hath more?</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>JAcob's third Request,</hi> which he here makes, is for Maintenance, this is the last thing about which he <hi>conditions with GOD;</hi> And in this particular he was not Immodest and Exorbitant; His Desires were far from being Inordinate and unreasonable, for he craves only what was <hi>simply necessary</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisit for the Support of his Life: He askes no more, but that <hi>GOD</hi> would <hi>give him Bread to eat, and Raiment to put on;</hi> without these he could not live, and having these he thought he had enough, all that was Need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or Sufficient, as to his Present State and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:55045:43"/>
Condition. And that <hi>Iacob</hi> confined his Desires to this Sober Measure of Food and Raiment is the more observable, seeing we find a little before, GOD making him large Profer's, and great Promises of the <hi>whole Land</hi> in which he was. It might been thought that he would at lest taken in GOD'S own Promise unto him, as one of the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his <hi>Vow,</hi> and that he should have said, <q>well, if thou wilt indeed give me all this which Thou hast Promised, and do all these things to me which Thou hast spoken, and make me so Great, and so Rich a Man, then <hi>Thou shalt be my</hi> GOD<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </q> But he takes another Method, and Proceeds after another Manner, he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses by all these large Profers of Wealth and Greatness, and pitches only upon a meer simple <hi>Sufficiency of Food and Raiment,</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it Improper and Unreasonable, and a peece of Immodesty for him to seek more than was necessay for him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If GOD gave more, it was an Act of His Bounty; if his Wisdom and Goodness thought fit to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow a larger Allowance, and a greater Measure of these <hi>Temporal things,</hi> it might be matter of Praise and Thankful acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; But it did not become him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe and set down<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Rules to the <hi>Soveraign</hi>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:55045:43"/>
                     <hi>LORD</hi> of Heaven and Earth: he knew his Happiness was not tied to these outward things, and that Man's life did not consist in the abundance of these things which he pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed; Food and Raiment was sufficient for the support of his Life, and therefore he craved no more.</p>
                  <p>The generality of the World are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise minded, their desires are not bounded with <hi>Iacob's,</hi> they are not satisfied ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily with the portion of Food and Raiment, however sufficient it be of it self; they are not contented with meer necessary Supplies; but greedily covet a <hi>Superabundance,</hi> which is both their Folly and their Sin. We have shewed how wise and understanding the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch</hi> was in the two former Particulars, and have proposed him as our Patern, and if we will consider it, we shall find him to be no less Wise in this, and no less Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of our Imitation. Wherefore let us set this holy Mans Example before us, and let us moderat our Desires after the things of this Life, according to this Measure and Model, which he gives and sets to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. and to which all Wise Men have ever proportioned their Desires.

As if he had said, thou art not wise, thou understands not they self sufficiently, if thou think it a fine or a good thing to be Rich, and to have great abundance. <hi>St. Paul</hi> judged this, which <hi>Iacob</hi> here required, sufficient matter of Contentment, <hi>having food and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> saith he, <hi>Let us be therewith content;</hi> 1. Tim: 6: 8: And we might instance even in many Heathens, who sought no more than a meer Competency, and in their Judgement preferred that to the greatest affluence of Worldly Wealth, and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur. <hi>Horace</hi> calls this, <hi>Auream mediocritatem,</hi> a Golden Competency, because it is the best of Conditions; and elsewhere he saith,</p>

It is not Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion to set down Measures, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe what should be given, where nothing is due, Now GOD owes us nothing, He is not oblidged to give us any thing at all: But only because we are his Creatures, he is Ready and Willing to preserve us, and hath in some sense oblidged Himself to Maintaine and Cherish that Life he hath given, which yet gives no Allowance to seek for the satisfying of our unreasonable, and unsatiable Appetites. <hi>Necessaries</hi> we may call for but <hi>Superabundance</hi> and more than enough, we ought not; seeing we Live meerly by the Bounty of <hi>Almighty GOD,</hi> we ought not to carve for our Selves, but the Alms and Portion which He bestowes we should take Thankfully, and sit down Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly therewith. It is observed that though we have several other failings of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of GOD mentioned in Scripture, yet there is not one instance of an immoderate desire for <hi>Temporall Goods</hi> in any one of

To what purpose is it to seek more than that we stand in need of? All that is over and above is perfectly vain, useless, and unreasonable; And it is no real, but an imaginary Satisfaction only which a Man can promise to himself thereby. If one keep the Wealth by him which he stands not in need of, if he hoord it up in his Chests and Coffers, and put it to no use, what is he the better of it?

That is, a Man's Life is not prolonged thereby, he must not necessarily live as long as he hath any thing to spend, even though he have <hi>much goods laid up for many years,</hi> his <hi>Soul may be very soon required of him,</hi> as the Parable there sheweth. And as the Abundance mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not our Life the longer, so neither much the better. True Pleasure and Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth not alwayes follow great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of this Worlds goods; he that hath little, and but a <hi>moderate competency,</hi> passeth his dayes ordinarly more Quietly and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly, than he that hath much Riches,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55045:47"/>
and his sleep is alwayes sounder. The sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est sleep doth not necessarily follow Beds of Doun, and Pillows of Silk. <hi>The sleep,</hi> saith Solomon, <hi>of a labouring Man is sweet, whither he eat little or much; but the abundance of the Rich will not suffer him to sleep; Eccl:</hi> 5: 12. Our Natures may be well enough supplied with little, <hi>Natura paucis contenta,</hi> and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily when that little and <hi>moderate competency</hi> is only enjoyed, it affordeth greater Pleasure, and more Satisfaction than Excess and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance. What is superfluous and redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant commonly turns to our Hurt and Dammage, breeds Surfeitings and Loathings, Pains and Diseases, and doth Violence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to our <hi>Natural Complexions,</hi> and so tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the <hi>shortning of our dayes.</hi>

                  <p>But farther a State of Mediocrity or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency proportioned unto our Necessities is far more desirable than Great or Superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Abundance, because this condition is more safe and secure, and less subject to changes and alterations. <q>A man in this State (as is well expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Excellent Lord<note place="margin">Hales Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temp. part first pag. 181.</note> Justice <hi>Hales</hi>) will not be so readily disquieted through the malice and envy of others; as he who is in an Estate of External Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur,

Wealth, and Power; For he who is in the former State, hath nothing that others do covet or desire, but the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath gotten the Golden Ball that the generality of mankind are fond to have, and restless till they have gotten it, which makes the Man's estate unquiet and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe, because he hath many competitours for what he enjoys, which are continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavouring to trip up his Heels.

How hath this engaged them into a life of Strife and Debate? they have been so far from Augmenting even their temporal <hi>happiness,</hi> that many have losed it altogether, their Enemies not being content to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way what was so much envyed by their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and covetousness, unless they also redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them to circumstances worse than their former, that they might not be in a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of revenging themselves</p>
                  <p>Besides all this, such a competent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as we are speaking of, is of it self by far perferrable to any other, because there is less care and trouble attending it, and it affords a man time and leasure for acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knowledge &amp; vertue, and for mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and waiting upon the Great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of another World. He that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wants what he stands in need of, or hath much more, both of them are often necessitat to be a drudge to this life: all their

thoughts, &amp; cares, are for the most part about the World, and the things of the World, which debaseth a man very much, and is a stouping of him far below the designe of his Creation, he was created for the enjoyment of GOD, for converse with his <hi>Maker,</hi> and the Exercise of <hi>Divine vertues,</hi> which both a state of want and a state of superfluity and abundance doth very much hinder and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert him from. This made <hi>Agur</hi> pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst both, <hi>give me,</hi> saith he, <hi>neither poverty nor riches; not Riches, left I be full and deny thee, and say, who is the LORD.

Paul, <hi>fall into a temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtfull Lusts, which drown men in Destruction and Perdition.</hi> 1 Tim: 6. 9. This <hi>Crates</hi> that <hi>Pagan Philosopher</hi> had some sense of, when he threw his money into the Sea, declaring, <hi>that he would drown it, lest it should drown him;</hi> he might indeed have found many better and more Vertues Wayes of disposing it, for preventing the mischief thereof; But however this shews, that even <hi>Natural Wisdom</hi> teacheth that there be
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55045:49"/>
more inconveniency in Having, then in Wanting riches. <q>Of all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions in the World (saith<note place="margin">Ibid pag. 180.</note> that excellent Personage for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned) a redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant and over plentifull condition is most subject to the most Dangerous and Perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Temptations in the World; As namely forgetfulness of GOD; Self-De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, Pride, Insolence, Oppression, Injustice, Unquietness of Mind, Excess, Luxury, Intemperance, contempt of others. I have very often, saith he, known these persons that have carried themselves sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, and commendably in a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mediocrity; nay have been able to bear with Victory the shocks of these Temptations that arise from want and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty: yet when in the late times being advanced to Wealth, Power, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, they were lost, and could not bear the Temptations that attended Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, Wealth, and Power. So that the sun of wealth and Prosperity quickly disrobed them of that mantle of Innocence, Piety, and vertue that they keept about them against the Stormes of Wants and necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</q> And perhaps there be few, but from our experience we may learn and observe
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55045:50"/>
the like. Though Men little regard it, yet certainly it merits our consideration, seeing it was spoken by our Saviour, <hi>Verily, verily I say unto you, that a rich man shall hardly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kingdom, of Heaven; and again, I say unto you, it is easier for a Camel to go through the eye of a needle, then for a rich Man to enter into the Kingdom of GOD, Mat.</hi> 19.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see what Reason and Wisdom there is in this Request of <hi>Iacob's,</hi> and how much it doth really concern us to bound &amp; measure our Desires thereto. Food and Raiment we may and ought to seek, because without this, we cannot live conveniently and comfortably; but to ask more, as it is Insolent and Immodest in regard of GOD, so it is Vain and Unreasonable in it self, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe in respect of others, and very Dangerous for our selves.</p>

competency, their convenient Food, as <hi>Agur</hi> terms it; for it is certain that this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries according to the various conditions of Men: Some require more and some less, the same measure doth not fit all; a single Man needs not so much as he who hath a Family, a Privat Person so much as a Publick, one in a low Condition, as he of better Rank and Quality, every Man's Necessities are according to his Station, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and Circumstances; and therefore as <hi>Zeba</hi> and <hi>Zalmunna</hi> said to <hi>Gideon, as is the man, so is his strength;</hi>

                     </gap>o we may say in this Case, <hi>as is the Man so is his competency.</hi> But whatever it be, having found it, let us Humbly and Modestly ask it of GOD as <hi>Iacob</hi> doth here, and let us not think to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it without him, for unless he give it, we cannot come by it; <hi>It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows, for so he giveth his beloved sleep,</hi> Psal: 127. If the eyes of the inferiour Creatures, as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> tells us, <hi>do all waite upon GOD, that he may give them their meat in due Season;</hi> how much more doth this become us, to whom he hath given reason and understanding, by which we know that our food and raiment are his peculiar gifts; It is true they who seek not GOD, may come to have these

things; For wee see the wicked and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have them usually in abundance: But then they cannot be considered as tokens of <hi>Gods</hi> love, <hi>as effects of his special favor and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular care, and as pledges of better things in the life to come, and so they loss their lest savour, they want that which would give them the sweetest taste.</hi> It is the love of the giver which puts a value upon the Gift, and so our chief delight in these temporal things should be, because they come from GOD, and witness his favour for us; otherwise they can afford but a Mean and brutish Satisfaction, no greater then what an Ox or Horse, hath over their fod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Now, who waite not upon GOD, though they have their sustenance &amp; more, yet it is not given them as a Blessing, they have reason rather to look upon it as a Curse, that they may be among those whose portion is in this life only. <hi>Omnia temporalia Dei munera sunt, ne putetis quod aliquis illa possit dare nisi unus Deus.</hi> August: And as we should ask our necessary sustenance, as it becomes us to seek our dole and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, so let us be carefull not to offend him by craving arrogantly more for which we have neither Precept, nor yet any Patern of any wise or holy Man in all the Scripture. But we must not content our selves to seek
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55045:51"/>
this by Prayer only, it behoveth us to seek it, and also to wait upon GOD for it, in the use of these prudent lawfull and ordinary Means which his Providence hath appointed; for 'tis this way ordinarily that he gives it, and by which we must expect it. Prayer ought to be used, but it must not be wholly rested in; When the LORD directs us to Pray for our <hi>dayly bread,</hi> the meaning is not, that GOD may give it without our own <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours;</hi> we do not Pray that GOD may Feed, and Cloath us by a <hi>miracle,</hi> as he did the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> and the children of <hi>Israel</hi> in the Wilderness: But only that he would blesse our diligence and industry in those ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Courses which his <hi>Wise Providence</hi> hath Ordained and Established, that thereby we may procure the means of <hi>our subsistence</hi> and the <hi>comforts of our lives.</hi> That sentence which GOD past upon Man after the fall, stands yet unrepealed, <hi>In the sweat of thy face thou shalt eat thy bread;</hi> This is still in force it binds all, and it is in the observance hereof, that we are to expect our necessary Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and Support. Only in following these <hi>Ordinary means</hi> and <hi>Methods,</hi> we ought to beware of all <hi>immoderate care, anxiety</hi> and <hi>Solicitude, taking no thought what we should eat, or what we should drink, or wherewithall we</hi>

                  <p>In the next place, it will be fit and proper that we consider our present State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and what be those things which GOD hath already bestowed on us, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we may know how to behave and demean our selves sutably.</p>

the Happiness and Sufficiency of thy present Lot. For to be informed of the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of our present Condition, we must not proceed by those Measures which Pride, and Vanity, and Luxury, and Voluptuousness, and corrupt Customes lay down, but we must examine and consider things accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their true Nature and Use, and as Sober and Modest Reason doth dictate. <hi>Magis nos docere debet judicium veritatis, quam praejudicium consuetudinis.</hi> If we have whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Food, though it be not Rare, Costly or Delicious, if we have Cloaths that are Useful and Comely, though they be not Gaudy and Splendid, and for great Osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, if we have as much as serves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve our <hi>present necessities,</hi> and to afford us Necessary and Convenient Accommodation, though not for Lavish and Prodigal Spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or so much as others have, or equal to what our Ancestours enjoyed, in this case we have no Reason to complain. And if we do complain in these Circumstances we shall never be satisfied in any, he that is not contented with a Moderate and Reasonable <hi>Competency</hi> will never think the greatest A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance enough; when Mens desires once go beyond their necessities, no measure of Wealth or Riches can stay them; <hi>Crescit</hi>

                     <hi>amor nummi, quantum ipsa pecunia crescit:</hi> And <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>he that loveth Silver, viz.</hi> with an immoderate Love, <hi>shall not be satisfied with Silver; nor he that loveth abundance with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, Eccl.</hi> 5. 10. The best and readiest way to become Rich is not to seek to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease our Substance, but to Moderate and Abridge our Desires. The true way to fill a leaking Vessel is not to carry it to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean or some great River, but to stop the leaks, for so long as they continue, it were no more possible to fill it at the Ocean, then at some small Rivolet, even so if we would draw Contentment and Satisfaction from our present State and Condition, we must not let our Desires reach farther then what is Just and Equitable, otherwise the whole World will not be able to content or satiat them.</p>
                  <p>But suppose that it shall be found even by the narrowest Measures, that thou art in an Estate of Want, and hast not a Sufficiency answerable to thy Necessities; in this case indeed thou hast not full matter of Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but however thou must Labour to support thy self with Patience, considering that this is the Lot which the <hi>All wise GOD</hi> hath given thee to whom thou owest an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Submission, and who may have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed

this, as to punish thy former Follies and Sins, so likewise both to further thy greater good and also to prevent greater mischiefs and evils which might have befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len thee. And though thou mayest very law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully seek to be out of this present <hi>Necessitous Condition,</hi> (providing it be by Lawfull Means and Moderat Cares and Endeavours) yet thou hast no reason to Fret and Repine thereat: For consider, that as thy <hi>Estate is little here, so thy account shall be the less hereafter,</hi> and thou art also at present delivered from many Dangerous Temptations, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps thou couldst not well have resisted, and art rid of many Incumbrances and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanglements which would either have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thy Progress in Vertue and H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55045:54"/>
Piously in whatsoever Condition GOD puts us. The state of Man in this World may be compared to a play, whereof we all are the Actors; and as in a play it is of no great moment, what part a Man act, providing he act the part alloted him handsomely, and well, for he that acts the part of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant or Clown rightly, gets as much Praise and Reward as he who playes the part of a Prince: So let it not trouble thee, whither this or the other Condition hath fallen into thy share, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther GOD hath given thee this or the other Station to shew thy self in, but whatever it be, do thou what becomes thee, walk sutably to thy place and Circumstances, see that thou carry thy self so as that GOD may be Glorified, thy self Praised<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and others Edified, and when the Play is done, when this Life is ended, great shall be thy Reward.</p>
                  <p>Lastly if thou find that GOD hath put thee into an Estate of Redundance &amp; Plenty so that besides the liberal supplies of thy Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities thou hast much considerably over and above; if so, then thou owest first great thanks to GOD for his Bountyt and Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to thee, whilst many others in the World are Pinched and Strained: Thou

broughtest as little into the World with thee as they did, and therefore if the <hi>Divine Providence</hi> had not made the difference and kept it up, thou shouldest have felt their Poverty, and they might have enjoyed thy present Plenty. Make therefore an thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Acknowledgement unto GOD'S Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as this <hi>Iacob</hi> did afterwards upon the like Consideration, <hi>O GOD,</hi> said he, <hi>I am not Worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the truth which thou hast shewed unto thy servant, for with my staff I passed over this Iordan, and now I am become two bands; Gen.</hi> 32. 9: 10.</p>

                  <p>The present Condition of this <hi>Patriarch,</hi> is a fit and proper Embleme to hold forth the Nature and Qualitie of Man's Life, while in this World; for what <hi>Iacob</hi> was at this time, all Men may be said to be, during their abode upon Earth.

Our very Life here is nothing else but a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, and that both in a Literal and Moral Sense. It holds even for the most part true Literally, for there is no settled Condition here: like Travellers we are still in a continuall motion, flitting up and down; what do we else but traverse the World, and go from one place to another? He is truely a singular person who hath never been from his Mothers knee, nor seen any other place then that of his Birth, nor conversed with any other Men then his particular Friends and Relations, and those he was Born and Bred amongst.

When we think our selves most secure, and are building to our selves Houses and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles of Residence, hoping that here we shall fix and settle, behold, presently some thing or other occurs which defeats our Design, and alters our Purpose, and constrains us to make Tryal of some State and Condition we little thought upon.

                  <p>But however true it hold in a <hi>Literal sense,</hi> it is alwayes <hi>Morally true,</hi> that Man while upon Earth is but a Sojourner and Stranger whatever be his Lot and Portion. For <hi>first,</hi> GOD hath not intended us a Sure and Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Abode</hi> here, he hath resolved not to suffer us to make any long or considerable stay on the Earth, he designs only that we should take a short view of things, take a turn or two and then remove hence. Man's Life here is but of <hi>few dayes,</hi> even those who attain to the greatest number of years, their life if compared to <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> is but a <hi>span-long;</hi> and seeing that thus we have but so short and so uncertain Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of this World, our stay therein can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

We can call no place here our <hi>Home,</hi> we never go <hi>Home</hi> till we descend into the Grave, and pass over into the other World; that is our <hi>Home,</hi> because there is no chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, nor flitting from it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> As we are to account our selves <hi>Sojourners,</hi> because our Life is short, so <hi>Strangers,</hi> because of the want of an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Habitation. All Creatures have a proper Element, whither also their Natural Propensitie inclines them; that is the Proper and Natural Element of any Beeing which is suitable to its Nature and Quality, and where it finds Rest and Ease; but on the contrary, that is Improper and Unnatural which agrees not with its Disposition, and where it lives with Difficultie, and in much pain. Thus the Air is an improper Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Fishes, as the Water for Fowls, and Terrestrial Creatures; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this World is not the proper place and habitation of Spirits, and Rational Beings: And therefore also not of Men, seeing we are of this Order by our <hi>better part.</hi> The

Creatures to be met with here below, are not capable of Converse with us; and all the Delights and Enjoyments here can only gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the Body, and be profitable for chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those <hi>frail Tabernacles we carry about with us;</hi> But 'tis little service they can do the <hi>Soul,</hi> and therefore however proper these <hi>lower Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions</hi> may be for Bodies, yet certainly our Souls soar higher, and aspire after a Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness beyond what is to be found here.

This World affords no perfect Contentment, or true solid Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: All we can expect here is some little Refreshing to keep us from Fainting and Languishing. This World is an <hi>Inne,</hi> too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and scanty for to give <hi>Satisfactorie ease</hi> and <hi>fulness;</hi> this is only to be looked for when we come to our <hi>Fathers house, where there are many Mansions,</hi> and all Richly and well Furnished; <hi>In his Presence, there is fulness of joy, and at his Right Hand there are Rivers of Pleasures for evermore; Psal.</hi> 16. 11.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Earthly Canaan</hi> which was here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to <hi>Iacob,</hi> was a type of Heaven, and given as a Pledge thereof: It is not to be doubted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that the <hi>Patriarch</hi> had a prospect beyond the Land wherein he was, though it was the pleasantest upon Earth, he had
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55045:61"/>
already tasted these Delights which <hi>Canaan</hi> upon Earth afforded: and albeit they were good enough of their kind, yet he could not but be sensible, that they were far short of of satisfying the Appetite of the <hi>Soul:</hi> And that therefore there was something to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, more then what is to be found even in the best Countrey here. <hi>Iacob</hi> had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the best and most <hi>vertuous Education</hi> of any in the World, he was preserved from <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Immorality,</hi> which render Men <hi>brutish,</hi> and so enfeeble their Minds, that they can Dream of nothing but what savours of the Flesh; he was early taught all Natural Wisdom and Knowledge, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed also in things which <hi>Natural light</hi> could not reach to: And therefore he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly knew, and was persawded that there was <hi>something within him</hi> besides <hi>Flesh and Bones;</hi> even a <hi>Divine Soul</hi> capable of, and designed for a more <hi>noble kind of Life,</hi> then what Man enjoyes at present: Because the Promises made to the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> expressed in <hi>Scripture</hi> are <hi>Temporal,</hi> we must not from thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that they had no other, <hi>Spiritual</hi> &amp; <hi>Eternal Blessings</hi> were Vailed under these, and might perhaps also be Promised a part, though they be not particularly mentioned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No doubt more was Revealed to them then
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55045:61"/>
what we have an account of, but what is <hi>written was only necessarie to be known to us for the pointing out of the Messias.</hi> It is very unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to think, that they who were so Dearly Beloved of GOD, Honoured with many Particular Revelations, and whose Wisdom and Vertue was more then Ordinary, I say it is unreasonable to think that they were left ignorant of a <hi>future state.</hi> Such a thought is injurious to the Love of GOD, and also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with that Character they deserve; as questionless they had a Curiosity to know, whither there was <hi>another better life</hi> hereafter. So GOD would not refuse to satisfie the same, it being very Laudable and very Necessary for the directing of their Life and composing their minds in Peace, It is but small Comfort and Satisfaction, the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> can be supposed to have had, in the Promises that were made them; if we take away the Hopes and Expectation of another Life: For the Promises did more concern their Posterity then themselves; And as for the Favours presently conferred, the pleasure thereof could not but be very much marred with the thoughts of their Death. Nay, the more Good they Enjoyed, the more they would be Troubled, when they reflected upon their Mortality; And they
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:55045:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
could not but frequently reflect thereon, seeing every where Instances thereof are to be met with. Death damps a Man's Spirit, and Imbitters his Life; The greater matter of Contentment one hath at present, the greater will be his Disquiet when he thinks he will die: Unless he believe his death will be followed with a long and better Life. It is the Wretched and Miserable, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire death, or think upon it without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate: Others cannot think upon it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sadness, if they have not the Comfort which ariseth from the Assurance of after Happiness. <hi>O death,</hi> saith the Son of <hi>Sirach, how bitter is the Remembrance of thee to a Man that liveth at rest in his Possessions, And to the Man that hath nothing to vex him, and that hath Prosperity in all things, Yea, unto him that is yet able to receive Meat; Eccles.</hi> 41: 1, 2. If then the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> had been ignorant of a Future State, and without the Hopes of it, their Life would have been very Miserable; And the Singular Blessings GOD bestowed on them, would have but tended to increase their misery. But that another better State was made known to them, and that they lived in the expectation of it, is plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timat to us by St. <hi>Paul Heb.</hi> 11. 13. &amp;c where he saith, <hi>these all died in Faith, not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:55045:62"/>
                     <hi>received the Promises, but having seen them a far off, and were perswaded of them, and Embraced them, and Confessed that they were Strangers and Pilgrims on the Earth, for they that say such things, Declare plainly that they seek a Countrey; And truly if they had been mindful of that Countrey from whence they came out, they might have had Opportunity to have returned but now they desire a better Countrey, that is an Heavenly. Therefore GOD is not ashamed to be called their GOD, for He hath prepared for them a City.</hi> And a little before he tells us parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularlie of <hi>Abraham</hi> that he <hi>looked for a City which hath foundations, whose Maker and Builder is GOD.</hi> Which he could not look for in this World, and therefore certainly he expected it in that which is to come.</p>
                  <p>If we break off the Fetters of Lusts, and Disintangle our selves from Carnal and Worldly interests, and allow our Souls but any measure of Rational Wisdom; As then our <hi>Desires</hi> would soon take Wing and flee above Sublunarie Enjoyments, so our <hi>Minds</hi> would be easily inclined to believe another better State to succeed this: For without this Supposition, <hi>Man</hi> is the strangest and most Puzling <hi>Phenomena,</hi> the most Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable thing in Nature, a <hi>Beeing</hi> patcht up of Irregularities &amp; Contradictions: For by

Nature he is capable of Immortality, and yet as to his Duration but an <hi>Ephemera,</hi> of so short a Life, that he bends to die almost as soon as he begins to live; He is capable of the highest Perfection, and fitted for the Noblest Imployments, and yet i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> we do not suppose <hi>another Life,</hi> he hath nothing else to do, except to eat and drink, and serve the mean ends of an <hi>Animal Life;</hi> which the <hi>brute Beasts</hi> attain to with much less toil and trouble. Thus <hi>He</hi> who is the Chiefest of all the Creatures we see, and seems to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd <hi>Lord</hi> of them, would be in the worst Condition of any; Because never attaining the End and Perfection his Nature is capable of, neither receiving the Satisfaction of his most Reasonable, which is the most Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like desires. If there were not an after-State preferrable to this, <hi>Man</hi> would not be the Ornament of the <hi>Creation,</hi> but rather its Deformity; And would afford some ground of Impeaching the <hi>Divine Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> as if either the Contrivance had been marr'd, or the Design of Creating him cruel, in that he is indued with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities never to be Perfected, and with Desires and Appetites which cannot receive Satisfaction. Hence it would follow that GOD is kinder to the Beasts then to Man;
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:55045:63"/>
And that he is the happiest Man who least useth his Reason and Understanding, that is, that layeth aside that which maketh him Man, and endeavours to be as the Beasts who perish. Then they should be in the worst case, of all others the most Miserable who Love and Fear and Serve GOD most, and are most Careful to Please Him. These and a great many moe Absurdities would follow the Negation of a <hi>Future State,</hi> which cannot be admitted, unless we deny a <hi>Providence</hi> altogether, and ascribe all things to <hi>blind Chance.</hi> And indeed the <hi>Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of our Souls</hi> seems to follow so necessarly from a belief of a <hi>Deitie,</hi> that there have been very few who doubted of that, without cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling this in Question too.</p>
                  <p>But though those things may incline us to the belief of a <hi>Future happy State,</hi> yet they do not certainly assure us thereof; They are great and strong <hi>Presumptions</hi> indeed, but no certain <hi>Demonstrations:</hi> Because it might be alledged that these Absurdities are rather the Consequence of our Ignorance, which cannot understand better, then of that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed state of Man; And that we cannot conclude any thing to be, because that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes we are unable to Salve and Vindicat the Wisdom of GOD: For how do we

know what is Consistant or Inconsistant with <hi>Infinite Wisdom?</hi> Many things may be agreeable thereto which we cannot find out. The undoubted certainty therefore of an <hi>after happy State,</hi> can only be drawn from the <hi>Gospel of IESUS CHRIST;</hi> He <hi>hath brought Life and Immortality to Light,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1: 10. He hath put this matter clearly out of doubt, so that it needs no longer be Disputed as an uncertain <hi>Probleme. IESUS CHRIST</hi> by his plain Assertions, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Promises, and his own Resurrection, hath Demonstrate to the World that there is another Life to succeed this: So that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Perversness and Obstinacy can make Men call it in Question. He that will not be Convinced with this Evidence which the <hi>Gospel</hi> giveth, is proofe against all Evidence, and it is impossible to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him; <hi>He who will not believe Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets, CHRIST</hi> and the <hi>Apostles, will not believe though</hi> One <hi>should rise from the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as it is the <hi>Gospel</hi> which doth only ascertain us of a <hi>Future state,</hi> so it is from it only that we may learn any true account of the nature and qualities thereof. This is a thing not so easie to be guessed at as the other. If any should offer to describe the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:55045:64"/>
State of a Countrey which they had never seen, neither hath any true <hi>Idea</hi> of, this description would be but bad and far from exactness: Now Heaven doth infinitlie transcend the best state in this World, and is of a quite different nature, so that our conceptions could not reach it, unless it were revealed. The Heathens who had not this true light to direct them, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained wild and extravagant fancies about the nature of that Life which is to succeed this: But yet they were not so gross and absurd as <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who set aside the light of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and followed his own dreams, which have suggested an odd kind of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,</hi> and such <hi>Monstruous Pleasures</hi> there, as can relish with none but beastlie and bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Persons: for others certainly cannot but despise them, and be so far from count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such enjoyments of happiness, that they will certainly reckon it the greatest misery to be tyed to them eternally. Some of that <hi>False Prophets followers,</hi> are so ashamed of this account he gives of Mens happiness in the other World, that they study to put a fair construction thereupon, by interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the same allegorically: But though this should be admitted, it will not excuse; for such Similitudes should have been shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55045:65"/>
which can only serve to beget in Mens minds base and low thoughts of that <hi>Blessed Life,</hi> and which are so far from engaging men to purifie themselves here in order to it; that they rather foster an perswasion, that none are fitted and disposed for it, but impure and unclean persons; seeing it is represented by the exercise of impuritie and the grossest sensualities. It is true, the <hi>Gospel</hi> makes use of Earthly comparisons, in holding forth the <hi>Ioyes and excellency of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> Because otherwayes it is impossible to convey to our minds any apprehension thereof: for as Children must be taught in Childish terms, so men cannot be instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in things so sublime, and so far above the reach of their understandings, but by using expressions and Similitudes familiar to them though not so just and adequat in themselves. But though the Scripture when it speaks of Heaven, adapts it self to the weakness of our apprehensions, yet at the same time it guards sufficiently against all low and sordid thoughts: for both the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors</hi> used are choise and cleanlie, and the manner of handling them such, as gives us to Understand, that we are not to take them Literally. The glory of the other Life it set forth by <hi>Growns,</hi> and <hi>Scepters,</hi> and <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetings</hi>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:55045:65"/>
and <hi>Rivers of Pleasures;</hi> But we are allo abundantly cautioned against the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of carnal gratifications; for these cannot be look'd for there, where the state of things makes them no wayes desirable, but altogether unnecessarie; for then men live not an <hi>Animal Life,</hi> but a life <hi>Sublimely Spiritual.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All the circumstances and particularities of the <hi>Life to come</hi> are not revealed, neither are we yet capable to know them. At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent our faculties are not fitted to discern the pleasures and enjoyments above; even though they were laid out before us, we could no more take them up then a blind Man colours, or the Infant in the Womb, the Chearfulness of this lightsome World, or a Child the strong contents of riper Age. When <hi>St paul</hi> was caught up into <hi>Paradise</hi> he was so transported besides himself, that he knew not well <hi>whither he was in the body, or out of the body;</hi> And what he saw and heard there, he tells us is <hi>unspeakable, and not possible to be uttered;</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 4. Untill the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Disposition both of body and mind be changed and Spiritualized, we can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enjoy that Life above, nor yet fully understand the Pleasures and satisfactions thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:55045:66"/>But that all possible Felicity, will both be then bestowed, and there also enjoyed, is not only expresly promised, but this we may very well conclude from what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. For <hi>first,</hi> that State above, hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing troublesome or uneasie in it. It is not like this World lyable to rough Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, severe Storms, or excessive heats, which occasion fainting; nor doth there e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fall out any sad disaster or calamitie to discompose the minds of the Inhabitants. There be some Mountains, as <hi>Tenariff,</hi> which surmount the Clouds, and it is said the Air about the top of them is alwayes so calm, that the smallest Sand or Dust will remain unblown away, and in the same manner it was first laid down, which may be no unfitt Emblem of the Tranquillitie of Heaven: It is the Fate only of these <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunarie Countreys;</hi> to be infested with Fogs and Mists, with Wind and Rain; such is the constitution of this World, that the pleasures here are marr'd and allay'd, by some or other disgustfull inconvenience which always attend them: but the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Regions</hi> are ever Clear and Serene, there is a perpetuall Calm there, and a constant Freedom from all sort of Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances. They, who are there, saith <hi>St. Iohn, shall hunger no more, neither thirst any</hi>
                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:55045:66"/>
                     <hi>more, neither shall the Sun light on them, nor any heat: For the Lamb which is in the midst of the Throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them unto Living fountains of Waters, and GOD shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. And thereshall be no more death; neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain, for the former things are passed away,</hi> Rev. 7. 17. 21. 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly</hi> not only what Disquiets our present Life, and holds us in continuall Vexation, is for ever thrust out of Heaven: but also the Beautie and Ornaments of this World, are laid aside as Imperfections and Unnecessarie things; and what is <hi>infinitlie more glorious,</hi> take places in stead of them. The <hi>Sun</hi> is the Beautie of this <hi>lower World,</hi> and how disconsolat would our Condition be without the light thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But so glorious is the <hi>State above,</hi> and so excellent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, that the <hi>Sun</hi> it self, and its Light would be but a Blemish <hi>there:</hi> for <hi>St: Iohn</hi> tells us, <hi>that the Heavenly Ierusalem had no need of the Sun, neither of the Moon to shine in it, for the Glory of GOD did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof;</hi> and again, <hi>there shal be no night there, and they need no candel, neither light of the Sun: for the LORD GOD giveth them light,</hi> Rev. 21. 23. and 22. 5. All Kings and

Princes, Study to have their Courts answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their Magnificence and Dignitie; The Palaces of Kings are alwayes Seated in the best part of their Kingdoms, and thither are brought the Chief delights which their Countreys can afford: How Glorious and Magnificent then must Heaven be, which is the Palace of the great King, the Peculiar habitation of GOD himself? if he hath so Beautified this World, and Replenished it with such variety, when it is only the <hi>lower apartment of beasts;</hi> or at the best but a <hi>transient quarter</hi> for Man, What do we think will that be, and how sumptuously Enriched, which he hath design'd to be his own everlasting abode, and the Habitation of those peculiar ones whom he hath set his love upon, and with whom he hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to remain for ever?

Of all pleasures, Friendship and the society of Excellent Persons is the greatest; it affects the mind most, and fills the Heart with the greatest Measure of Joy and Gladness: what Delight and Satisfaction then, may be expected in the Society of <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Arch-Angels, Cherubims</hi> and <hi>Seraphims,</hi> and <hi>the Spirits of just Men made perfect?</hi>

                  <p>But <hi>fourthly,</hi> in the <hi>other life</hi> we shall find our selves, not only in a far better State as to Externals but shall also feel great and Glorious Changes in our selves. For <hi>first,</hi> we shall not be tyed to the necessity, of Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Drinking and Sleeping, <hi>in which mean exercises, the one half of our time is consumed;</hi> there we shall not be cloged and fettered to a crazy, infirm, and sickly Body as now, <hi>for then this Corruptible shall put on Incorruption, and this Mortal, Immortality. And CHRIST IESUS shall change this vile Body, that it may be fashioned like unto his Glorious Body, according to the working whereby He is able to subdue all</hi>

                     <hi>things to himself;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 21. There shall be a vast Change in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>rame and Constitution of our Body: For there shall be given to it, Glory and Power, and Splendor, and some other Subtile and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Qualities, so far above the <hi>common Nature</hi> of Bodies, that the <hi>Apostle</hi> thought fit to term it a <hi>Spiritual Body. Secondly,</hi> As such Glorious Changes are to be wrought upon our Bodies, so the like shall be done to our Souls; the Body is thus changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the better, because the Soul is also made more perfect: these excellent Endowments are bestowed upon the Body, because the Perfection and Dignity to which the Soul is now raised, require that it should be solodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; For being our inward Faculties are much better then Formerly, the outward Organs and Instruments of Action should be better too. Now our Souls shall not only be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from Ignorance and Errour, and all the Disorders which sin hath involv'd them into, but shall also have all their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties rectified, and elevat to the outmost hight of Perfection, of which Creatures are capable. Truth shall not then be vail'd with Absurdity, nor shall we be oblidged to seek the Knowledge thereof; by such tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and uncertain inquiries as now we are
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55045:68"/>
necessitate to: But shall be endowed with all desirable Wisdom; <hi>Now</hi> sayes the <hi>Apostle, We see through a Glass darkly, but then face to face; now I know in part, but then shall I know as also I am known;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. And to make our Souls compleatly perfect, there shall be added unspotted Puritie and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and a participation of the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Beloved,</hi> saith St. <hi>Iohn, now are we the Sons of GOD; and it doth not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when He shall appear we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 2. The <hi>Image of GOD,</hi> shall be renewed upon our Souls, and that more clearly and brighty then it was at our <hi>first Creation;</hi> the <hi>Divine Perfections</hi> shall be transcribed upon us, and thereby we shall be brought into a near and inconceivable Union with GOD. And now seeing this doth appear, what needs more? Here we may well stay our Thoughts, for indeed there is no climbing higher; GOD is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection it self, and the Fountain of all Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, he therefore must needs be most Happy, who is like GOD and United to him. It is simply impossible to conceive greater Happiness and Satisfaction, then this Enjoyment of GOD and likeness to him. <hi>David</hi> doubted not of receiving Satisfaction from this, when he said, <hi>As for me I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:55045:69"/>
                     <hi>thy Face in righteousness, I shall be satisfied when I awake with thy likeness; Psal.</hi> 17. 15.</p>
                  <p>This is <hi>true Felieity,</hi> and should be aspired after, 'tis a shame for any Man to sit down lower, or to content himself with less De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Happiness, seeing GOD is willing to bestow this upon him. The obtaining <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Eternal Life</hi> should be our main Project, and the great Design we should be alwayes dryving on, nothing should divert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>us from this; but all our Endeavours should be to further it on: And our Prayers to GOD should be chiefly, that he would be pleased to <hi>favour this aim of ours, and not suffer us to miscarry.</hi> Some whom Worldly Love and Carnal Affections have seized and enslaved, may with <hi>Reuben</hi> and <hi>Gad</hi> wish to have <hi>their Tabernacles set up this side Iordan:</hi> And providing they could get their Portion in this Life, would never seek after the <hi>Land of Promise:</hi> But such certainly Act contrary to Reason, and unbecoming the Dignity of their Natures, They must put off the <hi>Man</hi> very much who intend no higher Pleasures then what are Bodily, and arise from the Enjoyment of Earthly things; Which though gluted to the full, can never satisfie the Soul. As all Mens Experience do testifie. <hi>As Noahs Dove found</hi>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:55045:69"/>
                     <hi>no rest untill she returned to the Ark;</hi> So neither can the Soul of Man have any solide content until it ascend into <hi>the holy hill of GOD;</hi> and rest in the bosom of him from whom it had its being.</p>
                  <p>And as Man's <hi>true Felicity</hi> lyes not in this, but in the other World, so the chief Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction which we can have at present, flowes from the sure and well grounded Hopes of that after Happiness; even as the greatest content of a Merchant while he is Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficking abroad, is in the Expectation of the Gain he will make when he comes home: And as the chiefest delight of an Heir while he is <hi>Minor,</hi> is in his hopes of succeeding to his Father's Honour and Fortune when he arrives at full Age. Here we are as it were, in the Quality and Condition of <hi>Minors,</hi> and therefore have no Reason to grudge though we be not put actually in the Possession of full Happiness. We may be very well sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for the present, that the same is sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reserved to us, and waiting upon us till that we be ripe for it; <hi>Blessed be the GOD and Father of our Lord IESUS CHRIST, which according to his abundant Mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope, by the resurrection of IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST from the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not</hi>

                     <hi>away, reserved in Heaven for us;</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>The Design of this present <hi>Treatise</hi> is to direct to <hi>true Felicity,</hi> which as it is of great Importance to be known; so we judge we have made some plain Proposals, which may sufficiently instruct those who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to know, if they be also unbyassed. The sum of all this is, that <hi>true Happiness</hi> consists in the Enjoyments of GOD; for in him only is to be found what may satisfie all our Desires: All the Creatures are but <hi>finite things,</hi> and consequently their use is Limited and Restrained to some few Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars; they can neither remedy all evils, nor procure every thing Good and Desir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. The <hi>Sun</hi> gives Light, but doth not nourish; Meat nourisheth, but doth not Warm; Cloaths they warm us, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not recover our Health; Physick may do that, but cannot protect us from Dangers; and therefore we should be little the better, for the Enjoyment of one or a few of these <hi>Temporary Goods,</hi> unless we had all: and even though all were enjoyed, our Souls would crave some Satisfaction beyond what they could afford. The way to be Happy then, is not to seek to amass Wealth and Honour, and the other things of this World: the best and surest way is to seek
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:55045:70"/>
GOD and make Him our Friend, for in him we shall find whatsoever is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, He is <hi>infinite in himself,</hi> and the <hi>inexhaustable fountain</hi> of all Good, and there is in him what may serve all our necessities, and satisfie our Desires. And as he is our <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> our <hi>Chief good;</hi> so he is most readie and willing to Communicat himself to us: If we Labour to Please Him, and to approve our selves to him, he will befriend us as much as is requisite to our <hi>present Condition</hi> here, and hereafter when we are rendred capable thereof, he will Bless us with the full Enjoyment of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, whereby we shall be possessed of the most <hi>Perfect Felicity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Perfect Felicity</hi> is not to be met with in this World, in vain do men look for it, it is reserved till the <hi>next Life:</hi> All the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness which here we can enjoy, consists in the hope of that <hi>perfect Happiness which is to come,</hi> and in having fair Opportunities to secure it, together with the competent Supplie of our <hi>present bodily necessities.</hi> He then who would be truly Happy, let him make GOD and Heaven his great aim; for this will certainly lead to that Compleat and unspeakable Felicity of the other World; And in the mean time will procure him
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:55045:71"/>
all the Satisfaction desirable in this. If we were so wise as to propose this to our selves, our Life would not be so uneasie and troublesome as ordinarly it is: but we should enjoy a great deal of Tranquillity and Peace. For hereby we should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served from <hi>immoderat cares, discontentedness, and impatience,</hi> which so much disturb our Minds, and are the only hinderances of our <hi>present Felicity. First,</hi> he who placeth his Happiness in GOD, and sincerely pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> needs not vex himself with <hi>cares about the things of this Life:</hi> but may <hi>cast all his care upon GOD, who will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly sustain him;</hi> and who hath promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>if we seek first the Kingdom of GOD, and his righteousness, all these things shall be added unto us.</hi> Matth. 6. 33. <hi>Secondly,</hi> this will bring our Minds to be contented, with Moderat and Competent Supplies, by taking off our thoughts from Wealth and Greatness and Honour, &amp;c. <hi>Having food and Raiment,</hi> saith the <hi>Apostle, let us be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with content:</hi> And good reason, seing it is all that Travellers stand in need of. All that is requisite to one in a Journey, is his <hi>Viaticum,</hi> convenient Dyet, Cloathing, and Lodging, and a safe and Peaceable Passage: Other things would but retard the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55045:71"/>
and render it less easie and safe.. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> this would free us from impatience the last Enemy of our Peace, and would make us bear trouble and Receive Disast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with a Serene composed Spirit; Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that <hi>our time here is but short,</hi> and soon at an end, and that when we come Home to our Father's house, we shall have all things to our Mind, and shall soon be made to forget our Toil and Travel. No Wise Man who sets out upon a Journey will fret and be dejected because the Weather is not alwayes Fair, and the way smooth, and that he finds not every where as good Accomodation, as at Home. While Men are Travellers in forreign Countreys, they must resolve upon Hardships and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies: And we have this great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, to Patience and Cheerfulness even in the midst of Troubles, that no Trouble or Calamitie can defeat our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, if we be but stedfast to them; If we keep our Hearts fixt upon GOD, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant to the prosecution of Eternal Life, we shall certainly arrive there, what ever wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it blow, and whatever Opposition we meet with. It is impossible for either Men or Devils, <hi>to separate us from GOD,</hi> or to keep us out of Heaven, if we continue sincere
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:55045:72"/>
in our Love, and Endeavours.</p>
                  <p>And now that we may draw to a Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as what hath been said sheweth where our <hi>true Felicity lyes,</hi> So it discovereth the Wretched Folly of the greatest part of Mankind; Who though they all desire Happiness, yet miss it: Because they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>eek it not where it is, but place the same in some vain empty Enjoyments. It is sad, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how Wild and Extravagant Men are in their Aims and Proposals, how hotly they pursue Toyes and Trifles and very means Things? and in the mean time, how careless they are of what they should most mind, <hi>viz. GOD</hi> and their <hi>eternal Interest.</hi> All are sensible that they <hi>cannot live here for ever;</hi> Its evident and visible unto them, that <hi>Nill they, Will they,</hi> they must be gone out of this World: And yet very few, are so wise as to endeavour that it may be well with them, when they remove hence. Their Thoughts for the most part are about the present World, and the things thereof, as if they were never to leave them; Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly though they could brook them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, they could not intend them more earnestly, or be more busie about them. Some being dazled with the Splendour and Glistering of Riches, labour for them with
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:55045:72"/>
all their Might, others grasp at Power and Command, as if that were some Fine or Happy thing; some study to be accounted wise and and Learned, some would raise themselves a Name, And desire to be the talk and Discourse of the World, every one has his Different aim and design which he followeth, <hi>trahit sua quemque voluptas;</hi> And that they may compass these their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Aims, They are still holding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and others in continuall Vexation and Trouble, and do fill the World full of Jarres and Contests. Now this behaviour of of Men is most Unreasonable and Unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, seing our Dayes are so few and that we are of so short continuance in this World; these things might be somewhat excusable if we were to live here for ever; but seing that cannot be, seing by the <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Decree</hi> of GOD, we are only appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Lodge here for a short time, how vain and foolish is it to make a great dale adoe about that which is neither necessary to our Present Peace and Comfort, nor yet to our Future Happiness; It is just as if a Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler coming to an Inne, where he were to stay but for a Night, and finding it but Poor and Mean and ill Accommodat, should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently send for Masons, Carpenters and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:55045:73"/>

If by such Impertinencies Men did only disturb their Present Peace and Quiet, the matter were yet the less, though even here their Loss would exceed their Gain, suppose they should obtain their Desire? But alas the great concerns of another World are often put in hazard thereby! Their Souls for the most part perish in these Attempts, and by their Eagernesse to have those vain and short Enjoyments of this <hi>present Life,</hi> they often keep themselves from receiving the Satisfactory and <hi>Eternal possessions above.</hi> O <hi>that men were wise, O that they understood this, that they would consider their Latter end!</hi> O that they were so Wise, and Happy, as not to enterprise or engage themselves into any Pursute: untill they first Weighed and Examined the importance thereof, whither the Fruit and Event would recompense the Pains and Labour!

                  <head>Chapter First. A short Review of the <hi>First Part.</hi> The Case pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, how far it is Lawful to eye the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in our Resolutions of Obedience. The Resolution given in five Particulars, with an Application of all to <hi>Jacob</hi> here.</head>
                  <p>THere are two things to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in every Vow, <hi>viz. What is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,</hi> and <hi>what is desired,</hi> this last we have handled already, as to this <hi>Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Vow of Iacob's</hi> here; we have in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Discourse opened up the Nature of his Requests and shewed what he sought of GOD, and made it appear, that as he was Humble and Modest herein, in respect of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:55045:77"/>
GOD, so very Wise for himself things craved comprehending all that is Necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Requisite to compleat ones Happiness in this present World, he who is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the Favourable Presence of GOD, who is kept and protected by the Power of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> and who hath Food and Raiment, that is, what is Competent and Sufficient for the serving his Necessities, and the Maintenance of the Present State, he hath all that is desirable in this World; And therefore <hi>Iacob</hi> is a fit <hi>Patern</hi> to direct us how we should steer our course, and what we should Aim at, while in this World, and wherein the Happiness of this <hi>Present Life</hi> doth consist.</p>
                  <p>Having thus cleared and treated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the <hi>Conditional part</hi> of this Vow; It followes next that we consider and speak to the <hi>Promissory part</hi> thereof, that we may see what the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch</hi> binds and oblidges himself to do to GOD, if so be he bestowed and granted these things to him.</p>
                  <p>But first, We will Answer and Resolve a <hi>Question</hi> which any may readily start here, and it is this, <hi>whither it be lawfull to take in conditionall Clauses in our Resolutions to serve GOD,</hi> or <hi>how far we may have a respect to our benefit in our Purposes of Obedience,</hi> for it would
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:55045:77"/>
seem that <hi>Iacob's</hi> service here was a little <hi>Mercenary,</hi> that he made a formal Bargain with <hi>God,</hi> and that he resolved only to serve him upon condition he did such and such things to him, for he <hi>first</hi> asks, and <hi>then</hi> he promises. For answer to this, we shall first consider the Case in general, and then speak to what <hi>Iacob</hi> did here in particular.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>first,</hi> you must know that we <hi>owe to GOD all possible Service and Obedience,</hi> even ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting from these <hi>External Rewards</hi> which he hath to bestow, and which we have good ground to expect from him. Indeed no Man doth or shall serve GOD for nought, they be-lye GOD, and speak falsly, who say, <hi>It is in vain to serve Him, and what profit is there in keeping his Ordinances;</hi> for he plentifully rewardeth such as seek him in <hi>sincerity</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> and is most Liberal to all those who come unto him: but however there are other <hi>prior Obligations</hi> and strong <hi>tyes</hi> upon us to Obey and Please Him, so that although we had no Advantage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by serving the <hi>LORD,</hi> yet we could neither Reasonably complain of, nor decline His Service, for he is the <hi>Author of our Life and Beeing,</hi> we are his <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and the work of his hands;</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath just Right and Power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us, and all the Service we are able to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:55045:78"/>
do, is small enough requital for what he hath already done to us; And he may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call for it, though he should add no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Favours. It is his <hi>own Bounty</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> which makes him load us with his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, there is no Obligation upon Him therefore, our Services do not, nor can they Merit any thing at GOD'S Hand, &amp; though we should suppose them never so excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table or Worthy, yet GOD is alwayes afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand with us, and we can never draw him in Arrears to us, for our very Life and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is more then sufficient payment for all that we are able to do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> the chief Motive to the Service of GOD and the great Principal by which we should be acted in our Obedience, is <hi>that of love.</hi> God himself, <hi>and his glory,</hi> should be the <hi>chief end,</hi> which we propose to our selves, otherwise our Service is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reasonable nor Acceptable. GOD is not like man, that he may be profited by us, <hi>our goodness,</hi> as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> sayeth, <hi>extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to thee; Psal.</hi> 16. 2. And how little will he value what is not done to him, but to another? Now though we be never so much taken up in the Acts of Religion and Vertue, yet that cannot be counted Homage and Worship payed unto GOD, unless we make
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:55045:78"/>
him our <hi>last end;</hi> But it is service only pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that which we chiefly aim at, be it our selves and Riches, or Honour, or Pleasure, or whatever else we have the greatest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to. That for which any thing is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, is of it self more beloved, when <hi>David</hi> dealt kindly and lovingly with <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phibosheth</hi> for <hi>Ionathan</hi> his Fathers sake, it is a certain Argument that he loved <hi>Ionathan</hi> more then <hi>Mephibosheth.</hi> He that loves a Man for Money, and for Meat, loves Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and Meat more then the Man, for these are the Causes and Ends wherefore he loves the Man; so he that serves GOD for any other End then GOD, he certainly loves that more then GOD. Now if we prefer any thing to GOD, we do not love him truly, nor will he regard us as upright be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. <hi>He,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>who loveth Father or Mother, Son or Daughter, or his own life more then Me, is not worthy of Me; Matth.</hi> 10. 37. <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 26. CHRIST upbraided the Men of <hi>Capernaum</hi> for following him, because it <hi>was for the loaves.</hi> We do not reckon them our Friends, nor do we think our selves oblidged unto them who wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us and do us service, because they bring Gain and Advantage to themselves thereby; these are <hi>Mercenary Persons,</hi> but he is our
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:55045:79"/>
Friend, who abstracting from his own Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, or from any Advantage which we might procure him, doth freely and hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set himself to please us, or to assist us in our Affairs. <hi>If a Man visits a sick Friend, and watches at his pillow for Charities sake, and because of his old Affection, we approve it, but if he does it in hope of a Legacy, he is a Vulture,</hi> saith <hi>Seneca, and only watcheth for the Car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <hi>Non sine prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mio diligitur Deus,</hi> saith holy <hi>Bernard, etsi absque praemii intuitu diligendus sit;</hi> that is, <hi>GOD is never loved without a reward, albeit he is not to be</hi>

                        <hi>loved chiefly for the Reward; our Love to Him can never be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, but yet it should not be</hi> Mercenary, <hi>for it should not seek its own things.</hi>
                        <pb n="145" facs="tcp:55045:79"/>
                        <hi>The Soul that loveth GOD should not require a greater Reward of its Love, then GOD himself, or if it require any other thing, it doth not love GOD, but that other thing.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> though we must chiefly serve GOD for himself, and what we do to him and for him must in the first place be out of <hi>pure love to him,</hi> yet we may have also a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to our selves, and to our own proper good, this doth not hinder the other; these two are not inconsistent together to love our selves, and to desire our own Happiness needs not imped, but should rather further our Loving GOD above all things. The best way of loving our selves is to endeavour the <hi>enjoyment of GOD, ille satis se diligit qui sedulo agit ut summo fruatur bono.</hi> There are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in our very Nature great desires of Happiness, and it is impossible to root them out; we shall as soon cease to be, as cease to have Desires for our Preservation and well being, or not to intend this in all we do, and therefore it is certainly Lawfull to have an eye to our own Good and Felicity, providing that we subject this to the Glory of GOD, and make it subordinate to the Desires of pleasing him. It doth not Spoil or cast a Blot upon a <hi>Son's respect and love to his Father,</hi> that he minds and seeks his
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:55045:80"/>
                     <hi>own interest,</hi> &amp; doth expect a share in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Inheritance; if so be he do it not to the greif and displeasure of his Father; neither doth it shew that we want True Love to <hi>God,</hi> that we seek and aim at our own Happiness, if so be we do not prefer our selves to GOD, nor yet take Courses to obtain our Happiness contrary to the Will and Commands of GOD. In the LORD'S Prayer, which is both a Patern of our Prayers, and the rule of our Desires, we are taught as in the first place to intend the <hi>Glory of GOD, the hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Name, the Advancement of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the fulfilling of his Will; So</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to desire our own Good in the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Sustenance of our Soul and Bodies, and in our Deliverance from Sin and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. <q>The Gospel doth not (saith one) Plainly prohibit us the Love of our selves, but teacheth only to Moderate it rightly, to Subject it to GOD, and to referr it to Him, we must not Love GOD for our selves, so as that we our selves are to be considered as the Last end, and GOD only to be placed in the Order of Means, by the fruition of whom we may be rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Happy, but because we pertain to GOD whom we ought to Love above all things, therefore also we ought to Love
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:55045:80"/>
our selves with a reference to GOD: our Good is therefore to be sought, that in it we may taste the Goodness and Sweetness of <hi>God,</hi> and that <hi>Gods</hi> peculiar measure, (so to speake) may be so much the more enlarged; thus our own proper love should be swallowed up in that Ocean of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is not only Allowable, but it is Necessary and Commanded, that we propose to our selves and have still be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes the Eternal Rewards of the other World, and We can never intend these enough. They do not understand things well, who study to take Peoples thoughts off these, and who go about to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade Men, that that Obedience is not Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which is done for Heaven; these are wild and <hi>Extravagant Principles,</hi> and it is sometimes advanced and set forth by as <hi>Romantik a fable,</hi> of a Womans going with a Torch in the one hand, and a Bucket of Water in the other, the one to burn up Heaven, the other to drown out the fire of Hell; That Men might serve GOD nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the Hopes of the One, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of Fear of the other. It is a peece of Arrogancy to model Mens Obedience otherwise then GOD hath done, and to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:55045:81"/>
offer to take away these things which GOD hath Ordained, and which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to Men to push them on the more forewardly in all manner of <hi>well-doing.</hi> And as one saith, <hi>if the Dowry which GOD hath given to Vertue, and Religion, were taken away, they would perhaps have but few Platonick Lovers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>—Quis enim virtutem amplectitur ipsam,</l>
                     <l>Praemia si tollas?</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>However all the Saints and Servants of GOD mentioned in <hi>Scripture,</hi> are said to have had the <hi>Promises of GOD for the future Life</hi> before them. We are told of <hi>Moses, that he had a respect unto the recompence of the Reward; Heb.</hi> 11. 26. And <hi>Saint Paul</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to himself <hi>the Crown of Righteousness;</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7, 8. Yea it is said of our Saviour himself, <hi>that be had an eye to the Ioy which was set before him; Heb.</hi> 12. 2. And <hi>St. Peter</hi> tells us the end wherefore there are given unto us, <hi>such exceeding Great and Precious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, is that thereby we might be partakers of the Divine Nature, having escaped the Corruption that is in the world through lust;</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. Thus it is not only Lawfull and Necessary for us to look often to that which GOD himself hath proposed to us; that we may be the more
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:55045:81"/>
Powerfully Excited and Encouraged to run the Wayes of GOD, and to keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements: Nay the Glory and Felicity of the other World is a thing which GOD hath chiefly before him, and therefore we should have it also. Obedience to the Laws of GOD is the Means only to carry it on, and so the end why we should do this, is to obtain that, and by intending that we truly Glorifie GOD, and do shew that we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him before all things. For the Main and great Happiness of Heaven it self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the clear Knowledge and full Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of GOD; and therefore, as one saith, <hi>it is too great nicety to distinguish between GOD and Heaven, his Glory and our Salvation, for they are not really things distinct; We cannot in a true Sense seek the Salvation of our Souls more then the Glory of God, for the one is the Advancement of the other. Heaven is not a thing without us, nor is happiness distinct from a Conjunction with God, to love God above our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">See Smith Sel: Dis: pag. 399</note> 
                     <hi>is not indeed so properly to love him above the Salvation of our Souls, as if they were distinct things, but it is to love Him above all our Sinful Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and particular Beeings, and to conform our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly and Lastly, the proposing to our
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:55045:82"/>
selves the <hi>temporal enjoyments</hi> of this World, as a <hi>Principal end,</hi> the making Wealth, Honor and Riches a main Motive why we serve GOD, and Obey him, is altogether Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull. It is a peece of the grossest Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, and Men do thereby dishonour GOD and Religion, in making them stoup for to Serve their <hi>base Carnal designs;</hi> they who are guilty of this, cannot be said so much to exercise Religion and Vertue, as to abuse them, and in steed of Honouring <hi>GOD</hi> they do but put a Mock upon him, like that <hi>Gentleman</hi> in <hi>Elian,</hi> who coming into the presence of the <hi>Persian</hi> King, at his entry into the Presence Chamber he stouped to take up his Ring, which he purposely let fall, that thereby he might be thought to pay that adoration to that Monarch which the Laws obliged him to. Satan laid this to <hi>Iob's</hi> charge, and would have made it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that it was only GOD'S Blessing him with Outward Prosperity which tied him so much to the Service of GOD. doth <hi>Iob,</hi> saith he, <hi>Fear GOD for nought? Hast thou not made an hedge about him, and about all his house, and about all that he hath on every side? Thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath,</hi>
                     <pb n="155" facs="tcp:55045:82"/>
                     <hi>and he will curse thee to thy face;</hi> Job 1. <hi>verse</hi> 10, 11. The Devil thought <hi>Iob</hi> was of the humor of some who keep close by a Man, whilst any thing is to be expected from him, and that he is in a capacity of doing them good, but so soon as Fortune frowns, and his Condition alters they turn their backs and run away: To take off which tash from <hi>Iob,</hi> and to convince the World of the falshood of this Accusation, it was that GOD gave Satan power over all that which he possessed. And indeed though the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of GOD be the most Natural, Reasonable and Proper Way, for securing to our selves the good things of this Life, yet he suffers his Faithful Servants sometimes to fare worst, that their Sincerity may be tryed and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested, and that Men may learn thereby to seek and serve him for higher and more <hi>noble ends.</hi> GOD requires us to <hi>mortifie all immoderate desires for the things of this Life,</hi> to be so far denyed to all <hi>sublunary enjoyments,</hi> as neither to care much, whither we have them or want them, not to be overjoyed and lifted up when they come unto us; nor yet dejected and cast down when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from us; and therefore it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for us to have our Hearts set upon that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:55045:83"/>
which GOD teacheth us to despise, and besides that can be no true and proper Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to <hi>Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Service of GOD,</hi> which sometimes cannot be obtained, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then by swerving from them; <hi>ye cannot serve GOD and Mammon,</hi> saith CHRIST, and the Reason is clear, because their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands often interfere and come in Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition together. We cannot sometimes se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our Life or Fortune, our Honour or Means but by renouncing GOD, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Laws, wherefore our Saviour tells us plainly, <hi>if any Man come to Me, and hate not his Father and Mother, and Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and Brethren, and Sisters, yea and his own life also, he cannot be My Disciple; Luke</hi> 14. 26. That is, if a Man cannot find in his Heart to part with these freely, he needs not offer to follow Him, for he will sometimes be necessitat to leave him. If to have the World be the <hi>chief motive</hi> why one comes to GOD, for the same Reason, he will some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times foresake him, and GOD will have no Regard to that Man, who minds not to be constant, but who serveth only for a time. Wherefore I wish that Wealth, Honour and other <hi>Temporal things,</hi> were less insisted on as Motives to <hi>Christian duties,</hi> though I deny <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>t, but that it may be proper enough
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:55045:83"/>
sometime, or occasionally to shew that <hi>Religion</hi> conduceth to our <hi>present happiness,</hi> as the <hi>Poet</hi> saith,</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>—Semita certe</l>
                     <l>Tranquillae per virtutem patet unica vitae.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>But who come to CHRIST meerly for these Worldly Respects, cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Converts: and as he upbraided the Men of <hi>Capernaum,</hi> so it may be said to them; <hi>Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye seek me not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the Loaves, and were filled;</hi> John 6: 26.</p>
                  <p>But here it will be objected and said, by some, doth not GOD in the Scripture give us many Temporal Promises? Doth he not frequently propose to us Wealth, and Honour, and the other good things of this Life, as the Reward of our Obedience; and is it Unlawfull to have an eye to GODS own Promise, and to Desire that Reward which he hath proposed? <hi>For Answer hereto,</hi> we are to consider that GOD makes these Promises, not to draw our Hearts after the World, or to make us think that our Happiness lies in the enjoyment thereof; but only to free us from Immoderate Cares, and to engage us to serve Him without Anxiety and Solicitude for these Temporall things we stand in need of while we are here
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:55045:84"/>
That we may not be diverted from the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <hi>GOD,</hi> nor interrupted in our pursure of these Eternal Felicities in the other World, by a too great thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness for the Relief of our Necessities in this; therefore it is that <hi>GOD</hi> hath made us the Promise not only of what is simply Necessary, but even also of Plenty and Abundance, and the only use we are to make of these Promises, is to encourage our selves with the Expectation of what is Good, Usefull and Convenient for us, and all the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son<note place="margin">Temporalia haec me, O Domine, juvent utentem, non corrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant mentem &amp; amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem meum retorque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant in te Artificem eorum, ne in his quae placent mihi, ego dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliceam tibi.

Illis adhaeream dilectione transitoria, tibi inhaeream dilectione mansoria.</note> why we should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire these things here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low is, that we may be rendred thereby more <hi>serviceable</hi> to GOD, and more Profitable unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that the <hi>good things</hi> of this World may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to us Pledges of these <hi>better things</hi> above.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:55045:84"/>The sum of what we have said in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the Question proposed is this, That there is an Indispensible Obligation upon us to serve GOD, abstracting from any Consideration of the Benefit to be had thereby, and that our Services are then best and most Acceptable, when they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in Regard of <hi>GOD</hi> himself, and out of <hi>Pure love</hi> to him: but that however we may Respect our own Good, and Seek our own Happiness, and pursue for <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Eternal Life;</hi> for this is not inconsistent with the <hi>Purest love</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> but only <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate</hi> thereunto. But as for the <hi>Temporal things</hi> of this World, it is Unlawful to make them our <hi>Chief</hi> and <hi>Ultimat End,</hi> or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them to our selves as any main <hi>Motive</hi> &amp; inducement to the Observance of GOD, or his Laws, for we should resolve to cleave to GOD, whither he gives us these things or no; Nay though he should leave us alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether Destitute of all Worldly Help and Comfort, yet it should be our Resolution never to forsake him, saying with holy <hi>Iob, though he slay me, yet will I trust in him;</hi> Iob. 13. 15.</p>
                  <p>Now as to <hi>Iacob's</hi> case in Particular, it doth not appear that he swerved from these <hi>General positions,</hi> which we have laid down,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:55045:85"/>
yea it seems evident, that he kept close to them. He makes, 'tis true, his Requests for himself <hi>first,</hi> but his Serving and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring of GOD might be the <hi>chief thing</hi> he had before him: If he had Aimed more at his own <hi>Private Interest,</hi> than at the <hi>Glory</hi> of GOD, he would not have been so Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest in his Desires, nor yet contented himself with so small a Portion as <hi>Food</hi> and <hi>Raiment,</hi> he would certainly have sought more; but that he did not seek more, makes it clear, that he gave himself freely to GOD without Respect to his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits. GOD had been promising him the <hi>whole land of Canaan for a possession to him and his Posterity,</hi> and he to let see that it was not upon that Account he tied himself to GOD, and Resolved to become his Servant, he asked no more but <hi>Food and Raiment.</hi> As if he had said, <q>though thou do not so great things, if thou grant but Food and Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If thou wilt <hi>but bring me back to my Fathers house in peace,</hi> though I should never brook this <hi>Land</hi> as my <hi>Property</hi> and <hi>Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, yet thou shalt be my God.</hi>
                     </q> Thus <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> loved GOD for himself, like a Friend and not for his Benefits, like a Merchant. Could <hi>Iacob</hi> have passed by <hi>Food and Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:55045:85"/>
of GOD, he would not have given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self thus unto GOD upon Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, but absolutely and<note place="margin">Hales Rem: pa: 223.</note> without Condition. Now he is constrained to fall upon the Condition <hi>of Food and Raiment,</hi> for without this he could not love his GOD, because without this he could not Subsist, nor have his Being, by which he evidently witnesses, that he therefore and for no neither End desired to be, but only to Love and Serve his GOD. It was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent speech of <hi>Crispus Passienus,</hi> a witty Gentleman of <hi>Rome, quorundam se judicium malle quam Beneficium, quorundam Beneficium malle quam judicium,</hi> that is <hi>Some Mans Res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and good Opinion is more to be esteemed then another Man's Benefit; and</hi> one saith, that <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> here doth express the same Conceit: for when he came to compound with <hi>Laban</hi> he made his Bargain in another manner, he would not serve him for <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> only, <hi>but fourteen years for his Daughters, and sex years for his Flock,</hi> by which Means he became Rich, and Wealthy, and the Reason why he Covenanted thus differently with GOD, and with <hi>Laban</hi> was, because with <hi>Laban</hi> he sought his own commodity, but with GOD only his Acceptance and Favour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="162" facs="tcp:55045:86"/>From this Example of <hi>Iacob's</hi> we should all of us learn this Lesson to aim at the Glory of GOD in all our Desires, when we make any Requests for any <hi>Particular Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,</hi> the chief thing which should Prompt us thereto should be that we may have the <hi>occasion of serving</hi> GOD, some way or other more eminently. Thus <hi>Hannah</hi> when she Prayed for a Son, she at the same time <hi>vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to devote him to GOD.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> besought the LORD earnestly, <hi>to have mercy upon him, and to consider the trouble which he suffered of them which hate him;</hi> and the end why he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired this was, <hi>that I may,</hi> saith he, <hi>shew forth all thy Praise in the gates of the Daughter of Zion; Psal.</hi> 9. 13, 14. Whither we call for <hi>Spiritual</hi> or <hi>Temporal Blessings,</hi> we should seek them not for themselves, or to rest in the meer enjovment of them, but to reflect Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour on GOD, that we having such things may be capacitated and enabled to do him greater Service, we must not let the Reins loose to our Desires, and be over anxious for the enlargement of our State; for often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there is as much of Vanity, and seeking our own Praise in this, as any other thing.

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:55045:87"/>
have them in our Translation, and put an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other sense upon them; they have it <hi>cumque fuerit Dominus mihi Deus,</hi> making it a fourth Petition, importing as much as if he had said, <hi>if the LORD indeed will be to me a GOD,</hi> which is indeed a very great and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive Request, and doth include all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable Hapiness, for what can One ask more then that GOD should manifest his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, his Power, his Goodness, and all his other Glorious Perfections for his particular behoof and benefit. Wherefore the <hi>Psalmist</hi> having prayed for the flourishing of their State, <hi>That their Sons may be as Plants grown up in their Youth, and their Daughters as Corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones, polished after the similitude of a Palace, that their Garners may he full, affording all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Store, that their Sheep might bring forth thousands and ten thousands in their streets, their Oxen strong to labour, that there be no breaking in or going out, nor any complaining in the Streets;</hi> Having, I say, prayed for this, and being much taken with the Consideration of that Happiness, he cryes out, <hi>Happy is that People that is in such a case:</hi> but presently he checks himself, and upon second thoughts cryes, <hi>Yea, happy is that People whose GOD is the LORD; Psal.</hi> 144. 15. intimating thereby to us, that the LORDS interessing himself in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:55045:87"/>
any People, and becoming their GOD, was a greater Happiness, then all that which he had formerly spoken of, did amount to.</p>
                     <p>But how great and Desireable soever this be in it self, yet we see no Reason why we should interpret the words in this sense, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially seeing they should by this means coincide with the <hi>first petition;</hi> for <hi>the LORD to be with One,</hi> and <hi>to be Ones GOD,</hi> is one and the same thing; and it is not likely that <hi>Iacob</hi> would have come over twice with one thing in so short a Prayer. However our Translation in this agrees with the <hi>Hebrew, Septuagint,</hi> and the <hi>Vulgar Latine,</hi> and we judge it best and more Reasonable to take the words this way.</p>
                     <p>Here then when <hi>Iacob</hi> promises, that <hi>the LORD shall be his GOD,</hi> it implies two things, <hi>First,</hi> that he would not serve the Gods <hi>of the Nations,</hi> whither on this or the other side <hi>Iordan,</hi> that he should take care not to be corrupted with the <hi>Idolatry of the rest of the World. Secondly,</hi> that he should Faithfully serve <hi>the GOD of his Fathers, Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Isaac,</hi> who had here honoured him with a signal mainfestation of his Presence, and that to him, and to him only, he should pay all the Homage, Deference, Worship, and Service which is due from Reasonable
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:55045:88"/>
                        <hi>Creatures</hi> to the <hi>true GOD.</hi> For to take One to be our GOD, is to carry towards him, as to such a <hi>Supreme</hi> and <hi>Infinit Beeing,</hi> and to yield him what is proper from us who are so far below the <hi>Deity,</hi> and who depend upon it for Life, Breath, and all things.</p>
                     <p>Thus you see what the <hi>Patriarch</hi> here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadged himself to: And it doth first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that it was not an <hi>Arbitrary Free-will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offering</hi> which he here Pitched upon; it was not a thing which he could have passed over, and been Blameless; It is a <hi>Natural or moral duty,</hi> which he and all Men as Men, that is, as <hi>Rational Creatures</hi> are strictly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidged unto, This is <hi>the first and great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,</hi> all other are but parts and bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of this: Wherefore it is that we find this set first in that sum and Abridgement of the <hi>Moral law,</hi> which <hi>Moses</hi> had from GOD, and delivered to the People of <hi>Israel: Thou shalt have no other GODS before me,</hi> Requires the same, and neither less nor more then that which <hi>Iacob</hi> here <hi>Vowes</hi> and <hi>Resolves</hi> on, <hi>Viz.</hi> that there shall be no declining and falling off, to the Worship of false GODS, and that the <hi>true</hi> GOD shall have all the Worship and Service which properly belongs to him.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore that we may be stirred up to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:55045:88"/>
imitate <hi>Iacob's</hi> Practice, and to conform to his Resolutions as well as his Desires: we shall GOD willing clear and make out these following Particulars, <hi>First,</hi> that all Men ought to Worship GOD. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that they ought to be very wary in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their Worship, that it be the <hi>true</hi> GOD and none else whom they adore. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> we shall shew what Worship and Service is requisite to be payed to the <hi>true</hi> GOD.</p>

                     <p>Religion and the Worship of GOD, doth indeed suppose that there is One, which we may very well suppose, it being a Truth so evident and demonstrable. Every thing in Nature doth so clearly prove the <hi>existence of a Deity,</hi> that we can never sufficiently admire the Blindness and Stupidity of those who call it in Question: And indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it Argues such Stupidity, some have

doubted whither there be, or can be, any real <hi>speculative Atheists,</hi> and do imagine that such as have pretended <hi>Atheism,</hi> have done it only out of an <hi>ostentation of Wit,</hi> and for to shew their Smartness, in being able to Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and Dispute the plainest and most <hi>received Opinions.</hi> But whither there be any <hi>Atheists</hi> or not, the <hi>Beeing of a Deity</hi> may be easily made appear to any whose eyes are but open to see it: His very <hi>Nature</hi> carries a Demonstration in it, and all things else do prove his <hi>Existence, Praesentemque refert quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet herba Deum.</hi> If we look <hi>within</hi> our own selves, there seems to be such an <hi>Impression of a GOD</hi> stamped upon our Minds, as is not easily defaced and blotted out; And how we could have this, without a GOD, is very hard if not impossible to Resolve. And if we take a view of the World without, either of the Parts singly by themselves, or in their Conjunction together, we shall discern such admirable Wisdom in their Contrivance, as might be sufficient to draw the most Incredulous to an Acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for these things are either the <hi>effects of Chance,</hi> or they are the Works of a Wise Agent; If the last be said, a <hi>Deity</hi> is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and it will be very strange if any have the Impudence to assert the <hi>first.</hi> He may

believe anything in the World, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so Monstruous, who can imagine <hi>blind Chance</hi> could have hit so well, or that things of themselves could have jumped so luklily together, as that the greatest or even <hi>infinit wisdom</hi> cannot be supposed to Rectifie, or to have contrived otherwise.

                        </q> The <hi>Atheists</hi> ordinarly object, against such as <hi>believe a GOD,</hi> as if they were too Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and of an easie belief; But there is more Reason to retort this upon themselves, for they are the most Credulous who believe the most unlikely things, or what hath the least appearance of Truth: Now what can be more improbable, nay impossible then that Things should be produced without any Cause, or that there should be no Wisdom or Understanding, where the greatest Effects and Instances thereof are to be seen. Though one did take <hi>Garagantua</hi> or <hi>Don Quixot</hi> for true History, or did believe the Wildest and most Unlikely Forgeries of the <hi>old Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iravagant Romances;</hi> I could not yet think him so absurd, or judge him to have so large a swallow, as the <hi>Atheist,</hi> who <hi>denies a</hi> GOD,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:55045:90"/>
when there are so many and so great evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences and Demonstrations thereof.</p>
                     <p>Now if there be a GOD, as certainly there is One, there is nothing more clear then that He should be Worshipped. The very <hi>Atheists</hi> will grant this, even those who as yet <hi>deny a God,</hi> will acknowledge the necessity of Worshipping One if he be found; And in Truth it is hard to tell which of the two are most unreasonable, <hi>he who denies there is a GOD, or he who refuses to worship the GOD whom he believes.</hi> If Prudence and Interest, do oblidge Men to Honour and Obey Kings and Monarchs, that under their Favour they may enjoy Safety and Peace; should not every one for that same very Reason, adore and do homage to the <hi>great King,</hi> to whom all the Princes and Potentates of the World must submit and bow themselves? Though he sit in the Heavens, yet His Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion reacheth over all; the whole World is filled with his Presence, he ruleth the Children of Men, and there is no safety but in his Protection, nor any Security but in his Favour. <hi>The LORD,</hi> saith the <hi>Psalmist, is a great GOD, and a great King above all Gods. In his Hand are the deep places of the Earth: The Strength of Hills is his also. The Sea is His, and he made it: And his Hands formed the</hi>

                        <hi>dry-land.</hi> Therefore he infers, and that rightly, <hi>O come let us Worship and bow down, Let us kneel before the Lord our Maker, for he is our God, and we are the People of his Pasture, and the Sheep of his Hand; Ps.</hi> 95. 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If Men needed not either care for the <hi>Divine Favour,</hi> or much to fear his Wrath, they might be somewhat excusable, though they did not highly regard GOD, but seeing it is utterly impossible that ever they can be in such a Condition, wherein they stand in no need of GOD, or may easily protect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the effects of his Anger, it is the most unaccountable madness to neglect him, and to be careless to please him. It is even such and greater madness, as 't would be for a <hi>poor Peasant</hi> or other <hi>mean Fellow,</hi> to slight or shew a contempt of some mighty <hi>Monarch,</hi> while under his Power, and within his Reach. None have less Reason to make Pretensions to wit, then those who slight <hi>Piety,</hi> and cast off all <hi>regard to GOD;</hi> because none act more contrary to common Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and the <hi>Principles of Reason.</hi> Contempt or carelesness of the <hi>Divine Worship</hi> can never be <hi>justified;</hi> unless Men could be certainly assur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>that there is no God,</hi> which the greatest <hi>Atheist</hi> never yet pretended to, nor can he? or else that they could extricate themselves from

all dependence upon GOD, which as it is not desireable, so neither is it possible. And therefore it is absolutely necessary, that all Men concern themselves in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of GOD, and that they be carefull while they live to Own and Acknowledge Him, which who so Refuseth shall not pass Unpunished. They who will not willingly Own and Submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to Him, shall certainly fall under the dint of his Fury.

                     <p>AS thus you see it is necessary we Worship <hi>God,</hi> so by the same Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it becomes no less necessary that we Worship the True GOD, which was the <hi>Second particular</hi> we promised
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:55045:92"/>
to speak to. As <hi>there is a GOD,</hi> so there is but One True GOD, to whom and to none else we must direct our Worship, and our Religious Services; For if we adore any other then him, or make any Partner of our Worship with him, we are guilty of a Crime which is not easily pardoned, for it is a dethroning of GOD. And therefore, <hi>Iob,</hi> saith, <hi>If I beheld the Sun when it shined or the Moon walking in brightness: And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath Kissed my hand?</hi> That is, if ever he was guilty of Worshipping the Sun, or the Moon, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth that <hi>this were an iniquity to be punished by the Iudge: For thereby,</hi> saith the <hi>he, I should have denied the GOD that is above;</hi> Job. 31. 26. 27. 28. <hi>Sceptra non ferunt soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi> Kings can endure no Copartners, nor will <hi>God</hi> suffer any Rival with him? he will not endure that any should share in that Honour which is due to himself alone. <hi>I am the LORD,</hi> saith he, <hi>that is my Name, and my Glory will I not give to another, neither my Praise to graven Images,</hi> Isa 42. 8. <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi> or the Worship of <hi>false GODS,</hi> is such an abomination, and doth so highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the <hi>True GOD,</hi> that nothing will, or can excuse it; neither is there any thing which he is more Jealous of: A Man's <hi>Serousness</hi>
                        <pb n="175" facs="tcp:55045:92"/>
or <hi>Sincerity</hi> will never endear his Worship, and render it acceptable, Unless it be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the right Object, Though one be a favourer of <hi>Monarchy</hi> in the general more than any other Government, yet he can never be counted Loyal, if he neglect his True Prince, and follow an Usurper, no more then he who is for no King at all. Even so though one be never so Devout and Serious in his way, yet unless it be the True GOD whom he Adores, he is not to be esteemed a Friend, and Lover of GOD, he cannot be Reckoned otherwise then as an Enemy, as well as those who are altogether <hi>Irreligious</hi> and <hi>Profane.</hi> We must be sure then that we Worship the True GOD and none else, otherwise it is to no purpose to Worship any: For to worship none, and to Worsh a False GOD, will be alike profitable, that is certainly, they will be both of them hurtfull and pernicious: for either of them will incense the true GOD, and make him set himself against us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy us.</p>
                     <p>Now as it concerneth us to worship the true GOD and none else, so that we may be sure to worship him and none other, let us first Labour to get right Apprehensions of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and <hi>Attributes.</hi> Let
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:55045:93"/>
us be carefull to keep in mind how he is the <hi>Supreme Being, Eternal, Infinit</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> from all others, that he <hi>is Almighty, most wise, most just,</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>Holy;</hi> A <hi>pure Spirit,</hi> who is not only free from all <hi>imperfections,</hi> but who is <hi>infinitlie excellent beyond what can be apprehended,</hi> and <hi>who is every where present.</hi> For as the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith, <hi>he is not far from every one of us in him we all live, move, and have our beeing.</hi> 'Tis this and nothing else which we call GOD, He and none other hath these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties and Excellencies; And therefore not only what we Worship, must be such; but also we must be carefull to Worship Him under the consideration of a being thus <hi>infinitly excellent</hi> and <hi>glorious,</hi> or else we <hi>Worship we know not</hi> what. Instead of the <hi>True GOD</hi> we do but set up an Idol, which our own Fancie hath devised. 'Tis true an adequat Comprehensive Knowledge of God, or of any of his Attributes, is not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible; <hi>for he dwelleth in the light which no man can approach unto, whom no man hath seen, nor can see;</hi> He being <hi>infinite,</hi> and we <hi>finite,</hi> we are not capable of such an exact full know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him. Wherefore it will not follow that One is ignorant of the True God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his knowledge of him is imperfect, for the knowledge which the best have, or
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:55045:93"/>
can have is no other. Nay farther, it is not reasonable to infer, that men are mistaken about the <hi>true God,</hi> because they err about these things which are deduceable from the right consideration of some of his <hi>Attributes,</hi> or because they have not right or true appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of some of the effects of his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, power or goodness. Every one is not capable of drawing proper consequences from truths, and the consequences are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes so clear as the truth it self; it would be too severe to charge one with the denial of a truth, because he does not close with what may follow upon it: Unless the one be as clear and evident as the other, when two things are not a like evident, neither their connexion very palpable, though in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves they may be really inseparable, Men may err very innocently and excusably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them; and cannot be said to reject what is evident, because they do not hold the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is not so. As to the <hi>present case,</hi> that God is <hi>Almighty, Wise. Iust, Holy,</hi> &amp; <hi>Good,</hi> is clear and demonstrable, so that they are altogether inexcusable who do not believe it: But the most proper methods and manner of exercing his <hi>Power, Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Iustice, &amp;c.</hi> Are not so discernable by us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if men differ about them, it is no great
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:55045:94"/>
wonder; and it savours somewhat of arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie, to offer to determine them too par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly. If silly Country-clowns were to speak of State Policie, and Regal Grandeur, 'tis not to be doubted but that they would err grosly, because they have not true or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act notions thereof: But it is less to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it is more beyond the wisest man's reach, to tell exactly what is sutable to the glory of God, and agreable to <hi>infinite wisdom, power,</hi> and <hi>justice.</hi> What boldness were it tosay peremptorly, <hi>God should have done or not have done this, &amp; that if he had or not had done so &amp; so he would have acted unworthily?</hi> What of the <hi>divine actions</hi> are plainly revealed, we see clearly are agreeable to the most <hi>perfect conceptions</hi> of a <hi>Deity,</hi> and what is kept secret, we ought rather to admire in silence, then to sit down and curiously resolve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And if men will needs attempt the resolution of the hidden <hi>mysteries</hi> of <hi>GOD's Councill,</hi> and prescribe Rules for that end, they should rather be check'd for their bold and too curious medling, then unbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a false <hi>god,</hi> because their sentiments cannot be so exactly adjusted to the more common notions of <hi>justice</hi> and <hi>equity</hi> which men have. Wherefore the deriding the God of the <hi>Calvinists,</hi> * as one of late hath done, deserves a severe censure and chastisement;
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:55045:94"/>
For whither these <hi>Calvinistical tenets</hi>

But to return whence we degressed, it is requisite that every one study to get the highest and most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy thoughts of GOD, and it is absolutly necessary that they acknowledge what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly contain'd in the very <hi>Idea of God,</hi> as that he is <hi>Almighty, most Wise, most Iust &amp; Good above all things, and the cause of all things:</hi> For God is only a short term, used to expresse these perfections by; and therefore who takes any of <hi>them</hi> away, destroys the very <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God;</hi> and who worships what he doth not ascribe these properties to, worships not <hi>God,</hi> but some other thing. Even as he is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ignorant of a <hi>circle</hi> or <hi>triangle,</hi> who does not consider the one, as a <hi>figure</hi> made up of three lines with three <hi>distinct angles;</hi> and the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:55045:95"/>
other of one round line, whose parts are all equally distant from the center; who knows not this, is quite destitute of the notion of these figures: But if one knows this much, he cannot but be said to have the right no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>circle</hi> and <hi>triangle,</hi> though he do not understand all which knowing and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Mathematicians</hi> demonstrate about them.</p>
                     <p>But it is not enough for preserving our selves from <hi>Idolatry</hi> that we get and <hi>maintain</hi> some right <hi>true</hi> and <hi>proper notions of a Deity.</hi> Men may have these, and yet be <hi>Idolaters;</hi> in that they fix these notions where they ought not, and ascribe them to that which in it self is not God. Thus the <hi>Heathens</hi> were guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Idolatry:</hi> for many of them, were not so much mistaken in their <hi>conceptions</hi> of God, as in the application of their general <hi>concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> to the particular <hi>objects</hi> of their worship, when they spake of God (at least the wise &amp; understanding persons among them) they shewed that they believed him a <hi>Supreme Beeing</hi> of great Wisdom, Power, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and therefore they term'd him alwayes the <hi>Summum Numen, Deus ter optimus maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> So that their sentiments concerning the Nature and Attributes of GOD, could not be so much found fault with as their gross absurdity in misapplying these proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:55045:95"/>

of the true GOD: But now that the World hath been, so miserably o'respread with Idolatry, and that Men are become so vain in their imaginations as to set up false <hi>Gods</hi> and to ascribe a Deity to many things; Therefore it is necessary that we be very wary, and not only Design to have our Worship terminate in the True, for who Worship <hi>False Gods</hi> intend this: But that it may really do so, we must discern what doth certainly particularize the true GOD, and as it were Single him out from all the false <hi>Gods</hi> of the World.</p>
                     <p>Now it needs not puzle us much or put us to any great difficulty to find out who is the True, amongst the several pretended Deities; a small enquiry will easily deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the point: We shall not have well begun to examine, when it shall appear who is <hi>True,</hi> &amp; who <hi>False.</hi> It is a speech of <hi>Tully,</hi> the <hi>Heathen Orator, utinam tam facile veram re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligionem invenire possim, quam falsam convincere; I wish I could as easily find out the true GOD, as detect who is false:</hi> But the one will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow upon the other. <hi>Solomon</hi> at once discovered the <hi>false Mother, and the true by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a tryal of their Motherly affection and behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our;</hi> So by examining the account of those Gods which are mentioned among Men,

                        <pb n="197" facs="tcp:55045:103"/>Thirdly that the True GOD may be our <hi>GOD,</hi> it is absolutly necessarie that we pay all divine worship to <hi>Him alone,</hi> and not share it among others <hi>besides him:</hi> for seing there is but <hi>One</hi> GOD, therefore to have <hi>more Objects of divine Worship,</hi> is to be guilty of <hi>Idolatrie;</hi> and <hi>Idolatrie</hi> and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the true GOD cannot agree together. It is certain, that GOD will not accept of their worship, who pay the same adoration to others besides him: Therefore the <hi>First command</hi> which He gave to his People of old, was this, <hi>Thou shalt have no other Gods before ME.</hi> Intimating thereby that the very foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of true Religion, and the very first thing to be done in the Acknowledgment of the true <hi>God,</hi> is to resolve <hi>to Worship him only,</hi> according to what our <hi>Saviour</hi> saith, <hi>thou shalt Worship the LORD thy GOD and him only shalt thou serve; Matth</hi> 4: 10. This <hi>Ioshua</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood well, and laid plainly before the <hi>Children of Israel,</hi> in his last solemn speech to them, wherein he endeavoured to reclaime them from Idolatrous practices, that is, the paying <hi>divine respect</hi> to any other besides the True GOD, by shewing the absurdity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and its inconsistencie with the <hi>Worship and service of the true</hi> GOD; for having bidden them choose whom they <hi>would serve,</hi> lest they
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:55045:104"/>
might have thought that they could well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough both serve Him who had done so much for them, and others besides, he round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tells them, <hi>ye cannot serve the Lord, for he is an holy God, he is a Iealous God, He will not forgive your transgressions, nor your sins, if ye foresake the Lord and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you after that he hath done you good.</hi> And when the People expressed their resolution to serve the LORD, that they might give a <hi>true Testimonie</hi> thereof he said to them, <hi>Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore put away the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD GOD of Israel, Ioshua</hi> 24.</p>
                     <p>Some perhaps will say that these <hi>Passages of Scripture,</hi> do only strike against plurality of <hi>gods,</hi> or the <hi>Worshipping of false gods,</hi> with a neglect or contempt of the <hi>True,</hi> or the Substituting any in his Room, but not at all against the <hi>Worshipping of Subordinate Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> while one <hi>Supreme LORD and GOD</hi> the <hi>Creator of all things</hi> is owned and worshipped. But to this it is answered, that certainly all is to be included in the <hi>Prohibition,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogates from the <hi>Glory of the True GOD,</hi> and is inconsistent with the Worship and Service due to Him; and therefore among other things, this <hi>of paying Divine Worship to any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides:</hi>
                        <pb n="199" facs="tcp:55045:104"/>
For who doth this, does not <hi>Glorify GOD as GOD,</hi> nor acknowledge that Infinit distance, which is betwixt him and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Beeings. They are guilty of <hi>Lese<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Majesty</hi> and commit Treason against the <hi>Person</hi> of GOD, who either level Him with others, or exalt others to <hi>a parity with him;</hi> and yet this is done when GOD is not Honoured above others, and that <hi>Creatures</hi> are honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all the <hi>Acts of Worship,</hi> and <hi>Testimonies</hi> of respect proper to the <hi>Creator.</hi> In the <hi>Scripture</hi> a <hi>Covetous man</hi> is called an <hi>Idolater,</hi> not that he sets up his Money as an <hi>Idol,</hi> falls down before it, makes Prayers, and counts it his <hi>Creator,</hi> but because it enhanceth his <hi>Affections,</hi> is the Ground of his <hi>Confidence;</hi> and that he cannot be more earnest to <hi>Please GOD,</hi> then he is to <hi>get Money</hi> and keep it: Now is he not much more an <hi>Idolater,</hi> who designedly, and of set purpose, payes all that homage and Worship to others which he owes only to GOD; is not this to return to the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> for <hi>their Crime</hi> was, that they <hi>did service unto them which by nature are no Gods,</hi> as St: <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 8. And in that he saith, <hi>they did it when they knew not GOD,</hi> it clearly implies that they who know him aright as the <hi>Gospel manifests</hi> him, ought not to do it, otherwise they
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:55045:105"/>
walk contrary to the Gospel, and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour GOD.</p>
                     <p>To guard men against this crime, God hath in Scripture declar'd himself, a <hi>Iealous God;</hi> like a <hi>Iealous Husband,</hi> who cannot suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with patience, the least appearance of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honesty in his wife, or any the least inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to strange embraces. And indeed as a Woman would be guiltie of Adulterie, though she did not quite abandon her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, if she did but prostitute her self to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and entertain him with the affection and kindness due to her own husband: So they are guilty of <hi>Spiritual whorrdom</hi> and <hi>adulterie,</hi> who honour with divine worship any besides the <hi>true God;</hi> though they do not cast him off. As the Husband is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, unless he have his wife's whole heart and intire affection; so neither is God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less those who pretend to worship him, do it without reserving any homage or service for another. And as she comes at last to have her heart wholly enstranged from her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who hath been too familiar with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: So they who allow themselves to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form <hi>Divine Homage</hi> and service to creatures, are at last altogether alienated from the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, when men are drawn, to worship any other then God, they prove wholly forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:55045:105"/>
of him; they let those whom they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended at first only to be <hi>Co-partners</hi> to turn absolut <hi>Proprietors</hi> of their hearts and service. Wherefore who would take the Lord to be their God, must resolve to devote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves intirely to him, and <hi>to have none other beside him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Lastly, who would worship the <hi>true GOD,</hi> and have their service find acceptance with him, as they must not dishonour God by giving him <hi>Co-partners;</hi> so they must not make their adress to him, by the means of Images or such sensible or external objects, but must direct their worship immediatly to God himself, without application to any other thing for the <hi>conveyance of their worship;</hi> for this he hath expresly forbidden, and that worship which he hath forbidden and declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his displeasure with, can never be said to terminate in him, That He hath forbidden it, is evident from <hi>the second Commandement,</hi> where all sort of <hi>similitude</hi> and <hi>resemblances</hi> are discharged: And that there is forbidden, not only <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>similitudes</hi> design'd for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>false Gods,</hi> but even also such as might be intended for the honour of the <hi>true GOD,</hi> appears clearly from <hi>Deut:</hi> 4. 15. where <hi>Moses</hi> saith, <hi>take ye good heed unto your selves (for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day the</hi>
                        <pb n="202" facs="tcp:55045:106"/>
                        <hi>Lord spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire) least ye corrupt your selves and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Male, or Female, the likeness of any beast that is on the Earth, the likeness of any winged foul that flieth in the Air, the likeness of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that creepeth on the Ground, the likeness of any Fish that is in the Waters beneath the earth, and least thou lift thine eyes up to Heaven, and when thou seest the Sun, and the Moon, and the Stars, even all the Host of Heaven, should be driven to worship and serve them.</hi> In this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage not only <hi>particular Resemblances,</hi> but all kinde of <hi>similitude</hi> whatsoever with a design to worship it, is absolutely forbidden: So that there is not the least shadow of pretence, for the thinking <hi>any</hi> lawfull to be made use of. And that God not only prohibits the use and worship of <hi>Images</hi> themselves, and for themselves, that is to say, when the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is made to terminat in the <hi>Image</hi> or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall object it self; but also when the same is used, as a means of honouring and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping God, is clear both from the due consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of what hath been already said, and likewise from the instances of the <hi>Golden Calf</hi> which <hi>Aaron</hi> made, and the <hi>two Calves</hi> in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> which <hi>Ieroboam</hi> set up: For they who worshipped these <hi>Calves</hi> were not so
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:55045:106"/>
gross as to terminate their worship in the <hi>Calves</hi> themselves; but used only the <hi>Calves,</hi> to stir up their remembrance of the <hi>true God,</hi> and their devotion for him as appears by their saying, <hi>these be thy Gods, O Israel which brought thee up out of land of Egypt. Exod.</hi> 32. 4. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12: 28.</p>
                     <p>The reason why God discharg'd the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of him, by <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>external Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblances,</hi> or any kind of <hi>visible objects,</hi> and which makes this still unlawfull, is because it is a very improper and disagreable thing in it self, and that which begets dishonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thoughts of God, and which seldom or never faileth to make men guilty of the grossest <hi>Idolatrie.</hi> What an improper, and unsutable thing is it, to studie to make him visible who by nature cannot be seen; and by materiall and corruptible things, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present him who is Spirituall and Incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible; nothing which we can make or fancie bears any proportion to God, neither hath any resemblance of him; the glory of the best and chiefest creatures, is far below the glory of God; and therefore it would be but a dishonouring of him to <hi>Resemble</hi> him to them, or to set up them as <hi>Images</hi> of him. <hi>To whom,</hi> saith the <hi>Prophet, will ye liken GOD, or what likeness will ye compare</hi>
                        <pb n="204" facs="tcp:55045:107"/>
                        <hi>unto him? Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and metted out the Heaven with his span, and comprehended the dust of the Earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in seales, and the hills in a Ballance. He sitteth upon the circle of the earth and the Inhabitants thereof are before him as grashoppers, he stretcheth out the Heavens as a Curtain, and spreadeth them as a tent to dwell in.</hi> By what figures and similitudes then can he be represented? As St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>we ought not to think that the God-head is like unto Gold or Silver, or Stone, graven by Art and Mans device.</hi> And as there is no truth in these resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances which men make of GOD, so by making them they dishonour GOD, and occasion people to intertain mean and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable thoughts of Him: they who set up visible representations of the Deity are said to have <hi>changed the Glory of the Incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible</hi> GOD; and thereby also the true dread of God, came to be taken away from among men. For by the meannesse and foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Images, men came to despise the Deity which they represented; as some of the wiser and sober Heathens have observed. Farther the use of Images is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the grossest Idolatrie; For who are accustom'd to Worship them, fancie something of Divinity in them, for they
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:55045:107"/>
think good luck attends them, and that it bods ill when they want them; as appears by <hi>Micah's</hi> speech, to those who stole away his Images, <hi>ye have taken away my Gods which I made, and what have</hi> I <hi>more?</hi> But though one should never be so Cautious in the use of Images, and guard never so well against these abuses of them, yet certainly it is not lawfull to have them with a Design to Worship them, seing GOD hath expresly forbidden it, and that he hath declared he will not own that Worship, which is given in and by an Image or any visible form and representation.</p>
                     <p>Now by the two last Particulars, it doth easily appear how corrupt the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> is, and how much guilty of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> for though that <hi>Church</hi> profess the knowledge of the One <hi>true</hi> GOD, yet She both hath <hi>other Gods</hi> besides whom She Worshippeth, and also Worshipped the True GOD for the most part in that way which he hath expresly discharg'd, and which by his word we are assured he will not own. First the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> holdeth other GODS besides the True, for <hi>I</hi> may well call these <hi>People's Gods,</hi> to whom they pay'd Divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and Worship: And so <hi>Angels,</hi> the Blessed <hi>Virgin,</hi> and other departed <hi>Saints,</hi>
                        <pb n="206" facs="tcp:55045:108"/>
                        <hi>Crucifixes, Images,</hi> the <hi>Host,</hi> or consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Bread,</hi> and other Reliques are <hi>Gods</hi> to the <hi>Papists;</hi> for they pay to them Divine worship and Service, even all that is usual to be payed to the true GOD himself, they fall down before them, make Prayers and Vows unto them, Sacrifice and burn Incense, build Temples, and keep Festivals in honour of them, and in a Word, there is scarce any Testimonie of respect payed to <hi>GOD</hi> himself, which is not also given to them; and the service of these is very little, if any thing different from the service of GOD. Certainly some few subtile Distinctions, which of late they have set up will not put any essentiall difference betwixt the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of <hi>GOD,</hi> and the Worship of these other persons and things, so long as they are the same upon the matter. Nay though <hi>I</hi> should say that they served these more then <hi>GOD,</hi> I would not calumniat them, <hi>I</hi> would but speak the truth; For they pray oftner to the Saints, particularlie to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> then they do to GOD; She hath ten <hi>Aves</hi> for a every <hi>Pater Noster;</hi> there be more Temples built to Her and the other Saints, and many more dayes kept to their Memory, then what are consecrat for the Honour of GOD; their Altars and Shrines
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:55045:108"/>
are more frequented, and greater offerings made at them; and by many instances it might be made appear, that greate Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, as Indulgences, &amp;c: are bestowed by the Pope, for their devotion to the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and other Saints, then for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of GOD and of JESUS CHRIST. Thus what <hi>St. Paul</hi> said of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> is applicable to them, even that <hi>they Worship and serve the creature, more then the Creator, who is Blessed for ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These practises are so palpably Idolatrous, so contrary to GODS word, and so incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistant with the honour and worship due to Almighty GOD, that it is a Wonder indeed how men who pretend to Learning and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son should go about to excuse them; They are so gross, that the very Ignorant <hi>Vulgar</hi> could discern them, if they were allowed the use of the Light: But alas poor People! they are therefore Industriously keept in the dark, and the word of <hi>GOD</hi> is hid from them, which would teach them the Haynous abomination of these things, and how highly displeasing they are to <hi>GOD.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How little these Practises of the Papists, in Worshipping of Angels, the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> departed Saints, &amp;c: are to be justified, yea how much to be abominated
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:55045:109"/>
will presenty appear by considering the ground they are built on, and the reason pretended for the defence of them.</p>
                     <p>First, That whereon all <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angel-Worship</hi> is founded, is the <hi>Supposition</hi> that they are <hi>Agents, and Mediatours</hi> betwixt <hi>GOD</hi> and Man, by whose moyen and Meanes, both <hi>Temporal</hi> and <hi>Spiritual good things</hi> are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed: Remove but this <hi>supposition,</hi> and the the whole frame of this Service will fall and prove an idle ridiculous foppery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now as to this, first we say it is the same pretence which the <hi>Heathens</hi> made, for the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of their severall Deities, as doth clearly appear from their Writings; for we must not think, that they believed all whom they Worshipped to be <hi>Gods,</hi> in the strictest sense of the word: No indeed, they believed but <hi>One Supreme LORD, One real GOD, who created and ruled all,</hi> whom therefore they called the <hi>Father of Gods and Men.</hi> But besides him, they held several others, to whom they gave the name of <hi>Gods,</hi> not that they thought them <hi>Uncreated</hi> and not <hi>Subordinat</hi> to the great <hi>GOD;</hi> but because they were superiour to Man by their Nature, and made use of by the Great GOD, in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the world, and the disposal of Humane Affairs. Not having right appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:55045:109"/>
of the <hi>infinite nature of GOD,</hi> they thought that he either could not, or that it was below him, to superintend all things himself; but that he did all things by the intercourse of these <hi>Inferiour Deities,</hi> to each of whom they assign'd <hi>Particular offices;</hi> giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to one the charge of the Earth, to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Sea, to a third Fire; some they appointed to be the Guardians of Cities, and whole Countreys, others of particular Men, and some were set over Beasts, in a word, there was no Art, nor Trade, nor Disease incident to Man or Beast, nor Passion, nor Vertue, nor Vice, which they did not commit to the oversight of some <hi>Deitie</hi> or other, which they failed not to invock, according to their various Conditions and Circumstances. By this it appears, that the Opinion which the <hi>Heathens</hi> had of their <hi>Deities,</hi> was just such which the <hi>Papists</hi> have of <hi>Saints and Angels,</hi> and that the One hath no other ground for the Worshipping of <hi>Saints and Angels,</hi> then what the <hi>other</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the worshipping of <hi>Iupiter, Iuno, Minerva, Mars, Vulcan,</hi> &amp;c. these <hi>Dij mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum gentium,</hi> these Gods of the lower rank &amp; order. Neither can any thing be said in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the one which may not be alledged for the other. And in truth, it would seem
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:55045:110"/>
that the <hi>Romish Church</hi> hath been so much in love, with that <hi>scheme</hi> of <hi>Heathen Religion,</hi> as to think fit to transcribe it wholly: for there be little difference in this point, except some change of Names, that whereas they Worshipped formerly <hi>Iuno, Iupiter,</hi> &amp;c. Now some more Christian names are set up to be adored. And though certainly the holy <hi>Angels,</hi> and some of the <hi>Christian Saints,</hi> are by far preferable to the best of the <hi>Heathnish Deities;</hi> yet it is no more law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to worship the One, then the other: for the doing either, is to <hi>do service to them who by nature are no Gods,</hi> which the <hi>Scripture</hi> condemns, Gal. 4: 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And which they who are thus worshipped would abhore. If there were any communication betwixt us and the <hi>Angels and Saints,</hi> they would certainlie declare against the Worshipping of them, and would shew themselves so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gratified thereby, as to be highly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased therewith. That the <hi>Angels</hi> would forbid it, we have good reason to believe, seeing they have done it when occasion offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for when <hi>St Iohn</hi> was about to worship the <hi>Angel,</hi> who shewed him these things he sets down in his <hi>Revelation,</hi> he withheld him, saying, <hi>see thou do it not, for I am thy fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servant.</hi> And if <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> returned
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:55045:110"/>
to the earth, they would no doubt as earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie restrain men, from paying Divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to them, as they did once <hi>the People of Lystra,</hi> and that too for the same reason, even because <hi>they are Men of the like passions;</hi> for though they be freed from sin, and these frailties we are lyable to here, yet they are men still, they are <hi>Glorified</hi> indeed, but not <hi>Deified,</hi> and therefore not proper Objects of Worship.</p>
                     <p>But to return and to speak more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to this, which is pretended for the <hi>Ground of Saint and Angel worship.</hi> In the next place, we say it is a thing very <hi>uncertain,</hi> what <hi>use God</hi> makes of the <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> what be their <hi>charge,</hi> and <hi>office,</hi> and what <hi>imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> they are put to. We read indeed in the Scriptures, that God hath sometimes imployed <hi>Angels,</hi> in the affairs of his <hi>Servants</hi> here below: But whither he doth this always, whither each <hi>Saint</hi> or <hi>Angel</hi> hath a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar constant <hi>imployment,</hi> or what is the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>imployment</hi> of <hi>each</hi> of them, is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd; men can only guess at them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have they any rule to make their guesses probable, and therefore there is no reason to worship them or to make any adresses to them. For <hi>Religious worship</hi> and <hi>service,</hi> should stand upon better grounds, then meer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:55045:111"/>
yea I may say idle and fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick dreams. What Ground of assurance can be given that <hi>Raphael</hi> is appointed for <hi>traveling, St. Roche</hi> for the <hi>Pox, St. Cornelis</hi> for the <hi>falling sickness, St. Loy</hi> for <hi>Horse diseases, St. Apollina</hi> for the <hi>tooth-ach,</hi> and that the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> can give all that either Soul or body needeth; <hi>I</hi> say what assurance have we of this? And if there be no assurance, (as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there is none<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) what a foolish thing is it to make adresses to these <hi>Saints,</hi> for these favours which (for ought we know,) do not belong to them to give, but to other <hi>Saints,</hi> if to any at all; if men be desirous of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours they seek, me thinks they should make application where they are surest to be had, that is, they should rather go to God then to <hi>Saints</hi> or <hi>Angels;</hi> for we are sure he hath all good to bestow, but what gifts are at their disposal, or whither any, is a thing we know not.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, though all should be true that is alledged, that we receive <hi>good things</hi> from hands of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> and that they could procure us what we desire; yet this were no reall ground for worshipping them: For they are not the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>cause</hi> of these things, which are thus supposed to come from them. <hi>Do not erre, my beloved Brethren,</hi>
                        <pb n="213" facs="tcp:55045:111"/>
saith St. <hi>Iames, every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above,</hi> and least we should mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take him, and think he included <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> he addeth, <hi>and cometh down from the Father of Lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning, Iames</hi> 1. 17. <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> at the best, are but the <hi>means</hi> and <hi>Instruments</hi> of the <hi>conveyance of God's bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,</hi> and therefore it is not reasonable to worship them, as we worship God. If they ought to be honoured with <hi>Divine worship,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God useth their <hi>Ministerie,</hi> in blessing us with <hi>Spiritual and Temporal benefits;</hi> then for the same reason, a <hi>Merchant</hi> or <hi>Sea-man</hi> may adore the <hi>Wind,</hi> when its favourable; and every one may worship his <hi>meat,</hi> for by the use of our <hi>Meat,</hi> GOD gives us the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of Life: and it will not cast the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, as to the being a <hi>Ground</hi> of paying <hi>Divine Worship</hi> to <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> that they are <hi>Intelligent Beeings,</hi> understand what they do, and what good they do us, they do it with good-will; for if this were sufficient then it should be of as great force, for the Worshipping of the <hi>Pastours of the Church,</hi> or any other <hi>Earthly men,</hi> whom GOD raiseth up to be the instruments of our <hi>Temporal</hi> or <hi>Spirituall good.</hi> The <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Instruments</hi> should indeed have a due respect,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:55045:112"/>
but it should be far below what is payed to the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>main cause; Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> indeed ought to be honoured and had in great esteem, because they stand alwayes near <hi>GOD,</hi> and are his <hi>chief Servants:</hi> But there is no Reason to equal then with <hi>GOD,</hi> by giving them the same homage, and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them the same Acts of <hi>Adoration</hi> A great difference should be put between the <hi>Servant</hi> and <hi>his Lord, Ministers of State</hi> and the <hi>Person of the King,</hi> and so betwixt <hi>GOD</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> and <hi>Saints;</hi> Which also shewes the unsuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie of that other <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Pretence,</hi> which some make for the worshipping of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> viz. That hereby they do Honour to GOD, for though GOD would have them Honoured, yet he would not have them Honoured as Himself.</p>
                     <p>2. Some of the <hi>Papists,</hi> are so sensible of the absurdity of Worshipping <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> directlie, that to take away the shame thereof, they study to put another face on these <hi>acts of Adoration,</hi> which they pay to <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> telling us that they intend thereby no more, but to intreat the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> to interceed with GOD for them, which may be as well done as the seeking of <hi>Prayers</hi> of those upon Earth. To which it may be replyed, first, that what is
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:55045:112"/>
alledged is not true. 2. That it will not excuse this worship nor free it from <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, the thing alledg'd in the excuse of <hi>Saint and Angel worship</hi> is not true. For besides the <hi>building of Temples,</hi> the <hi>erecting of Altars, offering up to them Christ in the sacrifice of the Mass,</hi> which without the most violent stretching cannot be interpret a desiring them only to pray for them; I say, besides this, there is nothing more evident, then that their Prayers to <hi>Saints,</hi> is put up in as express terms, as they should be to <hi>GOD Almighty;</hi> and it is impossible for any to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress themselves to GOD, more humbly and devoutly then they doe, Particularlie to <hi>B: Virgin;</hi> or to speak more highly of God, then they do of her; or to attribute more to the One, then to the Other; or to Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the greatest Graces in more plain and direct Terms, as appears from many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances in that office of <hi>B: M:</hi> Authorized by <hi>Pope Paul</hi> 5.

even this much cannot be done, without as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing to them the peculiar <hi>properties</hi> of God, as <hi>Omnipresence, Omniscience</hi> and the <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of mens hearts and secret thoughts</hi> If the <hi>Saints</hi> do not, neither can hear us, its a vain thing to pray to them and <hi>they</hi> cannot be supposed to hear the <hi>prayers</hi> which are put up <hi>every where througout the World,</hi> unless <hi>they</hi> be made <hi>every where present,</hi> or so <hi>Omniscient</hi> as to know whatsoever is done or said upon the earth: Which to say of them, is reallie to make them <hi>Gods,</hi> for the <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> both appropriate these things to GOD only. <hi>Thou even thou onely,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon, knowes the hearts of all the children of Men;</hi> 1 Kings 8. 39: And it is <hi>One</hi> of the <hi>proofs</hi> we give of the <hi>Deitie of CHRIST,</hi> that he saith of himself, <hi>I am he which searchest the reins and hearts;</hi> Rev: 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>. 23.

                        <hi>or Him who was the price of the World,</hi> In that <hi>English Manual</hi> (done at <hi>Edinburgh</hi>) there is a <hi>particular Office</hi> for the worshipping of the <hi>Cross,</hi> and one of the <hi>Antiphony's,</hi> is, <hi>O venerable Cross, which hath brought Salvation to wretches, by what praise shall I extol thee, for that thou hast prepared the Heavenly Life.</hi> Page 332. and the <hi>general Let any</hi> in that <hi>Office;</hi> is that <hi>GOD would deliver them,</hi> not <hi>by CHRISTS Death, or Passion, or Crucifixion,</hi> but by the <hi>Sign of the Cross.</hi> Thus as it is evident, that they worship <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, &amp;c.</hi> so it will not be excused and justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they do it for the sake of what is represented by them; for as we formerly made appear, <hi>God</hi> hath absolutely discharged the use of such things in <hi>His Service</hi> &amp; will not accept of any Worship or Honour tendred him thereby. The <hi>Images</hi> of GOD and CHRIST, should not be worshipped for themselves, for they are but <hi>the work of Mens hands;</hi> nor yet for their sake whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present, seing they have forbidden it: and the <hi>Images of Saints</hi> should far less be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped, seing it is not Lawfull to <hi>Worship the Saints themselves,</hi> as we have made out; and therefore the Homage which the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> pay to <hi>Images, Crucifixes, &amp;c.</hi> cannot be acquitted of <hi>Idolatry:</hi> How much the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> are accused of <hi>Idolatry</hi> in the <hi>Scripture</hi>
                        <pb n="224" facs="tcp:55045:117"/>
for the <hi>usage</hi> and <hi>worshipping of Images,</hi> is known to all who read these <hi>holy Books?</hi> And if there was Reason to fix this Guilt upon the <hi>Heathens,</hi> there is no less Reason to leave it at the <hi>Papists door;</hi> seeing their use of <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> now is little or nothing different from the Customs and Practices of the <hi>ancient Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> as might be easily made appear, could we allow our selves to pursue every thing at full length. But as we said of the <hi>Saints and Angel-worship,</hi> that it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a <hi>transcript of the Heathen Demon Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;</hi> so who are pleased to compare them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, shall find the <hi>Religious use</hi> and <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> among the <hi>Papists,</hi> to be a perfect imitation of the <hi>Heathen Idol-Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:</hi> for as to their Matter whereof they are made, it is the same, to wit, <hi>Stone, Wood, Brass, Gold, Silver, &amp;c.</hi> as to their qualitie they are not different, both the one and the other being <hi>dumb and senseless, having mouths which speak not, eyes which see not, and hands and feet, which can neither handle nor walk.</hi> Nay in many places the <hi>Images</hi> honoured by the <hi>Papists,</hi> are the very same which the <hi>Heathens</hi> used, only the name is changed, thus it is said, that in the <hi>Vatican Church</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Image of Jupiter Capitolinus,</hi> stands this day for St. <hi>Peter;</hi> onely they have taken
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:55045:117"/>
away the <hi>Thunder-bolt,</hi> and instead thereof have put the <hi>Keyes in his hand:</hi> but it may be easily discerned to be <hi>Iupiter,</hi> because of his <hi>long thick and curl'd hair,</hi> whereas all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Images of St. Peter</hi> are made <hi>bald.</hi> And at <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> in the <hi>Metrapolitan Church of St. Andrews,</hi> an <hi>Antick of Iupiter going up to Heaven upon an Eagle,</hi> served sometimes to represent <hi>Iesus Christ ascending up to the Heavens;</hi> And who doubts, but the same thing may have happened in diverse places? However the <hi>Papists</hi> agree with the <hi>Heathens,</hi> as to the Ceremonies and <hi>externall Acts of Adoration</hi> payed to <hi>Images;</hi> they cloathed, and decked and perfumed them; they kiss'd them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated themselves before them, burnt <hi>Incense</hi> and lighted Candles to them, and carried them in <hi>Pompous processions,</hi> all which the <hi>Papists</hi> do: * yea some not only<note place="margin">See Iur: prej. cont. papisme.</note> 
                        <hi>Protestant-writers,</hi> but of their own, undertake to prove, <hi>that the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition of the Heathens, never carried them so far towards the honouring of Images as the Papists have gone:</hi> And certainly, nothing can be brought in defence of the <hi>Papists,</hi> which may not as well be alledged for the <hi>Heathens:</hi> Nay except some few <hi>logical distinctions,</hi> which prove very frivolous, all the <hi>specious pretexts</hi> which the <hi>Papists</hi> make, for justifying their
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:55045:118"/>
Practice, are to be found in the <hi>Apologies</hi> of the <hi>Heathens.</hi> Do the <hi>Papists</hi> say, <hi>that their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship terminats not in the Image it self, but is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by it to what is thereby represented?</hi> the <hi>Heathens</hi> said the same. Do the <hi>Papists</hi> say, <hi>that they use Images only, to remember them of the Invisible objects of their Worship?</hi> So did the <hi>Heathen</hi> as appears from <hi>Maximus Tyrius,</hi> and some others. Are the <hi>Heathens</hi> taxed with a gross conceit, <hi>that the Gods inhabited their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and that some divinity resided in them?</hi> The <hi>Papists</hi> entertain the same fancy of theirs, at least a great part of the <hi>Vulgar</hi> do, else what means the high esteem of <hi>one Image</hi> of the same Person above another? Why are <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Pilgrimages</hi> undertaken, to visit the <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Virgin,</hi> or some other <hi>Saint</hi> in such and such places, when the <hi>Images</hi> of the same <hi>Saints</hi> are every where? How comes it that <hi>miracles,</hi> the gifts of healing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Are ascrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Images,</hi> if they do not think that there be something of <hi>Divinity</hi> in them? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Papists opinions and practices anent Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, are one and the same with the Heathens,</hi> for which they are accounted <hi>Idolaters</hi> in <hi>Scripture:</hi> and consequently all <hi>subtilties</hi> of the <hi>Roman Doctors,</hi> will not free their <hi>Church,</hi> from this horrid and <hi>provoking crime.</hi> And as both rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and <hi>Scripture</hi> declare against them, so
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:55045:118"/>
they cannot plead here the practice of the <hi>Ancient Church;</hi> for nothing is more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, then that the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> abstained from the very appearance of this <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Superstition,</hi> so far were they from practis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, witness that known Fact of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Salamine in Cyprus,</hi> in tearing a Linnen cloath whereon the <hi>Image of Christ</hi> was painted, which he found in the <hi>Church,</hi> lest it should be an occasion of <hi>Idolatry</hi> to the People, this was about the end of the <hi>fourth Century;</hi> And about the <hi>sixth, Serenus Bishop of Massile</hi> brake to pieces all the <hi>Images of CHRIST and Saints,</hi> which were in the City, fearing the People who were then Declining from the <hi>Purity of the Christian Religion,</hi> should be drawn to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship them. And that the worship of them, was not at that time <hi>Publickly allowed,</hi> nor brought into the Church, appears clearly from <hi>Gregory the first</hi> his Letter to the said <hi>Bishop,</hi> wherein he hath these words, that <hi>thou didst forbid Images to be Worshipped, we praise altogether, but that thou brakest them we blame;</hi> who would be fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

see, the great Disagrement betwixt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> for hundreds of years, so little Reason have they to plead <hi>Antiquity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But though all should be admitted which the <hi>Papists</hi> say, for their Vindication in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping <hi>Angels, Saints and Images;</hi> yet this would not free them altogether from <hi>Idolatry</hi> so long as they <hi>Worship the Host,</hi> or <hi>Consecrated Bread:</hi> For though there were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reason to tax them with this Crime, yet this were sufficient, which we come now in the last place to speak to; And the rather, because they go not about to excuse this, nor do they collour it with <hi>subtile Glosses,</hi> as in former Instances: they do not cry out, that they are wrong'd and calumniat, when they are said to <hi>worship the Host,</hi> for they publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allow it, and the <hi>Council of Trent</hi> hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced an <hi>Anathema</hi> upon all who do not think the same Worship due to GOD, ought to be payed to this <hi>Sacramental Bread.</hi> That whereon the <hi>worship of the Host</hi> is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, is the <hi>Doctrine of Transubstantiation,</hi> or a <hi>total Conversion of the Bread into the Body and Blood of the Lord IESUS CHRIST;</hi> and therefore if this Doctrine be taken away, or shew'd unsufficient it will clearly appear, that they are guilty of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as some of
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:55045:119"/>
themselves plainly acknowledge.</p>
                     <p>Now as to the <hi>Doctrine of Transubstantiation,</hi> it cannot be expected that we should here treat of it fully and particularly, for this would carrie us too far from the design of this Present Treatise, and make it swell too bigg. All we shall say at present, is that there is no Evidence for it, no Ground to believe it, and consequently no Reason for establishing this Worship, which they make to follow upon it. If we examine the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ways, by which we come to know and to be assured of any thing; it will easily appear that there is no Evidence for <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,</hi> no Ground to believe that the <hi>Host</hi> is the <hi>real Body and Blood of</hi> JESUS CHRIST. All things are Manifest to us, either by <hi>Sense,</hi> or <hi>Reason,</hi> or <hi>Revelation,</hi> and what appears by none of these, is a groundless conceit, a <hi>Fantastick Opinion,</hi> which ought not be made the <hi>Foundation of any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious observance,</hi> and such will the <hi>Doctrine of Transubstantiation</hi> be found to be: For first if we examine our Senses, and believe their Testimonie: there is no <hi>Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but the <hi>Bread</hi> continues <hi>Bread</hi> after <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration;</hi> the <hi>Figure, Shape, Cllour, smell</hi> and <hi>Taste,</hi> are the same were before; and if it be keept any while it moulds and corrupts as
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:55045:120"/>
Bread, so that to the appearance of Sense there is nothing but Bread. And if we have recourse to Reason, it will not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, but confirm the <hi>Testimony of our Sense:</hi> And farther shew what an absurdity it is to think otherwayes: because it would, quite destroy the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Properties of Bodies,</hi> if the <hi>Body and Blood of IESUS CHRIST</hi> were in the <hi>Host;</hi> For then it would follow that one body might be in <hi>Diverse places at once,</hi> that Matter might be without Extension, that the Accidents, Effects and Properties of a Body may remain when the Body it self is destroyed, and such like absurdities; Thus <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is founded, neither upon Sense nor Reason but is contrare to both. And therefore if there be any such thing, it must appear by <hi>Revelation,</hi> but it will appear as little this way, as any other: for there is no <hi>Revelation</hi> to be trusted, but what is set down in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and they are altogether silent. What ever was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of this Doctrine, sure the <hi>Scripture</hi> was not, for it is not plainly asserted, nor is it to be deduced from clear or <hi>Positive Truths.</hi> Nay the <hi>Scripture</hi> gives so little ground to fancie this, that on the contrarie, it speak so of this <hi>Sacrament</hi> as may assure us there is no such thing as the <hi>Papists</hi> dream:
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:55045:120"/>
for it calls it <hi>Bread,</hi> both before and after its <hi>Consecration,</hi> and the usuall <hi>Phrase</hi> for the <hi>celebration</hi> of this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> is in <hi>Scripture, the breaking of Bread,</hi> which would have been a very mean expression if the Bread were turned to the <hi>Body of IESUS CHRIST.</hi> The pretext for <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> from <hi>Scripture,</hi> are these words, <hi>this is my Body,</hi> which in Truth when considered are no Pretext at all; because none but such as are Prepossest with the Fancy, could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that to be the Meaning of them: such a Mystery and Miracle as <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is, had need to have been asserted more plainly and clearly, that is to say in <hi>Terms</hi> which do more necessarly import it. The <hi>Disciples</hi> who used frequently to trouble our LORD, about the meaning of His Words, and to raise Scruples when he spoke of things far more Credible, it is not likely that they would have let this go, if they had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood him as the <hi>Papists</hi> do; if they had so taken him up, as to think that he said, what He Reached, and what they Receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Eat, was not real Bread, but that <hi>same real Body</hi> which was before their eyes, they would no doubt enquired farther into the matter, and asked how such a thing could be? But having a little before, in the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration</hi>
                        <pb n="232" facs="tcp:55045:121"/>
                        <hi>of the Passover,</hi> heard our LORD say of the <hi>unleavened Bread,</hi> according to the <hi>Iewish custom, this is the Bread of Affliction which our Fathers eat in Egypt,</hi> they could not understand the Bread now distribut, to be his <hi>Body</hi> otherways, then the <hi>unleavened Bread</hi> was the <hi>Bread which their Fathers eat in Egypt,</hi> to wit, not the same reallie, but only the <hi>Symbol</hi> or <hi>Memorial</hi> thereof.</p>
                     <p>Thus it appears that the <hi>Doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,</hi> is a meer groundless Conceit, favoured neither by Sense, nor by Reason, nor <hi>Scripture,</hi> but flatly opposed by all of them: And so though the <hi>Bread</hi> in the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi> be Consecrat to an <hi>Holy use,</hi> and though it serve for <hi>Holy ends</hi> and <hi>Purposes,</hi> yet as to its Nature and Substance it is still <hi>Bread,</hi> and therefore who worship it, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship not GOD, but a <hi>Creature,</hi> and a <hi>dumb Senseless Creature</hi> of it self too, which is as gross <hi>Idolatry</hi> as any can be. Neither will it excuse them, that they think it to be him who is their GOD: for then all <hi>Idolatry</hi> should be excusable, he who Worships the <hi>Sun</hi> should be excused if he fancied a <hi>Deitie</hi> therein; Mens Opinions will not alter the Nature of things, nor make that Justifiable which is of it self Damnable, otherways the greatest Crimes may prove no Crimes. Nor
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:55045:121"/>
will it acquit the <hi>Papists</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping the <hi>Host,</hi> that they intend therein to worship JESUS CHRIST, seing their Worship is directed immediatly to another thing; otherwayes the <hi>Israelites,</hi> who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped the <hi>Golden calf,</hi> might upon the same account be freed of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> And yet the <hi>Papists</hi> in worshipping the <hi>Sacramental Bread,</hi> are more gross then the <hi>Israelites</hi> in worshipping the <hi>Golden calf:</hi> For they made not the <hi>Calf</hi> their GOD, neither did they terminat their worship in the <hi>Calf it self,</hi> but used it only as the means of conveying their Worship to the <hi>true GOD.</hi> Whereas the <hi>Papists</hi> believe the <hi>Bread</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> to be the very <hi>LORD IESUS CHRIST himself,</hi> and do terminat their Worship in the very <hi>Sacrament it self.</hi> Then which I hardly think there can be a grosser instance of <hi>Idolatry</hi> produced from among the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> whither <hi>Ancient</hi> or <hi>Modern:</hi> 
                        <q>If saith <hi>Coster,</hi> a <hi>Popish-Writter, the</hi>
                           <note place="margin">See <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:</hi> Idolat?</note> 
                           <hi>Doctrine of Transubstantiation be not true, the Idolatry of the</hi> Heathens <hi>in Worshipping some Golden or Silver statue, or any Image of their Gods, or the</hi> Laplanders <hi>Worshipping a red cloath, or the Egyptians an Animal,</hi> is more excusable then <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Christians Worshiping</hi> a bit of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:55045:122"/>
bread.</q> And another of them saith, <hi>that if there be nothing but bread in the Eucharist, they are all Idolaters.</hi> Thus they confess, that it is the <hi>Supposition</hi> of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> only, which can vindicat them from the <hi>grossest Idolatry:</hi> but that there is no such thing to be supposed, we have already proved, and they who will needs believe a thing not only without all ground, but contrarie to all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of Sense, Reason and <hi>Scripture,</hi> their Errour is wilfull, and neither is it to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused, nor the Practises which they build thereupon to be Extenuated. And it will be to little purpose here, to have recourse to the Fathers for the Defence of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; for first, we are not obliedged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any of them contrary to Sense, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and <hi>Scripture.</hi> And secondly, it hath been frequently shewed that they say no such thing, for untill about the <hi>Eight</hi> or <hi>Ninth Century</hi> this Opinion did not creep into the <hi>Church,</hi> it only entered in with the <hi>Worship of Images,</hi> for which among several others, see a <hi>late discourse of Transubstantiation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But though there were ground for the <hi>Doctrine of Transubstantiation,</hi> and that CHRIST should be really in the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> as the <hi>Papists</hi> imagine; yet according to their <hi>Principles,</hi> it is scarce possible, yea I may say altogether impossible, to know
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:55045:122"/>
certainly, or to have any assurance, when the <hi>Bread</hi> is truly <hi>Transubstantiated,</hi> or that <hi>CHRIST</hi> is <hi>Really</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who Adore it run alwayes the Hazard of committing the <hi>grossest Idolatry,</hi> which is the most <hi>Heinous of Crimes.</hi> According to the Principles of the <hi>Romish Church,</hi> there can be no <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> if the <hi>Elements</hi> be not prepared of due matter, viz. The Bread of true Wheat, and the Wine of ripe Grapes, and neither of them any wayes spoiled or corrupted; if the <hi>Priest</hi> who Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brats, be not a true <hi>Priest,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Rightly ordained,</hi> and according to them, a great many things are requisite to make ones Ordination valid, and it is not possible to know when they are wanting or when they are present, but thought he should be a <hi>True Priest,</hi> yet if he intend not seriously the <hi>Consecration of the Sacrament,</hi> or doth not pronounce the words, or doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them right, but doth either mangle or transpose them, in all these cases, there is no <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> neither is there any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt the <hi>Elements of Bread and Wine</hi> which seems to be consecrat, and <hi>common Bread and Wine.</hi> And therefore it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to know, when the <hi>Bread is Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated,</hi> or when not, when CHRIST <hi>is really</hi>
                        <pb n="236" facs="tcp:55045:123"/>
                        <hi>present,</hi> and when he is absent; for it is one to an hundred, but some one or other of these necessarie conditions of a right Consecration is wanting; and therefore also who adore the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> can never be certain that they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore JESUS CHRIST really, but instead of him, may be paying Divine worship to a <hi>meer creature,</hi> to lifeless Bread and Wine, which may perplex the minds and conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of such as seriously consider the hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nousness of the crime of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> To evade this Difficultie, they tell us that <hi>the Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sacrament</hi> is always with the suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Christ's presence,</hi> that they adore the Bread upon this condition, that it is <hi>the Body of IESUS CHRIST:</hi> But this is a sillie evasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and will never free their <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;</hi> for it is only <hi>Doctours</hi> or the Learned who may use these subtilties; as for the <hi>Vulgar</hi> they do not make any such supposition, nor do they worship the <hi>Sacrament</hi> with any such <hi>salvo.</hi> And besides, both the One and the Other pay the same <hi>Adoration</hi> when it is no <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as when it is: for without any scruple, they worship alwayes and every where the <hi>Bread</hi> which is pretended to be <hi>Consecration,</hi> when it is certain some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, nay oftimes, it is not <hi>Transubstantiated into the Body and Blood of</hi> JESUS CHRIST, because of the want of those necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:55045:123"/>
which infer that change. And when it is but <hi>simple Bread,</hi> will it take off the guilt of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> to say, <hi>I worship thee if thou art</hi> CHRIST? Which is, as if a <hi>Woman</hi> should pretend to excuse her <hi>Adultery,</hi> by saying when she admitted a stranger, I <hi>do this if thou art mine Husband.</hi> A <hi>woman</hi> is not honest and faithfull, if she embrace another upon light pretences and appearances; she should be alwayes certain, that he is her <hi>real Husband</hi> to whom she payes the duty of a wife: in like manner, none are faithfull to God, who throw away the worship due to him only, upon uncertain objects. <hi>He is a jealous GOD,</hi> as jealous of his glory as any earthly <hi>Husband</hi> is of his honour, and therefore will never be pleased with us, if we worship <hi>rashly,</hi> when we are not sure that it is him we worship. Thus though it were granted, that the <hi>Bread and Wine</hi> should be turned into the <hi>Body and Bloud of Iesus Christ,</hi> yet seing it is so uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain when it is <hi>de facto</hi> thus turned, it is much safer not to worship then to worship: because there is no crime in not worshipping, but by worshipping we may run the hazard of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</hi> No <hi>King</hi> would find fault with one that were blind or half blind, for not falling down and paying homage to him, when he were Ignorant of his presence. But if such a

what they have such a high Opinion of; to believe it to be no less then the <hi>GOD</hi> whom they should adore, and yet at the same time to treat it thus seems most disagreeable and inconsistant: For this is both to elevat and to depress it, to raise it as high as is possible; and at the same time to debase it as much as can be. Adoration is the highest honour which can be payed, but it speaks out the greatest contempt of a thing, to eat and devour it. Wherefore I think it would be very agreeable to the tenets of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Church,</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> should interpose his <hi>Authority</hi> to discharge people to treat the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ</hi> as they do <hi>common food,</hi> which is to put upon him the greatest indignity. 'Tis true, <hi>Christ</hi> hath said, <hi>take eat this,</hi> but that needs be no hinderance to the <hi>Pope to enjoya</hi> the contrary, who pretends to have power to alter and dispence with <hi>Divine Commands: Christ</hi> said of the <hi>Cup</hi> too, <hi>drink ye all of it,</hi> and yet this hath not hindred the <hi>Pope</hi> to take it away from the People; and there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be alledg'd greater inconveniences in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Cup,</hi> then in giving the <hi>Bread</hi> to be eaten and chew'd. If the People saw the <hi>Host</hi> only in the <hi>Priests</hi> hands, when it is ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat; their respect and esteem thereto might be the more easily keept up: but nothing
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:55045:127"/>
may occasion more the <hi>vilifying</hi> thereof, then the allowing them <hi>Liberty</hi> to use it as they do the most <hi>Despicable</hi> food. It is said, <hi>that GOD commanded the Israelites, to eat what was usuallie adored in Egypt,</hi> that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> thereby might be undeceived in their <hi>Opinion of the Deity of these things:</hi> And if it may convince one, that a thing is no God, when he sees it eaten by another: how much more may he be reasoned out of that Belief, when he is accustomed to eat it himself; For as the <hi>Heathen Oratour</hi> speaks, <hi>is any man so mad as to believe that which he eats to be God.</hi> The <hi>Church of Rome</hi> therefore should either let go the <hi>Doctrine of Transubstantiation,</hi> or they should abolish the Custome of Feeding upon what, they say and profess to believe, to be changed into the <hi>Body of their LORD:</hi> for <hi>these two</hi> seems not to agree well together. There can be nothing more brutish <hi>then to adore what they eat, and to eat what they adore,</hi> whereby they make themselves and their Religion lyable to the <hi>greatest contempt</hi> and Derision. A proof of which we have in that known speech of <hi>Averoes</hi> the <hi>Arabian Philosopher, I have travelled,</hi> says he, <hi>over the World, and have found diverse Sects, but so sottish a Sect, or Law, I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>never found, as is the Sect of the Christians; Because with their own Teeth</hi>

                     <p>By <hi>these Instances</hi> which we have adduced, the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> doth clearly appear; it is evident that <hi>that Church</hi> both teacheth to adore as GOD what is not GOD, and also alloweth to have <hi>Compart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> in the Worship of the True <hi>GOD:</hi> Which we have the longer insisted on, both because it was pertinent to our subject, and also seasonable to the times, when <hi>Rome</hi> is likelie to be so active by its <hi>Emissaries,</hi> to re-e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish its <hi>Authority</hi> among us, and that so many <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>plausible</hi> things are pretended for the inclining Men to embrace its <hi>principles</hi> and <hi>practices:</hi> but whatever <hi>specious pretncees</hi> be used, we may see by what hath been said, that there is all reason to avoid the <hi>communion of that Church,</hi> whose <hi>communion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be keept, without drawing on our selves the guilt of Idolatry, and the having accession thereto in others.</hi>

                     <p>Now that we may draw to a <hi>Conclusion</hi> of this <hi>Section;</hi> seing the Knowledge and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the True GOD is so necessary, and that all Worship is in vain which is not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly directed to Him, what matter of <hi>Thankfulness</hi> have we that our Lot hath been in <hi>these Times,</hi> and in these places where we may so easily come to the <hi>Knowledge of the</hi>
                        <pb n="244" facs="tcp:55045:128"/>
                        <hi>true GOD,</hi> and what way to <hi>find acceptance in his sight.</hi> If we had been born in former Times, or in many other Places of the World, we might have remained for ever without the <hi>true knowledge of GOD,</hi> and so without all <hi>Hopes of true Felicity.</hi> It was once matter of Praise to a Poor-man, when he passed by a <hi>Toad,</hi> or some other <hi>Venemous Creature,</hi> that GOD had made him a Man, and not so <hi>Vile a Beast:</hi> But truly it should stir up greater Thankfulness in us, that GOD hath not left us to wander after the Foolish and Ignorant Devices of our own Hearts, nor to be involved into the <hi>Idolatrous Abominations</hi> of such as know not GOD, which should have Deformed and Debased our Natures, and rendred us more ugly and loathsome in the sight of GOD, then such <hi>Vile creatures</hi> are in our sight. Blessed be GOD, who hath sent us the <hi>Light of the Gospel,</hi> which hath dispelled the Darkness of <hi>Heathenish superstition and Idolatry,</hi> and drawn us from the <hi>Service of those who by Nature are no gods,</hi> which could have been no wayes Profitable to us, but many wayes Hurtfull. This is a Blessing for which we can never be enough Thankfull, and if we have a right Sense thereof we will value it above all Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings. Many <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> indeed
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:55045:128"/>
enjoy a <hi>Pleasanter</hi> soil, their Countrey per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps affoords them rich Mines of Gold and Silver, and aboundance of Wines and Spices, which we want: But yet we have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to envy them upon that account, or to think them happier then we, seing we have that which brings us better then a <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Happiness,</hi> even <hi>Eternal Life: for this is Life Eternal, that they might know thee, the only true GOD, and Iesus Christ whom thou hast sent; Iohn</hi> 17: 3.</p>
                     <p>Now if we look upon this Knowledge of the true GOD as any Happiness, let us Praise and Highly esteem it and testifie the same, first, by taking a care to get and to keep this Knowledge: for they slight and despise a thing who are careless of it, and readie to prefer any other thing to it. It might have been expected, that there should have been no need, of <hi>exhorting People to seek after the knowledge of GOD;</hi> but that ere this time, every one both <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>Young, Great</hi> and <hi>Small</hi> would have abundantly known Him, seing we have so many good Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of acquiring this Knowledge; But alas! the contrary is very much to be seen, our knowledge of God is not answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the means of instruction, we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, some can give so little account
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:55045:129"/>
of what is known of God either by Nature or Revelation, that one might imagine they had been alwayes tedder'd in the <hi>deserts of Arabia,</hi> and not bred up in the <hi>green Pastures of Brittain.</hi> There is generally gross igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God, and little desire to know him; every thing even the most trifling shufles aside, and diverts from the <hi>knowledge of GOD,</hi> and all things are hotly pursued ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this, which (though People will not <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow it, yet</hi>) do speak out a contempt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing thereof. The <hi>Prophet</hi> tells us, <hi>that God had a controversie with Israel, because there was not knowledge of God in the Land; Hos:</hi> 4: 1. and surely we have reason to think, that his controversie with us will be no lesse, seeing besides our lake of this knowledge, we do but despise it, in that we neither much desire it nor endeavour after it. God hath given <hi>clear manifestations of himself,</hi> but some will not believe them, and others are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less to be acquainted with them, <hi>loving dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness rather then light,</hi> which in Truth is to love their Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

is not full or sufficient, neither so very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain now, by Reason of <hi>that darknesse</hi> which Sin hath raised, which is too thick to be dispelled by <hi>Natural Light:</hi> yea, Sin hath so mingled it self with our very <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Constitution,</hi> that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish betwixt the <hi>Dictates of right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Conscience, and the erroneous sentiments of that Sinfull contagion.</hi> And farther, seing wee have not kept our <hi>First state,</hi> but are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Sinners,</hi> some other Homage and Worship is requisite then if it had not been so: For it is not Reasonable, to think <hi>that such as have offended GOD should do no more,</hi> then if they had still retained their upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; another acknowledgement is due from <hi>Traitors and Rebels,</hi> then from these who have been always <hi>Loyal,</hi> els it will not be accepted. But what Homage Sinners should pay, or how they should Address themselves to GOD, cannot be known, unlesse he declare it: <hi>Natural Reason</hi> doth not teach this, for though it were cleared of its present incumbrances, it is only adapted to the State in which we were Created, that is a State of <hi>Innocency,</hi> and doth not serve to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect our behaviour if we fall from that state. Thus it is evident that some <hi>new Revelation</hi> is necessary to be superadded to <hi>natural Light</hi>
                        <pb n="253" facs="tcp:55045:132"/>
both to confirm it and to supply its defects.</p>
                     <p>And what was thus necessary, GOD hath not withholden from Men; but as he made <hi>Particular Manifestations</hi> of himself to distinguish himself from the <hi>False Deities</hi> which Men had devised, as was shewed above: So he hath given <hi>expresse Revelation</hi> of his Mind, concerning the way how he will be Worshipped; that Men may not be to seeke herein, nor yet make an offer of what is <hi>Abominable in his Sight.</hi> The Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of GOD is not now left to Mens <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain conjectures,</hi> and unless they be Perverse and Obstinate, they need not perplex their Minds long with such enquiries, <hi>wherewith shall I come before the LORD, and bow my self before the high GOD? Shall I come before him with burnt offering, with Calves of a year old;</hi> if we be truely Serious we may soon come to a resolution, for as <hi>Micah</hi> saith. <hi>He hath shewed thee, O man what is good, and what the Lord do inquire of thee.</hi> He hath giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en a sure, plain, and fixed rule, which to use the words of <hi>Moses, is not hidden from thee neither is it far of, it is not in Heaven that thou shouldest say, who shal go up for us to learn and bring it unto us, that we may hear it and doe it. Neither is it beyond the Sea, that thou shouldest say who shall go over the Sea for us, and bring it</hi>

by him. Wherefore who would be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the <hi>true Worship of GOD,</hi> ought to consult these <hi>Holy books,</hi> especially the <hi>N.

                     <p>Some will be ready to ask here wither <hi>any service</hi> will be acceptable, besides what is enjoyned in the <hi>Scripture;</hi> which I shall stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to answer plainly and in few words. First it is certain that it is not lawfull to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change the <hi>divine appointments</hi> with our <hi>own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices;</hi> for nothing which we can doe will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse the neglect of <hi>Commanded duties,</hi> nor will be received in compensation of them: we then truly adore GOD and own him, when we heartily and readily comply with his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will and pleasure and as this will please him better then an <hi>Ox,</hi> or <hi>Bullock,</hi> that hath horns and hoofs, yea better then thousands of oblations and burnt offerings, so though we would doe never so much or so many things it would not please him if that were left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:55045:134"/>
as <hi>Samuel</hi> said to <hi>Saul, hath the Lord as great pleasure in Sacrifices and burnt offerings as in obeying the voice of the Lord; behold to obey is better then Sacrifice, and to hearken then the fat of Lambs;</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 22.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if we make the <hi>acts of Religion</hi> and <hi>Devotion</hi> which are of our own Devising of equall weight, and value with what is Commanded, they are <hi>Abominable Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> if these two be garded against, it cannot be said to be unlawfull or displeasing to GOD, to do things not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely or particularly enjoined, especially if the end and Reason of doing them, be mainly to help forward that <hi>Service</hi> which is enjoined. This matter will be farther clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the following Example, if <hi>some Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and Conceited Person</hi> should either coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teract or <hi>slight</hi> the <hi>established Statutes of the King,</hi> and resolve to expresse <hi>His Loyalty</hi> by new ways of his own, it is evident that he would not find acceptance with the <hi>King,</hi> though his aime be good: But on the other hand, if one duely observe the <hi>King's laws</hi> and pay the <hi>Homage</hi> required, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over out of the greatness of his Affection will doe more or something else, then what by the <hi>Lawes</hi> he is tyed to, the King will not be displeased with him, yea cannot but highly
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:55045:134"/>
favour him. The very same may be said to the <hi>present question,</hi> only there is this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that all <hi>humane laws</hi> are imperfect, so that a Man may out-doe them, his <hi>Actions</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten may be better then the <hi>Law,</hi> by which he may pretend to merit at the <hi>King's</hi> hand: but <hi>the Law of God</hi> is most perfect and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to all <hi>things</hi> good and <hi>commendable</hi> either in themselves or in Order to other things; and none have Reason to plead Merit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore GOD upon the account of any thing they doe, For their Actions which are commanded fall short of the Perfection re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and if they do any thing not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly or particularly required, if it be Good or Usefull any wise, it comes under some general Command, if it be not Good and Usefull, it is but a vain and unreasonable service, which GOD doth not value or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard.</p>
                     <p>Thus having shewed, that GOD hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd <hi>the Worship he would have in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi> and that they do not worship in <hi>an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable manner,</hi> who do it not as they are there directed: It comes next to be considered, <hi>what that Worship is which is there required, &amp; by which we testify that we own the true GOD to be our God.</hi> Now in discoursing hereof, we shall begin with that which indeed must
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:55045:135"/>
have the first place in our Addresses to God, <hi>viz. Faith in Iesus Christ,</hi> both as he is a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,</hi> and a <hi>Propitiation for sin.</hi> Without this the <hi>Scripture</hi> tells us, <hi>it is impossible to please God; Heb:</hi> 11. 6. And the reason thereof is clear, for seing we have offended God, and thereby made him our enemy, it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that <hi>our peace</hi> be first made, before either <hi>our Persons</hi> or <hi>Actions</hi> can find Favour in his Eyes: and there can be no <hi>peace</hi> without the <hi>Mediation</hi> and <hi>Intercession</hi> of <hi>some third Person.</hi> When <hi>Parties</hi> treat together immediately by <hi>themselves,</hi> it speaks out an equality; and so t'would savour of great Arrogancy in us to presume to draw near of our selves, the <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite distance</hi> betwixt God and us, makes it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary that there be some <hi>Dayes-Man;</hi> and not to acknowledge the necessity of <hi>such an one</hi> is to do <hi>a dishonour to the Divine Majesty.</hi> Nw <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> is a <hi>Mediatour,</hi> and there is <hi>none other,</hi> by him we have <hi>accesse to God,</hi> but without him there is none; <hi>I am,</hi> saith he, <hi>the way, the truth and the life, no man cometh to the Father but by Me; Iohn</hi> 14. 6. <hi>There is not Salvation,</hi> saith St. <hi>Peter, in any other, for there is none other Name under Heaven given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men whereby we must be saved. Acts</hi> 4. 12 When ever therefore we present our selves before God, it ought to be <hi>in the Name of Christ,</hi>
                        <pb n="259" facs="tcp:55045:135"/>
and all <hi>our services</hi> ought to be tendred <hi>in and by him;</hi> according to that of St. <hi>Paul, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ye do in word or deed, do all in the Name of the Lord Iesus, giving Thanks to God and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Him. Col:</hi> 3. 17. for what is not done thus by <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Christ,</hi> is rejected as the <hi>addresses</hi> of an <hi>irreconciled enemy</hi> which nauseat and stir up wrath: all the Sacrifices and services of <hi>Unbelievers</hi> are an abomination to God.</p>
                     <p>Therefore also, besides <hi>Faith in Christ</hi> as <hi>Mediatour,</hi> we must draw near to God, by <hi>Faith in him as the Sacrifice and great Propitiation for sin:</hi> for as the <hi>Majesty</hi> of God requireth <hi>that,</hi> so the <hi>justice</hi> of God exacteth <hi>this;</hi> it being most just and Reasonable that they who do a wrong, should both acknowledge it, and make satisfaction for it, otherwise the <hi>Injur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Person</hi> hath no reason to remit the wrong, or to take the <hi>Partie offending</hi> into favour. <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> hath made <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for us, by submitting Himself to the <hi>death of the Cross,</hi> because we could never have done it our selves but it remains necessary, that we <hi>by Faith</hi> give our assent to what <hi>Christ</hi> hath done <hi>in our name,</hi> and that <hi>by Faith</hi> we offer up unto God, <hi>this death of Christ,</hi> as that which is just and due to be payed unto him, for our offences and sins; for without this, what <hi>Christ</hi> hath
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:55045:136"/>
done cannot be <hi>imputed</hi> to us, nor receiv'd as a <hi>satisfaction for us.</hi> For as in the <hi>case of an affront,</hi> when a <hi>third Person,</hi> understanding well all the <hi>points of Honour,</hi> is desirous to Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the <hi>Affronted</hi> and Affronter, by drawing up <hi>a writ,</hi> in which there is an ample ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of <hi>the fault</hi> of the <hi>one,</hi> and a sufficient Reparation of <hi>the honour</hi> of the <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> this <hi>Writ</hi> is only accepted and becomes satisfactory, when he who gives the affront subscribes it: but if he refuse to own and ratifie it, 'tis altogether void and null; neither is there any reparation of the honour of <hi>Him</hi> who is <hi>injured.</hi> It is Even so here, the <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is in it self a <hi>sufficient atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for sin,</hi> and doeth truely repair the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine honour</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> which are affronted and injured by out sins: but it is not effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall to make our peace with God, untill we <hi>assent</hi> thereto by <hi>Faith;</hi> for untill that be done there is no <hi>actuall reparation</hi> made by us, what <hi>Christ</hi> hath done is his own deed alone, and can be reckoned ours no manner of way, and so no more valid then the <hi>Writ</hi> in the <hi>former case,</hi> which the <hi>offender</hi> neither drew up, nor yet consented to after it was drawn up. Thus it appears, how necessary <hi>Faith</hi> is in our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses to God; for as it is only for <hi>Iesus his sake</hi> and by <hi>vertue of his blood,</hi> that we ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

liberty to approach God, so it is only <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Him</hi> which makes him become our <hi>Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,</hi> and a <hi>Propitiation for our sins in particular;</hi> Without <hi>Faith</hi> it is impossible to remove out of the way, the <hi>wrath of God</hi> due to <hi>Sin,</hi> and the approaches of <hi>Unbeleevers</hi> will but prove their confusion and destruction.</p>
                     <p>But though <hi>Faith</hi> be necessary, yet it is not all that is necessary; it must indeed have the first place in our worship of GOD, and addresses to him; but after <hi>the acknowledgement of Faith,</hi> we ought to mind other things too, else we mangle the Service of GOD, and are very much wanting in that Worship which is due to him; As when a <hi>King</hi> to shew his clemency, hath <hi>Indemnified rebellious and Disobedient Subjects,</hi> It is their duty not only to come and lay hold on the <hi>Indemnity,</hi> and to claime his <hi>Protection</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi> and <hi>other Priviledges</hi> only by Vertue thereof: But also to return to the <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> of <hi>good Subjects,</hi> and to be carefull to manifest the same by such proper acts and Services, as they have occasion of. <hi>So we are justified by faith, and have our peace with GOD through our Lord Iesus Christ;</hi> but this doth not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve us from paying to GOD, what his <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Dignity</hi> and <hi>Excellency of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> require of us; we are rather the more
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:55045:137"/>
oblidged to set about carefully, what was our duty before our revolt, and all these other services, by which it may appear that we own and acknowledge <hi>the LORD GOD.</hi> Therefore though <hi>Faith</hi> makes our way to GOD, and rendreth our Actions accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to him, yet will not serve insteed of all those duties we owe him.</p>
                     <p>We must first <hi>Reconcile</hi> our selves to God <hi>by Faith,</hi> and then by proper and sutable acts both of the <hi>Inward</hi> and <hi>Outward Man,</hi> endeavour to honour him, and to set forth the <hi>Glory</hi> which is <hi>Due to his Name.</hi> To worship in <hi>the General</hi> is nothing else but to <hi>make an acknowledgement of some excellency in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> Therefore the true worship of GOD, consists in a serious sense of what he is, and in giving proper &amp; sutable expressions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and seing GOD is infinitly great, and powerfull, and wise, and good, &amp;c: We are taught by <hi>Reason and Scripture,</hi> to fear and love him above all things, to trust in him, depend upon him, to offer prayers and praises vnto him; for these Divine at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of Power, Wisdom, &amp;c: are not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise glorified, nor can we any other way shew a sense of them.</p>
                     <p>But seing GOD is not only <hi>Power, Wisdom, Goodness,</hi> &amp;c. but <hi>our Maker, Preserver,</hi> and <hi>the</hi>
                        <pb n="263" facs="tcp:55045:137"/>
                        <hi>Author of all me have,</hi> therefore <hi>a ready and chearfull Obedience is due to him;</hi> And by this especially we must <hi>testify that we own &amp; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him.</hi> What <hi>Obligations</hi> are on <hi>Servants</hi> to <hi>obey</hi> their <hi>Masters, Children</hi> their <hi>Parents, Subjects</hi> their <hi>King, the same</hi> and <hi>greater Obligations</hi> are upon us to obey <hi>God:</hi> And so there is nothing more evident, then that we disown and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject him from being our GOD, whom we refuse to obey in any thing he commands. Now all the <hi>Commands</hi> of GOD may be reduced to <hi>two sorts.</hi> First, there be some whose reason is apparent to us, such are those which are discernable by <hi>natural light,</hi> and usually called the <hi>Moral law.</hi> The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance whereof is required by the very <hi>Order of Nature:</hi> for if we act rationally we ought to follow this <hi>Law</hi> as closely, as <hi>the Brute Creature</hi> do their <hi>Natural instinct.</hi> But besides the <hi>commands</hi> of this <hi>first kind,</hi> there be <hi>others Meerly Arbitrary,</hi> which God hath enjoined cheifly to hold out his <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Soveraginity</hi> over us, and to prove our Subjection to him; <hi>These Divines</hi> ordinarly term <hi>Positive Precepts,</hi> and they are only known by <hi>Revelation.</hi> GOD never suffered Man to be without some command of <hi>this Nature,</hi> the <hi>Iews</hi> had many such, but <hi>Christians</hi> have few, and those few too are
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:55045:138"/>
made very serviceable to the <hi>great ends of Religion,</hi> the <hi>perfection of our souls,</hi> and <hi>their Union with God.</hi> How ever though 'twere o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, they ought to be observed, if we would have it appear, that we <hi>serve</hi> and <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> God: for if it be a <hi>part</hi> of <hi>Divine Worship to own Gods Authority,</hi> as we have made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, then we ought to observe <hi>positive Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts</hi> as well as the <hi>Duties of the Moral Law;</hi> seing thereby we signifie a <hi>true respect</hi> to the <hi>Authority of GOD,</hi> because there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reason which induceth us to such an Observance. Our <hi>chief motive to the obedience of the Moral Law,</hi> should be the <hi>Will and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of GOD,</hi> otherwise it is no <hi>Act of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious worship:</hi> but it cannot appear that our Obedience to that Law is for GOD, if we refuse to <hi>observe the positive Precepts of Scripture;</hi> for that <hi>Obedience</hi> is no <hi>true Obedience,</hi> which consider rather the <hi>Reason of the thing</hi> then the <hi>authority</hi> of the <hi>Injoyner.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Indeed if <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>positive Duties</hi> come at any time in Competition together, then <hi>these last</hi> should give place to <hi>the first;</hi> for this is the <hi>Will of GOD</hi> according to that <hi>Rule, I will have Mercy and not Sacrifice;</hi> that is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then Sacrifice. But when there is no such Reason for suspending them, it is a great sin and contempt of GOD to slight or

neglect them. It was <hi>by the breach of a positive precept,</hi> that our <hi>first Parents</hi> revolted from GOD, and which brought all <hi>this Masse of Sin and Misery</hi> upon <hi>Mankind; Which</hi> shews <hi>Divine Authority</hi> is affronted by small things as well as great, and that the <hi>Wrath of GOD</hi> may be provock'd by the neglect of <hi>positive Commands</hi> no lesse then of <hi>What is Moral.</hi> Wherefore they are grosely mistaken who think they are only concern'd to be what we call <hi>Moral good Men,</hi> and that it is little mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whither they observe the <hi>positive Ordinances</hi> of the <hi>Scripture.</hi> He is indeed no <hi>true servant</hi> of God, nor a <hi>right Worshipper</hi> of him, who is Vicious, and whose Conversation is not Honest and Righteous, for that is a <hi>Weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty matter of the Law:</hi> but neither can He be said to <hi>Worship God,</hi> who makes no Conscience of doing <hi>these Acts of Religion,</hi> which God hath been pleased <hi>to enjoyne, to shew his Authority,</hi> and to <hi>try what regard we have thereto.</hi> One may be <hi>Chaste, Temperate, Iust, Bountifull, &amp;c:</hi> Not for God's cause, but for his own, because 'tis agreeable to his Constitution, and for his Health, Interest, Reputation <hi>&amp;c:</hi> but who is all these, &amp; also carefull to expresse his <hi>devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, those otherwayes</hi> which are <hi>peculiar to the Scripture,</hi> gives a true proof that he owns God and doeth what he doeth only for him.</p>

                     <p>THAT we may shew more Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularlie, how and wherein GOD is to be Worshipped and Acknowledged, we shall instance, <hi>first,</hi> that of <hi>Fear.</hi> And here we shall not need to prove from <hi>Scripture, that GOD should be feared,</hi> it being so known and manifest a thing, that all who have ever <hi>acknowledged</hi> a <hi>GOD,</hi> have also <hi>Acknowledged that he ought to be feared;</hi> so that not only in <hi>Scripture,</hi> but even amongst all <hi>Nations, all Religion and Divine Worship</hi> is frequently expressed, by this one particular, he <hi>Fear of the LORD.</hi> And indeed it would
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:55045:139"/>
be very strange, if any should think GOD <hi>ought not to be Feared;</hi> a greater <hi>Parodox</hi> was never vented among Men: <hi>Fear ye not Me,</hi> saith the <hi>Lord, Will ye not tremble at my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the Sea, by a perpetuall decree that it cannot pass it, and though the Waves thereof toss them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, yet can they not prevaile, though they rear yet can they not pass over it. Ier</hi> 5. 22. And again, as the same <hi>Prophet</hi> hath it, Chap. 10. 6. 7. <hi>Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O Lord thou art great, thy Name is great in might, who would not fear thee, O King of Nations? For to thee doth it appertain;</hi> yea it is a saying of that excellent <hi>Roman Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, quis non timeat amnia providentem, &amp; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitantem, &amp; animadvertentem, &amp; omnia ad se pertinere putantem, curiosum &amp; plenum negotii Deum:</hi> That is, <hi>who would not fear that GOD, who sees and takes notice of all things, so carefull and full of business as to have a Particular concern for every Action and Person in the World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But as it is certain <hi>that GOD is to be feared,</hi> so by this we do not mean that <hi>servile and slavish fear,</hi> which makes Men only appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive of the hurt and evil which GOD may do them, and which such have who consider GOD only as a <hi>Being of great Might and Power,</hi> which he useth Arbitrally, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:55045:140"/>
considering that his <hi>Power</hi> is alwayes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by his <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and determined by his <hi>Goodness.</hi> This <hi>Kind of Fear</hi> ingendereth <hi>Superstition,</hi> and doth as oft avert a Man's mind from <hi>GOD</hi> as incline it to him; <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> observeth <hi>in his Treatise of Superstition, that this ordinarly turneth to Atheism, and nourisheth it.</hi> such was the <hi>Fear of the Israelites,</hi> when they saw the <hi>Lightnings</hi> and heard the <hi>thunderings</hi> from <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> as we read <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 18. for it is said there, <hi>when the People saw these things, they removed and stood a far off, and they said unto Moses, speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.</hi> It was <hi>this fear</hi> also, which possessed our <hi>First Parents</hi> after they had eaten the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit, they were afraid of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the Garden; Gen.</hi> 3. 8. Nay, the <hi>Divels</hi> themselves are seased with this <hi>Fear, they also fear and tremble,</hi> but by doing so they do not please God, nor find any acceptance with him.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Commendable fear of God</hi> is what we call a <hi>filial fear,</hi> such a <hi>fear as a Son carrieth to his Father,</hi> whom he loveth dearly, a <hi>fear</hi> which breedeth <hi>love</hi> and <hi>delight,</hi> which makes a Man to rejoyce in God and glad that he is; whereas the <hi>other fear</hi> makes one wish
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:55045:140"/>
there were no God, and is inconsistent with <hi>love,</hi> and doth fill one with <hi>dread</hi> and <hi>horrour:</hi> Of which kind of <hi>Fear</hi> it is that the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaketh, when he saith, <hi>There is no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear, because fear hath torment, he that feareth is not made perfect in love;</hi> 1: John 4: 18.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>true Fear of GOD,</hi> is founded upon <hi>his Nature,</hi> and doth proceed from the right Knowledge of GOD, and a deep Sense of his <hi>Glorious Attributes</hi> and <hi>Perfections.</hi> Some say, <hi>Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion,</hi> But it is quite contrarie; for the more one knows of GOD, and the greater apprehensions he hath of these <hi>infinite excellencies</hi> which are in him, the more he both <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Loves Him,</hi> and therefore it is we find that those to whom God <hi>revealed himself most, did ever Fear him most: Abraham and Moses</hi> seemed to have had GOD in greater reverence then all other Men, because they were most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate with Him; and certainlie the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in Heaven</hi> do yet <hi>Fear</hi> him more then any the <hi>most eminent Saint</hi> upon Earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they see him more clearlie and know him more fully: For it is certain, the more ones worth and perfection is known it is alwayes the more valued and esteemed, and as there is no <hi>Love</hi> nor <hi>Desire</hi> of a good
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:55045:141"/>
unknown, so it is a small regard which any can have to the Worth and Perfections which they are Ignorant off. Wherefore that we may be possessed with the <hi>true fear of God,</hi> it is necessary that we get the <hi>right knowledge of Him,</hi> we must learn what he is, and how great he is; we must furnish our minds with <hi>true and proper nations of his Almighty Power, his unsearchable wisdom, his infinite goodness, his unspotted holiness, his admirable greatness, his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable glory, his strict and severe justice, and his Soveraign Dominion over all things;</hi> which made <hi>David to</hi> say, <hi>my flesh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy judgements; Psal:</hi> 119. 120. I say, we should labour to know these things, and should let them have a deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression on our Spirits, and should ever bear the Sense of them about with us, or else we can never <hi>truely fear God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as this is the way to come <hi>to</hi> the <hi>true fear of God,</hi> so it expresseth it self alwayes in two things <hi>viz.</hi> 1. in reverence towards his <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Person;</hi> &amp; <hi>2ly.</hi> in a care not to offend him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> if we <hi>truly fear God,</hi> we will <hi>highly honour</hi> and <hi>reverence Him,</hi> and that both <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly</hi> and <hi>outwardly. Inwardly,</hi> by having him in a high Esteem, and thinking upon him alwayes with a holy regard and Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Deference. When ever God comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:55045:141"/>
our mind, or that we present our selves before him, our Spirit should be struck into <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>w;</hi> we should lay aside all Vanity and Lightness, and become Grave, Serious, and Composed, as is sutable to so <hi>High</hi> and <hi>Holy</hi> a <hi>presence.</hi> The serious Thoughts of God, should make us stoop and humble our selves and be very submissive; when we consider God and his <hi>Greatness,</hi> we should strip our selves of all Pride, and Self-conceit and look upon our selves, and all things else as little and inconsiderable; yea as very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for what else are we, or any Creature, nay all Creatures together when compared to God. <hi>Behold,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>the Nations are as the drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the Ballance: behold he taketh up the Isles as a very little thing; All Nations before him are as nothing, and they are counted to him less then nothing, and vanity; he sitteth upon the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Earth and the inhabitants thereof are as Grashoppers; Isai:</hi> 40, 15, 17, 22. They who are proud of themselves, or big with conceit of any other thing, do either not know God or they doe little reflect upon him: for as the <hi>lesser Stars</hi> disappear when the <hi>Sun</hi> aris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and as the <hi>Diamond</hi> doth obscure with its brightness, the <hi>Peeble, and counterfeit Stones,</hi> when it is set beside them, so certainly when
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:55045:142"/>
God is seriously considered and thought upon, he will make all things appear small and inconsiderable; the sense of <hi>his Greatness</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> will cast a shadow upon the <hi>Beautie, Lustre,</hi> &amp; <hi>Excellencie,</hi> even of the best of other things. The <hi>Right fear of GOD will not suffer him who hath it to be proud,</hi> but doth alwayes fill him with low and mean thoughts of himself, and with a <hi>high esteem of God and greater reverence for him;</hi> yea, also it maketh a Man to admire the least <hi>Act of Favour</hi> and <hi>Condescension</hi> which cometh from GOD. Thus we find <hi>Abraham</hi> humbled himself when he talked with GOD, and shewed what a <hi>high esteem</hi> he had of him, <hi>behold,</hi> saith he, <hi>Now I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes;</hi> Gen 18: 27. <hi>Iob</hi> likewise when he had a clear <hi>Sight of GOD,</hi> he was base in his own eyes, <hi>behold I am vain,</hi> saith he, <hi>what shall I answer thee, I will lay my hand upon my mouth:</hi> And again, <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eyes seeth thee, wherefore I abhorre my self, and repent in dust and ashes; Iob</hi> 40, 4: 42; 5. And when <hi>David</hi> had considered <hi>the Heavens, the works of God's Fingers, the Moon, and the Stars,</hi> and was drawn by them to the consideration of of the greatness of the <hi>Maker,</hi> he presently
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:55045:142"/>
looks down with contempt and disdain upon himself and all Mankind, and admires GOD'S <hi>Goodness</hi> unto them. <hi>Lord, saith he, what is Man, that thou art mindfull of him, and the Son of man, that thou visitest him? Psal.</hi> 8: 4. Thus it appears, that the <hi>fear of God</hi> doth alwayes make us to reverence and <hi>esteem him highly in our minds,</hi> and <hi>thoughts,</hi> and also to contemn and undervalue our selves, and all other things out of respect unto him.</p>
                     <p>But as we must thus <hi>reverence God Inwardly,</hi> by studying to have great &amp; <hi>worthy thoughts</hi> of him, &amp; mean &amp; <hi>low thoughts of our selves,</hi> &amp; all things besides for his cause, so we ought to shew reverence towards him <hi>Outwardly,</hi> by a <hi>Grave and Humble deportment of the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man before him:</hi> All <hi>reverence of the Divine Majestie</hi> must not be confined within us, it must sometimes appear without also, and certainly if there be much <hi>Within,</hi> there will something of it Kyth <hi>Outwardly.</hi> The <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Thoughts, Sentiments,</hi> and <hi>Inclinations</hi> of the Soul, are always to be discerned by the <hi>Outward behaviour;</hi> and therefore if we <hi>Inwardly fear GOD</hi> and <hi>reverence him,</hi> we will discover it both by speaking alwayes of him with great Respect and Deference; and also by such Acts and Gestures of the Body when we set about his <hi>Worship</hi> or present our selves
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:55045:143"/>
before Him; as are proper to express and speak out the sense of that <hi>Infinite Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> which is betwixt Him and us: And so we read that <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and all the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Servants of GOD</hi> in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> used to <hi>bow down</hi> and <hi>fall upon their Face to the Ground when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before GOD,</hi> or that he appeared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Yea, GOD himself expresly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired this of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Ioshua,</hi> at these <hi>Manifestations of his presence unto them,</hi> which we find, Exod. 3. 5. <hi>Iosh</hi> 5. 15. For there he commanded them, <hi>to put off their shoes from off their feet,</hi> which according to the custom of the <hi>Eastern Nations,</hi> was then a Testimonie of Respect and Reverence. And indeed seing we bear no proportion to the <hi>Greatness of God,</hi> there is nothing more Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or Reasonable, then that we should Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and <hi>Exalt</hi> him, by such depressing of our selves and humbling of our <hi>Bodies</hi> in <hi>his Sight.</hi> The very <hi>Angels,</hi> these <hi>Glorious Spirits,</hi> are said <hi>to vail and cover their faces when they appear before God;</hi> And how much more Reason is it, that we be abashed and humbled <hi>who dwell in houses of clay,</hi> and <hi>whose founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in the dust.</hi> Certainly if there be any Gesture or Posture more humble then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her, it becomes us to use it; and it doth
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:55045:143"/>
bespeak little <hi>Reverence to</hi> God, to use that Gesture and Carriage, when we speak to him, or he speaks to us, which we would not make use of, but when we were conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with our <hi>Equals,</hi> or <hi>Inferiours. Sitting therefore at Prayer,</hi> and <hi>having the head covered when Divine Worship is performed,</hi> are very undecent and unbecoming things. I wonder how ever this creept in, or came to be in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion amongst us; and I think it yet more strange, that there should be some who take upon them to defend that which is condemned not only by <hi>the practice of all the Saints and Servants of God,</hi> we read of in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> but also by the <hi>Custome</hi> of <hi>all Nations</hi> whatsoever: For even the very <hi>Heathens,</hi> would account it irreverence towards their <hi>False Gods;</hi> which many <hi>Christians</hi> in <hi>this Country</hi> are not ashamed to do towards the <hi>True and Living God.</hi> What the <hi>Lord</hi> saith by the <hi>Prophet Malachy,</hi> in another case, will be very applicable here, <hi>a Son honoureth his Father, and a Servant his Master, if then I be a Father, where is my honour, and if I be a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster where is my fear: offer this now unto thy Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, saith the Lord of Hosts? Mal:</hi> 1. 6. 8. Nay, to pass <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> and those of the <hi>best quality,</hi> even the <hi>meaner sort of Gentlemen,</hi>
                        <pb n="276" facs="tcp:55045:144"/>
would look upon themselves, as affronted and uncivilly Treated, if they had not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er respect payed them, then what some shew to God: who would not be incens'd and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock'd, if his <hi>Tennent</hi> or <hi>any other Poor mean Fellow</hi> should thrust into his presence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out uncovering his Head, and sit down and talk with him? <hi>I</hi> doubt not but there are some, who would be ready to cause kick such <hi>all manner'd Persons,</hi> to the doore; and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see, how that can be reckoned as <hi>reverence</hi> and a sign of <hi>devotion</hi> to God which men look upon as rudenesse and incivility.</p>
                     <p>There be some which very much mistake that place of the <hi>Prophet, Isai.</hi> 29. 13. Where the <hi>Lord</hi> complains of his <hi>People of Old, that they drew near Him with their Mouth, and that they honoured him with their lips,</hi> as if that were a discharge of all <hi>externall Worship</hi> or of <hi>outward reverence</hi> therein: whereas it is not the <hi>outward honour</hi> and <hi>reverence</hi> which the Lord there finds fault with, but only <hi>that their hearts were far from him:</hi> God values not the <hi>Body</hi> without the <hi>Soul,</hi> for then it is but a dead Carcase; he cares not for our <hi>outward reverence</hi> and <hi>Prostrations,</hi> when the <hi>inward Spirit of devotion is wanting:</hi> but as he calls chiefly for the <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Mind,</hi> because it is the <hi>better part of Man;</hi> so he expects that
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:55045:144"/>
having the <hi>inward,</hi> the <hi>outward man</hi> will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: and indeed <hi>what God hath joyned together should not be put asunder.</hi> The <hi>Apostle</hi> enjoyns the <hi>honouring of God outwardly</hi> as well as <hi>inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> when he saith, <hi>Glorify God in your body, and in your spirit which are Gods;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 6. 20. 'Tits <hi>true superstition</hi> is a fault, but it is not the best way to redresse it, to turn <hi>Profane</hi> and <hi>irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</hi> God is not pleased with the humblest postures of our bodies, when our hearts and souls do not accompany them: but to make up that want, we must not turn away from the <hi>necessary</hi> and <hi>becoming testimonies of devotion</hi> and <hi>reverence:</hi> What our <hi>Saviour</hi> said on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occasion to the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharises,</hi> I may well apply here, <hi>these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. Matth:</hi> 23. 23. As <hi>hypocrisie</hi> may be joyned to the <hi>outward acts and expressions of humility and reverence,</hi> so it is as certain that there is little <hi>true sense of God within,</hi> when the outward <hi>behaviour</hi> is not Grave, modest, and Humble: wherefore it is the <hi>saying of One, I will as sure believe him tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perat, who is staggering in the Streets with drink, and him chaste, whose eyes are full of Adultery, &amp; him mercifull, whose hands are imbru'd in blood, as that he can truely fear God who sheweth no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reverence in his worship.</hi> The <hi>outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence</hi> of the Body, is not only necessary
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:55045:145"/>
to testifie the <hi>inward respect of the mind;</hi> but it is also requisite for the quickning and stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it up: as the <hi>outward Pomp</hi> and <hi>Grandeur</hi> of <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Magistrats</hi> is necessary, to put <hi>People</hi> in mind of their <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> which otherwayes they would be readie to forget, or to be too bold with; so the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Humiliation of our Bodies,</hi> serves to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish and to keep up in us the <hi>sense of God's greatness and Glory,</hi> which otherwayes perhaps would slip out of our minds.</p>
                     <p>Thus we have spoken to that reverence both <hi>Inward</hi> and <hi>Outward,</hi> which is due to GOD, which is always <hi>One of the fruits of his fear.</hi> The <hi>other effect thereof,</hi> consists in a great <hi>care and circumspection not to offend or displease him:</hi> And indeed if this be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there is no true <hi>Fear of GOD,</hi> nor will any Reverence which we shew towards him find acceptance with him. As <hi>Children</hi> who truly honour and respect their Parents, are alwayes very loath to give them any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of offence, and as they are grieved when at any time they chance to do it, though they do not <hi>Fear</hi> nor <hi>apprehend to be chastised;</hi> so such as are sincerly acted with the <hi>Fear of GOD,</hi> will carefully watch <hi>against all manner of sin,</hi> and will have an aversion from it, though there where no ground to dread
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:55045:145"/>
Hell or other punishments; but even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that this is contrarie to him, whom they intirely love and honour: And when they have sinned, the consideration of the offence which is given GOD thereby, will afflict them more, then these bitter fruits which sin alwayes produceth. Therefore the <hi>True fear of GOD,</hi> doth alwayes restrain Men from doing these things that are <hi>Evil in his sight,</hi> and doth incline them to <hi>that which is good, the fear of the LORD,</hi> saith <hi>the wise Man, is to hate evil; Prov:</hi> 8: 13: And again, <hi>by the fear of their Lod, men depart from evil.</hi> Chap. 16 6. This is a great <hi>Aw<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> band</hi> over men, &amp; will crub them more then all humane Laws and Authority: For such as are possessed with the <hi>Fear of GOD,</hi> will not only for bear gross and open transgressions, which may make them lyable to punishment from Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but even also as much as possible Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and lesser Faults, which the World takes no notice off. Thus <hi>Ioseph</hi> would not yeeld to the enticements of his <hi>Mistress,</hi> though perhaps he might have done it, without being in hazard of a discovery, for he feared GOD: <hi>How shall I,</hi> saith he, <hi>do this great wickedness, and sin against GOD. Gen.</hi> 39. 9. And when his <hi>Brethren</hi> were seased with <hi>Panick fear</hi> because of that rough and
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:55045:146"/>
severe countenance which he put on towards them, he encouraged them with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration <hi>that he feared GOD,</hi> as if he had said, <hi>Though I have all power and Authority here in Egypt, yet you have no reason to be afraid of me, for I am not one who will abuse my Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and wrest my power to do Men hurt, and prejudice, for I fear GOD: Gen.</hi> 42. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>8. When Men are not very carefull to avoid sin, and to do good, it is certain there is little or no <hi>Fear of GOD</hi> before their eyes, and they do in vain pretend it: How im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent and unreasonable a thing is it, to say, we <hi>Fear that Person</hi> whom we nevery study to please, &amp; whom we are careless whither we offend or not? There cannot truly be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er signs and evidences of contempt and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respect then this, and it is impossible that we should both <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Despise, Slight</hi> and <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> the same Person <hi>at one and the same time.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And hence it appears how little of the <hi>true fear of God is in the World,</hi> even among us who are called <hi>Christians,</hi> seing there are so small endeavours to please God, Nay such a forwardness to displease him, by doing these things which he hates and Abhors, and which he hath so often expresly forbidden. It is a sad, but a certain Truth, that the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gul</hi> and <hi>Cham of Tartar,</hi> nay some of the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:55045:146"/>
                        <hi>Petty Indian Princes,</hi> are not only more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured &amp; feared by their own <hi>proper Subjects,</hi> but also may be said to be had in greater Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence by many <hi>Christians,</hi> then the <hi>true and everliving GOD</hi> is: because they do not slight them so much as they do Him, their laws they do not so often violat, their power and Authority they do not so frequently bafle and trample upon as they do Gods; and it is certain their name is not so much nor so often profaned and derided, as the Name of the Great GOD; for some, nay many both <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>Young</hi> amongst us, are come to this now, that they cannot open their mouths without <hi>prophaning the holy Name of God,</hi> though he hath said expresly, <hi>that he will not hold them guiltless who take his Name in vain.</hi> Judge I pray you, if this be to <hi>fear the Lord,</hi> or if it be not rather to mock him, and to have him in Derision; for certainly though Men would set themselves to affront Him, they could hardly do it more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; And is this then fair and equall deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by such as profess themselves Friends and Servants? Did every <hi>Nation</hi> or <hi>People</hi>

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Gods Eye is alwayes upon us, it should be our endeavour to do those things which he approves of, which doth not tye us to do always what is best in it self simply, or when compared to other things, but only that we never be busied in other then Lawfull and innocent things, and that we be ever care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to do what is best relatively, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

To do and forbear any thing, because Men are witnesses, and do approve or discommend it, and yet not to care to do or neglect the

And do we not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard man more then <hi>God,</hi> when we are more desirous of applause from Men, then to find <hi>favour in the Eyes of GOD?</hi> And when we withdraw our selves from the eyes of Men lest they should know our evil Actions, but never value God's sight and knowledge thereof? He who doth thus, hath not taken <hi>the Lord to be his God,</hi> he doth not own and acknowledge him, he bows only to Men, to his own <hi>Credit</hi> or <hi>Homour,</hi> and hath set up these for his <hi>GOD.</hi> Wherefore who would not be guilty of such <hi>gross Idolatry,</hi> as to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the <hi>Creature</hi> more then the <hi>Creator,</hi> and and who would testifie and make it appear that they indeed adore the <hi>true GOD,</hi> let them not slight or despise the <hi>Divine Presence,</hi> but let them alwayes eye and consider it, and be carefull to carry themselves alwayes, as before so Great and Glorious a <hi>Majesty.</hi> And seing that God is every where, and hath his eye alway upon us, let us in private and in publick, at home and abroad, at all times and in all places, walk wisely and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectly, let us not be guilty of such incivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity towards God, as to do any unworthy thing before him: but let us labour so to

                        <p>However, it is certain all the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> have ever thought it their Duty, and a proper and necessary Testifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Respect unto <hi>GOD,</hi> to be taken up with the <hi>Contemplation of his Works,</hi> both of <hi>Creation and Providence,</hi> and to set a part sometime dayly for this purpose.

therefore largely display them before him, in the 38. and following Chapters.

And again he saith, <hi>All thy works shall praise thee, O Lord, and thy Saints shall blesse thee?</hi> That is, as his works contain the matter of his Praise, so the <hi>Saints</hi> shall publish and Declare it, by admiring and magnifying of them, <hi>they shall,</hi> as he goeth on, <hi>speake of the Glory of thy Kingdom, and talk of thy power to make known to the Sons of Men his mighty Acts, and the Glorious Majesty of his Kingdom, Psal.</hi> 145. 10. &amp;c:</p>
                        <p>Thus it appears, that the observing of <hi>GOD'S wayes and works,</hi> makes a great part of his Worship; and that hereby we do truely acknowledge him to be what he is, not only of <hi>great Majesty,</hi> but also a GOD of <hi>Infinite Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Power:</hi> Because by so doing, we declare that <hi>He does nothing in Vain,</hi> nothing that is not <hi>infinitly Worthy,</hi> of our most <hi>Serious Consideration,</hi> and that

our thoughts can never be better imployed, them in the Contemplation of what he hath done and dayly doth in the World.

                        <p>It will become us to take notice, <hi>how manifold the works of the LORD are,</hi> and <hi>in what Wisdom he hath made them all:</hi> How he hath reared up this vast fabrick of the World out of nothing, and Wonderfully beautified &amp; adorned it. <hi>How he hath stretched out the Heavens like a curtain, and in them hath set a Tabernacle for the Sun, which is as a bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom coming out of his chamber, and rejoyceth as a strong man to run a race, whose going forth is from the end of the Heaven and his circuit to the ends of it, and there is nothing, hid from the heat thereof.</hi> What a wise and admirable contrivance is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Scituation</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> whereby all the parts of the world are equally enlightned? For what any part wants at one time, it hath at another, those places which are longest without the <hi>Sun,</hi> have him also longest with them, so that <hi>his Presence</hi> alwayes equals his <hi>Absence.</hi>
                           <pb n="297" facs="tcp:55045:154"/>
And the dispensing <hi>his presence</hi> thus different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is much more usefull and convenient, then if it had been otherwise; it is visibly better that the <hi>Sun</hi> moves now betwixt the <hi>two Tropicks</hi> not in a straight or direct Line, then if it had rolled regularly upon the <hi>Equator:</hi> for then those <hi>under the Line</hi> or near it would have had all the Advantage, and his influence upon the rest of the World would have been very faint, like to that in <hi>March</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> which is not sufficient to produce and ripen the <hi>various fruits</hi> of the Earth, which are usefull both for our Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and Pleasure. But when we have our eyes lifted up to the Heavens, the <hi>Sun</hi> is not all which is worthy to be observed there, we ought likewise to consider the <hi>Moon</hi> which <hi>GOD hath appointed for</hi> the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguishing Seasons,</hi> and hath placed as a Lamp to give light in the night, that those whose necessities call to travell then, may be derected and see their way. We ought to view the <hi>Stars</hi> also, these admirable <hi>Embellishments</hi> of the <hi>Heavenly Frame,</hi> which we have reason to think vastly bigg, beyond their appearance, else how would they be seen at such a distance? And seeing <hi>Reason</hi> teacheth them to be so great in quantity, and that our eyes shew them to be many in

                           <hi>there is no power but of GOD,</hi> he curbs their Rage, stills their Tumults, defeats their Conspiracies and Rebellious Designs, and and forceth them to stand in aw of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority established over them, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise is too weake to restrain their fury. <hi>The Lord maketh Poor, and maketh Rich, he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth low and lifted up, he raiseth up the Poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the Beggar from the Dunghill, to set them among Princes, and to make them inherit the Throne of Glory.</hi> It's fit to observe, how variously and wonderfully, God punisheth Sin, and rewardeth Vertue and Righteousness; for his Hand findeth out sinfull Men, and maketh them to smart for all their evil Deeds, and repayeth them as they have dealt with others, that with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donibezek,</hi> they may say, <hi>as I have done, so GOD requited me.</hi> But he blesseth the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and giveth them Peace; he sendeth them <hi>many Afflictions</hi> to teach them Wisdom, and to perfect them in Virtue, but also <hi>he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereth them out of them all,</hi> that Men may learn to trust the LORD, and to seek his Favour above all Things.

to / find out that we are <hi>Beloved of GOD.</hi> Wherefore as it is a piece of slight put upon GOD, not to observe these his <hi>Admirable workings,</hi> and <hi>Manifestations of his Power, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodness;</hi> So it is a prejudice unto our selves; in that hereby we are deprived of unspeakable Pleasures and Delight, which otherwise would accrue unto us. And is it not strange that this so pleasant Duty, should be so much neglected and laid aside; the meaner sort drudge alwayes at their Work, and take no leasure to meditate; and those who can, and do allow themselves some spare hours, do for the most part imploy them in hearing and telling News, in Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious enquiries about the Motions &amp; Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sactions, of some remote Prince, which little concerns them, and which amounts to little when known, they becoming there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by neither wiser nor more Happy.

is there any thing more worthy of us, this is most worthy of Angels.

These <hi>Secrets</hi> of the <hi>Divine Counsel,</hi> God hath reserv'd to himself, and 'twould but offend him to be over curious to know them. It is not the will of God that we seek for this, for he hath given us no Means to come to the knowledge thereof; for to have recourse to <hi>Astrologers, Wizards,</hi> such as have <hi>Familiar Spirits, &amp;c.</hi> Are means as Unlawfull as they are Uncertain and Deceitful. Nor is it profitable for us to know what shall befall us, God keeps this Secret, because it is better to be Ignorant of it, then if it were revealed; 'tis better that we <hi>live by Faith then such a sight,</hi> because hereby these necessary vertues of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, trust in God, Watchfulness, and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, are exercised &amp; confined. It is true the <hi>Iews</hi> of old had Liberty granted them to enquire about future Events and their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires were satisfied as appears by many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances in <hi>Scripture:</hi> but now the Reason of such Extraordinary <hi>Temporal priviledges</hi> is ceased, and the <hi>Gospel</hi> requires us to be <hi>entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resign'd to GOD,</hi> and to be dispos'd either to Prosperity or Adversity, to Disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Successe, with a kind of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, because the <hi>Glory of GOD and our true Felicity,</hi> depend neither upon the one nor the other, but may be Advanced by either of them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="315" facs="tcp:55045:163"/>To <hi>consult</hi> GOD then, is not to enquire into <hi>secret purposes of his Counsel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how he intends to dispose of us:</hi> but it is that we may be <hi>inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of our Duty,</hi> that we may understand what becomes us to do in the <hi>several Periods of our life,</hi> and in all those Stations and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we stand in what course of Life we should intend; How we ought to carry our selves having chosen one? How we should best spend our Time and Order our Affairs, that as much as possible, we may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>all offence either to GOD or Man.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>From hence it follows that we ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to deliberate about things certainly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, nor yet ask of GOD whither at any time we may venture upon them, for this in plain terms is, to ask whither we should thwart his Will, transgresse his Laws, grieve his Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dishonour his Name, and rebell against his Authority. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tempt God, and Act most impudently who ask Counsel in such a Case; and what prompts Men to things sinfull is not the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of GOD:</hi> the Counsel is not from GOD which Allows and Approves of any <hi>unlawfull deed.</hi> GOD is not the Author of Sin, <hi>He cannot be tempted with evill, neither tempteth he any man; Iam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:55045:164"/>
which make them continue the practice of any wicked Action whatever such pretend, and whatever high conceit they may enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of themselves, yet the <hi>Scripture</hi> tells us, <hi>that it is a heavy Iudgement and a sign of a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate mind to be given up to do things unlawfull, and which are not convenient; Rom:</hi> 1. 28.</p>
                        <p>When therefore we come to <hi>Consult GOD,</hi> as we ought alwayes in all doubtful Cases, it should be to know what is lawful, and not only what is simply lawful, but also what is expedient, what is sutable for us as we are so Stated &amp; Circumstantiated, and by what wayes and Means we should prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute those Ends we ought to have before us, <hi>viz.</hi> GOD'S Glory, our Neighbours good, and our own present Comfort, and <hi>after hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now having seen whereabouts we ought to <hi>consult GOD,</hi> we come in the next place to shew <hi>how we are to doe it.</hi> And <hi>First,</hi> we must lay aside all <hi>prejudice and byassed affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> aud put on the <hi>Indefferency of a Traveller,</hi> who hath no Inclination to turn either to the Right or the Left hand, but to be directed in the <hi>Right way.</hi> If we do not this, we are not <hi>Sincere</hi> when we seek <hi>Counsel of God,</hi> nor capable to receive it though it be given; this was the fault of the <hi>Young Man</hi> that came to
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:55045:164"/>
our <hi>Saviour,</hi> to ask, <hi>what he should do to inherite eternal Life?</hi> For because the Answer would have parted him and his Possessions, he would not listen to it. If Men be blinded with Prejudice, they will not see the Light though it be clear; nor will they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded though they have <hi>Sufficient convictions laid before them,</hi> if their Inclinations be strong another way, we must therefore free our selves of all Passion and Prejudice; and be Sincerely Desirous of <hi>right Information.</hi> In the next place, we must <hi>Addresse our selves to GOD</hi> by <hi>Humble and Hearty Prayer,</hi> that it may please him to Enlighten the eyes of our Minds, to the discerning His Will, and the way wherein we should walk: For is we do not Pray, we are not desirous here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, neither duely Value it, and so GOD will not think us worthy of it; who De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise or Lightly esteem the <hi>Counsel and Direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of the LORD,</hi> shall be left to wander in the Ignorance and Darknesse of their own Minds: But he will lead and guide them in the Paths of Righteousnesse, who hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly seek Him. But though Prayer be good, yet it is not the only Means, it must not be neglected, but it must not be rested in. We must not ask direction, as <hi>Pilate, what was Truth</hi> at <hi>Christ,</hi> who when he put the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:55045:165"/>
presently went out and stayed not for an Answer. After we have Prayed, we should listen attentively to what GOD say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; we ought to hearken carefully to the <hi>voice of GOD.</hi> And therefore, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> we must <hi>search Diligently the Scriptures, for they are the Word of God,</hi> and in and by them he speaketh to us his Will and Pleasure. God hath given the <hi>Seripture,</hi> to be <hi>a Lamp unto our feet and a Light unto our Path;</hi> And so who would walk uprightly so as to Please God, must follow the Guidance thereof. 'Ts true God speaketh also <hi>Inwardly</hi> by his <hi>Spirit</hi> to the Hearts and Minds of Men, but Ordinarly it is by the <hi>outward Means of the Word.</hi> 'Tts seldom and in some singular Cases only, that he speaks to men without the <hi>Mediation of the Scriptures:</hi> However he never speaketh but agreeably to the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> whatever he sayeth any manner of way must be consistent with the <hi>Doctrine and Precepts of the Scriptures,</hi> for GOD neither can nor will contradict Himself. Wherefore all <hi>inward Suggestions</hi> and <hi>Inspirations</hi> must be examined by the <hi>Written word of GOD,</hi> which as <hi>St. Peter</hi> speaks in a like case, is <hi>the surer Word,</hi> 2 Pet 1. 19. We have Reason to put greater Confidence in the <hi>outward Light of the Scriptures,</hi> then what is <hi>inwardly suggest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi>
                           <pb n="219" facs="tcp:55045:165"/>
for we may readily deceive our selves here, and take the <hi>delusions of Satan,</hi> or our own strong Imaginations for the <hi>Inspirations of GOD'S Spirit,</hi> every one cannot distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish betwixt them, and indeed it is often hard for any to do it, but by comparing them to what is delivered in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> which we are sure is from GOD. We must not then be too hasty in concluding our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to a thing, or aversion from it, (after that we have prayed fervently) to be from GOD unlesse it be warranted by the <hi>Word of GOD</hi> revealed in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> or at lest no wise opposite to what is there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd us.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Scriptures</hi> are the <hi>holy Oracles</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the <hi>mind of GOD,</hi> to them therefore we must resort at all times, and on all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to know what we should do; and by them all Persons of each Sexe, Age, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, Imployment may be instructed how to order their <hi>conversation aright before GOD.</hi> For they are so composed, <hi>that the Man of GOD,</hi> by them <hi>may be perfect, throughly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished unto all good works;</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 17. 'Tis true every one will not find their particular Case Stated and Resolved, but either Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or Indirectly, either by expresse Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts or Paralel, and not much different Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:55045:166"/>
they shall see what may sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inform and resolve them: And whoso will give themselves entirely up to the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of GOD in his word</hi> shall without doubt (as we shewed before) either by <hi>secret Suggestions of the Spirit,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">See part first chap; 2?</note> or by some <hi>speciall occurrences of his providence</hi> be <hi>Particularly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in the disposall of themselves and their affairs</hi> which are of greatest concernment and to which it cannot be expected that the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> should speak particularly. <hi>The meek will he guide in judgement, and the meek will he teach his way. All the paths of the LORD are Mercy and Truth, unto such as keep his Covenant and Testimonies; Psal.</hi> 25. 9. 10.</p>
                        <p>Thus we have shewed how we should <hi>consult GOD,</hi> and by what means wee may come to be <hi>directed by him.</hi> Now certainly it concerns us very much thus to consult Him, and to follow these Means for acquainting our selves with what is proper for us to do. The <hi>Heathens</hi> of old gloried much in their <hi>Oracles,</hi> and used to Consult them in all their affairs, though they were so uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Ambiguous, that they proved more often Snares to entrap them, then Lights to guide them. But sure wee have much more Reason to Glory and Rejoyce
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:55045:166"/>
in this <hi>Special Priviledge</hi> we have of <hi>Consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true GOD,</hi> who neither will deceive others, nor can be deceived himself; and who hath been Graciously pleased to speak to us so plainly and clearly by <hi>his Word,</hi> and who Promises farther Direction as we stand in need. Hereby we are enabled to walk wisely, and are shewed the <hi>True way</hi> of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on our <hi>Happiness, and Peace, the Testimony of the Lord,</hi> saith <hi>David, is sure, making wise the simple; the commandement of the Lord is pure, enlightning the eyes.</hi> Psal. 19. 7, 8. It was a laudable custome amongst the <hi>Iews,</hi> to <hi>ask Counsel of GOD</hi> before they began any Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise; and so it becomes us to resort unto the <hi>Scriptures for Counsel and Direction,</hi> where we shall receive it fully and clearly if we be desirous thereof, and follow the Direction prescribed above. <hi>David</hi> no doubt had many Counsellours, and yet he preferred the <hi>Word and Law</hi> of GOD before them all: <hi>thy testimonies,</hi> saith he, <hi>are my delight and Counsellours.</hi> And again, he tells, us that <hi>he bad more understanding then all his Teachers, for GODS Testimonies were his Meditation; Ps</hi> 119. 24. 99. It is reported of the <hi>Heathen Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> that he pretended to have a certain <hi>Spirit</hi> or <hi>genius,</hi> which he used as his Counsellour; and therefore when ever he was required to
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:55045:167"/>
speak or to do any thing, his usuall answer was, <hi>si Daemon permiserit, if my spirit or genius will suffer.</hi> Now it is our Happiness that we have a better Counsellour to advise with, and therefore also whenso e're any thing is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded unto us, either to our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or Wills, to be believed or practised, let our Answer be with the <hi>Psalmist, I will hear what GOD the LORD will speak Ps.</hi> 85. 8. I will first consult GOD, by the <hi>Holy Oracles</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> And if we never conclude or resolve any thing without <hi>advising thus with GOD,</hi> we shall highly honour him and shew an entire regard unto him, and also take a Wise and most Profitable Course for our selves. But alas! As <hi>Solomon</hi> complains, <hi>wherefore is there a price in the hand of a Fool to get Wisdom, seeing he hath no heart unto it?</hi> So it may be said, <hi>to what purpose is it?</hi> And how little doth it avail us, to have the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> seing we make so little use of them, and take so little notice of what GOD says to us in and by them? How sad is it, and what matter of regrate to see how many miscarry in this Point? There be many who will readily consult Flesh and Blood, they will listen to the <hi>corrupt maximes</hi> of the World, they will hearken to what the Devil himself doth say, and suggest unto them; bnt only
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:55045:167"/>
what GOD the LORD speaketh, they care not to hear: nay with the <hi>deaf Adder, they stop their ears and will not hearken to the voice of the Charmer, though he Charm never so wisely.</hi> And as Men hereby slight and dishonour GOD, in that they undervalue his <hi>Counsel,</hi> so they intangle themselves in a World of Trouble and Difficultys: for many, nay most of our Crosses and Sorrows, are but the effects of this folly. For when we do not <hi>ask Counsel of the LORD,</hi> but will needs take our own courses, then he <hi>blasts our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,</hi> by leaving us to our selves, to stand by our own strength; and so it comes to passe, that we have no ability to conquere the difficultys we are engadg'd in, but must necessarly sink under them, whereas if we con sulted GOD, he would not fail to concur with <hi>his Power and Providence</hi> to effectuat that which he himself had advised or approved of. That therefore we may be Wise in all our Undertakings, and have Comfort in them, let us undertake nothing without GOD, let us be carefull alwayes to ask Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of him, praying with <hi>David, shew me thy wayes O LORD, teach me thy paths, lead me in thy truth and teach me: for thou art the GOD of my Salvation, on thee do I wait all the day. Ps.</hi> 25. 4. And then no doubt GOD
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:55045:168"/>
would guide us with his Counsel here, and receive us into Glory hereafter: If withall in the last place, we Stedfastly and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully observe the wayes he layeth before us, and keep close to the Direction he gives, which we told was the last Particular includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Walking with GOD;</hi> and which comes next to be spoken to,</p>

As a true Friend we must never leave him or part with him, but must follow chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully whither so ever he leads us, be the way fair or foul, pleasant or unpleasant.

                        <p>And as this is to <hi>walk with GOD,</hi> so by walking thus with Him we make the most proper acknowledgement of him and pay the most acceptable Worship to him: for hereby we declare a true sense of his Wisdom, Goodnesse, Greatnesse, and Absolute Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignity; and that we think him worthy of all Honour, Love, and Service. GOD is not truly honoured, when we make not an Oblation of the best things to him; for he who <hi>is Authour of all</hi> should be <hi>served with he best,</hi> or else he is badly requited: And
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:55045:170"/>
consequently he is never truely Honoured or Worshipped but when we make an <hi>obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our whole selves</hi> to him. <hi>I beseech you therefore Brethren,</hi> saith <hi>St. Paul, by the mereies of GOD, that ye present your Bodies a living Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, holy, acceptable to GOD, which is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

What GOD hath given to Man for his use he himself needs not; and besides the whole World is his, and the fulness thereof: he needs not a Temple, who hath the World for his dwelling place nor an Image, or Statue who is</hi>

This is a true Sacrifice, when the Soul offereth it self unto GOD: For what signifieth other Sacrifices? What doth inccnse, what do Garments, and Gold, and Silver and Precious stones profit, if the Worshippers mind be not holy and pure? 'Tis only Righteousness which GOD seeks after, 'Tis in this that the</hi> True Worship <hi>of GOD doth consist.

But though 'twas not lawfull to offer Sacrifice except in that one place, yet there was every where besides both in Towns and Villages, in the Cities and open Fields, <hi>Synagogues,</hi> and <hi>Oratories,</hi> where people came to <hi>Pray to GOD</hi>

                        </gap>t a part Places and Houses for the <hi>Worship</hi> and <hi>Service of GOD:</hi> 'tis well conjectured by the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> from <hi>Iosh:</hi> 22. 16. that these Lands and Countries were reputed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, where there was no such Consecrate or Devoted Places.</p>
                     <p>Now whither Men had an expresse Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Precept, for the erecting houses to GOD, and consecrating such places to him, or if they were meerly prompted thereto by the

                        <hi>light of Nature,</hi> and the Stength of Reason, it doeth not very clearly appear. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is certain, that GOD did very much approve therereof; not only by allowing his most eminent Servants to continue in the use and practice of this thing: but also by requiring it of them. Thus GOD was so well pleased with <hi>Noahs building him an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> that 'tis said <hi>he smelled a sweet savour therefrom; Gen.</hi> 8. 21. and 35. 1. we have God putting <hi>Iacob</hi> in mind of the <hi>Vow</hi> which he here made, and requiring him to make performance thereof in this very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. When it first came into <hi>Davids</hi> Heart to build an house unto the LORD, the motion did so please GOD, that he sent <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet to tell him, <hi>that for this he would make a sure covenant with him, and establish the Crown and Throne upon him, and his house for ever; though for reasons he would not let him build the house, but deferred it to his Son So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam:</hi> 7. And we must not look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Temples,</hi> as a <hi>Legall Ceremonie</hi> agreeable on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Times of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or necessary now: for though <hi>GOD dwelleth not in Temples made with mens hands,</hi> and that his Worship is not fixed to one particular place, as 'twas of old, yet it's no lesse necessary now then formerly, to
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:55045:174"/>
                        <hi>set a part Places and to consecrate Houses for the publick worship of GOD,</hi> that hereby he may be the more solemnly acknowledg'd, &amp; that his Worship may be gone about with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Decency, Gravity, and Conveniency.</p>
                     <p>These were the <hi>Reasons,</hi> no doubt which moved Men to this Act first, and their Strength and Force is as great now, and as binding as ever. Wherefore the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and <hi>first Christians,</hi> even such as was most zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous against <hi>Iudaisme,</hi> did not think the use of Temples to be abolished by the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Law:</hi> but did continue the use of them, and were carefull to consecrate and set apart <hi>Churches</hi> where ever they made converts and did propagate the Gospel. For though the ontward state of <hi>Christians</hi> was then but mean and though they were also lyable to many persecutions, yet they wanted not Houses for that Worship and service of God which was peculiar to the Gospel. This the Learned Man formerly mentioned, hath made very evident; and it appears clearly from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 22. and from these salutations to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Churches</hi> of such and such a house.</p>
                     <p>At first <hi>Temples</hi> and <hi>Religious Places</hi> were but mean, plain, and simple, without any great ornament: what the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> used seems to have been no other then open un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:55045:175"/>
places, set about with trees or Stones agreeable to their own way of living, which was not constant or settled in any one place; for they dwelt in tents only and removed from place to place. There be some remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of such kind of simple <hi>Oratories,</hi> yet to be seen in many places of this Kingdome. But as People became more fixt and settled, and as they farther improved in art and cunning, so they used to take greater pains in adorning their temples and religious hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: and judg'd it to be their glory, to have them Stately and magnificent. <hi>David</hi> was ashamed that he himself should dwell in a house of <hi>Cedar,</hi> while the <hi>Ark</hi> of the LORD was only within <hi>Curtains.</hi> And GOD com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by the Prophet <hi>Haggai,</hi> that the <hi>People</hi> who returned from the <hi>Captivity,</hi> should have dwelt in <hi>Cieled Houses</hi> themselves while the Temple of the Lord lay wast and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired. The <hi>Churches</hi> of the first <hi>Christians</hi> 'tis like indeed were not very fine, nor could much better be expected from them, if we consider the meannesse and poverty of their State, and what hazards they run by offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to meet together at all. They were then necessitate to content themselves with any place, though it had not the conveniency and adornments which they wished: but so
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:55045:175"/>
soon as the Emperours turned Christians, and that the publick exercise of the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> was allowed, then <hi>Churches</hi> were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where built Stately and magnificent. They did not then proceed by the scant rule of meer necessity, but rendred them not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convenient for themselves: but such as might speak out the greatnesse and glory of that God whom they adored. And though it cannot be denyed but that there may be an excesse in adorning Churches, when more is bestowed on them then on the poor which are GOD'S living Temples; yet certainly to have no regard of them, and to grudge any cost upon them, is an other extreme much more to be condemned; seing GOD hath been so bountiful to us, and to enrich this World for our use not only with necessaries, but with comforts, and to make it not only convenient, but also very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, pleasant and delightful: therefore I think gratitude should oblidge us, to make an acknowledgement hereof, by adorning his temples, and taking care that these places of his <hi>special presence,</hi> have all the ornament and comlinesse, which our State and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try will allow. Sure by all the rules of the World, it cannot be judged otherwayes then a contempt of GOD, or at the lest
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:55045:176"/>
small esteem of him, when his houses are the worst of the Land, as is usually to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served throughout this <hi>Kingdom:</hi> nay in many places are to be seen <hi>Stables</hi> and <hi>Byers</hi> much more neat and handsome then the <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> beside them, which certainly is a most shamefull thing, and cannot but expose us to the contempt of all strangers. What a shame? and how unworthy a thing is it to be more curious about the apartment of our beasts, then the house of our GOD? GOD ordered his Son to be born in a Stable and in a Manger, to teach us humility and to be content with a mean State, but not to make us humble him thereafter by lodging him no better then our beasts. <hi>I</hi> am sory it should be said, because 'tis our shame, but it is true that we have many Churches, which look rather like barns byres and stables, and would be as proper for that use, then what they are design'd for. God did expresly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite under the law, the dedicating the worst things unto him, and I cannot understand what precept or example can be pretended forwarranding this under the <hi>Gospel:</hi> I would think <hi>Nature</hi> as well as <hi>Religion</hi> doth teach the contrary. GOD and Kings should be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes honoured with what is best, and there is reason that the <hi>Courts</hi> of both be beautified
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55045:176"/>
and Adorned with State and Splendour, that thereby that Reverence and Respect which is due from all who approach them, may be engendered, nourished &amp; increased. But by <hi>Adorning of Churches,</hi> I doe not mean what is in use in the <hi>Romish Church, viz.</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, Lamps, Puppets, rare and various Curiosities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are of no use in the <hi>Service of God,</hi> and do but divert the minds of those who come up to Worship; gaudy shews are not <hi>the true ornament of Churches</hi> but what makes them Grave, August, and Venerable. And therefore the same Rules are to be observed in building of Churches, which Wise and Discreet Persons follow in their Cloaths, who seek out what is Decent and Useful, and are careful to shun both what is nesty and course, and also, what is Gaudy and Vain; because the one speaks out <hi>a mean sordide Spirit,</hi> and the other too <hi>much lightness and childishness.</hi>

He there alludes to the common Custome of <hi>pulling off the shoes in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of respect and reverence,</hi> And though that particular Act be now out-dated and worn out of fashion, yet still 'tis necessary to carry reverently towards them; For GOD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self commands it, saying, <hi>ye shall reverence my Sanctuary,</hi> and the reason he gives is, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I am the LORD; Lev.</hi> 19. 30. Now this Reverence to the <hi>House of GOD,</hi> was no <hi>Temporal Ceremonie</hi> peculiar to the <hi>time of the Law:</hi> but even a <hi>Moral Duty,</hi> to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as long as it is necessary to keep up the use of <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>consecrated Places,</hi> which will be ever necessary in this World; as doth appear from our Saviour's Zeal, <hi>in scourging out of the Temple,</hi> such as have profaned it, <hi>by buying or selling therein.</hi> And the <hi>Apostle S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           </gap>. Paul</hi> inveighs against the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for that abuse which crept in amongst them in the <hi>Celebration of the Lords Supper, whereby in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

                        <hi>every one, did take before another, and one was hungry and another drunken:</hi> because as he tells them 'twas not only contrary to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Purport of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> but also a contempt of the house of GOD, and a want of reverence towards it. <hi>What,</hi> saith he, <hi>have ye not houses to eat or drink in? Or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise ye the Church of GOD;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 22. And when the same Apostle urgeth the not <hi>defil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Body,</hi> because it is the <hi>Temple of GOD;</hi> it is evident that he takes it as a certain and undoubted Truth, that what is the <hi>Temple of GOD</hi> should not be prophaned, or else his Argument would not be good or valid. Through all the World it is a custome to respect the Presence Chamber of Kings, and such places wherein they use to appear in Majesty and State, and to behave Reverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards them, even when they are not Personally present: And how much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Reason is there to pay the like Respect and Reverence to the <hi>House of GOD,</hi> and those Places where he uses to meet and bless his People, and where he is alwayes special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly present, by the Attendance of his <hi>Angels and Ministring Spirits?</hi> For that Churches are thus Honoured with the <hi>special Presence of GOD,</hi> seems to be very evident from the <hi>Scripture,</hi> both of the <hi>Old and New Testament.</hi>
                        <pb n="344" facs="tcp:55045:178"/>
GOD indeed is not in <hi>Temples</hi> so as to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in them; we must not think that his <hi>Essence</hi> can be shut up any where, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this 'tis true, <hi>that He dwelleth not in Temples made with Mens hands;</hi> Nay, <hi>the very Heaven of Heavens do not contain Him:</hi> But how ever it is certain that He is and may be said to be more <hi>present in his Temples and Churches,</hi> then in other places.</p>
                     <p>When GOD is said thus to be more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in one place then another, it is either when there are some more visible Effects of His Presence by the conferring of special Blessings; or when his <hi>Heavenly Host</hi> is there: for so <hi>Iacoh</hi> here declared <hi>GOD to be in this place,</hi> because he saw the <hi>Angels of GOD a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending and descending.</hi> Now that GOD is present in his <hi>Churches,</hi> the first way appears from <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 24. Where GOD saith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, <hi>in all places where I record my Name, I will come unto thee, and I will blesse thee,</hi> upon which account the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> was called <hi>the Tabernacle of the Congregation or meeting,</hi> not of Mens meeting, but of GOD'S meeting with Men. The like Promise our <hi>LORD</hi> gives us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 20. Where he saith <hi>where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the midst of them.</hi> And that he is also present the other way, <hi>viz.</hi> by the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:55045:178"/>
of his <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Heavenly Host,</hi> was not only the constant Opinion of the <hi>Iews,</hi> concerning their <hi>Temple;</hi> but is also express<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed plainly by <hi>Solomon, Eccl.</hi> 5. 6. When he sayes concerning our behaviour in the <hi>House of GOD, Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin, neither say thou before the Angels that it was an errour.</hi> And in like manner, St. <hi>Paul</hi> pleads against the <hi>undecency of Womens being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in the Church, because of the presence of Angels: for this cause, saith he, ought the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to have power over her head, because of the Angels;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 10. Christ telleth us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 21 <hi>That God dwelleth in his Temple,</hi> and how can he be said to do it more there then else where, but this way.</p>
                     <p>Now that we may make what hath been said usefull to direct our practice, we will proceed to draw some inferences. And first it teacheth us, that it is the duty of all those who would <hi>Worship GOD</hi> aright and who would manifest themselves to be his <hi>Devoted Servants,</hi> to take care to consecrate places for his Service, and to erect <hi>Churches for his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> where there are none; and to contribute chearfully to the maintaining and keeping them up where they are: for the Honour and Glory of God requires it, and <hi>Nature</hi> as well as <hi>Scripture</hi> teacheth this to be a <hi>proper</hi>
                        <pb n="346" facs="tcp:55045:179"/>
                        <hi>Act</hi> of Homage and acknowledgement due to GOD. It is the Duty of all who own and believe in him, to meet frequently toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Worship Him,</hi> and that Worship which is due unto him, can never be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performed, with <hi>requisite solemnity</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,</hi> unlesse there be particular places <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate</hi> for it. And if there be no care taken, what sort of places these are, if they be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to be Mean, Nasty, Sordide, and Sloven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it will very much lessen <hi>Peoples</hi> esteem for GOD and his Service: for whilst Men are in this World, they will be still creatures of Sense, and their Apprehension of things will be alwayes according to the <hi>outward im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression</hi> they make upon their Senses. How comes it that the <hi>meanner sort</hi> especially, are lesse awed in the <hi>Church,</hi> then when they are in the houses of Lords and Gentlemen? but because in these they see something of Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, but in the other nothing finer then what they have at home in their own silly Cottages.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> what <hi>Iacob Vowed</hi> and <hi>resolved on</hi> here, may be a fit Patern and Precedent to all the great Ones of the World, whose Quality and Condition makes it requisite for them to have great and Magnificent dwellings: <hi>viz.</hi> That they allow some
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:55045:179"/>
particular room in these their Dwellings, and Palaces, for a private Chappel and <hi>House of GOD,</hi> wherein they and their Family may dayly meet together to <hi>Worship Him.</hi> If they do not think their houses and dwellings convenient or answerable to their Grandeur unlesse there be in them several Apartments for severall Offices; me thinks also they should judge them defective, if they cannot allow one spare Room to be reserved for GOD and his dayly service. We would not have any believe us so <hi>Superstitious,</hi> as to think no <hi>Prayers acceptable,</hi> but such as are made in the <hi>House of GOD</hi> or consecrated Places; for without doubt, God will hear all who call upon him in <hi>sincerity &amp; truth,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they are: but yet there is great conveni ency &amp; decency, in appropriating one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular place for the performance both of our <hi>private and more Solemn Devotions</hi> with the rest of the Family; for then we are not so lyable to disturbance and distractions: &amp; therefore if our state &amp; condition allow it, it were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable to set apart some particular room of our house for this end only. It is not to be expected that the generality can win to to this, yet those of the best Quality I think may, and if they may, they ought too: &amp; if they would thus give GOD an Interest in
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:55045:180"/>
their Houses and dwelling Places, we may very confidently say 'twould be their best security, <hi>Except the Lord keep the house, they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in vain that keep it;</hi> and he would not fail to preserve and maintain that House and Family where he is so highly Honoured and devotely served. But alas this is little looked to now a dayes! There be very few who regard much the <hi>interessing God in their houses,</hi> by the <hi>consecrating</hi> them or any part of them to him; and which is farr worse, who take any care to have <hi>Him Worshipped</hi> in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies either inseparate or comon Rooms. This part of <hi>Religion</hi> is but little in request amongst the <hi>Grandees</hi> of the World, it is laid aside as an Antick and unfashionable thing: and as their practice in other things is too ordinarly a Law unto the inferiour Sort of People, so 'tis very much to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grated that it is so here. How seriously the <hi>Heads</hi> of Families <hi>Worship GOD</hi> in their <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets,</hi> we do not, and we cannot know; but 'tis too apparent, that there is but little care taken to have him Worshipped decently by all the Family together; nay, this is now scarce lookt upon by any as their Duty; <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi> thought it incumbent upon him, when he said, <hi>as for me and my house we will serve the LORD;</hi> as if he had said, <hi>not I in my single</hi>
                        <pb n="349" facs="tcp:55045:180"/>
                        <hi>capacity, but I also with my whole Family; and not I only by my self alone in private, but I also with all my House;</hi> we shall be carefull to <hi>serve Him</hi> and Devotely to <hi>call upon Him:</hi> which certainly every one whose heart is sincere with GOD will endeavour to imitate. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Worship</hi> becomes now the more necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that there is no <hi>publick Worship Evening and Morning</hi> in our <hi>Churches;</hi> if this were, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Families should with their Families attend it, and so the want of the other might be much excused: but seing we are not so happy as to have a <hi>dayly publick worship,</hi> every Family should serve God apart. And though as we have said, there be some reason for <hi>set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting apart particular Rooms,</hi> for the exercise of <hi>Family Worship,</hi> by such as can do it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently; yet the want of such conveniency; needs neither be a hinderance to this necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>serving of GOD,</hi> nor will it excuse the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect thereof. When we cannot serve God as we would, we ought to do it as we may, when we honour him as far as we are able, he will not impute the want of what is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our reach as a sin to us. Though there be no Room nor apartment in our house, but what of necessity must be put to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon use; yet let us not neglect to offer unto
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:55045:181"/>
GOD Evening and Morning the Sacrifices of Prayer and Thanksgiving, and they shall certainly find acceptance in his Sight. By doing this our House and Family shall be a <hi>little Sanctuary</hi> unto GOD, who will graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onsly vouchsafe to dwell in them, and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish with us his <hi>Comfortable Presence,</hi> which should afford us greater Peace and quiet and Satisfaction, and should prevent those Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Tarres and Disorders, which fall out too commonly amongst those of the same Family. If GOD were much among them, these things would not be; and he is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, because his Name is not <hi>called upon,</hi> nor his <hi>Worship observed</hi> by them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> we may see by what hath been said, how much it is our Duty to frequent <hi>the House of of GOD;</hi> for as it is <hi>Religion</hi> to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect <hi>Churches and Temples,</hi> so 'tis with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to use them, and to come up unto them <hi>to call upon GOD,</hi> and to hear what he will say to us. When <hi>Iacob</hi> resolved to <hi>build GOD an House,</hi> he did not mean to shut the door thereof, and to be a Stranger thereunto; but to visit it often that he might have <hi>Opportunity of meeting and conversing with His GOD.</hi> If civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and kindnesse draw us to the House of our Neighbour; and if such as are about <hi>Kings Courts,</hi> be oblidg'd to come and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:55045:181"/>
the <hi>King's person</hi> at those hours when the Court opens up, or that he presents himself; sure we should think our selves much more oblidg'd to come up to the <hi>House of GOD,</hi> and to wait upon him at these times and hours which he hath appointed for meeting with us. What a Honour and happinesse is it to have the freedom to stand in <hi>his presence,</hi> and the Liberty to speak unto Him? <hi>The Psalmist,</hi> it seems, thought it a great hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse when he cryed out, <hi>Blessed is the Man whom thou choosest, O LORD, and causest to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto Thee, that he may dwell in thy Courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodnesse of thy house, even of thy holy Temple. Ps.</hi> 65. 4. And again, <hi>How amiable are thy Tabernacles, O Lord of Hosts, My soul longeth, yea fainteth for the Courts of the LORD. Blessed are they that dwell in thy House, they will be still praising thee. Ps.</hi> 84. Hereby it appears that he looked upon the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levits</hi> as very happy, whose Office ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidg'd them to a <hi>continuall attendance on GOD'S House;</hi> their Lot he thought was worthy of his ambition: for though he was a <hi>King,</hi> and upon that account might have commanded the Chiefest Pleasures and Delights of the Sons of Men, yet he undervalued them all in comparison of the Priviledge of being in <hi>GOD'S House. A day in thy Courts,</hi> saith he,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:55045:182"/>
                        <hi>is better then a thousand; I had rather be a door keeper in the house of my GOD, then to dwell in tents of Wickedness.</hi> This favour he sought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things, and preferred before all things, as he plainly tells us, <hi>Ps.</hi> 27. 4. where he saith, <hi>One having have I desired of the LORD, that will</hi> I <hi>seek after, that I may dwell in the house of the LORD, all the dayes of my life, to behold the Beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his Temple.</hi> And certainly whosoever comes up to the <hi>House of GOD,</hi> with a sincere Love to and desire after Him, shall receive much Comfort and Good thereby. It is not an Honour only, but an advantage also to be in <hi>GOD'S presence:</hi> for he still leaves a Blessing behind him and hath expresly promised to meet with us in <hi>His House to blesse us, as you have it, Exod.</hi> 20. 24. In token hereof the <hi>Ministers of GOD</hi> are appointed <hi>to blesse in His Name,</hi> as appeared from <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 8. which in all Reason must be extended to <hi>Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Ministers,</hi> seing GOD'S Goodnesse is not narrower, but larger then it was of old, We are not then to look upon <hi>Pastoral Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,</hi> especially in the solemn assemblies, only as intimations of their own good wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; but as <hi>Authoritative declarations</hi> of the Good will of GOD, which are effectuall upon such as are worthy; See <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 13.
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:55045:182"/>
                        <hi>Let none therefore withdraw from the House of GOD,</hi> but let all accept of all Occasions of coming up thereto; as <hi>David</hi> who tells us, <hi>I was glad when they said unto me, let us go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the House of the LORD. Ps.</hi> 122. 1. For our coming shall not be in vain, GOD will not suffer such as sincerely seek him to return without profite. <hi>I said not to any of the seed of Iacob seek ye Me in vain. Isa.</hi> 45. 19. They speak Ignorantly and unadvisedly, who say, they will not be the better by <hi>coming to the Church,</hi> and that they may profite themselves as well at home: For seing GOD hath promised to be there, such as are truly dispos'd and seek Him in sincerity, shall undoubtedly find Him; they shall feel the <hi>influences of His Spirit moving on their Hearts,</hi> and shall be made to taste and see his Goodness, that by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience as well as by Reason they may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand <hi>it is good for them to draw near to God.</hi> It is true God is not tyed to the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick meetings,</hi> but may &amp; will manifest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to his Servants also in other places; yet they are not likeliest to find him at home, who stay there out of a contempt of the <hi>Church,</hi> which is the place he himself hath appointed for a <hi>Solemn meeting</hi> with his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. We ought not to despise or neglect those <hi>means of Comfort and Happinesse</hi> which
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:55045:183"/>
GOD hath prescribed, but to use them Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and Thankfully; waiting humbly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Him, that in and by them he may blesse us. 'Tis a tempting of GOD, to expect or desire he should shew himself or conveigh his blessings by wayes extraordinary, while the ordinary means may be had. What is better then to <hi>find GOD?</hi> What is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireable then to receive <hi>Expressions of His fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour?</hi> And where shall we seek him? Or where may we with greater assurance expect these, then where he hath promised to be found, to wit, in <hi>His House and Ordinances?</hi> Let us then resort thither, and we shall find <hi>Him whom our Soul Loveth,</hi> who shall resolve our Doubts, and Advise us in the Way we should take; he shall ease our Hearts of our <hi>Secret Grief, comfort us</hi> against all our Troubles, and shall Refresh us with new Strength and vigour, to <hi>enable us to endure patiently to the End of our Race,</hi> that so we may <hi>obtain the Crown of life.</hi> I have known some (and I believe 'twill be found nothing extraordinary) who upon their coming to <hi>Church,</hi> have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Resolution of their <hi>Particular Doubts,</hi> Comfort for their <hi>Particular Troubles,</hi> and who when they little expected it have had their present Case touched as if the <hi>Preacher</hi> had mainly aimed at them, when yet he
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:55045:183"/>
neither knew them, norintended them. Weak <hi>Preachers</hi> will drop now and then good and usefull <hi>Speeches,</hi> and though their Discourse in the grosse be not Learned nor Eloquent, yet sometimes they let fall short sentences which may be, and often prove more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial then more fine and Elaborat Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. I have known Digressions in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, what is usually termed a running from the Text, more pertinent to some of the <hi>Hearers,</hi> then if the <hi>Minister</hi> had kept more close to his Subject, because they were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by struck home, and hit upon some Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of their Condition which concerned them to understand, and to be rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of. If then Men would but lay aside their <hi>prejudices,</hi> put themselves in a <hi>Sutable Disposition,</hi> and listen attentively, they might and without doubt should be Edified and Bettered by <hi>coming to Church.</hi> The appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended weakness of him who is to Offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, ought to be no discouragement, for GOD often useth <hi>weak and mean things</hi> to effectuat <hi>great Matters,</hi> &amp; by what we account the <hi>foolishnesse of preaching, he doth save those that believe.</hi> Though there were no Sermon, 'twould be our Duty nevertheless to <hi>come up to Church,</hi> that thereby we may testify our homage to GOD and acknowledgment
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:55045:184"/>
of him: but however for our Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if we be sincerely desirous <hi>to hear what GOD the LORD will speak, he will speak good one way or other.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the last place, when we come <hi>up to the House of GOD,</hi> we ought to be carefull to lay aside every thing which may offend, and be unbecoming <hi>so Divine and holy a Presence:</hi> while we are there, we should behave our selves <hi>decently and reverently;</hi> for if the presence of <hi>Kings</hi> over-awe us, how much more should the <hi>presence of GOD</hi> and <hi>Angels?</hi> If it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper and most unseemly to appear any ways light frothy &amp; impertinent before <hi>Kings,</hi> especially when they are sitting in <hi>Majesty,</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> it is sure much more unworthy to be guilty of Indiscretion in the <hi>House of GOD,</hi> which is the <hi>Place where God is alwayes present,</hi> and that <hi>in Majesty</hi> and <hi>State</hi> too by the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Ministring Spirits.</hi> It were far better not to approach the <hi>House of GOD,</hi> then not to be reverent when we are in it: he who stayes away is but guilty of neglect, which though it be a great sin, yet 'tis not so great as insolency &amp; a downright affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of GOD, which he is guilty of who laugheth, Sporteth, talketh idlely, or any ways playeth the Fool within the <hi>Church,</hi> or sleepeth and snorteth away the time
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:55045:184"/>
therein to the Scandal and disturbance of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; or who abstracts his mind from the <hi>Service of GOD,</hi> and imployes his thoughts in Worldly Matters. Such behaviour, and irreverent Carriage cannot but highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock God, and obstruct our own Good and Benefite. If we do not meet with GOD when we <hi>come to Church</hi> if he do not blesse us, if we find our selves no whit bettered, the reason must be our Irreverent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemly Behaviour, or some indisposition in our selves, for GOD is <hi>alwayes ready and will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to manifest Himself.</hi> Wherefore if we would <hi>see the Beauty of the Lord in his Temple;</hi> or if we would <hi>taste the goodness of his house;</hi> we must guard against those things which may <hi>provock him to withdraw himself from us.</hi> And must labour so to please him by a Humble, Devout and Reverent Behaviour, as that he may condescend to <hi>come and manifest himself to our souls for our edification and comfort.</hi> And to what purpose is it <hi>to come,</hi> if you be not resolved to do Reverence to <hi>GOD by coming?</hi> what a dishonour is done to the <hi>House of GOD?</hi> When you only come up unto it, because you know not otherwise how to spend the Time, or when you make it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a place for meeting with your neighbours where you talke about Newes and other
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:55045:185"/>
Worldly Affairs, and where you may be informed what Garb and Dresse is most in Fashion, or where you may Sleep and take your rest, or where without Disturbance you may ruminate on your Business and projects. as St. <hi>Paul</hi> said to the <hi>Corinthians, have ye not houses to eat and drink in,</hi> so I say, have ye not other places to do these things in? <hi>Or do ye indeed despise the Church of GOD,</hi>

                     <p>HAving had occasion to treat of <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> or Sacred places, I judge it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to subjoine some short dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course on Prayer, seing that <hi>this</hi> is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry use, &amp; end of these: For upon this account the <hi>Church</hi> in Scripture is called <hi>the House of Prayer.</hi> The very design of consecrate hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es or Places, is that Men may have in them conveniency for Prayer; &amp; thither men were wont to come, not only to joyne in the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worship,</hi> but also for the performance of their private Devotions. But because our Lord perceived that the resorting to such publick Places, so often as we need to pray, might Minister to pride and vanity, which spoile the odour of our Prayers, and hinder their acceptance with GOD; therefore he hath advised us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. to choose out the
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:55045:186"/>
most secret and retired Places, for our Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Prayers and addresses to GOD: and though the place we pray in, have not the Honour to be appropriate to GOD, yet our Prayers shall find acceptance, if they be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and rightly qualified. Prayer doth in some sense sanctify the place, but the place can add no weight or worth to our Prayers. It may be more convenient for us to pray in one place more then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but our Prayers will not be more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to GOD upon the account of the place they are said in. GOD is every where, and we may freely addresse our selves to him any where, and where ever Men lift up holy hands in Prayer without wrath or doubting they shall be heard. If Churches be imployed to any other use then prayer, and religious services, they are profaned. See <hi>Mark</hi> 11. 15. but it is not necessary, nor expedient to goe to <hi>Church</hi> each time we pray to GOD. The <hi>Church</hi> should be reserved for <hi>Publick Worship</hi> chiefly, but as for what we do apart by our selves, we ought to seek out Places of the greatest privacy to do it in, and as I said in the former section, if our State would suffer it, 'twould be very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and convenient to set apart one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Room of our House for this end, that
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:55045:186"/>
we may perform our Devotions with the greater freedom, and be less lyable to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance, and those interruptions which persons usually meet with who want this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency.</p>
                     <p>But to leave the circumstance of the place, and to come to the thing it self. Prayer is a speciall part of <hi>Divine Worship,</hi> enjoined by clear precepts, recommeded by the example of all holy Men, and so necessary that who prayeth not at all or but seldome, cannot be said to <hi>Worship GOD,</hi> whatever el<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Our obligation to Prayer ariseth not from one, but from all the <hi>Divine Attributes;</hi> and by Prayer there is an acknowledgement of all of them: He who prayeth declareth <hi>GOD'S Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, His Omniscience, His Omnipotence</hi> and <hi>All sufficiency, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.</hi> But who neglecteth Prayer doth not believe these <hi>Divine Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> or doth not seriously consider them; he maketh no actuall acknowledgment of them, nay he lives in open defiance of them, and arrogates to himself an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and self-sufficiency, which are GOD'S prerogative.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="362" facs="tcp:55045:187"/>Again there can be no Intercourse with GOD, but by the means of Prayer. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Prayer we can never arrive at he end of Religion, <hi>viz. Union with GOD,</hi> and participation of the <hi>Divine Nature.</hi> He who is not exercised in Prayer hath his Heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienat from GOD, and is wholly indisposed for receiving the Spirit of GOD, and the impression thereof, without which there is no advancing towards perfection Prayer is by some compared to <hi>Breathing,</hi> and not unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for what <hi>that is</hi> to the Body, Prayer is to the Soul; respiration is no more necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our NaturallLi'e, then Prayer to the Spirituall Life, for hereby it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>But to make Prayer acceptable to GOD, and thus profitable to our selves, it must be rightly performed and duely qualified. true Prayer is alwayes acceptable as incense, and never failes to bring down a Blessing; but many deceive themselves with a meer shew, they are contented that they seem to <hi>Pray,</hi> but do not <hi>Pray</hi> really: some Pray much, but yet are never a whit nearer GOD, nor move more forward in Holinesse, which is both the undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sign, and the certain Effect of <hi>true Prayer.</hi> We ought then not only to Pray, but to pray aright, else all the Labour we bestow this way is in vain. <hi>Ye ask,</hi> saith St. <hi>Iames, and ye have not,</hi> why? <hi>because ye ask amiss.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now that our Prayers may be proper Prayers and effectuall; <hi>first,</hi> We must take heed that they be the <hi>Work of the Spirit,</hi> and not the <hi>Labour of the Lips: For GOD is a Spirit, and will be Worshipped in Spirit and Truth,</hi> That is, by free and proper Acts of the Mind and not by empty shews which have no Solidity or Reality in them. If our Hearts be removed, he cares not for our drawing near with our mouth, or the

Our Prayers are but bruitish gru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, if they come not from the Heart and be not performed by the understanding. Wherefore when we are to Pray, we should first fix our Spirits, and compose our Minds to a serious Attention, and should endeavonr to wind up our Souls to that fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and earnestness which is Sutable to the weight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and importance of Prayers: And to this purpose, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> will be necessary to bestow some time in <hi>Meditation,</hi> and <hi>Reading of the Seriptures,</hi> or <hi>some other devout book.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having thus reduced our Minds to a due Attention, and secured as much as possible a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst wandering thoughts; in the next place we must consider the <hi>several parts of Prayers,</hi>
                        <pb n="365" facs="tcp:55045:188"/>
the Nature and Property of each, and the Affections sutable thereto, and frame our Prayers accordingly: For they cannot be acceptable if lame and defective, nor though they have all necessary parts, if each part be not rightly Adjusted and Properly qualified. To clear this better, we will touch a little on them;</p>
                     <p>The first part of Prayer is <hi>Adoration</hi> and <hi>Invocation.</hi> This we should alwayes begin with, for as in our addresses to Kings and great Personages, we use first to do them reverence, and to testify their dignity before we present our requests: So in our addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to GOD, we should first adore his <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty</hi> and invocate his Audience. Now the right way to do this, is not to be accoast him with a heap of bigge tittles; but to call to mind his <hi>incomprehensible Nature, and Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perfections,</hi> visible in his <hi>manifold Works.</hi> And if our apprehensions of GOD be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of him, we will be abashed at our selves as unfit for so great a presence, and most unworthy to be regarded by one so highly exalted above all our thoughts: To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse which and to cherish it too, 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to throw our selves in some humble posture. Thus the <hi>Publican</hi> to signify his own vileness, and <hi>GODS greatness,</hi> he <hi>stood</hi>
                        <pb n="366" facs="tcp:55045:189"/>
                        <hi>a far off, and would not lift up his eyes, as one ashamed of himself.</hi> But lest the reflecting u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon <hi>GODS Majesty</hi> and <hi>Greatness,</hi> should take away the hopes of Acceptance, and rather fill us with dread then confidence in him; we must remember his Goodness, his Love, his Mercy, and how that he is reconciled to us in his <hi>Son IESUS CHRIST.</hi> Therefore our <hi>Saviour</hi> hath taught us to <hi>draw near to GOD</hi> as in a sense of his <hi>Ineffable Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tness</hi> whose throne is in the Heavens, so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of a Father who is alwayes ready and easie to be entreated: <hi>When ye pray,</hi> saith he, <hi>say Our Father which art in Heaven; &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Confession</hi> is another part of Prayer. This must by no means be omitted, GOD re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it; the rules of Justice and Equitie make it necessary, and there is no Remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without it; he who confesseth hath the promise of pardon, <hi>but who covereth his Sins shall not prosper.</hi> To perfom this aright we must consider both our Generall and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular State, and make an acknowledgement of them: In the Generall we ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge what is common to us with all others, that we are of a <hi>rebellious Race, miserably corrupted, and prone to all evil;</hi> but we must not rest here, but must subjoine also a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi>
                        <pb n="367" facs="tcp:55045:189"/>
                        <hi>of our own particular faults, all our sinful inclinations and actual transgressions,</hi> with their Aggravating Circumstances: for which purpose we ought to <hi>search our hearts,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine our Disp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>sitions, and to take account of our Lives. But if we make only a <hi>simple Confession,</hi> it will avail us little; we must not confess our sins to GOD, as usual People do the offences they give one another, or some great Man, which they do clearly out of Complement, or out of Constraint to shun some present inconveniency, without any dere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ation of the thing: But as we must be ingenuous in <hi>confessing our Sins,</hi> so we ought to confesse them with sorrow and contrition. <hi>Confession is a meer mockery, if it proceed not from an abhorrency at Sin;</hi> and be not atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with indignation at our selves, and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with unfeinged purposes to abandon Sin, and guard against it: wherefore when we confesse, 'twill be necessary to consider how every sinful act is a complex of Injustice, Ungratitude, Arrogancy, madness and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that sin is most loathsome in its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and most mischeivous in its Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. But because GOD requires us not to remember and confesse our Sins, that we may be filled with despair: But to stirr up in us desires of Mercy, and to prepare us
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:55045:190"/>
for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So having humbled our Souls with the sight of our sins, and wrought our selves to an earnest Desire of being delivered from the stain and Guilt of them, we should next support our selves with the comfortable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of <hi>GODS infinite Mercy,</hi> how that he is most ready and willing to forgive, and how that to make way for his Mercy to Sinners, he hath sent his own Son to satisfy for our sins, and to repair his Honour which by our sins is affronted and baffled; we should consider that <hi>IESUS CHRIST</hi> is the <hi>True Sacrifice and Propitiation for sin,</hi> which by Faith we should offer up to GOD and thereupon both ask forgivenesse and confidently hope for it.</p>
                     <p>A third part of Prayer is <hi>Petition</hi> or a humble Representation of our Desires to GOD; which he calls for, to teach us our Dependance on him, that <hi>'tis in him we live, move, and have our being,</hi> and that we may acknowledge Him the Authour and Giver of all good. To the right performance of this part, we must first have a sense of our own indigency, and a strong Faith in Gods Power and Goodness, in his Power that he is able, and in his goodnesse that he is willing to give us what we aske: For 'tis a vain thing to ask of another what we think we
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:55045:190"/>
need not, or what we may get without him; and 'tis no less vain to address our selves to one in whom we have no Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, whose Power or Goodness we very much doubt. Now to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perswade us of GODS Power and Goodness, and of our own Misery and Poverty, we need but to read the <hi>Scripture,</hi> call to mind the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Works of GOD,</hi> and take an impartial view of our selves. <hi>Secondly,</hi> we ought to look to the Aime and Reason of our Desires that we have a right end before us; for if we have an evil intention, our Desires are sinful and unworthy to be presented to GOD, who is <hi>most Iust and Holy,</hi> and who cannot be perverted from what is right<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Our Desires therefore must not <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate</hi> in our selves, we must not intend our own Honour, Glory, Pleasure, &amp;c: in this World; that must be the cheif end of our Desires and Petitions, which is the last end of our Life and Beeing, viz. GOD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and his Glory. This our <hi>Saviour</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us in that <hi>short Prayer</hi> he prescribed; for there we are commanded in the first place to Pray that <hi>GODS name be hallowed, that his Kingdom may come;</hi> But this doth not debarr us from respecting our own <hi>Eternal Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity,</hi> for the Glory of GOD, which we
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:55045:191"/>
should seek includes that; in seeking the Glory of GOD, we seek our own <hi>Eternal interest,</hi> and we cannot aime at Heaven with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out aiming at the <hi>Glory of GOD:</hi> these two are inseparable. <hi>3ly.</hi> We ought carefully to consider the matter of our Requests, that in this also they be good and proper, that is, agreeable to the will of GOD; for it is not lawful for us to crave what he hath not approved. And therefore we must acquaint our selves well with the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> in which GOD hath revealed his Will, and thereby regulate all our Desires: what he hath allowed we may, what he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, we ought to ask; but what he hath forbidden we should pray against. From hence it follows. <hi>4ly.</hi> That we ought to pray with all earnestnesse for all <hi>Spiritual Blessings:</hi> but as for <hi>Temporal things,</hi> though we should Pray for them too, yet not <hi>Peremptorly,</hi> but with a <hi>Resignation</hi> to the wise Disposal of <hi>GOD'S Will:</hi> the Reason of this Difference is, because he hath absolutely approved of <hi>Spiritual Blessings,</hi> but hath declared other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise anent <hi>Temporal Benefits;</hi> and because he hath made it alwayes necessary for us to be Good, Holy, Chaste, Sober, Meek, &amp; <hi>c.</hi> But it is not always expedient for us to have health and outward Peace, Prosperity, and other
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:55045:191"/>
                        <hi>temporal good things,</hi> nor is it expedient for us to know when they are fit for us. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> and lastly, each time we pray, we should not only consider our <hi>general State</hi> as Men and <hi>Christians,</hi> and ask what is agreeable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: But also our <hi>particular Station,</hi> the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Body and Soul, the tentations we are in or lyable to; and in a word, all the Circumstances of our Affairs both <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Temporal,</hi> and lay them open before GOD, and frame Desires sutable to each of these things: as a Man goeth to his Friend with a thing which befalls him, and as the Sick and Infirm make the Physitian ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with all their Distempers, so we should never fail to impart our State and all our Concerns to GOD, and to ask the Direction and Assistance he knows we stand in need of: Which being done in Faith of his Power and Good-will, as was said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, cannot but be a great Ease and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to our Minds, because then we may have this <hi>confidence, that we shall have the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we desired of Him;</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 15. For as all things are possible to GOD, so all that is good and fit shall be done to them who believe in Him or rely upon Him; <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seod are they who believe, for there shall be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of these things which are told them of the LORD.</hi>

                        <hi>Intercession</hi> makes a <hi>fourth part of Prayer,</hi> this <hi>St. Paul</hi> enjoyns, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1. and it is insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Tenor of the <hi>LORD'S Prayer,</hi> for that being prescrib'd to be a Form of <hi>private Prayer,</hi> and yet runing all alongs in the <hi>plural number;</hi> it teacheth us that while we <hi>pray for our selves, we should also be careful to hold up the concerns of others.</hi> Selfishness is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the temper of the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> and it tenders our <hi>Prayers ineffectual;</hi> For GOD hears us and deals with us only according as we are disposed towards others, <hi>with what measure we mett it shall be measured to us.</hi> The <hi>Apostle</hi> requires expresly that our <hi>Prayers</hi> be <hi>without wrath,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 8. intimating thereby that <hi>where there is wrath, there is no acceptance;</hi> And according to the <hi>Christian Law,</hi> there is <hi>Wrath,</hi> where <hi>Kindness</hi> is not testified; he <hi>hates</hi> who does not <hi>love;</hi> he envies anothers Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, who does not heartily wish it: That therefore our <hi>Prayers</hi> may be <hi>effectual</hi> for our selves, we must present Supplications for others; that we may taste the <hi>goodness of GOD,</hi> let us not confine it to our selves, but heartily wish it extended to all the rest of the World. That <hi>GOD</hi> may be glorified in others as well as in us, thus it is our duty to <hi>pray for all Men,</hi> whom we must specify ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their various Conditions and
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:55045:192"/>
Necessities, because we cannot name every one in particular; but <hi>St. Paul</hi> bids us <hi>pray, especially for Kings, and those in Civil Authority,</hi> in the forecited place, <hi>and for our Spiritual Guides and Rulers,</hi> in several of his Epistles: both because they have much need to be <hi>prayed for,</hi> and also in that the <hi>good of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind</hi> much depends upon them. And as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth us to particularize those who are <hi>near</hi> or <hi>dear to us,</hi> so <hi>Religion</hi> requires us expresly to mention our Enemies: and if our hearts will not suffer us to do this, we need not pray at all, as our <hi>Saviour</hi> plainly intimats; <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 23. 6. 14.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>fifth Particular</hi> whereof Prayer should consist, is <hi>Praise</hi> or <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> this must be alwayes joyned to our <hi>Prayers</hi> according to the <hi>Apostles Precept, Col.</hi> 4. 2. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 18. Very Nature teacheth us to be thankful to our <hi>Benefactors,</hi> and to make an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Favours, so that an unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful person has been ever esteemed among Heathens most odious; what Obligations then are on us to give thanks to GOD, who is the <hi>great Benefactor,</hi> and who is even the <hi>Author of all the favours which others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer?</hi> And we are the more oblidged to make this hearty and thankful acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because tis all the <hi>requital</hi> he seeks, &amp; all
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:55045:193"/>
we can return for what he does to us: for we cannot be profitable to him again, as we may be to our <hi>fellow creatures,</hi> our requests &amp; the desires of our heart are intimat by <hi>thanksgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as much as by <hi>Formal Petitioning,</hi> as appears from <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 6. and moreover hereby, we in a manner lay obligations on GOD, both to continue the benefite, and also to <hi>grant us what else we aske:</hi> whereas by our unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, we provock GOD to withdraw his Blessing already bestowed, and to turn away from our Prayers; How unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable is it to desire or expect a kindness from him, to whom we have shewed our selves unthankfull, for what he hath already done? But because GOD measureth our Thankfulness not by our Words, but by the <hi>inward sentiments and affections of our hearts,</hi> therefore we should consider, <hi>First,</hi> the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those blessings which God bestows on us, how they are almost, nay altogether <hi>infinite,</hi> for who can reckon up all the <hi>Publick</hi> and <hi>Private,</hi> the <hi>Temporal</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings</hi> they enjoy, the Good they possess, and the Evils which they want? for as he gives the one, so he withholds the other. As the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaketh, <hi>Many, O LORD my GOD, are thy wonderful Works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts</hi>
                        <pb n="375" facs="tcp:55045:193"/>
                        <hi>which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee; if I would declare and speak of them, they are moe then can be numbred. Psal.</hi> 40. 5. <hi>2ly.</hi> The <hi>greatness of them,</hi> what matter of Content and Satisfaction they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, especially such as are Spiritual, for without them we should be <hi>Eternally miserable. 3ly. How freely they are bestowed,</hi> for they are all <hi>Acts of pure love in GOD,</hi> being given with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either merit on our part, or profite or gain to Himself. <hi>4ly. How undeservedly they are continued,</hi> we rebell against GOD, grieve his Spirit, and give him dayly manifold Provocations and yet he still loads us with his <hi>Benefits:</hi> if any Parent received but the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand part of these injuries from his only Son, He would certainly abandon him. By these considerations, we must labour to make our selves sensible of GOD'S Goodness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, and to estimate truly these expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions thereof we have received, that our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections towards him may be enflam'd, <hi>and that our Souls and all within us may be stirred up to bless and magnifie his holy Name.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These are the several parts of Prayer which if persons please they may rank other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, for 'tis not material what particular method be observed: but by this veiw we have given, it appears that Prayer is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:55045:194"/>
more then a bare repetition of Words; that to pray well and effectually, there is more time and greater deliberation requisite then People ordinarly imagine, or what I fear the most bestow. If we would have our Prayers avail or take effect, we must ply them seriously, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot some time for the right performance of them. And here none ought to pretend, <hi>that their business will not suffer this;</hi> for though upon some urgent Occasion or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>emergency,</hi> Men may be allowed to shift or abridge their Prayers: Yet it is not lawful for any to let the Ordinary or Daily Business of their Callings, so take them up as not take time to retire and pray in that manner we have shewed; for this were to prefer Earth to Heaven, the Body to the Soul, the cares of this Life to those things above; whereas our <hi>Saviour</hi> bids us seek first <hi>the kingdom of GOD, and his righteousness.</hi> The Servant that is most strictly kept, hath time allowed to <hi>eat, drink and sleep,</hi> &amp; the Man of the greatest business if he be Master of himself, will allow himself some leasure to talk with his Friends or Neighbours; and why also should not every one seek out some proper time for <hi>Praying to GOD.</hi> 'Tis true, People may lift up their Hearts to GOD while at work, and
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:55045:194"/>
indeed they ought to be ever darting up <hi>Pious Ejaculations,</hi> wherefore we are commanded <hi>to Pray alwayes,</hi> and herein also <hi>Prayer</hi> is like to <hi>Breathing,</hi> that it ought to be continual and joined to all other <hi>Exercises.</hi> But these <hi>short Ejaculations</hi> or <hi>occasionall Prayers,</hi> will not serve in steed of such Set and <hi>Solemn Prayer</hi> as we have been speaking of, which GOD ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarly calls for, which all <hi>Holy Men</hi> have taken care to perform, <hi>some seven times,</hi> some <hi>thrice a day,</hi> and which none ought to do seldomer then <hi>twice, viz.</hi> Morning and Evening: and those who fear that their <hi>Daylie business</hi> hinder them from <hi>plying Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> so seriously as they ought, should set a-Day of the Week, or once a Moneth, for redressing their <hi>Daylie Omissions</hi> in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And indeed none ought to grudge at the time they imploy in <hi>Prayer,</hi> even upon a <hi>Worldly account;</hi> for though the <hi>hours</hi> we steall from our <hi>Callings</hi> to <hi>Pray</hi> and <hi>Meditate,</hi> may seem to obstruct our interest, and to hinder our Thriving; yet on the contrary, they shall bring <hi>a secret Blessing</hi> on the <hi>other hours</hi> which remain, and make them as much or more for our gain then twice as much time: <hi>All these things,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>shall be added unto you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I cannot now adduce all the Motives to
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:55045:195"/>
                        <hi>Prayer,</hi> for they might be sufficient for a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same. I shall at present content my self to say, that as <hi>Prayer is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> necessary, so it is the most pleasant and profitable exercise;</hi> it Sanctifies for our use what we receive here, and secures the better things of the Life to come; it sweettens adversity, and keeps us from sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting on Prosperity; it is delightful in times of Peace, and disburdens our Hearts of Grief in times of Trouble; and in a word is the greatest priviledge we enjoy on Earth. But we must remember that we hold it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and therefore we must ever conclude our Prayers in <hi>His Name</hi> and present them <hi>through Him.</hi>

<pb n="377" facs="tcp:55045:195" rendition="simple:additions"/>
who hold the same Faith and Profession with our selves: and without we pay this <hi>publick Service,</hi> our Sincerity in the other does not, yea cannot appear, as we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy insinuat <hi>Sect. 1st.</hi> of this Chapter, where we shewed <hi>our Obligations to frequent the Church or House of GOD.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But because the <hi>publick Worship of GOD</hi> is so much disregarded now a dayes, and every Person is so ready to quarrel with what is Established, and to take upon them to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del it; therefore we have thought fit to treat here of somewhat particularly, and to shew <hi>First,</hi> the <hi>necessiity of this Worship. Secondly,</hi> the <hi>time to be appointed for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance thereof.</hi> And <hi>Thirdly</hi> the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Matter</hi> of it. As to the <hi>First,</hi> concerning the <hi>Necessity</hi> of <hi>publick Worship,</hi> it will not be needfull to insist much in proving it; for though there be many who slight the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worship of GOD in their Practice,</hi> yet we hardly think there will be any who will take upon them to Justify their practice, by alledging the <hi>non-necessity of Worshipping GOD publickly:</hi> And if any person should be so hardy as to doe it, he should herein not only set himself against all <hi>Christians</hi> of what ever <hi>Perswasion,</hi> but also should oppose the <hi>Sentiments and Practice of all Mankind.</hi> As the
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:55045:196"/>
beleife of a <hi>Deity</hi> hath been every where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, so all People have ever look'd upon themselves as oblidged to <hi>Worship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> GOD pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly</hi> according to the knowledge they had of him. The <hi>Iews</hi> to whom GOD reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself, were both enjoyned such a Worship and directed how to do it; and the <hi>Gospel</hi> only abrogate the <hi>Ceremonial part</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> it still retains and confirms such Customs and Practices as are useful and agreeable to the Nature thereof, and this is one of them: therefore the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Private Christians,</hi> continued to assemble themselves publickly as the <hi>Iews</hi> did, only taking care to <hi>adapt their Worship to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Law.</hi> Our LORD supposeth, that <hi>His Church</hi> will have <hi>publick Meettngs,</hi> and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them here he makes a special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise; <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 19. <hi>St. Paul</hi> finds fault with those who for fear of pesecution <hi>foresooke the Assembling themselves together. Heb.</hi> 10. 25. 'Tis not only necessary that we <hi>Believe with our Hearts,</hi> but we must also <hi>confess with our Mouth. Rom.</hi> 10. 12. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 32. 33. And as we are thus oblidg'd to a <hi>publick profession of GOD and Religion,</hi> so by the same Reason to <hi>a publick Worship:</hi> for this is the Badge and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And as the <hi>Glory of GOD</hi> requires him to <hi>be woshipped Publickly,</hi> so the
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:55045:196"/>
Edification of others, <hi>for hereby</hi> saith the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, we provock one another to love and to Good Works; Heb.</hi> 10. 24. <hi>Finally,</hi> our Private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, and the Concerns of the <hi>Common Wealth</hi> where we live, oblidge us to meet together, to call upon GOD, that by the Importunity and Strength of our <hi>united Prayers,</hi> we may procure all necessary Blessings. Upon these considerations we are oblidg'd to attend the <hi>publick Worship of GOD.</hi> And nothing can jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie our withdrawing from it, except those we live among require our complyance with some thing sinful and which we know to be offensive to GOD.</p>
                     <p>Having thus seen the necessity of <hi>publick Worship,</hi> it clearly follows from hence that there must be some <hi>set time appointed for it.</hi> And seeing the Reasons which oblidge to this <hi>Worship</hi> are alwayes in force, therefore that it may seem continued too, there must be no considerable distance betwixt the times appointed for the performance thereof: there is a Cessation of the <hi>Worship,</hi> if the returns of these times be not Frequent; for Men are said to leave off that, which they do seldom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then there is need or occasion of doing it. Upon this account even these who had no more then <hi>Natural Light,</hi> have thought them selves tyed to a <hi>dayly Service</hi> in their Temples<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="382" facs="tcp:55045:197"/>
the <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Mahumetans</hi> do still Assemble themselves several times a day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> GOD en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned his <hi>People of Old a Sacrifice Morning and Evening, Exod.</hi> 29. 38. At which time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <hi>Publick Prayer</hi> was wont to be made, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 1. And though Sacrifice could only be offered in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> yet the <hi>Iews</hi> who lived elsewhere observ'd <hi>those hours,</hi> came up to their <hi>Synagogues,</hi> and made <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> to GOD jointly, which is the constant Practice of that People to this Day, as <hi>Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torf</hi> and some others tell us. Now as I hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, CHRIST and his <hi>Apostles</hi> did not abolish such Customes and Practices as were <hi>Moral</hi> and tended to the <hi>Glory of GOD,</hi> or <hi>Edification of Men,</hi> but recommended them to be continued among <hi>Christians: Sacrifices of Beasts,</hi> 'tis true, are not required nor is there any use of them; but <hi>Sacrifices of Prayer</hi> and <hi>thanksgiving,</hi> these <hi>Calves of our lips</hi> are no less exacted by the <hi>Gospel</hi> then the other by the <hi>Law.</hi> And I cannot see why the <hi>one</hi> should been <hi>continued</hi> under the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>other discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued</hi> under the <hi>Gospel;</hi> the <hi>Apostles</hi> thought there was as much Reason for the one as the other, wherefore they and their <hi>Converts</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to <hi>serve GOD daylie by such publick Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Worship,</hi> as is evident from <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 42. 46. Which Custome was kept up in the
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:55045:197"/>
                        <hi>Church</hi> afterwards, and certainly the want hereof is such a defect, as doth more then spoile the Beauty of a <hi>Church;</hi> it is a main cause of the decay of all <hi>true piety:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ignorance and stubbornness of the <hi>Generality</hi> of this <hi>Nation</hi> is much to be lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which discourage our <hi>Governours</hi> from Establishing this <hi>Dayly Worship of GOD</hi> in <hi>Towns, Cities,</hi> and other <hi>populous Places,</hi> which I may confidently call a <hi>Necessary,</hi> as well as a <hi>Reasonable Service.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But as we ought thus to hallow <hi>every Day,</hi> by devoting some part thereof to the <hi>publick Service</hi> of GOD; so we are oblidg'd to Sanctify for this end <hi>one whole Day in seven, viz.</hi> the <hi>first day of the Week,</hi> commonly called the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> partly because of its being peculiarly consecrate to the <hi>Service of GOD,</hi> and partly because of that <hi>special Honour</hi> whiich the <hi>LORD IESUS CHRIST</hi> conferr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on this <hi>Day,</hi> by his <hi>Triumphant resurrection from the Dead,</hi> which was the Reason for its consecration: we should set a part <hi>one day of the seven,</hi> not that this portion appears necessary by <hi>Natural Light,</hi> but because 'twas expresly exacted of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and that we are unjust if our expressions of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Devotion</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards GOD be lesse then what was sought of them; and what oblidgeth us to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:55045:198"/>
of the <hi>first day particularly,</hi> is the practice of the Holy <hi>Apostles,</hi> who either had an expresse command for what they did themseves and enjoyned others in the <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of GOD,</hi> or were led thereto by the <hi>holy Ghost.</hi> Now their practice in this particular is declared to us <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 7. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2. And is witnessed by a constant <hi>universal Tradition</hi> of <hi>the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Besides the <hi>LORD'S Day,</hi> no other is strictly necessary to be kept, except in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to our <hi>Rulers Civil and Ecclesiastical;</hi> who without all question may (as well as the <hi>Iewish Church</hi> and State formerly) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point dayes for the <hi>publick Worship</hi> and <hi>service of GOD,</hi> upon the account either of some particular emergency wherein <hi>Church or State</hi> is concerned, or of some special Mercy granted them. But they ought to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful neither to burden People with too many such appointments, nor yet to give them a disgust by ordering <hi>Solemn Dayes</hi> upon mean &amp; silly accounts: if Men be not serious in these <hi>Solemn Addresses,</hi> they are a meer Mockery and Dishonour to GOD; and it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make them Serious when the cause and occasion of them is frivolous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be made the matter of <hi>Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</hi> And so the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> has misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:55045:198"/>
transgressed, for <hi>first,</hi> she hath so multiplied her <hi>Fasts and Festivals,</hi> that the number of them almost exceeds the dayes of the Year; the year would need to be enlarg'd, if all their <hi>Holy Dayes</hi> should be distinctly and exactly keept. And though it be pretended that all are not required to observe each of them; yet there be too many imposed upon every person and every place, so that the <hi>French King</hi> was necessitate to deall with the <hi>Pope</hi> lately for the dispensing with a great many in his Kingdom. Again the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> is not only to blame for enjoyning such an intollerable burden of dayes, but also because the Reason of these injunctions, for the most part, are frivolous scarce worthy of a Man's serious attention, much lesse of being the matter and occasion of <hi>solemn Devotions,</hi> as for example the invention of some pitiful Relicts, the dedication of Bells, some ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous passage of their <hi>Legendary Saints, &amp;c.</hi> and as most of their <hi>Holy-dayes</hi> are in honour of their <hi>Saints,</hi> so the most of their <hi>Saints</hi> according to their own relation did nothing memorable, their lives are more Foolish and impertinent then Old Wives Fables, or the Tales of Children, as we might shew by seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral instances did we not fear to be tedious.</p>
                     <p>But leaving this, we come next to speak
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:55045:199"/>
to the <hi>Nature of this Worship,</hi> which should be payed unto GOD publickly, and to shew the Particulars whereof it should consist, which ought especially to be considered.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>First,</hi> as to the <hi>General nature of this Worship,</hi> it must <hi>first</hi> answer the end thereof, which is the <hi>Glory of GOD, the Celebration and Praise of his Greatness, Wisdom, Goodness</hi> and other <hi>Glorious perfections;</hi> that the <hi>Souls of the Worshippers</hi> may be enflamed with the love of GOD and that they may be excited to Fear, Trust, and Obey Him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>2ly.</hi> It must be agreeable to the Will and Mind of GOD, and altogether free of what he hath forbidden, or signified his displeasure with: otherwayes it will be so far from being acceptable, that it will be very abominable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>3ly.</hi> It must not only contain all the parts of <hi>Natural Religion,</hi> but besides carry <hi>Characters of the Gospel,</hi> for it is not only Reasonable, but Necessary that the <hi>Worship of GOD</hi> be Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late by <hi>special dispensations of his Grace,</hi> and made to expresse the particulars of such <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations.</hi> the <hi>Iews</hi> were required to <hi>Worship God in a different Manner</hi> from what is discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by <hi>Natural Light;</hi> and so those who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Mysteries of the Christian Religion,</hi> must have a <hi>Peculiar Worship,</hi> that is distinct from such as own no <hi>Revelation,</hi> or only <hi>that of the old Testament.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="387" facs="tcp:55045:199"/>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> from these considerations it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that <hi>Christians</hi> must <hi>Worship GOD to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in spirit and Truth:</hi> For so our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our directed us, Iohn</hi> 4. 23. Where he saith, <hi>The hour cometh, and now is, when the true Worshippers shall worship the Father in Spirit and Truth: For the Father seeketh such to Worship him, GOD is a Spirit, and they that Worship, must Worship him in Spirit and Truth.</hi> Which words, whither we consider them abstractly &amp; in a general notion, as deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a certain <hi>Natural Truth,</hi> or with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the way of <hi>Worshipping GOD</hi> then usual in the World. I say, which way so ever we consider them, they teach us that GOD will now be <hi>Worshipped,</hi> not by a <hi>Multitude of carnal and external Observances,</hi> or a number of <hi>Mysterious</hi> and almost <hi>unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible rites and Ceremonies,</hi> as the <hi>Gentiles</hi> used to doe, and as he thought fit for a time to impose upon the <hi>Iews:</hi> But by actions of a <hi>Spiritual Nature,</hi> and whose signification and use is Reasonable and easily understood. The Law considered Men as in a weak In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant State, and so prescribed a Worship su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to such a State; but the <hi>Gospel</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to bring us to the full <hi>Stature of perfect Men,</hi> and considers us as such, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our way of worshipping GOD now
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:55045:200"/>
must speak out more perfect Reason and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding. The worship required of <hi>Christians</hi> is not a <hi>Pompous shew of Ceremonies,</hi> which may affect Children or Childish Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; but <hi>Real and Substantial expressions of Faith, Love, Fear, Ioy,</hi> and <hi>Confidence in GOD:</hi> There must not be more, or other Ceremonies used in the <hi>Worship of GOD,</hi> then what is requisite for Order and Decency, or necessary to Excite and Fix the <hi>inward atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our minds;</hi> for that is not True or <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Worship</hi> which is wholly <hi>External,</hi> and doth not come from, and is not perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>inward Mind.</hi> Thus in a word as we should <hi>Worship GOD in Spirit and Truth, So to Worship in Spirit,</hi> is to <hi>Worship with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acts</hi> and <hi>Affections of</hi> the <hi>Soul,</hi> and to <hi>Worship in Truth</hi> is to perform such <hi>Outward Acts</hi> as doth not Mystically and Figuratively but plainly and properly, signify and hold forth these <hi>inward ones.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having thus viewed the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Publick Worship</hi> in <hi>General,</hi> we passe to the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>parts</hi> thereof <hi>In particular.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And <hi>First</hi> the <hi>Publick Worship of God</hi> should consist of <hi>Prayers,</hi> this is so clear from <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Reason,</hi> &amp; the practice of all the world, that it were a vain thing to prove it: the parts and Qualifications of <hi>Publick Prayer,</hi> are
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:55045:200"/>
the same with those of private <hi>Prayer,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have spoken already. And because it is so useful to know before hand what we should Pray, and so unworthy a thing to utter rash and indiscreet expressions before GOD, especially in publick, therefore the <hi>Church</hi> in Ages have ever thought themselves oblidged to compose deliberatly <hi>Forms of publick Prayer,</hi> and not to leave them to the extemporary effusions of him who officiates; there is not at this day any <hi>Church</hi> (except our own) <hi>without a publick Service and Liturgy:</hi> But because we are driven to the necessity at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, not to use one, therefore it is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on the <hi>publick Ministers</hi> to take the more care in composing their <hi>Prayers,</hi> that their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions be grave &amp; Decent, &amp; that as to the Matter of them they contain all things proper &amp; necessary, &amp; nothing disagreable to <hi>God,</hi> or which may disgust &amp; stumble the <hi>Worshippers.</hi> they should study to make their <hi>Prayers</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press truly the general needs &amp; desires of the People; for he who <hi>Prayeth</hi> is their mouth, imployed to speake in their name, what every one should do if they were allowed to speak: &amp; so all <hi>publick Prayers</hi> should be so ordered, that every one may be able to joine heartily with them. And here I cannot passe two faults ordinarly committed in this part of
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:55045:201"/>
                        <hi>publick Worship,</hi> the one for the most part in Country Parishes, the other generally both in City and Country: by this last I mean a careless unconcernedness in Prayer, many think not themselves oblidged to joyne with the <hi>Minister</hi> while he prayes, they do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that he is but their voice, &amp; that 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for them to say with the heart what he does with the mouth, else the <hi>Prayers</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be heard as theirs, or for them. Though one Pray but audibly to shun confusion, yet it is necessary for all to assent thereto. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fault is committed often by the <hi>Common People</hi> (especially in the <hi>Northren parts</hi> of the Kingdom, as the former in the <hi>Southren parts</hi>) who fall to their particular <hi>Prayers</hi> when the <hi>Minister</hi> is praying in the <hi>name of the whole Congregation:</hi> this is an irregular and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent thing which obstructs the Edification Designed by this part of Worship, see 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 26. When the congregation cometh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it should be with <hi>one Heart and Mind,</hi> they ought not to have different exercises but alwayes the same; they should pray one and the same Prayer <hi>with one accord,</hi> as we read the <hi>Disciples</hi> did <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 24. To prevent both these Evils, if 'twas usuall in all, both <hi>Iewish</hi> and <hi>Christian Liturgies</hi> to Appoint the People to utter sometimes some short senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:55045:201"/>
and alwayes to speak out audibly, <hi>Amen,</hi> at the conclusion of every Prayer, as is inti mate to us, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 16.</p>
                     <p>Another Act of <hi>Divine Worship</hi> especially in <hi>Publick Assemblies, is singing of Psalms and Spiritual Songs.</hi> This was alwayes a part of the <hi>Worship of GOD</hi> under the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> 'twas observed by our <hi>Saviour</hi> with his <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Matth.</hi> 26. 30. And <hi>St. Paul</hi> enjoyns it to all <hi>Christians, Eph.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16. Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Hymns</hi> and <hi>Psalms</hi> is of great use in the <hi>Service of GOD,</hi> both to prepare our Minds for it, and to make us take Pleasure in it. It fixeth our thoughts, elevats our Spirits, fills us with Joy in GOD, and leaveth on our Minds a deeper impression <hi>of Divine Truths,</hi> then almost any other part of <hi>Religious Worship:</hi> for which cause it hath been an <hi>universal practice</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> through all Ages of the World.</p>
                     <p>And as <hi>Singing</hi> is our Duty, so the <hi>Psalms of David</hi> are excellently fitted for the purpose, they furnish us both with proper Matter and apposite Expressions: They were dictate by the <hi>Spirit of GOD</hi> to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed particularly in this <hi>Divine exercise;</hi> and we must not think the use of them to have ceased with the <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Iewish state;</hi> no certainly they are still usefull to the <hi>Church</hi>
                        <pb n="392" facs="tcp:55045:202"/>
and proper for the times of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> Without doubt <hi>S. Paul</hi> in the forecited places, and <hi>S. Iames</hi> Ch: 5. 13. Are to be understood of the <hi>Psalms of David,</hi> because the tittle of <hi>Psalms</hi> has been alwayes appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate to them. And from this Injunction of the <hi>Apostles</hi> conformable to their Practice, and which is most Reasonable and u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>efull, the <hi>Church</hi> hath ever used these <hi>Psalms</hi> in her <hi>Publick Service.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I know there are some who not only scruple at some of the <hi>Psalms,</hi> but say expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>they ought not to be sung and when it is done they refuse to take a part.</hi> But truly I think there is no Reason for this. Indeed all of them are not proper for all occasions, some are more pertinent and sutable at one time then another, and therefore they who have the ordering of the <hi>Publick Service,</hi> should make a Prudent choice of <hi>Psalms</hi> suted to the occasion, however all of them may be sung, and because People have not their own choise, but must take them as they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd; I will here propose some Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to shew how we may freely joyne with any <hi>Psalm</hi> and both sing it with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and also with edification.</p>
                     <p>First there can be no Question of those <hi>Psalms,</hi> which Declare the <hi>Divine Attributes,</hi>
                        <pb n="393" facs="tcp:55045:202"/>
Display the <hi>Works of GOD,</hi> hold forth the <hi>excellency of his word,</hi> or the <hi>General State</hi> of Man. To Sing and Meditate on these can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be improper at any time, but alwayes usefull and seasonable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>2ly.</hi> As for those <hi>Psalms</hi> which were Writ upon particular Occasions, besides the Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral sence which relates to those Persons, their actions and circumstances upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they were penned; there is a <hi>Mystical sense</hi> belongs to them which referres them to <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Church;</hi> and moreover, they are capable of being accommodated to seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conditions and Circumstances both of <hi>Private Persons</hi> and <hi>Publick Societies</hi> by allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some Liberty to <hi>Figures, Allegories</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Poetical Strains</hi> which are usual in <hi>Songs</hi> and <hi>Hymns:</hi> Now though we should be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle concerned in the <hi>Literal sense,</hi> yet we are in the <hi>Mystical<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> and if they will suffer an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation to our selves or the <hi>Church and State</hi> we live in, then we not only may use them, but the use of them will be both pleasant and edifying.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>3ly.</hi> These <hi>Psalms</hi> which contain narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Wonders which GOD wrought for the People of Israel,</hi> or the <hi>Special mercies conferred upon them,</hi> or <hi>David</hi> in particular, they are very proper to be sung; for besides that we
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:55045:203"/>
ought to celebrate the <hi>Praises of GOD</hi> for his goodness to others as well as our selves, and that all the world are concerned in <hi>these favours heaped on the Iewish Nation,</hi> because they served to <hi>Usher in the Gospel</hi> and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the <hi>Manifestation of the Son of GOD.</hi> I say, besides these two Considerations, those Acts of GOD towards his People in former times, are instances of his Power and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and so proper matter for his Praise; they are also grounds of our hope, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to trust &amp; confidence in Him both for our selves and the Publick; see <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 4.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>4ly.</hi> GOD'S plagues upon the <hi>Heathen</hi> and his punishments upon <hi>His own People,</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of <hi>GOD'S Iustice</hi> and <hi>Holiness,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Psalms</hi> which narrate these may be sung to put us in mind, <hi>that he is not a GOD who hath pleasure in wickedness, and that no relation to him will excuse sin, or hold off judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if his Laws be broken.</hi> And so they are useful to stirr up our repentance le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>t we likewise smart, and our thankfulness for whatforbearance and gentle dealing we have met with.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>5ly.</hi> The <hi>Psalms</hi> where <hi>David</hi> layeth out his own Troubles, and the successe of his Enemies are be meditate on, as Proofs that the Just will be afflicted and the wicked pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:55045:203"/>
to teach us Patience and Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The high Assertions of his Integrity and Uprightness, and Love to the <hi>Law of GOD, &amp;c.</hi> We should sing, thereby to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy, that it is our Duty to endeavour this way to please GOD, and that without these Endeavours we ought not to lay hold on the Promises, nor presume to crave the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of His Children.</p>
                     <p>6. The <hi>Psalms</hi> of <hi>imprecations</hi> are most scrupled at, but it is because persons are not at the pains to take a right view of them: for whatever was the particular Occasion of them, or whom ever they were primarly designed against, we should consider them now as intimations of the <hi>Divine vengeance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards obstinate and incorrigible sinners, and as declarations of the irrevocable Sentence which his justice hath passed against them.</hi> Nay, I may say this is the special intent of them, for if they had been only to vent <hi>David's</hi> private wrath, and emnity, GOD would not inspired them, nor approved of them. And it is no less lawful &amp; proper sometimes to sing them, then to meditate on the heavy judgements &amp; seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>God</hi> towards impenitent sinners; that thereby a wholesome <hi>fear of God</hi> may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited in us. By them also we may be supported against those tentations which arise from suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:55045:204"/>
of the Enemies of God, &amp; their insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in opposing the Truth and oppressing his People: And as it was never thought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful in times of Warr, and publick Trouble and Disorders to pray against the unjust authour and instruments thereof, not that GOD would damne their Souls, but that he would defeat their Devices, give them shame and confusion, and by his Judgements on their Persons, put them in fear to carry on their wicked enterprises; and all this not to satisfy our revengful Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, but that it may be known <hi>there is a GOD who ruleth the world, and who will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the innocent and righteous to the end all people may be engaged to put their trust in him.</hi> So I doe not see why it should be thought improper on such occasions to sing these <hi>Psalms,</hi> and to <hi>waite patiently for the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them.</hi> They are very unreasonable and unjust who would wrest this to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing of <hi>private revenge,</hi> and the <hi>cursing of Enemies,</hi> whither <hi>publick</hi> or <hi>Private,</hi> for its not lawful for us to doe, what GOD doth as he is <hi>Supreme judge,</hi> and by vertue of his <hi>soveraign authority, vengeance is mine saith the Lord,</hi> it belongs to him to punish, but not to us; and as it is not lawful for us to take Vengeance, because GOD doth it; so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:55045:204"/>
is it unlawful to meditate on the just judgements of GOD, to sing of them, and to give our assent to them, because we are forbidden to curse or revenge our selves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>7ly.</hi> It is alledged against some <hi>Psalms,</hi> that we cannot turn them to Prayers, or if we should they would not be true as from us, and therefore it is not fit to sing them: But to this may be answered, that <hi>there is a difference between praying and singing;</hi> every Prayer may be made a Hymn or Song of Praise, but that may be fit to be Sung which cannot properly be Prayed. In Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er we turn our Minds wholly to GOD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, speake to him, and therefore it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that our Words be strictly true and sutable to our <hi>Particular State:</hi> But in Singing we speak not so directly to GOD, as of him to others. Singing is a mutual calling upon one another to <hi>Laud and Praise GOD,</hi> together with a proposal of what makes for his Glory; and therefore it is proper enough to sing any thing which makes for the Glory of GOD, though it do not quadrate with our own case in all Circumstances.</p>
                     <p>But as we have made it thus appear that all the <hi>Psalms of David</hi> may be sung properly and with Edification, so we do not say

                        </gap>hat none other may be sung, it is certainly lawful to have other Hymns besides, and most Reasonable to have some more appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate to the <hi>Gospel</hi> and the <hi>Mysteries</hi> reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein, that our Worship in this as well as in other things may be distinguished from that of <hi>Iews. Pliny</hi> in his Letter to <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan, tells that the Christians were wont to sing a hymn to CHRIST as to GOD,</hi> which must have been some other then <hi>the Psalms of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> wherein there was some more express mention of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> or which had some more peculiar reference to him, then what is to be found in these <hi>Psalms.</hi> It is impossible to give any Reason why the <hi>Hymns</hi> of the <hi>N. T.</hi> should no be used as well as those of the <hi>Old,</hi> seing the same <hi>Spirit dictate both,</hi> and that there is some special propriety in them to the <hi>Christian Faith.</hi> And as for the <hi>Doxology,</hi> the questioning its lawfulness, bewrayes such Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or humour, that I think it needless to prove the use of it: if People would lay aside their prejudices, they might easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it very fit and proper to joyne this to each <hi>Psalm,</hi> for thereby we give the <hi>Psalm</hi> an <hi>Evangelical sense</hi> &amp; make it referre to every <hi>Person</hi> in the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> who as they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided in their <hi>essence,</hi> so they should be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our <hi>Worship</hi> and as they are distinctly
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:55045:205"/>
                        <hi>revealed to us,</hi> so we ought in all our Devotions to pay them <hi>distinct and particular Worship.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>3dly.</hi> The <hi>reading of the Holy Scriptures</hi> is a necessary part of <hi>Gods publick Worship.</hi> This was used in the <hi>Iewish Assemblies</hi> as appears from <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 8. <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 15. 15. 21. St. <hi>Paul</hi> expresly chargeth <hi>The reading of his Epistles, Col.</hi> 4. 16. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5: 27. And for the same Reason the rest of the <hi>Scripture</hi> ought to be read, and the <hi>Church</hi> has been still in use to do so. Now the main Reason hereof, is not our own instruction, but to do honour to GOD, for as hereby we own the Scriptures to be from GOD, so we solemnly acknowlege our selves bound to <hi>hear and obey his word,</hi> and tye our selves to walk as it diercts us. The <hi>publick Worship of GOD</hi> is not rightly performed, when there is no <hi>reading of Scriptures;</hi> and it is all one almost as if they were cast out of the <hi>Worship,</hi> when they are only read while the People are coming to <hi>Church,</hi> but not after they are mett: For then the reading is only used for a divertisement to put off the time, and not as a Honour or Acknowledgement due to GOD. They understand little of the Nature or <hi>end of publick Worship,</hi> who would have the <hi>reading of Scripture</hi> laid aside, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it can be done at home, Such have
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:55045:206"/>
more regard to their Fancy, then to the <hi>true honour of GOD;</hi> and do come to <hi>Church</hi> rather to feed an impertinent Curiosity, and desire of Novelty, then to perform a reasonable Service to GOD. Not to speak of the inability of a great many to perform this exercise in Private, the reading at home makes not so much for the Honour of the Sciptures, and consequently of GOD who is the Author of them. Respect to the Majesty and Authority of GOD require that his Will and Pleasure be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgate with solemnity, and heard with reverence. We have an eminent Instance hereof, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 5, 6.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>4thly,</hi> To the <hi>reading of the Scripture</hi> was alwayes wont to be joyned Preaching on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> and other <hi>Festival-dayes,</hi> as appears from the forecited places, which custome the Church hath continued, and it is most necessary and profitable, It shews our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to GOD, and a regard for his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, when we are willing to hear such as he hath Commissioned to inform us of his Will anent us. <hi>He that heareth you,</hi> said Christ to the Apostles, <hi>heareth me, and he that dispiseth you, despiseth me, and him that sent me.</hi> Kings and Princes are Honoured or Affronted according as their Servants and

                        </hi> 5. 20. <hi>Reconciliation</hi> with <hi>God</hi> is the Errand on which Ministers are sent, and seing the terms of this Reconciliation, and the means by which it is wrought, are set down in <hi>Scripture,</hi> therefore the subject matter of preaching should be to give the sense and meaning of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and to exhort to a Complyance with what is there contained. Sermons are not ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to teach men curious things, or to tickle them with fine neat speeches; but to make them understand the Scriptures, to instruct them in the Doctrine thereof, and to stirr them up to observe the same, thus <hi>Ezra</hi> preached, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 8. And ordinarly in the primitive Church, their Sermons were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Explications of such Portions of <hi>Scripture</hi> as were read in the <hi>publick Service,</hi> together with an Exhortation to obey it. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal design of Preaching is to unfold the meaning of <hi>God's Word,</hi> and to help men to discern the mind of the Lord revealed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and as these are the best and most Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Sermons which discover this plainly and clearly, so it is the duty of all to hearken diligently to these instructions, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:55045:207"/>
them gladly. It speaks out a Love to GOD when we are willing and very desirous to know his will: but there is little regard for God, where there is no desire to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what he sayeth to us in and by his <hi>word.</hi> But though <hi>the Priests lips should keep know ledge,</hi> and that it is the peoples duty <hi>to seek the Law at his Mouth,</hi> yet this is not to render the private search and study of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> useless: Guides are ordained to be helps, but not to take away our own sight; we may find them useful though we do not put out our eyes. As the <hi>Noble Bereans</hi> did, we should <hi>search the Scriptures dayly whither these things we hear be true or not;</hi> And this is the more necessary, because we are fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned of <hi>false Prophets:</hi> Every Spirit is not to be believed, none ought to be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an <hi>implicit Faith,</hi> but only the Spirit of GOD: all other should be tryed before trusted. And it needs be no hard task to try the truth of Doctrines, if we lay aside pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and search the <hi>Scripture impartially:</hi> A man by applying his eye narrowly, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he hath the advantage of a Rule, will soon discern whither a thing be straight or crooked; and it is indeed no less easie to judge in matters necessarie to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

                        <hi>5thly,</hi> I cannot omit here what was Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently &amp; Universally used though now turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into desuetude among us; and it is the <hi>Solemn and explicite profession of the Christian Faith,</hi> by a rehearsal of some <hi>Summary</hi> thereof, as the <hi>Apostles</hi> or <hi>Nicene,</hi> or <hi>Athanasian Creed.</hi> The expresse declaration of our Faith is much both for our profite and the honour of GOD: It is for the honour of GOD that we believe in GOD, and in JESUS CHRIST, and give our assent to all the truths of the Gospel; <hi>without this faith it is impossible to please GOD,</hi> unless our worship be founded on the belief of these things, it is altogether unacceptable: And it is not only necessary to have this Faith al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in our hearts, but we must also some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times openly testify it, by confessing the same with our mouths, as the Apostle tells us, Rom: 10. 9. Where he saith, <hi>that if thou shalt confesse with thy mouth the LORD IESUS, and shalt believe in thine he art that GOD hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved; For with the heart man believeth unto righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and with the mouth confession is made unto Salvation.</hi> This is also profitable for our selves, for these <hi>Creeds</hi> are the <hi>Badges</hi> of <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> which instruct us in our profession, and teach us how to <hi>answer every man who</hi>
                        <pb n="404" facs="tcp:55045:208"/>
                        <hi>asketh a reason of the hope that is in us.</hi> A fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent repetition of the Creed fixeth the great Articles of our Religion in our mind, brings them often to our remembrance, and serves to excite us to walk worthy of the Gospel. Persons of Honour are careful to behave su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably while they have the <hi>signs</hi> and <hi>badges</hi> of their Dignity and Quality upon them; and sure it could not but oblidge and quicken us to study a Christian Behaviour, if we frequently made a serious and solemn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of our Faith. Lastly, <hi>the celebration of the LORDS Supper</hi> should frequently accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany our other acts of publick worship; the <hi>Apostles</hi> with their <hi>Converts</hi> did this dayly, as we read Acts 2. 42. 46. which practice continued long in the <hi>Primitive Church. St. Augustine</hi> in one of his <hi>Epistles</hi> to <hi>Ianearius</hi> says 'twas the custome to do so in many places <note n="*" place="margin">vid: Gessel: Hist: Eccl: p: 426.</note> The <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes such as do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate when they come up to Church to hear, so doe those <hi>Canons</hi> which carry the name of <hi>Apostolical.</hi> Thus it appears that the participation of the Lord's Supper, was look'd upon as a necessary part of Divine ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which could not be well omitted; and there can be no reason given, why the use
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:55045:208"/>
of this Sacrament (at least every LORDS Day) was left off, but the decay of Piety: The Zeal and Devotion of the <hi>Apostolick Ages</hi> wore out, and so men became careless of giving this expression thereof. Or out off a Superstitious regard to their chief Festivals, they would only communicate on these days, that they might seem to do them the greater honour. But as for the present cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of communicating only once or twice a year, it is so unaccountable and speaks out so little <hi>true love to</hi> GOD, and the <hi>memory of our Saviour,</hi> that <hi>Calvin</hi> had good reason to call it <hi>Diabolicum inventum,</hi> a meer device of Satans to stiffle Piety, and to keep back Peoples endeavours after Godliness.</p>
                     <p>This is a piece of Worship peculiar to the Christian Religion, which our LORD hath expreslly enjoined; It's a great testimony of our <hi>Faith,</hi> a solemn act of <hi>Adoration</hi> payed both to the Father and Son, and a visible commemoration of the <hi>Mystery</hi> of the <hi>Cross,</hi> which as <hi>S. Paul</hi> speaketh, is both <hi>the Wisdom of GOD, and the Power of GOD:</hi> In a word, the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, is the <hi>Chief Rite</hi> of our Religion, which <hi>in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> comprehends all others parts thereof, and by the serious participation of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we truely glorify GOD, and bring
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:55045:209"/>
good to our selves, for CHRIST hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained it to be <hi>the instrument of our union with him,</hi> and the <hi>conveyance of the benefits of his death.</hi> And therefore this Sacrament should be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten administrate, and who would testifie their love to <hi>GOD,</hi> should as frequently partake thereof.</p>
                     <p>It is alledged against frequent communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating, <hi>first,</hi> that 'twould take away much of the esteem due to this <hi>Sacrament.</hi> But if this Reason were good, 'twould follow also that we should seldome <hi>think on GOD, Pray, read the Scriptures,</hi> and <hi>perform other Acts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> It is no true esteem, which ariseth only from the consideration of the rarity of the thing; and certainly acquaintance with <hi>Spiritual actions</hi> &amp; frequent exercising them, begets the highest esteem of them and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in them: He Prays best and with most pleasure who <hi>Prays oftnest,</hi> and so of other things. Another pretence is that if men <hi>Communicate frequently,</hi> they would not have leasure to prepare themselves: But this runs upon a mistake of the nature of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and of the preparation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisit thereto. A <hi>Cessation</hi> from sin is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes necessary, but not from our civil bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, especially if we had any occasion of <hi>Communicating.</hi> He who firmly believes the
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:55045:209"/>
                        <hi>Gospel,</hi> heartily repents <hi>of his sins,</hi> and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to live according to the <hi>Gospel,</hi> is true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disposed for the <hi>Sacrament</hi> any day, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day; and who is not thus disposed for the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> neither is he <hi>fit to pray,</hi> or to go about any other <hi>Religious exercise,</hi> and so is in a state of enmity with GOD. If a Person once understand the <hi>Nature and Design of the Sacrament,</hi> and daylie exercise himself in Prayer, as we have shewed in the former <hi>Section,</hi> if his Life be a <hi>continual walking with GOD,</hi> he is ever sutablely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for it. And if we ought to be alwayes thus prepar'd, therefore the want of <hi>prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> will not excuse the <hi>Ommission of this Duty,</hi> the <hi>Omission</hi> whereof doth of it self imply (though People are loath to acknowledge it) a <hi>renunciation of the Christian Religion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus we have gone through the several parts <hi>of publick Worship,</hi> shewed the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of them, and let see the right manner of going about them. And by what account we have given, which certainly will hold true, it appears that the <hi>publick Worship</hi> in all <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> is Proper and Acceptable, so that none have any just Reason to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from it, and who doe it are undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly guilty of <hi>Schisme:</hi> 'tis true, in some Places perhaps (and particularly among our
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:55045:210"/>
selves) there would need some Rectification for the more Grave, Decent and Orderly <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Divine service;</hi> but however nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we nor any other <hi>of our Protestant Brethren</hi> want any essential part of Worship, nor have we or they any thing disagreeable to GOD, or which destroyes the end of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, so that they are without all excuse who refuse to have <hi>Communion</hi> with <hi>this</hi> or any <hi>other Reform'd Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But as this must be acknowledg'd for all <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> so the quite contrary is true <hi>of the Worship in the Church of Rome:</hi> For it neither answers the <hi>end,</hi> nor agrees to the <hi>right rules of GOD'S Worship;</hi> it is not, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be acceptable to GOD, for it is full of Abominations.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>First,</hi> in generall the <hi>Popish Service</hi> is neither <hi>Spiritual</hi> nor <hi>Reasonable.</hi> Though we do not consider it in Retail but in Gross, it must be acknowledg'd an ignorant brutish service, a service which is not conform to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> nor doth it tend to the Glory of GOD, or the Edification of Men, because it cannot be understood being <hi>performed in an unknown Tongue.</hi> As the Learned <hi>D. Taylor</hi> sayeth, <hi>we may as soon reconcile Adultery with the seventh Command, as the service in a Language which cannot be understood,</hi> with the 14. of
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:55045:210"/>
first <hi>Ep.</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> and <hi>if publick Worship</hi> need not be understood, neither needs it be pronounced at all; for if the <hi>Priest speaks</hi> not to let Men understand him, he needs not speak to inform <hi>God,</hi> and so a <hi>Dumb Priest</hi> is even as good as one whom the People doth not understand. This practice of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> is both contrary to the practice of all the <hi>World,</hi> &amp; is condemned by common Sense; so that the <hi>Papists</hi> in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves use a deal of impertinent non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and vent intolerable absurdities which render <hi>Religion</hi> ridiculous, and destroy the very Nature and Design of it. What an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity is it, to teach People to use Prayers only as Charms? To think <hi>ignorant prating</hi> as acceptable to GOD, as the <hi>sincere desires of the Soul?</hi> and that judgement and discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are useless in <hi>Religion,</hi> though it be the great end of our <hi>Creation,</hi> and though for it especially we were endued with Reasonable Faculties? I shall conclude this point. with what <hi>a late Popish Writer</hi> hath <hi>Moyens</hi> confessed, <hi>It is necessary to have the pub- surs par lick service in the common language of la conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the Country; for it is certain that this is de Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to the Holy Scripture. The tiques Mysteries of GOD are not as those of</hi> 147. <hi>Pagans; these behoved to be hid from</hi>
                        <pb n="410" facs="tcp:55045:211"/>
                        <hi>People, because they were shameful and ridiculous, but GOD would have his Children instructed fully in his. There cannot be greater reproach thrown upon Religion, then to say as some do, that Faith without Knowledge is best. He must be an Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour and Seducer who speaketh so, for St.</hi> Paul <hi>commands nothing more then that we should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in knowledge; The reading of the Holy Scripture should be recommended to People accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the practice of all the Fathers, It was not the People who wrested the Scripture, and spread Heresies; they were the Bishops and Doctors and Persons of the Clergy. Arrius, Macedonius, Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, Eutyches, Pelagius, were all Church-men.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>2ly.</hi> The <hi>Worship of the Roman Church</hi> has not a Resemblance to the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> because it wants the <hi>purity and simplicity</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to make <hi>Worship</hi> look like <hi>Christian,</hi> as we formerly shewed, it should be Plain and Simple, that is, free of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> except what are requisite to Excite and Fix the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, &amp; should chiefly consist of Actions, which are Grave and Serious, and which do properly expresse the <hi>Divine Majesty and Glory:</hi> But the <hi>Worship of the Papists</hi> is meerly Pomp &amp; Pageantry, a vain external Shew of Ceremonies, fitter for the <hi>Theatre</hi> then the <hi>Church.</hi> Their <hi>Churches</hi> are dressed with <hi>Gaudy Scenes</hi> like <hi>Play-Houses,</hi> and like them

too they use not the light of the <hi>Sun,</hi> but the dazling &amp; deceiving light <hi>of Lamps and Wax-Candles;</hi> their <hi>Priests</hi> are sumptuously deck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with various kinds of Garments, and as for the <hi>Service</hi> it self, it consists in sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>of holywater, kindling Perfumes, Kneeling, and bowing</hi> and often crossing, Turning to the Right or Left Hand, according to the Sign given, the Elevating and Lowing of the Voice at certain Times, the vain repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of unintelligible Words, and in a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of impertinent and insignificant Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies which chock the very Spirit of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and which would render what is read or spoken to no purpose though it could be understood: For 'tis impossible that the mind can be attentive or make any Serious application, where there is such a multitude of <hi>external performances.</hi> The <hi>Worship</hi> enjoyn'd and practised in the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> has more resemblance to <hi>Paganisme</hi> then the <hi>Christian Religion;</hi> it contains indeed Acts and Instances of the <hi>true Worship of GOD,</hi> but so buried in <hi>Heathnish Superstition</hi> that they lose their <hi>Efficacy,</hi> both with <hi>GOD and Man.</hi> Their <hi>Sprinklings, Processions, Scourgings, Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,</hi> and in a word, the most of their <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies</hi> both in their Ordinary and Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Devotions are derived from <hi>ancient</hi>

                        <hi>3ly Popish worship</hi> is not only full of <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition</hi> but <hi>Idolatry,</hi> it not only is made up of many foolishly and uselesse Actions, which can pretend to no Shadow of Reason or <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority:</hi> But it contains also many things expresly forbidden, as the <hi>Invocation</hi> and <hi>Adoration</hi> of <hi>Angels,</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> &amp;c. What <hi>St. Paul</hi> said of <hi>Rome Pagan,</hi> holds true of <hi>Rome Christian, they have changed the truth of GOD into a lie, and Worship the creature more then the Creator.</hi> For the most of their <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> is not tendred to GOD and JESUS CHRIST, but to <hi>Angels,</hi> the blessed <hi>Virgin,</hi> and other departed <hi>Saints,</hi> to <hi>Images, Reliques,</hi> that is, the Bones, Ashes and other forged appurtenances of their supposed <hi>Saints, I</hi> say supposed, for their is no evidence for the most of them but the <hi>Popes Cannoniza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> which is very unsufficient: 'Tis laid on the name of one <hi>Pope Gregory,</hi> that he should have said, <hi>multorum corpora venerantur</hi>

                        <hi>4ly.</hi> The <hi>Mass</hi> which is the chiefest part of their <hi>Worship,</hi> is the highest abomination: For it is used in stead of the <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi> which our <hi>LORD instituted that night wherein he was betrayed,</hi> but in Truth, it is is quite another thing, because they have added to it and pared from it, and use it in another sense and to other purposes, then what that <hi>Sacrament</hi> was design'd for. <hi>First,</hi> they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the <hi>Cup,</hi> which is the one half of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> though it be clear that our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> commanded <hi>All</hi> to <hi>drink of it,</hi> as both the <hi>Councill of Constance, and Trent,</hi> acknowledge in their <hi>Acts</hi> which prohibite <hi>the use of the Cup to the Laity.</hi> And as for the other part of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> besides that their <hi>Wafers</hi> cannot

be counted Bread, they do not use the <hi>rite of breaking it,</hi> which is so essential that this <hi>Sacrament</hi> is ordinarly <hi>denominat</hi> by it in <hi>Scripture.</hi> Indeed what the <hi>Priest</hi> takes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he breaks in three pieces, one whereof is cast into the <hi>Cup,</hi> another is left upon the <hi>Altar,</hi> until the end of the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> and the third he puts in his own <hi>Mouth:</hi> but this doth not answer to <hi>that breaking</hi> which our LORD used, and which is necessary to hold Forth the purport of the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> That this Action may be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our <hi>LORD'S institution,</hi> it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that all the <hi>Communicants</hi> eat and have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to them <hi>one broken Bread. 2ly.</hi> Our LORD ordain'd the Bread in this <hi>Sacrament</hi> to be only a <hi>symbol of his Body,</hi> but they give it out to be <hi>His very self,</hi> and command <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Adoration</hi> to be payed thereto, which is the greatest absurdity and the grossest <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> imaginable, as we have formerly made out. <hi>3ly.</hi> Our LORD designed this <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to be only a <hi>memorial of his Death,</hi> and of that <hi>satisfaction was given thereby to the Iustice of GOD for the sins of men:</hi> but they teach and command under pain of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to be believed, that in the<note place="margin">Vid. concil.

                        <hi>Lastly,</hi> besides these <hi>Impieties</hi> mentioned, whereof every one is actually guilty who joine in the <hi>Worship of the Church of Rome,</hi> there be a great many other errours, abuses, and corruptions taught and practised in that Church, which all they who keep her <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> must necessarly be reckoned guilty of: For as joyning in Worship is a sign of holding Communion, so thereby persons testify their belief of, and assent to all which
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:55045:214"/>
that Church with whom they hold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion teacheth and practiseth as necessary to <hi>Salvation.</hi> Now seeing the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> requireth all under pain of damnation to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>the infallibility of their Church, the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of the Pope, Purgatory, Auricular Confession, Pennances, Indulgences, the Insufficiency of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the equal Authority of Unwritten Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the unlawfulnesse of Clergy Mens Marrying, the necessity of observing Dayes, Meats,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Without particular dispensations from the Pope, who arrogates to himself a power of rescinding both Humane and Divine Laws,</hi> these and many more Falseshoods and Absurdities are enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the <hi>Roman Church</hi> as <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> and as <hi>necessary to Salvation,</hi> and therefore who keep communion with her, do <hi>ipso facto</hi> approve of all her Errours and Abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and must be thought to exclude from <hi>Salvation</hi> those who refuse to submit thereto, for she doth so. It will not availe any to say, that in their <hi>Private judgement</hi> they are otherwise perswaded, neither have made any expresse Verbal Acknowledgement to the contrary, seeing they do that which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarly import the same.

our Profession or Practice. Hypocrisy in <hi>Religion</hi> is damnable, and they are Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crits who professe what they do not beleive: The belief of the Heart and confession with the mouth should not be disjoined, neither ought we by our Actions to countenance what we judge false and abominable. This I thought fit to say, because it is a trick used to gain persons to the <hi>Roman Communion,</hi> if otherwise they cannot be induced, to pass them a formal abjuration of the <hi>Protestant Doctrine,</hi> or an expresse consent to all the Tenets of that <hi>Church:</hi> But such would do well to remember and consider, that they do the one and the other, really and upon the matter as much as if they gave more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse Declarations. <hi>I</hi> shall conclude with these words of <hi>Scripture</hi> which certainly are as applicable to the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> as ever they were or will be to any. <hi>Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the LORD, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my Sons and Daughters, saith the LORD Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty;</hi> 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 6. 17, 18.

                  <p>THat GOD is to be <hi>Worshipped and Adored,</hi> that there should be <hi>Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to please Him,</hi> will be readily acknowledged by All: This is the very <hi>Dictate of Natural Conscience,</hi> and who have no <hi>Sense</hi> thereof, nor own any Obligation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, must needs be very Profligate and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched. And though it cannot be denyed, but that there are such Monsters of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness who have no <hi>Fear of GOD before their eyes,</hi> yet it must be confessed also, that the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Mankind</hi> as they <hi>profess and believe in GOD,</hi> so they seem to wish and be desirous <hi>of His Favour and Good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>wil.</hi> It is not then gross <hi>Atheism</hi> and <hi>Infidelit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </hi> which damnes and undoes the greatest part of the World: but the <hi>Rock upon which Men split most is Hypocrisie,</hi>
                     <pb n="420" facs="tcp:55045:216"/>
and the want of <hi>sincerity in serving GOD.</hi> They would please him, and are content to do something in order to it, but yet have not a Heart to ply all that is requisite: thus they will observe the <hi>smaller</hi> and <hi>lesser</hi> part of the <hi>Law,</hi> but in the mean time slip over what is more Weighty and of Greater Moment; they are very ready and willing to pay that Service which is cheap and easie, and which puts them neither to great pains, nor much cost, but what imports and includes either they are averse to and shrink from. Some will be very <hi>Religious</hi> whilst it is counted <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> to <hi>hear the Word of GOD,</hi> to read it and talk of it, to pray and to frequent the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ordinances of the Gospel,</hi> but when they are told of <hi>denying themselves, of taking up the Cross, of Mortifying the body, Subduing lust, Bridling their passions,</hi> and particularly, <hi>of distributing their goods to the poor,</hi> then they discover the Naughtiness &amp; Hollowness of their Heart, how much they <hi>mock GOD and deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:</hi> for they look upon these as hard say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and cannot digest them, but with the <hi>Young Man in the Gospel, they turn away sad and sorrowful.</hi> Such will seem sometimes to contend earnestly for Heaven, but yet they keep a fast hold of the Earth; they seem ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry zealous for the <hi>service of GOD</hi> so long as it
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:55045:216"/>
costs them nothing, but when Chargeable &amp; Expensive Duties are required, then they find out many Shifts &amp; Excuses, they either pretend the non-necessity of them, or their own inability; and when none of these can be pretended, they still delay and put off till another time, and 'tis very long before they can be drawn to the Performance; &amp; some never think it time to bequeath any of their Goods to Pious and Charitable <hi>uses till Death,</hi> that 'tis impossible for them to hold them any longer.</p>
                  <p>This Pievish and nigardly disposition to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Service of GOD</hi> is very far contrary to what the holy <hi>Patriarch Iacob</hi> sheweth here, where we see that as he devoted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to GOD, so heartily and freely the <hi>Tenth</hi> of all that he possessed, By giving this <hi>portion to GOD,</hi> we are to understand the allotting and Setling a part the same for such Ends and Uses as tendeth to the <hi>Honour and Glory of GOD,</hi> such as to the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his House, and his service therein, and to the relief of the Poor and Indigent, for whatsoever is imployed this way, <hi>is given unto GOD:</hi> We cannot reach <hi>himself</hi> immediatly with our Presents &amp; Gifts, <hi>nor stands he in any need of them,</hi> but the LORD is pleased to take <hi>that as done to himself, which</hi>
                     <pb n="422" facs="tcp:55045:217"/>
                     <hi>is done for the publick good of Mankind,</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly for the relief and comfort of such as are in Poverty and Distress: <hi>Verily I say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>in as much as ye have done it to one of the least of these my Brethren, ye have done it unto me; Mat:</hi> 25. 40.</p>
                  <p>I doubt not but upon the first view of the title of this Book, it will be apprehended that we intend to assert the <hi>Churches Right to the Tithes,</hi> but as this is a <hi>Doctrine</hi> which few are disposed to hear, so the entering upon this Question would but oblidge us to enlarge this Treatise beyond what we design'd it, and seing a discourse of this head is fitter to be addressed to <hi>Publick States,</hi> than to <hi>private &amp; particular persons,</hi> for whose use only we have intended this, therefore we resolve not to meddle with this Question. However <hi>by the by,</hi> we cannot but say, that whatever may be pretended by the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> or the <hi>Written Law of GOD,</hi> it is certain that our <hi>Tithes</hi> were <hi>Sacred and Consecrate things, by the Donation and Charity of Men;</hi> and therefore ought never to have been ali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="423" facs="tcp:55045:217"/>
rectified without taking away the use of the things themselves, and certainly the <hi>Sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious robbing of GOD</hi> of what was so <hi>Solemnly</hi> and for so many <hi>Years Devoted unto him,</hi> is such a stain upon our <hi>Reformation,</hi> as that our <hi>Orthodox Faith</hi> and the soundness of our Judgements, in other Particulars Will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attone or sufficiently wipe away; these words of <hi>St. Paul,</hi> seem to touch us very nearly, <hi>thou that abhorests Idols, dost thou commit Sacriledge, Rom:</hi> 2: 22: The <hi>brasen Censers</hi> which <hi>Corah</hi> and <hi>his complices</hi> made use of; though their use of them was not only unwarrantable, but even contrary to the <hi>expresse command of GOD,</hi> yet the LORD would not suffer them to be cast away, or to be turned unto any other use than that of the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> but commanded to make of them <hi>Broade plates</hi> for a covering of the Altar: <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>they offered them before the Lord, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are hallowed; Numb.</hi> 16. 38. So notwithstanding the great abuse of those things which the <hi>Church</hi> possessed in the <hi>times of Poperie,</hi> yet being they were once dedica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> unto the Lord, therefore they ought never to have been imployed to other than <hi>Sacred uses.</hi> I say, <hi>sacred uses,</hi> and not the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the Gospel only,</hi> for I confess the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriating all that <hi>Wealth to the present small</hi>

                     <hi>number of the Clergy, and to their particular use allennarly,</hi> were neither Reasonable nor Convenient: But as this Kingdom would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a greater number to serve in the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,</hi> so it would be fit and proper to bestow a better Maintenance upon some then what they enjoy. People testifie their respect to GOD, when they Honour His <hi>Servants,</hi> in allowing them a Liberal Maintenance, and indeed as a liberal Share is first due to the <hi>Ministers of the Gospel,</hi> and such as <hi>officiat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Holy Things;</hi> so this might have been given out of what the <hi>Church</hi> formerly pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed, and enough besides for other <hi>pious uses.</hi> Out of what remained, <hi>Hospitals</hi> might have been maintained for <hi>Sick</hi> and <hi>Diseased Persons,</hi> and for a Refuge for such as were decayed through Age or other Infirmitie, and thereby rendred unable for any Calling or Office, there might have been an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance for Widows and Orphans, and the training up Children in Lawful Trades, and some Charitable Banks erected for lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Supplies to such, as were broken in their Fortunes, whereby they might Recruite themselves, and be enabled to set up again. I am confident the former <hi>Church Revenues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and <hi>consecrated Lands</hi> would have been almost sufficient for these things, and this use there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:55045:218"/>
will I think be acknowledged more for the <hi>publick good</hi> then what they were imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto: And as this would have made less complaining in our Streets, so it would, been more for the <hi>Honour of our Reformation,</hi> and would have stoped the mouthes of our <hi>Adversaries,</hi> whereas now they Cry out, <hi>that the Zeal for the Reformation was not Sincere,</hi> but that there was <hi>more regard to the spoiles of the Church, then to the taking away the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof;</hi> for which the Pious Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> and some others, are very confident, <hi>GOD will some time or other signifie his displeasure by some signal judgement,</hi> and indeed Sacriledge seldome or never passed unpunished. But enough of this.</p>
                  <p>What we intend at present is, First, to shew that every <hi>Particular Person owes to GOD a part of his Estate and Fortune, and that GOD doth require and expect it from him. 2ly</hi> we shal consider what Proportion or Quality every one should think themselves oblidged to give. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> we shall propose some Motives for pressing home, and stirring up to the Practice of this necessary, but I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose much neglected Duty.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>First, that every one owes a part of his estate and fortune, to be thus imployed in the exercise of Charity towards Men,</hi> is a thing
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:55045:219"/>
which will easily appear by the Laws of Justice and Gratitude; <hi>for all that we have is from GOD,</hi> what ever we possess comes from His Bounty, and is the effects of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, by whatsoever Means and Methods it hath come unto us. Was thy inheritance intail'd upon the <hi>By birth,</hi> thou art neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less oblidged to GOD allennerly for it, for it was his Providence who Ordered thee to be born in Lawful <hi>Wedlock</hi> of such Rich and Wealthy Parents, it was he alone that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thus for thee before thou hadst a beeing, and before thou could'st make any choice for thy self. Is all the Fruit of thy Labour and industry? Though it be so, yet it doth not lessen they Obligation to GOD, for he gave thee, the Wit and the Head by which thou hast contrived, and the hands by which thou hast wrought and laboured; and his Wisdom did appoint and find out all those <hi>Favourable Circumstances</hi> which have been the occasion of they Prosperity and success; and it is his Providence alone which hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented those many Casualities, which might have devested thee of all, so that if it had not been for Him, thou mightest long agoe been stript naked and reduced to a piece of Bread. How many have gone to Bed rich and wealthy and have awakned
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:55045:219"/>
poor and Miserable? have we not seen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons turned out of their possessions, and rob'd of all their Wealth; and who have not been so dealt with must ascribe it to the Goodness and Care of GOD toward them. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what ever Wealth or Riches, Honour or Advantages any man enjoyeth, is still to be considered as the Gift and Gratuity of <hi>Almightie GOD,</hi> as <hi>Iacob</hi> doth here: For he saith <hi>not, all that I have, or shall have, but all that thou shalt give me;</hi> Acknowledging thereby that whatsoever should accrew to him by whatsoever means would be never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless GOD'S doings. But when I say by <hi>whatsoever means,</hi> it is still to be understood of lawfull means, for what cometh by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull wayes, as by fraud and violence &amp;c. Is not from GOD, but from him who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to our Saviour <hi>All the Kingdoms of the World if he would fall down and Worship him:</hi> And though a man should give all this to the Poor, and in Charitable uses, it would not be accepted, it would be but an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                  <p>But to return, if all be owing to the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine bountie,</hi> it is just and reasonable, and our bound Duty to allot and consecrate a part to his Glory. We are unworthy receivers of his Benefits if we do not thanfully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:55045:220"/>
his Goodness in bestowing them; and without such an acknowledgement we cannot pretend to a right or sanctified use of them: For the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us, <hi>every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of GOD is good, if it be received with thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,</hi> and not otherwayes, which thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full acknowledgment must be made not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly verbally, by Speeches and Expressions, but by real works &amp; deeds, <hi>viz.</hi> by devoting a certain part of what we enjoy to such pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous uses as he hath appointed. As <hi>Tenements</hi> own their <hi>Land-Lords,</hi> by paying their yearly rent, and <hi>Subjects</hi> their <hi>Soveraigne</hi> by yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tribute, so it is no le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>s our Duty to <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour GOD with our substance</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 9. It was thus to honour GOD by acknowledging him to be the LORD and Giver of all, that <hi>David</hi> with the Princes and Captains of <hi>Israel</hi> made these great offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for building the Temple of the LORD, and the service of the Sanctuary which we find 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. for verse 11. David saith <hi>thine O LORD is the greatness, and the Power, and the Glory, and the Victory, and the Majestie, for all that is in the Heaven and Earth is thine, thine is the Kingdom O LORD, and thou art exalted as Head above all: both Riches and Honour come of thee, and thou Reignest over all, and in thy hand is power and might, and in thy Hand it is to</hi>
                     <pb n="429" facs="tcp:55045:220"/>
                     <hi>make great and to give strength unto all; now therefore our GOD we thank thee, and praise thy Glorious Name, and of thine own have we given thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as Reason teacheth it to be just, thus to honour and acknowledge GOD, by consecrating a part of our Substance to his Glory, and for his use, so there never was a time wherein GOD did not particularly require it. In the State of Innocency there was not occasion for almes or other such pious uses as now, but the tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the midst of the Garden was reserv'd to GOD as holy in token that he was Lord of the Garden; and therefore was man cast out of Paradise and had the earth cursed for his sake because he had violated the sign of his Fealtie unto the LORD of Heaven and Earth. After the fall untill the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> we do not indeed find any expresse particular precept for making such offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of our substance to GOD, but yet all holy men did it; <hi>Iacob</hi> you see here vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and <hi>Abraham</hi> gave <hi>the tenth of his Spoil to Melchisedeck the high Priest of GOD.</hi> And though reason and the meer light of nature, might teach them that something was due and proper to be given, yet we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, how they could come to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend so generally upon such a Particular
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:55045:221"/>
Portion without learning it by Divine reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. In the law of <hi>Moses</hi> the <hi>Tithes</hi> of all things are expresly Commanded to be payed as an acknowledgment of GOD'S being the Proprietar of the whole Earth, and that men hold their possessions only by his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and good will therefore <hi>Deut:</hi> 26. As there is a Command for paying <hi>Tithes,</hi> and bringing the <hi>First Fruits</hi> as an offering unto the house of the LORD, so there is set down the particular confession to be made at these Offerings in which is shewed the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for requiring them <hi>viz:</hi> That even GOD'<hi>S Tittle</hi> to the whole land might be acknowledged, and that he might thereby be moved to bless the possession thereof to them, seing that they thus own him to be their <hi>LORD and GOD.</hi> Now as for the <hi>Gospel,</hi> this <hi>Precept</hi> is not renewed in it; and the Ceremonies of <hi>Bringing up to the house of GOD, the first Fruits of our encrease and what is due out of our Substance,</hi> doth not much concern us: But though the <hi>Ceremonial part</hi> of this <hi>Precept</hi> be not now obligatorie, yet the <hi>Moral</hi> thereof is; for CHRIST hath not taken away our Obligation to these <hi>moral observances,</hi> which the Honour of GOD calls for, <hi>think not,</hi> saith he, <hi>that I am come to destroy the Law or the Prophets, I am not come to</hi>
                     <pb n="431" facs="tcp:55045:221"/>
                     <hi>destroy, but to fulfil; Matth.</hi> 5. 17. There is not indeed in the <hi>New Testament</hi> such <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent</hi> and particular <hi>mention</hi> of making these <hi>offerings</hi> by <hi>way of Tribute</hi> unto GOD, because there we are not considered as in a <hi>Servile State,</hi> by the <hi>Gospel</hi> GOD hath exalted us to <hi>the Nobler State of Friends and Children,</hi> and deals with us as such, which yet doth not take away our <hi>obligation</hi> from paying <hi>necessary Duties,</hi> whereof the thing we are now speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about is one. And though as we have said the <hi>Devoting some portion of our Goods,</hi> be not now called so <hi>by way of Tribute</hi> as from <hi>Servants</hi> or <hi>Subjects,</hi> yet the thing it self is very often injoyned and inculcated, <hi>viz. of Almes giving, Beneficencie,</hi> and <hi>Works of Charity</hi> &amp; <hi>Mercie,</hi> &amp; though <hi>the phrase of give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Almes be generally used, yet it is so spoken of, as to let us understand that it is a debt due unto GOD which we are unjust if we do not pay: for it is usually Styled <hi>Ius<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice</hi> or <hi>Righteousness,</hi> as <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.</p>
                  <p>We must not think that GOD hath now under the <hi>Gospel</hi> quit his <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Tittle</hi> to our Goods and Possessions, or that he doth not require any acknowledgment of them from us; we are much mistaken if we think so, He requires this now as much as ever; and therefore to this end it is, that
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:55045:222"/>
his <hi>Providence continues to Poor and Distressed persons in the World,</hi> and other occasions of doing good. <hi>Ye have;</hi> saith our <hi>Saviour, the Poor alwayes with you; Mat:</hi> 26. 11. Which is the repetition of a <hi>Promise</hi> made <hi>Deut:</hi> 15. 11. Where it is said <hi>The Poor shall never cease out of the land, tberefore I command thee, saying, thou shalt open thy hand wide unto thy brother, to thy Poor, and thy Needy, in thy land.</hi> The <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>Distressed</hi> are GOD'S <hi>Assignes,</hi> to them he hath assigned the <hi>Debts we owe Him;</hi> or we may look upon them as <hi>his Chamberlanes</hi> whom he hath appointed to take up his Rents; by them he doth as 'twere <hi>Draw Bills</hi> upon us for what is due to himself, and when they aske us in <hi>GOD'S Name,</hi> 'tis no Forgery, they have GOD'S Warrant and Commission for it: Wherefore as the Wise man teacheth, <hi>with hold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.</hi> Prov: 3: 27. <hi>Thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy Poor Brother saith the LORD, but thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shall surely lend him sufficient for his need in that which he wanteth. Deut:</hi> 15. 7. The Poor and Needy are GOD'<hi>S Altars,</hi> whereon we must <hi>offer Sacrifice;</hi> and seing he hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down these other Altars of stone which
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:55045:222"/>
were <hi>under the Law,</hi> and hath freed us from the burden of these many <hi>expensive Sacrifices</hi> which were then required, we should not take in our hand, nor be sparing in the <hi>works of Charity and Mercy,</hi> but should look upon our selves as oblidg'd in all justice and Gratitude to abound in them the more Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally. GOD hath not abrogat <hi>Sacrifices</hi> and <hi>Oblations</hi> altogether, but only chang'd the use of them, and the way and manner of offering them; he will have them offered upon <hi>Living Altars,</hi> for the greater Comfort and delight of the Sons of Men: and as by the <hi>Law</hi> many <hi>Sacrifices</hi> and <hi>Offerings</hi> were exacted of the <hi>Worshippers,</hi> so the <hi>Gospel</hi> now requires <hi>Almes and charitable deeds no lesse;</hi> and <hi>as under the Law, he who contemned sacrifices, and refused oblations, was not counted Religious to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards GOD, but without all fear of Him;</hi> so now under the <hi>Gospel,</hi> they must be reckoned void of all <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Devotion.</hi> who do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press it by works of <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> which are our <hi>Spiritual Sacrifices</hi> for <hi>St. Iames</hi> tells us, <hi>that pure Religion and undefiled before GOD, and the Father is to visite the Fatherless, and Widows in their affliction, and to keep our selves unspotted from the World.

                  <p>Thus we have made out our <hi>obligation to devote some part of our Goods to GOD,</hi> that is to

                  <p>Now in finding out the <hi>true proportion of our Alms and Charity,</hi> as we must consider
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:55045:224"/>
our own Ability and <hi>God's bounty</hi> towards us, so we must distinguish between ordinary and extraordinary Occasions: for neither can all Men give alike, nor is any oblidged to the same measure at all times. Men are bound to be more Liberal and Charitable in times of great Dearth, Famine and Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, when many People are ready to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish for want at such Occasions, there is no other set rule but the necessities of People, which every one who hath must be careful to administer unto. Then these Precepts, <hi>Go sell all that thou hast, and give unto the poor.

                     </gap> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; but he is an unjust Steward, who let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any want or perish for hunger, if he hath beside him wherewith to supply them. Hence 'twas that the Disciples and the first <hi>Converts to Christianity,</hi> did sell their whole
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:55045:224"/>
possessions and gave them to the <hi>Treasury of the poor:</hi> they had all things then in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and it is <hi>St. Pauls</hi> advice to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, that every man lay by in store what God hath prospered him, viz. For the poor,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2. which rule and practice is not alwayes binding, nor are any now tyed to follow the same unless we were in the same circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</p>
                  <p>But leaving what is extraordinary, we will speak to that which men are oblidg'd to, even when there is no such great or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Calamity: As in times of Dearth and Famine all must be given, if it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary; so even at other times, we must be carefull to devote somthing to God, and the use of his <hi>poor Servants.</hi> That proportion which <hi>Iacob vowed</hi> here, was the practice of all the Patriarchs and <hi>Servants of God before the Law:</hi> When the Law was given by <hi>Moses,</hi> God required the <hi>first fruits</hi> of all things, and <hi>one Tithe</hi> for the use of the <hi>Priests and Levites;</hi> he commanded also <hi>another Tithe</hi> every third year for the use of the poor <hi>Deut.</hi> 14. 28. The first <hi>Tithe</hi> was <hi>Debitum fundi,</hi> the tribute upon the Land, and may be called GOD'S <hi>ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>rent,</hi> or <hi>Few duty</hi> which the very Land owed to him: The other <hi>Tithe</hi> was <hi>Debitum Personae,</hi> which every

one owed out of his own property, thereby to make an acknowledgment of God's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and kindness to him, in allowing him Possessions while others wanted.</p>
                  <p>But besides this <hi>Trienial Tithe,</hi> they were ordained every year <hi>to leave the corners of their field at Harvest,</hi> &amp; were forbiden either to reap the rest of their field clean, or to gather all the fruit of their Vine yards, but to leave in them for the poor, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 9. And moreover every <hi>seventh year,</hi> the poor and Stranger had the whole profite of all the land. see, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 11. All which reckoned together, the <hi>Iews</hi> besides the <hi>Tithes</hi> to the <hi>Priests</hi> &amp; other Publick Dues, will be found to have payed more then the tenth of their <hi>yearly incomes</hi> for the use of the poor only. Which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, though it be not exacted by any expresse positive Law repeated in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> yet all Good and Holy Persons have ever look'd upon themselves as oblidg'd to it in strict Justice, seing the <hi>Iews</hi> were tyed to it. Some offered to prove <hi>Tithes</hi> due to GOD from the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> but I could never see any forcible argument why either the <hi>tenth</hi> of our Estate, or the <hi>seventh of our time</hi> should be allotted and condescended on if we abstract from <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> and the expresse Command of GOD: certainly a
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:55045:225"/>
one concerning the proportion of our time so the other which measures the quantity of our Goods and Estate, hath been fallen upon by the particular direction of GOD himself. And therefore seing the <hi>Worshippers of GOD</hi> under the <hi>Old Testament</hi> were oblidg'd to give the <hi>tenth</hi> of all they possessed, I cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand how any can be satisfyed with giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lesse under the <hi>New Testament.</hi> Our Righteousness must not come short of those <hi>under the Law, I say unto you, saith CHRIST, that except your righteousness exceed the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Scribes and Pharis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

GOD for the property, when we are oblidg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give the other to men for the simple loan and use. Sure none will refuse this, or think it too much after they have seriously considered the matter, but such as are too much oblidg'd to the World, and are but too little sensible of their obligations to Love and Honour GOD. How small a matter is an 100 <hi>Merks</hi> to him whom GOD hath Blessed with a 1000 free of yearly Rent? He who hath much over and above the Payment of Publick and Particular Burdens, may very well let one go to the poor in Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his <hi>Thankfulness to GOD who giveth all Liberally. But would to GOD!</hi> That Men in his <hi>Degenerate Age</hi> could be prevailed on to give the <hi>fifteenth</hi> or <hi>sixteenth part</hi> of their <hi>yearly gain</hi> and <hi>incomes,</hi> which is but the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Ordinary annual-rent of Money</hi> in this <hi>Countrey:</hi> &amp; unless they be resolved to baulke this <hi>Duty of Charity</hi> altogether I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not understand how they can satisfy their Consciences with lesse then this comes to; if they will not be convinc'd of their Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to pay the <hi>tenth,</hi> yet I hope at least they will acknowledge themselves bound to be <hi>as Thankful to GOD as to Man,</hi> and to return him as much for the Property as they give to, and exact of others for the Loan and use. If
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:55045:226"/>
one were borrowing a 1000 <hi>Merks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> he would give <hi>Fourty Pounds</hi> in the year for it; now he who hath a <hi>Thousand merks per annum free,</hi> I think should be ashamed to offer less then <hi>fourty pounds</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> or indeed to give so little.</p>
                  <p>I suppose my <hi>Reader</hi> before this time is convinc'd of the necessity of Obeying and Honouring GOD, and that the <hi>Communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a part of our goods for the use of the Poor,</hi> &amp;c. Is one instance of our Obedience, and one necessary way of <hi>Honouring him:</hi> Now he who is thus convinc'd, may be easily perswaded of his Obligations not to reckon with God too narrowly or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly; but that he ought to be as free and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral in the Expressions of his <hi>Thankfulness</hi> as GOD is to him in the effects of his Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Every one hath more then he deserves, and the rich have more then they can law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ask, for <hi>Daylie Bread</hi> is all we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to Pray for, and considering what Sinners we are, t'is more then we are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of, and therefore when GOD hears our <hi>Lawful Desires,</hi> yea gives beyond them, I think common Equity should teach us to deall with him in like manner, and to give back more, at least as much as he seeks from us, that is, I think we should not hesitate at the <hi>Tenth,</hi> but give even over and above,
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:55045:227"/>
if our <hi>Circumstances</hi> will allow it: If we think the quantity of our Charity be wholly left to our own Discretion, then should not the Rules of Discretion teach us to give rather more then what would be sought? Now the <hi>tenth</hi> was required before the <hi>Law</hi> and under <hi>the Law,</hi> and there can be no Reason pretended why it should be abated under the <hi>Gospel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let me therefore entreat all who would keep a Conscience void of offence in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, to consider how GOD hath Blessed them, what is their yearly Rent, Gain, or Income to give <hi>GOD His due</hi> out of the same freely and Chearfully. And whatsoever they purpose in their Heart to give, I would advise them to set it a part by it self, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate it from what is reserved to their own use, for hereby several Advantages would arise. <hi>First,</hi> They shall be sure to make no encroachment on what they <hi>Devote to GOD,</hi> which would be no lesse then the <hi>Heinous sin of Sacriledge. 2ly.</hi> They should hereby give more Readily and Chearfully, because they have so much by them, for no other use then to be given. <hi>3ly.</hi> This would make them seek out occasions of bestowing Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and not wait until Occasions present themselves which is an Ordinary fault, and
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:55045:227"/>
the Reason why this Duty is so seldome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; who devotes a certain part of their Goods and estate to GOD, should do as Men use when they have Mony of a Friend, even seek out Good hands to lay it in.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps 'twill be best to pay this Debt to GOD in <hi>Parcels</hi> as our gain and Advantages come in; for as hereby we shall best know whither we doe justly agreeable to our vow or purpose, so 'twill be more convenient, &amp; a lesse Tentation to grudging, then if all were payed together. And besides what we think fit thus to <hi>Consecrate to GOD,</hi> for his <hi>Ordinary constant Kindness to us,</hi> 'twill be proper to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large our hand on special Occasions, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the receit of some <hi>particular Mercy,</hi> or in time of Sickness or other Affliction, that we may give a Testimony of joy and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness for the first, and secure some <hi>Special comfort</hi> to our selves in the last case.</p>
                  <p>Some it may be will imagine that all this doth only concern the Rich and Wealthy, but let none be so mistaken. These indeed are especially Oblidged to give Almes, or rather they are Oblidged to large and <hi>Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Measures:</hi> But others are not exeemed from <hi>Works</hi> of Charity, this is a Duty incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on all. Who have Much, must give Much, who have much of this Worlds
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:55045:228"/>
Gods and Little to do with them, are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidged to bestow more this way then those of equal Fortune, but who have more to do with it, as having more Children, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Oblidg'd to keep a greater retinue: but even all who are not themselves objects of Charity are oblidged to contribute some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the relief of the Poor and indigent thereby to testify their Homage to, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon God; and if Persons be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they easily may render themselves able to do either more or less. They who live on their proper industry, and have nothing but as they earn it, may lay by a dayes or half dayes work in the Week, &amp; Servants who work to others may give a part of their Wages, or one or two Meals a week; and if every one study to enable themselves, and give according to their Ability, though it be little 'twill be as acceptable as the gifts of the Rich. I never saw the meaner sort of People, even such as seem scarce to have their necessaries, but they would find out some shift for Money when they had a Friends or Neighbours Marriage to go to, and sure if they were as intent upon <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Deeds,</hi> they might take the same course to enable them thereto. The want of abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity therefore proceeds too often from the
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:55045:228"/>
want of will, 'tis because we think not our selves Oblidged to doe Good, or that 'tis enough if we do any though never so little: but we should consider that we ought to lay our selves out to this, we should be industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in this matter, and ought to endeavor as much to be Rich in <hi>good Works,</hi> as to be <hi>Rich in Worldly goods;</hi> nay the main Reason why we should Labour to be rich towards the World, is that we may be <hi>Rich towards GOD,</hi> and that we may have to give to them that need.</p>
                  <p>Which leads me to the <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>Last thing</hi> proposed, <hi>viz:</hi> to give some Motives to Perswade and Excite to the Exercise of this <hi>Duty of Charity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>First,</hi> we shall begin with what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed should be the <hi>Chief end</hi> of such <hi>good works,</hi> and <hi>alms-deeds,</hi> and <hi>the Principle</hi> from which they should flow, <hi>viz:</hi> The <hi>Love of GOD and desire of pleasing him.</hi> Though one would give never so much this way, even all his goods to feed the Poor, if 'twere not out of <hi>Love to GOD,</hi> 'twould profite nothing, he would neither find Acceptance nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: But as what we do of this kind should be out of <hi>Love to GOD,</hi> so if we have any <hi>Sincere Love</hi> to him, any true Regard for him, any Hearty desire to infinuate our

selves in his Favour, we cannot but be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to, and much set upon the works of <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Mercy:</hi> Because he Delights in these things, is well pleased with them, and truly oblidged by them. <hi>To doe good and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municat forget not, saith St. Paul, for with such sacrifices GOD is well pleased, Heb:</hi> 13. 16. And writing to the <hi>Philippians</hi> of the supply they sent him, he tells them <hi>'twas an odour of Sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to GOD. Phil:</hi> 4. 18.

But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if we have any <hi>love to him</hi> for the many <hi>Blessings Spiritual</hi> &amp; <hi>Temporal</hi> bestowed on us, or be desirous to secure his Kindness for the time to come; we will exercise our selves in acts of <hi>Charity,</hi> seing they are so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him. Every good and <hi>Charitable deed</hi> gratifies GOD, and endears us to him; hereby we both requite his <hi>past Favour,</hi> and also secure his <hi>future love.</hi> O how fond are People of Occasions of oblidging Kings, Princes, and other great Persons?

                     <hi>Thirdly, Charity</hi> is a <hi>God-like thing,</hi> it makes a Man truly resemble GOD in the most Lovely of his Attributes (if I may be allowed to speak so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) GOD'S <hi>Omnipotence</hi> and <hi>Omniscience</hi> are proper Objects of fear and Reverence, but 'tis the consideration of
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:55045:230"/>
his Goodness which especially begets our <hi>Love to him;</hi> yea 'tis this which makes him most Glorious, therefore when he shewed his Glory to <hi>Moses,</hi> he did it by proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Name, <hi>the LORD GOD, Merciful, and Gracious, long suffering, and abundant in goodness,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Exod:</hi> 34. 6. Because <hi>Goodness</hi> is the chiefest of the <hi>Divine Attributes,</hi> therefore the rest are set on work for the manifestation thereof; his Wisdom contrives, and his Power Acts, that by both he may shew his Goodness, <hi>his Mercies are over all his Works.</hi> Now as 'twill be acknowledged the <hi>Highest Perfection</hi> to be <hi>like GOD</hi> so the best and truest <hi>Likeness to him</hi> is to study to be <hi>good and Merciful</hi> as he is <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Merciful:</hi> Though we could come to some resemblance of his Wisdom and Power, 'twould neither <hi>endear us to Him,</hi> nor to others, so much as the imitation of his Goodness. Who therefore would be <hi>Like GOD,</hi> who are Acted with such an <hi>High</hi> and <hi>holy Ambition,</hi> let them busie themselves in <hi>doing good,</hi> and according to their Power let them abound in <hi>Works of Charity</hi> and <hi>Mercy:</hi> For hereby they shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come partakers of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and shall purchase a right to the same <hi>Tittles</hi> which GOD takes to himself in <hi>Scripture,</hi> and indeed glories in, as <hi>the Father of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
                     <pb n="450" facs="tcp:55045:231"/>
                     <hi>and Comforts, the Helper of the helpless, the Reliever of the needy, &amp; such as are distressed, &amp;c.</hi> The half of the Money which some lay out for Worldly <hi>Tittles</hi> would procure these <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Designations,</hi> which are by far preferrable, and upon many considerations more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> this Duty <hi>of Charity</hi> is most pleasant and taking, 'tis not more for the Comfort of the distressed, then 'tis for the satisfaction of the <hi>Charitable Man</hi> himself: wherefore our <hi>Saviour</hi> said, <hi>It is more blessed to give then to receive; Acts</hi> 20. 35. Acts of Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Charity truly rejoice the Heart, and fill the Soul with large measures of solid joy; there is far more Joy in <hi>Spiritual Exercises,</hi> then in any other; other pleasures are but <hi>skin deep,</hi> they are only some Titillations in the Body which soon evanish; but the Joy which results from Vertue and <hi>Religious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises</hi> peirceth the Heart, and causeth the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Spirit to exult: and there is in Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar a special Pleasure in doing Good. As the desires of doing Good are of all other the Noblest, which made a <hi>Heathen Poet</hi> to call them <hi>Sensus pars Optima Nostri,</hi> so certainly the fulfilling thereof is attended with the Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Satisfaction, has a gust and relish proper to delight a <hi>Heaven born Soul.</hi> 'Tis but small
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:55045:231"/>
delight which cometh from dainty Morsels, quaffing of Healths, for these are Bruitish ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises and inferiour to the Dignity <hi>of our Natures:</hi> But to <hi>feed the hungry, to afford drink to the thirsty Soul,</hi> to <hi>cloath the naked,</hi> to <hi>comfort those who mourn,</hi> to <hi>save the life which is ready to perish,</hi> and other the like <hi>Charitable deeds,</hi> are Exercises <hi>worthy of GOD himself,</hi> he delights in them, and how can it but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and rejoyce us to be so Nobly and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely imployed? If Men have reared up magnificent <hi>Structures,</hi> great <hi>Buildings,</hi> and made fine Gardens about them, they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to contemplate them with vanity, as <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnedzar</hi> did his <hi>Babylon,</hi> saying, <hi>Is not this great Babylon which I built:</hi> O how mean a thing is it to be vain of these works which Wind and Weather can deface, Storms batter down, and time wear out! But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there is Reason to rejoyce in being instrumental to rear up <hi>living fabricks,</hi> to repair the <hi>Temples of the Holy Ghost,</hi> and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve those who are capable to <hi>sound forth the praises of GOD to all Eternity.</hi> If People will but consult their Reason, and reflect on their own little Experience, they cannot but be perswaded of the unspeakable Pleasure <hi>in doing Good, in contributing seasonable comfort and relief to their fellow Brethren,</hi> in being able
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:55045:232"/>
to step in and pull them out of some <hi>Sad Straite,</hi> or to hold off the weight of a Crosse whose pressure is likely to fill them with excessive grief: 'Tis only the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this pleasure, which makes Worldly Greatness desireable or Supportable, for abstracting from this, 'tis an uselesse burden, and a great impertinence which a Wise Man would shun and seek to be rid of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly, Acts of Charity and Bounty</hi> are most profitable; and that upon many Accounts, <hi>First,</hi> they are Profitable, because hereby the Creatures of GOD are <hi>Sanctified</hi> to our use, and our enjoyment of them becomes Lawful, <hi>Every creature of GOD is good,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving;</hi> 1 Tim: 4: 4. The Creatures are only good then, when thanksgiving is Joined to the use of them, which thanksgiving doth consist in a deep sense of GODS Propriety in the Creatures, and of his goodness in bestowing them upon us, &amp; this sense must be expressed not only in Words but Deeds. The violating the Signs of GODS <hi>Dominion over the Creatures</hi> brought a curse upon them, for this cause <hi>the Earth was cursed to us;</hi> and this curse is not removed, but by returning to our Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, by making an acknowledgement of
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:55045:232"/>
GOD'S Right and Dominion, in paying the Tribute which is due, and which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires: The neglect of this keeps GOD from blessing our enjoyments, this is the reason why some as the <hi>Prophet Haggai</hi> speaks, <hi>sow much and bring little, eat but have not enough; drink but are not filled with drink; Cloath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves but are not warm; earn wages but 'tis put as 'twere into a bagge with holes Hag:</hi> 1: 6: And as the giving GOD his due, sanctifieth the Creatures by taking away the curse upon them, So it rendreth our enjoyment of them Lawful and Sweet. We may freely use the Creatures, may <hi>Eat our Meat with gladness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Singleness of heart,</hi> when we have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the Debt lying thereon, and payed the tribute of Gratitude we owe to GOD: But without this, our enjoyments can have no Delicious Relish, nor afford true satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: They are attended with remorse and sting of Conscience, as the feasting of <hi>Bankrupts,</hi> or the riotous living of <hi>Tennents,</hi> who have not payed their Masters rent. 'Tis not Lawfull to sit down to full Tables, to be alwayes Eating the fat, and drinking the Sweet, whiles there is no regard of those who are at the <hi>point of starving;</hi> 'tis not Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for any to ruffle it out in Silke, to hang their rooms with <hi>Arras</hi> &amp; other costly hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:55045:233"/>
whiles they see any perish for want of Cloathing, or any Poor without covering, and will not offer to help them, that <hi>their Loins may Blesse them</hi> as <hi>Iob</hi> speaks, 'Tis an heinous crime which will not pass unpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, <hi>to cast the Childrens Bread to Dogs;</hi> and are not they guilty of it who spend much on <hi>Dogs, Hawks,</hi> and other idle sports, but give nothing to the <hi>Supply of the Poor,</hi> the <hi>Fatherless,</hi> and <hi>Widow?</hi> But as the Enjoyments and pleasures of uncharitable Persons are unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and accursed, so who exerciseth <hi>Charity</hi> may lawfully indulge his desires, and allow himself what <hi>Innocent Comforts</hi> and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences this World affords.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, Charity</hi> is profitable for securing and preserving the Good things a Man hath; Every <hi>days experience may teach us the uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Earthly things;</hi> one may have much and soon come to Poverty; Fire, Violence, Treachery, and a thousand other Accidents, to which all are exposed, may very easily devest a man of his Wealth and Possessions, and 'tis impossible to prevent this, by our Foresight, Care, and Industry: our chief, yea, only security is in the <hi>Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> which we may lean to, if we testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy our thankfulness by acts of <hi>Charity and Bounty to the Poor.</hi> By giving to the <hi>Poor,</hi>
                     <pb n="455" facs="tcp:55045:233"/>
we <hi>clip the wings of Riches,</hi> so that they can not flee so fast from us: But if the Poor be not the better of our Wealth it wants the <hi>Divine protection,</hi> and so is altogether defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, it hath no sure hedge about it. By denying the <hi>Tribute of Charity</hi> we break our <hi>Tacks,</hi> forfeit our right by which we hold our Possessions: And as Masters use to turn out those <hi>Tennents</hi> who pay not their Rent, so GOD taketh away the good things of this World from them who do not use them to his Glory, not make any acknowledgment to him for them, or if he let them keep them, 'tis because he reserves them to a <hi>Heavier judgement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, Charity</hi> is profitable, because it tendeth to the encrease of our Wealth and Estate. As 'tis the best means to preserve our Fortune, so 'tis the likliest way to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large it: <hi>The Blessing of the LORD it maketh Rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it; Prov:</hi> 10. 22. Which Blessing is particularly entail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the <hi>Charitable Man,</hi> and therefore <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> having commanded to pay the <hi>Triennial Tithes</hi> to the Poor, addeth for an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragment, <hi>That the LORD thy GOD may blesse thee in all the work of thine hand which thou doest, Deut:</hi> 14: 29: Some are ready with <hi>Iudas</hi> to <hi>count all lost which comes not into heir own bagge,</hi> but what is given in <hi>Charity</hi>
                     <pb n="456" facs="tcp:55045:234"/>
is so far from losse, that 'tis great Gain, it returns with Usury. <hi>He that hath pity on the Poor, lendeth to the LORD, and that which he hath given will he pay him again. Prov:</hi> 19. 17. And that more may be expected then what is laid out we learn from many Texts in <hi>Scripture, The liberal Soul shall be made fat, and he that wattereth shall also be wattered himself, Prov.</hi> 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 25. Alms and Charitable Deeds may seem to impoverish us, but really they do it no otherwise then the <hi>Husband</hi> Mans throwing his Seed upon the Ground, which after some Moneths he receives with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease; <hi>There is that Scattereth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> saith <hi>Solomon, and yet encreaseth; and there is that withholdeth more then is meet, but it tendeth to Poverty.</hi> And because <hi>Charity</hi> contributes as much to Wealth as the ordinary way and Arts of Thriving, therefore he adviseth to use it, <hi>In the morning,</hi> saith <hi>he, sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand for thou knowest not whither shall prosper, either this or that, or whither they both shall be a like good. Ecel:</hi> 11: 6. Men indeed ought not to use <hi>Charity</hi> with this Design to be Rich, but neither need they be Discouraged from the Exercise thereof, for fear of redacting themselves to Poverty: for this is the ready way not only to prevent Poverty, but to ensure Wealth.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly, Charity</hi> is profitable in that it either prevents the <hi>days of evil</hi> or procures us

               <p>I Have now gone through both Parts of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob's Vow,</hi> and illustrated them by the <hi>Light of the Gospel,</hi> thereby to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate where our <hi>true Happiness lyeth,</hi> and by what Means we may compasse it, The Reason why <hi>Jacob's Vow</hi> was pitched on to afford Instructions in these Material Points, was because I judged it very propper, and that such Instructions as are drawn from Examples are the most convincing. Now that I may summ-up all which hath been said, As all will acknowledge that 'tis of the greatest im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to be rightly informed about <hi>Felicity,</hi> and the Means of accomplishing it, so every one may learn this necessary knowledge here. In the <hi>First Part,</hi> is laid out the <hi>Folly of being fond on the things of this World,</hi> of thinking Happiness depends on Wealth and Worldly greatness; For as the pursuit hereof is certain Slavery, Toile, and Vexation, and of very uncertain success, so when one is arrived to a more then ordinary Measure of these things, what is he the better?

The acceptance of these Duties, when we perform them, is only in and through <hi>Christ,</hi> as hath been made appear: But they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves necessary, even as necessary to obtain the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Enjoyment of GOD, as this is to procure Happiness. They neither understand what GOD is, nor have they right notions of <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> who think to arrive there any other way, <hi>without Holiness,</hi> saith the <hi>Apostle, no Man shall see the LORD.</hi> And the Duties spoken of are necessary parts of <hi>True Holiness,</hi> as will appear
<pb facs="tcp:55045:242"/>
to any who considers the account given of them.

Let me therefore earnestly entreat the <hi>Reader</hi> to give way to his Conviction, and to beware of letting either his former Inclinations and habits, or the Customes of others divert him from the Practice of what he is convinced is necessary to the obtaining <hi>True and Eternal Felicity.</hi> I shall not offer to perswade any to seek to be Happy, for this would be as vain and impertinent as to bid a hungry Man eat, or a Thirsty Man drink; but I would entreat all to consider that 'tis the height of madness to expect to be happy without using the means necessary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, even as 'twould be great folly in a Hungry or a Thirsty Man to desire the allaying of his Appetite without eating and Drinking. What is it which hinders you from closing with these Means of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse? What keeps you from observing the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties here enjoined? Do you think them unnecessary, that cannot be now pretended. Do you think them too much? What? Can there be too much Pains,

or Cost bestowed on <hi>Eternal and perfect Felicity</hi> None have Reason to grudge at these Conditions of Happiness, they are <hi>Just and Reasonable:</hi> This Service which GOD requires is no present Drudgery, and though 'twere, it could not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, seing so <hi>Glorious a Reward</hi> followes it, <hi>His yoke is easy,</hi> his <hi>Burden is Light,</hi> and this service he exacts is most Reasonable and desireable, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
