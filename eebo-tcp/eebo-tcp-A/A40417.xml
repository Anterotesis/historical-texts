            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>
               <hi>Free-men Inſlaved: OR,</hi> Reaſons humbly offered to the right Honorable, the Commons of <hi>England</hi> in Parliament aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, for the taking off the Exciſe upon <hi>BEER,</hi> and <hi>ALE.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> 
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecauſe the way of raiſing Money by Exciſe, is contrary to the Fundamental Laws of this Land, and never known to be practiſed in this Kingdom, until theſe late years of diſtraction and confuſion, it being alwayes thought in former Ages, by Free Parliaments, a more honorable and equal way of raiſing moneys for the ſupply of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties great Charges and Neceſſities by way of Subſidies and Fifteens, which charg'd onely thoſe of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Subjects who were moſt able, and had viſible Eſtates; Whereas this Levy by Exciſe, doth principally bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the poor, eſpecially that intollerable impoſt of four ſhillings in the pound on Beer and Ale.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe in the firſt attempts to introduce the Exciſe 3 <hi>Caroli,</hi> it was adjudged by that Parliament a horrible Monſter, that would devour Trade, and therefore rejected, And <hi>deci no ſexto Caroli,</hi> in four Declarations, Votes, and Remonſtrances, the Parliament then revived and approved of the former Judgement of Parliament againſt it. And in <hi>Octob.</hi> 1642. when it was but reported, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was about to impoſe Exciſe, the Parliament did then declare that thoſe that reported it, ſhould be brought to condign puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>O quantum mutatum ab illo!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Materials of Beer and Ale being of <hi>Engliſh</hi> growth, and that Commodity (next to Bread) the very ſtay and ſtaff of the poor; it will be moſt for the Nations advantage and encouragement of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufacturies, to take off all Impoſt from Native Commodities, and lay (in caſe of neceſſity) the charge by way of Subſidy and Fifteens, whereby it will be born by the abler ſort of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is moſt reaſonable that no greater ſum of money ſhould be raiſed upon the people, then will anſwer his Majeſties and the Kingdoms juſt Neceſſities; but in the collecting of this new Impoſt, one eighth part is waſted upon needleſs Officers; whereas the good old way by levying moneys by Subſidies and Fifteens, only known to our forefathers, brought in the whole into his Majeſties Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, at an inconſiderable expence, not exceeding two pence in the pound.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It will be eſteemed an act of high grace and great favour (as well as of Juſtice) to the impoveriſhed <hi>Brewers</hi> and <hi>Victuallers,</hi> and other poor diſtreſſed Tradeſmen who have chiefly felt the weight of that inſupportable burthen of Exciſe, for his Majeſty and his two Houſes of Parliament to put a period to that Grievance, eſpecially now when the people are full of expectation of their juſt liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and eaſe from their former burthens.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The continuance of this heavy impoſition of Exciſe, will be diſhonorable to the Parliament, in that they eaſe themſelves, and the Gentry, and rich People of the Nation; and lay the burden on Corporations, and the meaneſt of his Majeſties Subjects.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Reaſons further ſhewing the inequality of the impoſition of Exciſe upon Beer and Ale.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Becauſe by the pretended Laws of Exciſe, the <hi>Brewer</hi> is made the Collector thereof at his great charge and pains, for which he hath no recompence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe the common <hi>Brewers,</hi> (whoſe Families are numerous, as alſo the poor Victuallers) payes Exciſe for that which is expended in their own Families; whereas all other houſe-keepers who brew for themſelves, are Exciſe-free.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe the Victuallers are much impoveriſhed by this burthen of Exciſe, being unable to raiſe that great charge, dealing much with poor people, and reſtrained by former Laws from ſelling at higher Rates, whereby they are rendered inſolvent, to the <hi>Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> both for Exciſe and Principal, it often happening that the <hi>Brewer</hi> payes Exciſe where he looſeth all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Becauſe the allowance of two barrels and half in twenty two and a half, for <hi>Ale</hi>; and three barrels and half in twenty three and a half for <hi>Beer,</hi> granted for Returns, Lecadge, filling, <hi>Christmas</hi>-beer, and other wafts and Accidents incident to the Trade of <hi>Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> are no way anſwerable to the great loſs they receive thereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Becauſe that by the pretended Laws of Exciſe the <hi>Brewers</hi> are to clear their Accounts weekly for the ſaid duty, whereas they ſeldom receive the Exciſe of the Victualler until the <hi>Ale</hi> and <hi>Beer</hi> be retailed, and ſometimes but once a year, which is an encreaſe of the <hi>Brewers</hi> dead ſtoek one fifth part, and cannot be remedied by reaſon of the Victuallers inability to advance moneys.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> Becauſe lately the Exciſe is encreaſed ſix pence <hi>per</hi> Barrel upon Beer and Ale more then formerly, there being no poſſibility for the Brewer or Victualler to advance it in any proportion in their ſmaller Retailing meaſures.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Reaſons againſt the illegality in levying the Impoſition called the Exciſe.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Becauſe the Commiſsioners and ſub-Commiſsioners are both Judges and Parties, they having Poundage out of the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of Execiſe, according to what they are pleaſed by their Officers to extort of the Brewers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Commiſsioners and Sub Commiſsioners, are both Judges and Jurors, they judging both of the Law, and alſo of the fact, and that for their own advantage, denying us Tryals either by the Judges of the Land, or Jurors, which is our birth-right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe the Gagers and other Officers of Exciſe, have a Power at unſeaſonable times, by night, and by day, to enter into our houſes, to our great diſturbance, contrary to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> which ſaith, <hi>Every man's Houſe is his Caſtle:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Upon Levying of their fines by way of diſtreſs or impriſonment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we have been denyed <hi>Replevins,</hi> and likewiſe our <hi>Habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Corpus,</hi> and conſequently the benefit of the Common Law due to free-born <hi>Engliſh men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Brewers of LONDON not obtaining the Priviledge of having their Petition read in Parliament, do humbly offer theſe Reaſons to conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, praying that ſuch a way may be thought upon for the defraying the publike Charge of the Nation, as that every man according to his Eſtate and ability, may bear his equal and juſt proportion, and no more; That ſo your Goodneſs may be Univerſal, your Juſtice Impartial, and that the Cry of Oppreſſion may be no longer heard in our Streets.</hi>
