            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>The Louer true to cry, O wretched man,</l>
            <l>(And tore his haire) I liue no more to day;</l>
            <l>My danger, feare, hope, loue and care, away:</l>

            <l>So tooke his sword; but <hi>Cnemon</hi> staid his hands,</l>

            <l>To caue they run, and by the doore it finde;</l>
            <l>But (that which <hi>Cnemon</hi> maruells-at) vntin'd.</l>
            <l>He takes (as there he found) some fired reed</l>
            <l>To giue them light, and leads the way in speed;</l>
            <l>Yet (lo) full soone on sudden starts he backe,</l>

            <l>As draw his sword that hung downe by his side,</l>
            <l>And went for light. Then lamentably cry'd</l>
            <l>The Knight, and said, O griefe vnsufferable!</l>
            <l>Malignant Starre, or Furie vnsatiable!</l>
            <l>Was't not enough to banish me from home,</l>
            <l>All vp and downe the world to make me rome:</l>
            <l>To cast me where no comfort man releeues,</l>
            <l>At sea to Pyrats, and at land to theeues;</l>
            <l>Yea more than once; and take my ioyes away?</l>
            <l>Of all but one was left; and that to day</l>
            <l>Is also lost, my deare <hi>Chariclia,</hi>

            <l>That all men cheer'd, as with a light diuine,</l>
            <l>Be darke and nothing see; nor he them saw</l>

            <l>Then felt he where he thought his sword had hung,</l>
            <l>And said (O <hi>Cnemon</hi>) this is double wrong</l>
            <l>Both vnto her and me. As thus he said,</l>
            <l>A slender voyce, as 'twere of boy or maid,</l>
            <l>Was heard to call <hi>Theagenes,</hi> and he</l>
            <l>Full well it heard, and answer'd, Call'st thou me?</l>
            <l>Sweet soule I come: then <hi>Cnemon</hi> came with light.</l>
            <l>And plainely heard the voyce of such a sprite,</l>
            <l>As call'd <hi>Theagenes:</hi> O God, quoth he,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Chariclia</hi> liues, that was her voyce; 'tis she.</l>
            <l>O <hi>Cnemon</hi> (quoth <hi>Theagenes</hi>) O leaue,</l>
            <l>And doe me not thus often times deceiue.</l>
            <l>I both deceiue (quoth he) and am deceiu'd,</l>
            <l>If this dead-one be she, and therewith heau'd</l>
            <l>The head from ground, and to them turn'd the face:</l>
            <l>Whereat amaz'd, he started backe a space,</l>
            <l>And cry'd (O wonder!) this the countenance</l>
            <l>Of <hi>This be</hi> should be; what concealed chance</l>
            <l>Should bring her hither? then <hi>Theagenes</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Came to himfelfe, and feeles at heart some ease;</l>
            <l>And comforts <hi>Cnemon,</hi> almost out of winde,</l>
            <l>That with his helpe he might the sooner finde</l>
            <l>His deere <hi>Chariclia</hi>; this now <hi>Cnemon</hi> knew</l>

            <l>Which with a scroule from off her necke he tooke,</l>
            <l>And, as he would vpon the writing looke,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Theagenes</hi> him bids forbeare as then,</l>
            <l>And seeke <hi>Chariclia</hi> further in the den.</l>
            <l>So he's content: but I had nigh forgot</l>
            <l>The sword of <hi>Thyamis</hi> that in the plot</l>
            <l>Was also found, well hatcht and richly guilt,</l>
            <l>Which <hi>Cnemon</hi> said he knew well by that hilt.</l>
            <l>Who sits in darke, sees such as come with light,</l>
            <l>And knowes them sooner than is knowen; this might</l>

            <l>The kinde salute; and count'r embracing fell</l>
            <l>For sudden ioy aswound: there was a well,</l>

            <l>Though all but well: yet, as they had offended,</l>
            <l>They pardon craue for that which he commended.</l>
            <l>But you <hi>Theagenes,</hi> he said, for that</l>

            <l>Embrace a stranger hauing no relation</l>
            <l>To you at all, and in so foule a fashion?</l>
            <l>While I stood by, and told you plaine that she,</l>

            <l>Vnto the Caue where he had <hi>Thisbe</hi> plac'd;</l>
            <l>What time his Master sent him to deuise</l>
            <l>(And long he staid) for solemne sacrifice.</l>
            <l>And hard within the doore, as come but new,</l>
            <l>Her <hi>Thyam</hi> finding, for <hi>Cariclia</hi> slew.</l>

            <l>But when he found her dead, vpon her gaz'd,</l>
            <l>And, word not vtt'ring long time stood amaz'd.</l>
            <l>At last them hearing to them went, and thought</l>
            <l>They had her slaine; and would reuenge haue wrought,</l>

            <l>And had no sword; O, then in what a stam</l>
            <l>Was theeuish, barb'rous, loue-sicke, angrie minde,</l>
            <l>That how to wreak his wrath could no way finde;</l>
            <l>But must comply! and so he did; but yet</l>
            <l>Meant, if he got a sword, vpon them set.</l>
            <l>His looke declar'd his minde was not at ease,</l>
            <l>And so came fawning to <hi>Theagenes:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Amaz'd they were before they heared him speake,</l>
            <l>And suddenly <hi>Chariclia</hi> gaue a squeake,</l>
            <l>And into th'inner mazie cabbin ran,</l>
            <l>For feare, or shame, to see a naked man.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Theagenes</hi> opposed point of blade</l>
            <l>Against the slie assault <hi>Thermutis</hi> made;</l>
            <l>And bids keepe-off: when he the danger sees,</l>
            <l>With humble shew he fell downe on his knees,</l>
            <l>By fortune more than nature made so tame,</l>
            <l>And him to plead-for <hi>Cnemon</hi> call'd by name;</l>

            <l>And saw it bloudy yet of slaughter new.</l>
            <l>From barb'rous brest a deepe sigh then he drew,</l>
            <l>And said, O <hi>Thisbe,</hi> my deere heart, adieu.</l>
            <l>And <hi>Thisbe, Thisbe,</hi> rudely still he brai'd,</l>
            <l>And on her brest his head all bloudy laid:</l>
            <l>He kist her dying lips, and kissing wept,</l>

            <l>Opprest with former toyles, and <hi>Cnemon</hi> led</l>
            <l>The way to sleepe; <hi>Theagenes</hi> his head</l>

            <l>When I them read, I saw well whose she was,</l>
            <l>Yet vnto Shepherds nursing let her passe;</l>
            <l>And kept the rest, for feare that for the pray</l>
            <l>The childe might afterward be made away.</l>
            <l>And while she was but verie small, I count</l>
            <l>Her hidden safe: but flours of beautie mount,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:19366:25"/>And such as this apace; that vnder ground</l>
            <l>(I thinke) though hid, would breake forth and befound.</l>
            <l>Thus though a while I had it well conceal'd,</l>
            <l>I feare it would by selfe light be reueal'd;</l>
            <l>So hurt it selfe and me. Then suit I make</l>
            <l>To be int'Aegypt sent, and her I take</l>
            <l>Along with me; and now in this Embassage</l>
            <l>I hope to finde for her some better passage;</l>
            <l>And eu'n by you, Sir, whom this many a day</l>
            <l>I well obserue: and take her you, I pray,</l>
            <l>With all her dowrie, swearing first to me,</l>
            <l>You will her keepe, and marrie well, as free.</l>
            <l>But now no more, my businesse cals me hence,</l>
            <l>This King to day appoints me audience.</l>
            <l>In <hi>Isis</hi> Fane to morrow will I tell you</l>
            <l>The rest of her, and so with her farewell you.</l>
            <l>I take her home, and on the morrow went,</l>
            <l>To know the rest; but he away was sent</l>
            <l>With threats for haste; because he came to claime</l>
            <l>A mine of Emrauds for the <hi>Melchusaim,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Hydaspes</hi> King of either <hi>Blackmoreland</hi>;</l>
            <l>Then I, (because I could not vnderstand</l>
            <l>Who, whence she was, and of what parents borne,</l>
            <l>That had thereafter listned so beforne)</l>
            <l>With discontent retire: I cannot blame</l>
            <l>Him (then quoth <hi>Cnemon</hi>) for I feele the same:</l>
            <l>But what he further said, quoth <hi>Calasire,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Now shall I tell, and make you much admire.</l>
            <l>When I came in (thus said my <hi>Charicles</hi>)</l>
            <l>At sight of her my heart had present ease:</l>
            <l>In <hi>Catadup</hi> no longer dare I stay;</l>
            <l>But homeward downe the <hi>Nile</hi> make haste away.</l>
            <l>And here she now is with me, counted mine,</l>
            <l>And beares my name: and doth in all encline</l>
            <l>T'obey me like her father (so she takes me).</l>
            <l>But of a husband will not heare (that makes me</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:19366:26"/>Full, full of care) and yet in beautie exceeds</l>
            <l>All maids of <hi>Greece,</hi> which emulation breeds:</l>
            <l>For strangers here as well as Greekes admire her;</l>
            <l>And many Suitors, men of worth, desire her.</l>
            <l>She saith she will <hi>Diana</hi> follow she,</l>
            <l>And hunting with her still a Maiden be:</l>
            <l>With bow and shaft full well can hit the marke;</l>
            <l>But vnto <hi>Cupids</hi> bow would neuer harke.</l>
            <l>I thought bestow her on my sisters sonne,</l>
            <l>A proper man; but nothing can be done;</l>
            <l>In vaine is all my care and labour spent;</l>
            <l>So strongly she maintains her said intent,</l>
            <l>And most with reasons sometime heard of mee,</l>
            <l>In commendation of Virginitee:</l>
            <l>Now I beseech you (Sir) helpe what you may:</l>
            <l>To talke with her she will not you say nay,</l>
            <l>Nor any worthy man: she courteous is,</l>
            <l>And opportunitie you cannot misse:</l>
            <l>In Temple-close, as 'twere in house the same,</l>
            <l>Now liuing both: me helpe maintaine my name;</l>
            <l>For husband worthy long she shall not tarrie;</l>
            <l>Pray, you perswade her what you can to marrie;</l>
            <l>Lest, wanting whom to leaue-to mine estate,</l>
            <l>I lead my latter dayes disconsolate.</l>
            <l>So said he (<hi>Cnemon</hi>) shedding teares, and I</l>
            <l>Him promise helpe, and weepe for company.</l>
            <l>While thus we talke, a solemne Embasie</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Achillaeans</hi> came to him; and I,</l>
            <l>When he had told me what they were, desire</l>
            <l>To see the principal; (he came t'enquire</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Charicles</hi> the Priest for furtherance,</l>
            <l>And what so might their Sacrifice aduance)</l>
            <l>Let call him in (quoth he) and then came in</l>
            <l>The goodli'st youth among them e're had bin:</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Achilles</hi>-like in portlinesse and face,</l>
            <l>And shew of courage with more louely grace.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:19366:26"/>Vs he saluted, we him resalute:</l>
            <l>And Sir (quoth he to <hi>Charicles</hi>) impute</l>
            <l>No fault to me; for haste I must the Rite,</l>
            <l>That all the pompe may well come in ere night.</l>
            <l>Goe then, quoth <hi>Charicles,</hi> and to me said,</l>
            <l>If not before, now shall you see the Maid.</l>
            <l>For she, <hi>Diana's</hi> seruant, must attend</l>
            <l>This Sacrifice, from time it gin to th'end.</l>
            <l>Now <hi>(Cnemon)</hi> I had seene the Maid before,</l>
            <l>And with her ministred; and of the lore</l>
            <l>Sh'hath askt me many points; now held my peace</l>
            <l>To see the sequele: here our talke we cease,</l>
            <l>And goe to Templ'; as all things were before</l>
            <l>Made ready, when the Chiefe came in at dore.</l>
            <l>We come to th'Altar, and with Priest his leaue,</l>
            <l>Begins the young man orison conceiue.</l>
            <l>By secret slight some cunning Priests will make</l>

            <l>Truth has no need helpt-out to be with lye.</l>
            <l>For when came forth <hi>Diana's</hi> gallant Maid</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Theagenes</hi> and his <hi>Chariclia</hi>;</l>
            <l>Though yet not his; when he came forth, what ere</l>

            <l>The gallant mounted on a Dapple-gray,</l>

            <l>Not two, but one, they seeme to fall and rise.</l>
            <l>Amaz'd were all at him, and women kinde,</l>

            <l>Which none so markt as I, who nothing there</l>

            <l>What you conceale (quoth I) and tell me doubt,</l>

            <l>He neuer woman knew, or lou'd before.</l>
            <l>And wept as 'twere for griefe it should be said,</l>

            <l>And going was apace, till by the cloke</l>

            <l>I trust it shall be no disparagement.</l>
            <l>But he (quoth I) her promis'd long agoe</l>

            <l>Nor blunt my sword is, nor my hand so weake.</l>
            <l>Good Sir, quoth I, what need you thus to speake?</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:19366:34"/>'Tis better done another way: be wise,</l>

            <l>This is your Art, and your great wisdome able:</l>
            <l>My guirle is conquer'd, earst vnconquerable:</l>
            <l>She's now in loue. Then I looke big, and strut;</l>
            <l>And say, though little I gaue, I knew 'twold do't.</l>
            <l>But how appeares it? you (quoth he) vs bid</l>
            <l>Physitians counsaile aske; and so we did.</l>
            <l>When they came in, she turning to the wall,</l>
            <l>As if she minded not, or scorn'd them all,</l>
            <l>That verse of <hi>Homer</hi> sung with dewie cheekes,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>O great Achilles, chiefest of the Greekes.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The wise <hi>Acestin</hi> (sure you know the man)</l>
            <l>Her caught by th'hand, the malady to scan,</l>
            <l>And by the pulse her troubled heart bewray'd;</l>
            <l>Then vnto me (good <hi>Charicles</hi>) he said,</l>
            <l>In vaine you call vs; this is no disease,</l>
            <l>Whereof our physicke can the fits appease.</l>
            <l>O Gods, quoth I; and must I lose my deare</l>
            <l>And only guirle! Peace you (quoth he) and heare:</l>
            <l>So call'd m'aside, and softly told me thus,</l>
            <l>The body, not the minde, is cure for vs:</l>
            <l>She's sicke in minde; she loues, and only he,</l>
            <l>That made her sicke, will best Physitian be.</l>
            <l>So went his way: and I straight hither ran</l>
            <l>To you my best Director for the man:</l>
            <l>I would it were <hi>Alcamenes</hi> my lad,</l>

            <l>'Twere good (quoth I) to try, and let him go</l>
            <l>To visit her: he said it should be so,</l>

            <l>The next day met m'and cry'd, I am vndone:</l>

               <hi>Alcamenes,</hi> and him she so despis'd,</l>
            <l>And turn'd away-from shreeking, as the sight</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Gorgons</hi> head had put her in affright:</l>
            <l>Nay, threat with cord to make her selfe away,</l>

            <l>But all for combat ready make with speed,</l>
            <l>Saue <hi>Petosire,</hi> that, after great dilates,</l>
            <l>At length is hardly thrust out at the gates.</l>
            <l>For oth'r his armes than <hi>Thyamis</hi> doth aske;</l>

            <l>Vncertaine is; and therefore if it light</l>
            <l>I ouercome, to you my deerest frend,</l>

            <l>More happie she, than I am, at this houre,</l>
            <l>That hath her got so braue a Paramour.</l>
            <l>The Bawd then smoyling said, Ah Dearling mine,</l>
            <l>Ile make him cast-off her, Ile make him thine.</l>
            <l>Sweet mother <hi>Cybling,</hi> quoth the Lady then,</l>
            <l>And will you doe't indeed? (I pray) but when?</l>
            <l>Leaue that to me, quoth she; and take your rest:</l>
            <l>So tooke the candl' away, and to her nest.</l>
            <l>By peep-aday she rose, and well aray'd,</l>
            <l>A Groome before her, and behinde a Maid,</l>
            <l>Vnt'<hi>Isis</hi> Temple went: and there she spoke</l>
            <l>
               <hi>(As oft Deuotion's made of sinne a cloke)</hi>
            </l>
            <l>With one that kept the doore, as if she ment</l>
            <l>Come offer something that <hi>Arsace</hi> sent:</l>
            <l>Who (as she said) was troubled sore last night</l>
            <l>With verie fearfull dreame and grisly sight.</l>
            <l>He said, as yet he could not serue her turne;</l>
            <l>Now all that keepe within the Temple mourne</l>
            <l>For <hi>Calasiris</hi> death, and none let in,</l>
            <l>Till after this another weeke begin.</l>
            <l>What shall your strangers then the while (quoth she)?</l>
            <l>Our new Arch-Bishop <hi>Thyamis</hi> (quoth he)</l>
            <l>Hath order giu'n, and well content they are,</l>
            <l>T'another house, without the Close, to fare.</l>
            <l>This Hag layes hold on th'opportunitie,</l>
            <l>As on the chiefest point of Faulconrie,</l>
            <l>And said, good master Sextain well you know</l>

            <l>To say that <hi>Thyamis</hi> them sends vnt' vs.</l>
            <l>The Sextain little knew the Bawds intent,</l>
            <l>But as for good vnto the strangers went:</l>
            <l>And found them both (as full great cause they had)</l>
            <l>For losse of <hi>Calasiris</hi> weeping-sad.</l>
            <l>He cheeres them vp, and tels them <hi>Thyamis,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>As was his fath'r, of them right carefull is,</l>

            <l>Which this good Lady (pointing at the spright)</l>
            <l>Will bring them to: and bids no longer stay her,</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Well was his meaning, though it ill befell;</hi>
            </l>

               <hi>As, ill that ment is, often falls-out well.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>They condescend; O ne're had been so gull'd</l>
            <l>This louing paire, but that they had been dull'd</l>
            <l>The day before with ioy; that night with griefe.</l>
            <l>And so them stole this man-and-woman-thiefe.</l>
            <l>No sooner came they to the Palace gate,</l>
            <l>And saw the sumptuous buildings and the state;</l>

            <l>But maruell'd much, and troubled were in minde;</l>
            <l>For they had thought some priuate Host to finde,</l>

            <l>To start backe now; and further still are brought;</l>
            <l>Vntill they came to <hi>Cybels</hi> lodging; where</l>

            <l>And said, My children well I doe perceiue,</l>

            <l>That to my Lady better may I say</l>

            <l>This could I beare; but that, far worse than this,</l>

            <l>I am resolu'd: goe tell her now you Krone,</l>

            <l>In darke by <hi>Cyb,</hi> when all were gone to bed,</l>
            <l>But Lady her selfe and these: and when they came</l>
            <l>Within the chamber doore, the little flame,</l>
            <l>That there was left, she takes, and would away.</l>
            <l>Nay (Madame, quoth he) let kinde <hi>Cybel</hi> stay;</l>
            <l>For she's no blab. Then Lady tooke by th'hand.</l>
            <l>And said, thus long fore-slow'd I your command,</l>

            <l>With more securitie both night and day.</l>
            <l>And, now good fortune me declares your slaue,</l>
            <l>More willing am I you command and haue.</l>
            <l>But (O!) this one thing grant me first I pray,</l>

            <l>At your command I will doe nought at all.</l>
            <l>For ere I liue to see her suffer force,</l>
            <l>You shall me see a selfe-dead-wounded corse.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Arsace</hi> then; Why thinke not (Sir) that I,</l>
            <l>Who giue my selfe, can ought to you deny:</l>
            <l>But I haue sworne before, and by my life,</l>

            <l>For sister none haue I; and, on my life</l>
            <l>This is my spouse, and eu'n as good as wife.</l>
            <l>For further proofe, appoint the day, and we</l>
            <l>Shall gladly with your fauour married be;</l>

            <l>Her hand to kisse: but she it backward slips,</l>
            <l>And bowes her downe, and layes him lips to lips.</l>

            <l>And tels <hi>Chariclia</hi> what was done: but shee</l>
            <l>Scarce heard the last without some jealousie.</l>
            <l>This one thing done (quoth he) prevents the fall</l>

               <hi>Achaemenes</hi> prouoke his case deplore,</l>
            <l>And set this house forthwith in great vprore.</l>
            <l>For <hi>Cyb</hi> will tell her sonne; and for that cause,</l>
            <l>When forth she would of chamb'r, I made her pause:</l>
            <l>And to th'intent she might a witnesse bee</l>
            <l>Of what there past, and of my loue to thee.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>For though it well suffise the guiltlesse brest,</hi>

            <l>This he, with greater state her cups to fill,</l>
            <l>Must now put-on, though much against his will.</l>

            <l>But left a little, through her wanton skill,</l>

               <hi>Theagenes</hi> held downe his head, and said</l>
            <l>No word thereto: but th'other ill-apaid</l>
            <l>Complaines his mother-to, that this new Lad</l>

            <l>A new-come slaue, that should be kept in gyues,</l>

            <l>Are these enough to proue her not his sister?</l>

            <l>Till lay-day came (because he kept no measure)</l>
            <l>Did kill his bird, for in-her-hidden treasure:</l>

            <l>And come before the King: he ey'd them well;</l>
            <l>But how affected hard it is to tell:</l>
            <l>He rose a littl' and said; me Heau'n excuse!</l>
            <l>And sate him downe againe as in a muse.</l>
            <l>The Peeres about him askt him what he ment.</l>
            <l>He said, I drempt the Gods this night had sent</l>
            <l>Me such a daught'r, and suddenly so grown;</l>
            <l>I little thought theron, nor would it owne;</l>

            <l>And whence they were? <hi>Theagenes</hi> to that</l>
            <l>Repli'd, we broth'r and sister be, and come</l>
            <l>Late out of Greece. But is that Maiden dombe</l>
            <l>(Repli'd the King)? <hi>Chariclia</hi> said, we heare,</l>
            <l>We must to th'Altar; and my Parents there</l>
            <l>Will soone be known. But heare (O King) the troth;</l>
            <l>That one is here, and there they will be both.</l>
            <l>To that <hi>Hydaspes</hi> said, and saying smil'de,</l>

            <l>Well, take and vse these two with all the grace</l>
            <l>They had before: but what's that Eunuchs face?</l>
            <l>The same, say they. The King then, let him passe</l>
            <l>Along with them, to keepe vntaint the Lasse:</l>
            <l>For Eunuch is a kinde of jealous Elfe,</l>
            <l>Enuying others that he lacks himselfe.</l>
            <l>Thus hauing said, all other Captiues there</l>
            <l>He call'd, and view'd them well; and all that were,</l>
            <l>As borne to serue, of fath'r and mother slaue,</l>
            <l>Among his well-deseruing Souldiours gaue.</l>
            <l>The rest, that seem'd of better birth to bee,</l>

            <l>For now the time of day grew toward Noone.</l>
            <l>Three Altars were there, two for Sun and Moone</l>
            <l>Together set, the third for <hi>Bacchus</hi> was</l>
            <l>By't selfe alone; and this for offring has</l>
            <l>All sorts of creatures: to the God of wine</l>
            <l>Th'vncleane and cleane, th'impure and pure encline.</l>

            <l>That all the world about doe shine so bright,</l>
            <l>The Sun white horses had, for swiftest flight;</l>
            <l>The Moone, for helping tillage, oxen white.</l>
            <l>And, while men busie be preparing those,</l>
            <l>Confused cries among the peopl' arose</l>
            <l>For humane Sacrifice of strangers tane,</l>

            <l>And marking was affected much, and said</l>

            <l>Haue you pickt-out to kill? so sweet a face</l>
            <l>I neuer saw. With what a cheerfull grace,</l>

            <l>What pitie it is, that on this bloudy stage</l>

            <l>In such a waiter, if I saue her might</l>
            <l>A Greeke I thinke, the more I pitie her case;</l>

            <l>No matter, quoth the Queene, or maid, or wife,</l>

            <l>O King behold! this is that wicked wight</l>
