            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>WE departed from <hi>London</hi> Thurſday <hi>January 16th.</hi> 1690. about Nine in the Morning, and came that Night to <hi>Cittingbourn;</hi> the next Day, about Noon, we came to <hi>Margaret,</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Thanet;</hi> and the ſame Evening we went on Board the Frigat that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried His Majeſty's Muſick, which lay then in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:30590:4"/>
the Road, with the reſt of the Fleet, Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Admiral <hi>Rooke:</hi> Early the next morning, being <hi>Saturday</hi> the 17th. the King Arriv'd from <hi>Graves-end,</hi> attended by the Dukes of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Ormond,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Devonſhire, Dorſet</hi> and <hi>Portland,</hi> and other Grandees of the Court: About Noon, the Signal being given from the Admiral, the whole Fleet conſiſting of Twelve <hi>Men of War,</hi> Seven <hi>Yatchs,</hi> and many Tenders, ſet Sail, with a fair Gale. On <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 20th, We came in ſight of the Coaſt of <hi>Holland,</hi> near the Iſland of <hi>Goree,</hi> but the weather being dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Foggs, and the Shore choak'd up with heaps of Ice, pil'd up one upon another, it was not for us to come near: However the King put himſelf into a <hi>Shallop</hi> to get to the Land, notwithſtanding the danger that threatned him; and when all the reſt were terrified with the Perils wherein His Majeſty ventur'd his Perſon; and the Seamen themſelves were not in a little Terror, it was obſerv'd; that He himſelf, was the only Perſon, nothing at all diſmay'd. In the mean time the Foggs grew thicker and thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, inſomuch, that we who were in the Man of War, ſoon loſt ſight of the <hi>Shallop,</hi> where the King was; and Night coming on, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was for Ten hours expos'd to all the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Air, and the Waves of the Sea, which fometimes came into the <hi>Shallop;</hi> ſo that the Lords who were with him, had their Cloaths all covered with Ice: However the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing His Majeſty Landed in the Iſland <hi>Goree,</hi> and went into a Country Man's houſe, which had
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30590:4"/>
no more room to receive Him, and all the Lords of his Train, than one miſerable Chamber and a Kitchin; But it was a welcome Retreat after ſo great a Hazard. After the King had ſhifted his Linnen and his Cloaths, and had been Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemented by the Magiſtrate of the Iſland, who offered him his Houſe, which His Majeſty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, He took Coach again in the ſame Coach that brought him to the Country Mans Houſe, and went aboard the <hi>Shallop</hi> again, to Land up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firm Continent; But then he met with new difficulties, for the ſmall Veſſel could not get near the Shore for the Ice; ſo that two Seamen were forced to take the King in their Arms, and carry him to the <hi>Shallop:</hi> At laſt His Majeſty, with our whole Fleet of Tenders, (the Men of War returning for <hi>England)</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at a place called <hi>Orangie Poldar;</hi> here His Majeſty was Complemented by the Prince of <hi>Naſſau Sarbrach,</hi> Camp-Marſhall, the Count of <hi>Berka,</hi> the Emperors extraordinary Envoy, <hi>Monſieur Catonna,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh Ambaſſador,</hi> the Deputies of the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Frizeland,</hi> Count <hi>Horn;</hi> and ſeveral other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Higheſt Quality, who attended him to <hi>Houſlaerdike,</hi> where he repoſed himſelf for ſome hours. 'Twas thought His Majeſty would have continu'd here for ſome Days, till all things were ready for the Magnificent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try they were reſolv'd to make for Him. But he told them, he deſired none of thoſe Honours, well knowing that the Glory of a Prince does not conſiſt in Appearing, but in Acting. The
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:30590:5"/>
King therefore went the ſame day to the <hi>Hague,</hi> and Arriv'd there about Six in the Evening, Accompanied with the Lords already mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſurrounded with the Guards of the Body. And in regard the Kings coming was in a manner a kind of ſurprize, his Entrance was alſo without any Ceremony. So that all that could be done in Teſtimony of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Joy, was only by ſome Peals of Cannon, and Ringing the Bells.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, the <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> of the <hi>Hague</hi> had prepared along time before for His Majeſty's Publick Entry, and had been at conſiderable Charges to make a Glorious Appearance; and all the Towns adjoyning, had prepared to be preſent at the Solemnity. In a Word, all the <hi>Holl<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nders</hi> were willing to ſee the King in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and to aſſure themſelves, with their own Eye, that a Prince, whom they love ſo infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and of whom the common Enemy had ſpread ſo many falſe Reports, was ſtill alive, and returned into their Provinces, which obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the States to entreat his Majeſty to make a Publick Entry; which he refuſed a long time, that ſuch Ceremonies were but the loſs of that time which he had reſolved to ſpend altogether in Action. At length all that they could obtain from the King was, that he would dine about a quarter of a League from the <hi>Hague,</hi> at a Houſe of the Earl of <hi>Portlands,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn in his Coach through the midſt of the <hi>Burgeſſes,</hi> ranged in Files, from the Court to the end of the City, which was done on <hi>Thurſday,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:30590:5"/>
February</hi> 22d, about four of the Clock in the Afternoon, to the unexpreſſible Satisfaction of the People, all the Inhabitants of the Towns round about being got together, and perhaps there never was ſeen at the <hi>Hague</hi> ſuch a vaſt concourſe of People.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not ſpend time in deſcribing all the particulars of this Entry, which had nothing of extraordinary Magnificence, except the three Triumphant Arches, which ſurpaſſed in Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Magnificence, all that was ever made in <hi>France,</hi> under the Reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV upon the like Occaſions. There you might ſee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the Principal Actions of the King, in Honour of whom they were Erected, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſeveral Inſcriptions and Devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces perfectly correſponding with the Subjects to which they were applyed, and which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be done by the hand of a Maſter. There you might particularly ſee <hi>Europe</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the gripes of her Raviſher; the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of <hi>Holland</hi> defended and preſerved; that of <hi>England</hi> reſtored; <hi>Ireland</hi> ſubdued; and the Proteſtant Religion maintained. The whole Ceremony ended in the Evening with Fire-Works in ſeveral places of the City, ſeveral Peals of Cannon and Vallies of ſmall Shot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, as well by the <hi>Burgeſſes,</hi> as by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of <hi>Triſon</hi> which was in Arms, with Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires and Fire-works, before the Court: After all was over, they ſtill continued giving ſeveral Teſtimonies of their Satisfaction to ſee once more a Prince ſo highly beloved by the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:30590:6"/>
and in regard the whole proceeded from a ſincere Affection, there is a great Probability that theſe Rejoyceings will long endure.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide the King manifeſted an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Goodneſs and Affability to all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, and private Perſons that came to kiſs his Hands. Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> was one of this Number, and his Majeſty honoured him with the command of the <hi>Holland</hi> Fleet for this Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers Expedition; which was no ſooner ſpread about the Country, but you might ſenſibly perceive an Augmentation of Joy among the <hi>Hollanders</hi> for the Kings coming: His Coach was environed with crouds of People that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him where e're he went; and by a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Acclamations Teſtified their Satisfaction that <hi>WILLIAM</hi> the Conqueror would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand their Army by Land; and <hi>Trump,</hi> who juſtly may be called a ſecond <hi>Neptune,</hi> was to command their Fleet by Sea: and here, for the preſent, I ſhall break off my Relations of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions at the <hi>Hague,</hi> and divert the Reader with my obſervations on the Place.</p>

The Counts of <hi>Holland</hi> frequently kept their Courts in this palace, chiefly moved thereunto by the pleaſantneſs of the place, and its commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Situation for Hunting; Our King (when <hi>Prince of Orange,)</hi> kept his Court at this place, where he has a moſt ſtately Palace, the back part of which, with the great Hall, ſufficiently teſtify its Antiquity. There is on the ſide of it, a great ſquare, in which place, on the ſide of the <hi>Levant</hi> are three Magnificent Lodgments, built a few years ſince; the <hi>Doeles</hi> make the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whereof His Preſent Majeſty, they ſay, lay'd the firſt ſtone: Over againſt the other cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is another Palace built by Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> in which are to be ſeen the <hi>Portraitures</hi> of all the Kings in <hi>Europe,</hi> with many curioſities brought from <hi>America.</hi> The <hi>Voorhant</hi> Frontis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece as well as the Houſes that face the Court on the ſide of the <hi>Vivier,</hi> make by far the pleaſanteſt Quarter of the <hi>Hague,</hi> by reaſon of the large and ſpaciouſneſs of the Streets, and the number of Trees that are planted there; you may ſee great numbers of Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of both Sexes reſort thither in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſome in their Coaches, and ſome on Foot. The Cloyſter of the <hi>Jacobines</hi> which was built on the ſaid <hi>Voorhant,</hi> at this day ſtill retains the name of the Church of the <hi>Cloyſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is another Church, built much after the form of the <hi>Theater</hi> in <hi>Oxon,</hi> and is of ſo Admirable a piece of Architecture without, that none within the ſeven Provinces (or ſcarce in the World) is comparable to it; there's no

pillars within<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that the Miniſter may be ſeen in every place of the Church, by thouſands of People without any Impediment. The Counts of <hi>Holland's</hi> Chapple which is in the Court, is at this day a Church for the <hi>French Refugees;</hi> there are two pretty places like ſquares, the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and the other behind the Court, where all the Houſes reſemble thoſe of Princes.</p>
               <p>The States of <hi>Holland</hi> reſide here, as well the Councellors of the Provincial Court, as of the Grand Council. The Cities of <hi>Holland</hi> have built here very Magnificent Houſes for their Deputies, of which in my Opinion that of <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> is one of the beſt Scituate and next the Court. The <hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> of princes, the States Allies, have their Reſidence here. The <hi>Groote Kirck,</hi> or great Church is very fine, in the midſt of which is to be ſeen the Arms of the Famous Knights, the Order of <hi>Toyſon D'ore,</hi> which plainly ſhews that they there Celebrated the Feaſt of the ſaid <hi>Toyſon:</hi> The Tower is very high, and its Form is Quadrangular, built with bricks, which may be ſeen at a vaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: In fine, this place is, at all times, ſo well Inhabited by Gentry, and Perſons of the greateſt Quality; that if we conſider its Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, the Magnificence of its Buildings and Streets, the affluence of the Nobles, and the pleaſure of Converſe; The <hi>Hague</hi> is one of the prettieſt Courts, and the moſt agreeable in the Univerſe.</p>

               <p>AFter the King came to the <hi>Hague,</hi> few days paſt without the Arrival of ſome Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or other conſiderable Perſons, as well to have the Honour to wait upon his Majeſty, as to confer with him about the preſent Affairs. 'Tis true that moſt of the Princes came <hi>Incogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> as well to avoid the diſputes of Precedency, as to confer more Familiarly together, and without the Peſterment of Formalities. The <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> who lay at <hi>Cleves</hi> for ſome time, in expectation of the Kings coming, no ſooner heard of his Arrival by the Courriers that were forthwith diſpatched to give him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice thereof, but he haſtened to the <hi>Hague,</hi> where he Arriv'd in <hi>Cognito,</hi> the 24th of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi> The Duke of <hi>Wirtenbergh,</hi> Prince <hi>Regent,</hi> during the Minority of the Heir, and the Prince his Brother arrived the 29th, and were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the King a little time after. The Count of <hi>Windiſgrats,</hi> from the Emperor, Arrived <hi>February</hi> 4th, and was immediately admitted to the King. The Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> Arriv'd the 6th, about ten of the Clock at Night, and went to wait upon the King the next day about four a Clock in the Afternoon, with whom he had a Conference of two hours long. The

Marqueſs of <hi>Caſtanaga,</hi> Governour of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Netherlands,</hi> arriv'd the next day with a jolly Train, of which however but one part appear'd, becauſe the Princes were <hi>Incognito.</hi> The <hi>Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſe Caſſel</hi> arriv'd the 11th, accompanied by the Count of <hi>Lippe,</hi> the Baron of <hi>Gars,</hi> and ſeveral other Lords. The Prince of <hi>Commerci,</hi> General of the Imperial Forces, arriv'd the 15th. The Duke, and one Prince of <hi>Courland,</hi> arrived the next day. The King regalio'd the greateſt part of theſe Princes, and was alſo pleaſed to accept of Entertainments at ſome of their Houſes. It would be too long to make a Recital of all theſe Feaſts. I ſhall only therefore mention two; to ſhew what are the principal Ceremonies obſerved upon ſuch Occaſions.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty gave an entertainment to the <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> the 3d. of <hi>February,</hi> at his Houſe in the Wood; the King had an hours Conference with the <hi>Elector,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended, they entered into a ſpacious Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Room, where was a Table and Cloth lay'd, with one only ſingle Vermeil Furniture, (conſiſting of the Gold Plate, fine Napkins, Knife, Fork, and Spoon,) and an Elbow Chair, where the King ſat down; After that a Chair was brought for the Elector, with a white Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Cuſhion, and a Vermeil Furniture laid him, like the Kings. Then the King Commanded Seats and Furnitures to be brought for all the reſt of the Lords that were preſent, who were placed in this Order: The Elector on the Kings

Right Hand; next to whom ſat the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Scarborough, Monſieur Colbar,</hi> and <hi>Monſieur Dankelman,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Portland</hi> ſat at the lower end of the Table, juſt oppoſite to the King; The Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> on the Kings Left Hand; next to whom ſat the Count of <hi>Denhoff,</hi> and then the General <hi>Spaen</hi> cloſed that ſide of the Table, next to the Earl of <hi>Portland:</hi> The firſt Health was begun by the King, who whiſper'd it ſoftly to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, and the Elector to the reſt without Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it; after that the King began ſeveral other Healths, which he carried to the Elector, and the Elector to the reſt without Naming: The King and the Elector were ſerved each of them by a Page, all People being put out of the Room, with Orders given to the Guards, to let no Body enter. The Drums beat and the Trumpets ſounded when the King and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector drank; but not for any of the reſt.</p>
               <p>The 5th of the ſame Month the King Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> who went out into the very ſtreet to receive him, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him into a ſpacious Dining Room, where the Table was covered with Eleven Furnitures; and in a ſhort time after the meat was ſerved up. The King ſat in an Elbow Chair; on the Kings Right hand ſat the Lord <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> and then the Earl of <hi>Portland:</hi> On the left hand of the Elector ſate the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and then the other Lords of the Court, without any diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Precedence; and <hi>Monſieur Colber,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Office of <abbr>Eſq</abbr>

Butler was alſo preſent to pour out the Wine. The King was ſerved by one of his Pages, and two of his Gentlemen ſtood behind his Chair. When the King returned, the Elector accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him, to the very Boot of his Coach. All theſe Divertiſements of Entertainment, and pleaſure, were intermixed with ſerious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, his Majeſty being unwilling to looſe a moment of Conſultation for the general good of the Confederate Affairs: But all theſe Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are kept ſo ſecret, that it is impoſſible to penetrate the knowledge of them; nor ſhall we underſtand the Concluſions but by the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects that will follow. The King has ſat in the Aſſembly of the States General, in that of the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> and in the Council of State, to all which Bodies he expreſſed himſelf in moſt Affectionate Terms, which makes it appear, that his new Dignity has no way leſſened the Love and Affection which he had for thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</p>
               <p>On the 1ſt. of <hi>March,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Zell</hi> arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the <hi>Hague;</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Wolfenbuttel,</hi> his Brother, the <hi>Tueſday</hi> following.

               <p>You may travel among them though you have not a guide: For you cannot baulk your Road without the hazard of drowning. There is not there any uſe of an Harbinger.

Water, which they catch in Nets, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport to Land in their Boots, where they ſpraed it more ſmoothly, than a Mercer doth his Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet, when he would hook in an Heir upon his coming to Age.

               <p>Their ordinary Pack-horſes are all of Wood, carying their Bridles in their tails, and their Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens in their Bellies.

               <p>The Elements are here at variance, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile overſwaying the Groſſer. The Pire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes Earth, and the Air the Water.

               <p>The Land that they have, they keep as neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a Courtier does his Beard: They have a method in Mowing. 'Tis ſo interven'd with Water and Rivers, that it is impoſſible to make a Common among them.</p>

               <p>The Bridge to this is a Fir-plank with a Box of ſtones to poiz it withal, which with the leaſt help turns round like the Executioner when he whips off a Head: That when the Maſter is over, ſtands drawn, and then he is in his Caſtle: 'Tis ſure his fear that renders him ſupicious; That he may therefore certainly ſee who enters, you ſhall ever find his window made over his Door.</p>
               <p>When you are entred the houſe, the firſt thing you encounter is a Looking-Glaſs; no queſtion but a true Embleme of Politick Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality; for though it reflect your ſelf in your own Figure, 'tis yet no longer than while you are there before it: When you are gone once, it Flatters the next Comer, without the leaſt remembrance that you e'er were there.</p>
               <p>The next are the Veſſels of the Houſe Marſhal'd about the Room like Watch-men; All as neat as if you were in a Citizens Wives Cabbinet; for unleſs it be themſelves, they let none of Gods Creatures loſe any thing of their Native Beauty. The Linings of their Houſes is more Rich than the Out-ſide, not in Hangings, but Pictures, which even the pooreſt of the <hi>Boars,</hi> are there furniſh'd with: Not a Cobler but has his Toys for Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

And when he doth, his Horſes muſt not ſtir, but have their Manger brought them into the way, where in a top ſweat they eat their Graſs, and drink their Water, and preſently after hurry away: For they ever drive as if they were all the Sons of <hi>Nimſhi,</hi> and were furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly either purſuing an Enemy, or flying him.</p>
               <p>They are ſeldom deceiv'd, for they truſt no Body; ſo by Conſequence are better to hold a Fort, than win it; yet they can do both.

Complements is an Idleneſs they were never train'd up in, and 'tis their happineſs, that Court Vanities have not ſtole away their minds from Buſineſs.</p>
               <p>Sailers among them are as common as Beggars with us. They can drink, rail, ſwear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but examining their uſe, a meſs of their Knaves are worth a Million of outs, for they, in a Boiſterous Rudeneſs, can work, and live, and Toil, whereas ours will rather Laize them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Poverty, and like Cabbages left out in Winter, rot away in the Loathſomeneſs of a Nauſeous Sloth.</p>
               <p>Moſt of them are Seamen born, and like Frogs can live both on Land and Water. Not a <hi>Country-Urieſter</hi> but can handle an Oar, Steer a Boat, raiſe a Maſt, and beat you out in the rougheſt Straits you come in. The Ship ſhe avouches much better for Sleep than a bed.</p>
               <p>In their Families they all are equals, and you have no way to know the Maſter and Miſtreſs but by taking them in Bed together. It may be thoſe are they; Otherwiſe <hi>Malky</hi> can prate as much, laugh as loud, be as bold, and ſit as well as her Miſtreſs.</p>

               <p>The habit of the Men is much after the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paullian</hi> Faſhion; their Breeches yawning at the Knees, as if they were about to ſwallow his Legs unmercifully.</p>
               <p>The Women are far from going naked, for of a whole Woman you can ſee but half a Face: As for her hand, that ſhews her a ſore Labourer; which you ſhall ever find (as it were in Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence) loaden with Rings to the cracking of her Fingers.</p>
               <p>Where the Woman lies in, the Ringle of the door does pennance, and is lapped about with Linnen, either to ſhew you that loud knocking may wake the child, or elſe that for a month the Ring is not to be run at. But if the child be dead, there is thruſt out a Noſegay tied to a ſticks end; perhaps for an Emblem of the Life of Man, which may wither as ſoon as born; or elſe to let you know, that though theſe fade upon their gathering, yet from the ſame ſtock the next year a new ſhoot may ſpring.</p>

but the ſupply of what Nature requires, and the common increaſe of Wealth. They feed moſt upon Herbs, Roots, and Milks; and by that means, I ſuppoſe, neither their ſtrength, nor Vigor, ſeems anſwerable to the ſize, Bulk, of their Bodies.</p>

               <p>The Soil of the whole Province of <hi>Holland</hi> is generally Flat, like the Sea in a calm, and looks as if, after a long contention, between Land and Water, which it ſhould belong to: It had at length been divided between them: For to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the great Rivers, and the ſtrange number of Canals that are found in this Province, and do not only lead to every great Town, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to every Village; and the infinity of Sails that are ſeen every where courſing up and down upon them; One would imagine the Water to have ſhared with the Land; and the People that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:30590:13"/>
live in Boats, to hold ſome proportion with thoſe that live in Houſes. And this is one great advantage towards Trade, which is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to the Scituation, and not to be attained in any Country, where there is not the ſame level and ſoftneſs of Soil, which makes the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Canals ſo eaſie work, as to be attempted almoſt by every private Man; and one Horſe ſhall draw in a Boat, more than Fifty can do by Cart, whereas Carriage make a great part of the price in all heavy Commodities: And by this eaſie way of Travelling, an induſtrious Man loſes no time from his Buſineſs, for he Writes, or Eats, or Sleeps, while he goes; whereas the time of Labouring or Induſtrious Men, is the greateſt Native Commodity of any Country.</p>
               <p>There is, beſides, one very great lake of Freſh-Water ſtill remaining in this Province, by the Name of <hi>Harlem Maer,</hi> which might as they ſay, be eaſily drained; but the City of <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> having no other way of refreſhing their Town, or renewing the Water of their Canals, but from this <hi>Maer,</hi> will never conſent to it.</p>
               <p>Another Advantage of their Scituation of Trade, is made by thoſe two great Rivers of the <hi>Rhyne,</hi> and <hi>Maſe,</hi> reaching up, and Navigable, ſo mighty a length, into ſo Rich and Populus Countries of the higher and lower <hi>Germany;</hi> which as it brings down all the Commodities from thoſe parts to the <hi>Magazines</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> that vent them by their Shipping into all parts of the World, where the Market calls for them;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:30590:14"/>
ſo, with ſomething more labour and time, it returns all the Merchandiſe of other Parts, into thoſe Countries, that are ſeated upon theſe Streams,</p>
               <p>The Flatneſs of their Land expoſes it to the danger of the Sea, and forces them to infinite charge, in the continual Fences and Repairs of their Banks to oppoſe it; which employ yearly more Men, than all the Corn of the Province of <hi>Holland</hi> could maintain. They have found the common Sea-weed to be the beſt Material for theſe Digues, which faſtens with a thin Mixture of Earth, yields a little to the force of the Sea, and returns when the Waves give back.</p>
               <p>The extream moiſture of the Air, I take to be the Occaſion of the great Neatneſs in their Towns; for without the help of thoſe Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, their Country would not be habitable by ſuch Crowds of People, but the Air would corrupt upon every hot ſeaſon, and expoſe the Inhabitants to general and infectious Diſeaſes, which they hardly eſcape three Summers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, eſpecially about <hi>Leyden,</hi> where the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are not ſo eaſily renewed; and for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I ſuppoſe, it is, that <hi>Leyden</hi> is found to be the neateſt and cleaneſt kept of all their Towns.</p>
               <p>The ſame moiſture of Air makes all Mettals apt to ruſt, and Wood to mould; which forces them, by continual pains of rubbing and ſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, to ſeek a prevention or cure: This makes the brightneſs and cleaneſs that ſeems affected
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:30590:14"/>
in their Houſes, and is call'd Natural to them, by People who think no further. So the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Soil, and wetneſs of Seaſons, which would render it unpaſſible, forces them not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to exactneſs of paving in their Streets, but to the expence of ſo long Cawſies between ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their Towns, and in their High-ways; As indeed, moſt National Cuſtoms are the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of ſome unſeen, or un-obſerved, Natural Cauſes or Neceſſities.</p>
               <p>The lowneſs and flatneſs of their Lands, make it in a great meaſure the Richneſs of their Soil, that is eaſily over-flowed every Winter, ſo as the whole Country, at that Seaſon, ſeems to lye under Water, which in Spring, is driven out again by Mills.</p>

               <head>Sect. VI. <hi>Of the People of</hi> Holland, <hi>their Manners, Humours and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
               <p>THe People of <hi>Holland</hi> may be divided into theſe ſeveral Claſſes: The <hi>Peſants</hi> or <hi>Boars,</hi> who cultivate the Land. The <hi>Marriners</hi> or <hi>Schippers,</hi> who ſupply their Ships. The <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,</hi> or <hi>Traders,</hi> who fill their Towns. The <hi>Renteeners,</hi> or Men that live in all their chief Cities upon the Rents, or Intereſts of Eſtates for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly acquired in their Families: And the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and Officers of their Armies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:30590:15"/>
The Firſt we have already treated off in a Sect by themſelves, in regard of the giving a more particular Character of their Manners and Humours.</p>
               <p>The Second, The <hi>Marriners,</hi> are a plain Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but of a very rough Hew; whether from the Element they live in, or from their Food, which is generally Fiſh and Corn, and heartier than that of the <hi>Boars:</hi> They are Surly, and Ill-manner'd, which is miſtaken for Pride; but, I believe, is learnt, as all manners are, by the converſation we uſe. Now theirs lying only among one another, or with Winds and Waves, which are not mov'd nor wrought upon by any Language, or Obſervance; or to be dealt with, but by Pains and by Patience; theſe are all the Qualities, their <hi>Marriners</hi> have learnt; their Language is little more, than what is of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary uſe to their Buſineſs; their Valour is of a ſize extraordinary even beyond compariſon, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept with that of the <hi>Engliſh Tarpaulin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Merchants</hi> and <hi>Trades-men,</hi> both the Greater and Mechanick, living in Towns that are of great reſort, both by Strangers and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of their own, are more Mercurial, (VVit being ſharpned by Commerce and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of Cities, though they are not very inventive, which is the gift of warmer Heads; yet are they great in imitation, and ſo far, many times, as goes beyond the Originals: Of mighty Induſtry, and conſtant Application to the ends they propoſe and purſue. They make uſe of their Skill, and their VVit, to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:30590:15"/>
of other Mens Ignorance and Folly, they deal with: Are great Exacters, where the Law is in their own hands. In other points where they deal with Men that underſtand like themſelves, and are under the reach of Juſtice and Laws, they are the plaineſt and beſt dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in the World; which ſeems not to grow ſo much from a principle of Conſcience, or Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as from a Cuſtom or Habit introduced by the neceſſity of Trade among them, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends as much upon common honeſty, as War does upon Diſcipline; and without which, all would break; Merchants would turn Pedlars, and Soldiers Thieves.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Families which live upon their Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Eſtates in all the great Cities, are a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple differently bred and manner'd from the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, though like them in the modeſty of Garb and Habit, and the parſimony of living. Their Youth are generally bred up at Schools, and at the Univerſities of <hi>Leyden,</hi> or <hi>Utretcht,</hi> in the common ſtudies of Humane Learning, but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the civil law, which is that of their Country.</p>
               <p>Where theſe Families are Rich, their Youths, after a courſe of their Studies at home, travel for ſome years, as the ſons of our Gentry uſe to do; but their Journeys are chiefly into <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> not much into <hi>Italy,</hi> ſeldomer into <hi>Spain,</hi> nor often into the more <hi>Northern-Countries,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in Company or train of their publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. The chief end of their Breeding, is, to make them fit for the Service of their Country in the Magiſtracy of their Towns, their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:30590:16"/>
and their State. And of theſe kind of Men are the civil Officers of this Government generally compoſed, being deſcended of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, who have many times been conſtantly in the Magiſtracy of their Native Towns for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, and ſome for ſeveral Ages, and not Men of mean or Mechanick Trades, as it is commonly receiv'd among Foreigners, and makes the Subject of commical Jeſts upon their Government. This does not exclude many Merchants or Traders ingroſs from being ſeen in the Offices of their Cities, and ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to their Eſtates; nor ſeveral of their States from turning their Stocks in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome very beneficial Trade by Servants, and houſes maintained to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The next Rank among them, is that of their Gentlemen or Nobles, who, in this Province of <hi>Holland</hi> are very few, moſt of the Families having been extinguiſhed in the long Wars with <hi>Spain.</hi> But thoſe that remain, are in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner all imploy'd in the Military or Civil Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Province or State. Theſe are, in their Cuſtoms and Manners, much different from the reſt of the people; and having been bred much abroad, rather effect the Garb of of their Neighbour Courts, than the popular Air of their own Country. They ſtrive to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the <hi>French</hi> in their Meen, their Cloaths, their way of Talk, of Eating, of Gallantry, or Debauchery. They are otherwiſe an Honeſt, Well-natur'd, Friendly, and Gentlemanly ſort of Men, and acquit themſelves generally with
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:30590:16"/>
Honour and Merit, where their Country em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys them.</p>
               <p>The Officers of their Armies live after the Cuſtom, and Faſhions of the Gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſome Cuſtoms, or Diſpoſitions, that ſeem to run generally through all degrees of Men among them; as great Frugality, and Order, in their Expences. Their common Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches lye in every mans ſpending leſs than he has coming in, be that what it will: Nor does it enter into Mens heads among them, that the common part or courſe of Expence ſhould equal the Revenue; and when this happens, they think at leaſt they have lived that year to no purpoſe; and the train of it diſcredits a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, as much as any Vicious or Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Extravagance does in other Countries. This enables every man to bear their extreme Taxes, and makes them leſs ſenſible than they would be in other places, eſpecially in <hi>England:</hi> For he that lives upon two parts in five of what he has coming in; if he pays two more to the State, he does but part with what he ſhould have laid up, and had no preſent uſe for; whereas, he that ſpends yearly what he receives, if he pays but the fiftieth part to the Publick, it goes from him like that which was neceſſary to buy bread or Clothes for himſelf or his Family.</p>
               <p>This makes the Beauty and ſtrength of their Towns, the commodiouſneſs of travelling in their Country by their <hi>Canals, Bridges,</hi> and <hi>Cawſeys;</hi> the pleaſantneſs of their Walks, and their Grafts in and near all their Cities; and in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:30590:17"/>
ſhort, the Beauty, Convenience, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Magnificence of their publick Works, to which every Man pays as willingly, and takes as much pleaſure, and vanity in them, as thoſe of other Countries do in the ſame circumſtances, among the poſſeſſions of their Families or private Inheritance.</p>
               <p>To conclude this Section: <hi>Holland</hi> is a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where the Earth is better than the Air, and profit more in Requeſt than Honour; where there is more ſenſe than wit; more good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than good humour; and more wealth than pleaſure; where a man would chuſe rather to Travel, than to live; ſhall find more things to obſerve than deſire; and more Perſons to eſteem than to love. But the ſame Qualities and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions do not Value a private Man and a State, nor make a converſation agreeable, and a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment great: Nor is it unlikely, that ſome very great King might make but a very ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry private-Gentleman, and ſome very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Gentlemen, might be capable of making but a very mean Prince.</p>

               <p>THe great care of this State has ever been to Favour no particular or curious Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:30590:17"/>
into the Faith or Religious Principles of any peaceable Man, who came to live under the protection of their Laws, and to ſuffer no Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or Oppreſſion upon any Mans conſcience, whoſe Opinions broke not out into Expreſſions or Actions of ill conſequence to the State. A free form of Government, either making way for more freedom in Religion; or elſe, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſo far themſelves for Liberty in this point, they thought it the more unreaſonable for them to oppreſs others.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Religion was alone ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted from the common protection of their Laws, making men (as the Law-makers believed) worſe Subjects than the reſt, by the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of a Forreign, and Superiour Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: Yet ſuch has been the care of this State, to give all men eaſe in this point, who ask no more than to ſerve God, and ſave their own Souls, in their own Way and Forms; that what was not provided for by the conſtitutions of their Government, was ſo, in a very great degree, by the connivance of their Officers, who, upon certain conſtant payments from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Family, ſuffer the exerciſe of the <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> Religion in their ſeveral Juriſdictions, as free and eaſy, tho' not ſo cheap, and ſo avowed, as the reſt. This, I ſuppoſe, has been the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that tho' thoſe of this profeſſion are very numerous in the Country, among the <hi>Peaſants,</hi> and conſiderable in the Cities; and not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to any publick charges; yet they ſeem to be a ſound piece of the State, and faſt joynted in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:30590:18"/>
with the reſt; and have neither given any diſturbance to the Government nor expreſt any Inclinations to a change, or to any Foreign Power.</p>
               <p>Of all other Religions, every Man enjoys the free exerciſe in his own Chamber, or his own Houſe, unqueſtioned, and unſpyed: And if the Followers of any Sect grow ſo numerous in any place, that they affect a publick Congregation, and are content to purchaſe a place of Aſſembly, to bear the charge of a Paſtor, or Teacher, and to pay for this Liberty to the Publick; they go and propoſe their deſire to the Magiſtrate of the place where they reſide, who inform themſelves of their Opinions, and Manners of Worſhip; and if they find nothing in either, deſtructive to civil Society, or prejudicial to the Conſtitutions of their State, and content themſelves with the price that is offer'd for the purchaſe of this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, they eaſily allow it; but with the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that one or more Commiſſioners ſhall be appointed, who ſhall have free Admiſſion at all their Meetings, ſhall be both the Obſervers and Witneſſes of all that is Acted or Preached among them, and whoſe Teſtimony ſhall be received concerning any thing that paſſes there, to the prejudice of the State; in which caſe, the Laws and Executions are as ſevere as againſt any civil Crimes.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Jews</hi> have their allowed Synagogues in <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and <hi>Rotterdam;</hi> and in the firſt, I think all Sects, that are known among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, have there publick Meeting-places: and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:30590:18"/>
ſome, whoſe Names are almoſt worn out in other parts, as the <hi>Browniſts, Familiſts,</hi> and others. The <hi>Arminians,</hi> though they make a great Name among them, by being rather the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a Party in the State, than a Sect in the Church; yet are, in compariſon of others, but few in Number, tho' conſiderable by the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who are of the better quality, the more learned and intelligent Men; and many of them in the Government. The <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> are juſt the contrary, very numerous, but in the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Ranks of People, Mechanicks and Seamen, and abound chiefly in <hi>North Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Calviniſts</hi> make the Body of the People, and are poſſeſſed of all the publick Churches in the Dominions of the State, as well as of the only Miniſters or Paſtors, who are maintained by the Publick.</p>
               <p>It's hardly to be imagined, how all the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Sharpneſs, which Accompanies the differences of Religion in other Countries, ſeems to be appeaſed or ſoftned here, by the general freedom which all men enjoy, either by Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or Connivance. I believe the force of Commerce, Alliances, and Acquaintance, ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo far as they do in ſmall circuits (ſuch as the Province of <hi>Holland)</hi> may contribute much to make converſation, and all the Offices of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon life, ſo eaſy, among ſo different Opinions, of which ſo many ſeveral perſons are often in every Man's eye; and no man checks or takes offence at Faces, or Cuſtoms, or Ceremonies, he ſees every day, as at thoſe he hears of in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:30590:19"/>
far diſtant, and perhaps by partial relations, and comes to ſee late in his life, and after he has long been poſſeſſed by paſſion or prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. However it is, Religion may poſſibly do more good in other places, but it does leſs hurt here; and wherever the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effects of it are the greateſt and moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous, I am ſure, the viſible are ſo in this Country, by the continual and undiſturbed civil Peace of their Government, for ſo long a courſe of years; And by ſo mighty an encreaſe of their People, wherein will appear to conſiſt chiefly the vaſt growth of their Trade and Riches, and conſequently the ſtrength and greatneſs of their State.</p>

               <p>'TIs evident to thoſe, who have read the moſt, and travel'd fartheſt, that no Country can be found either in this preſent Age, or upon Record of any Story, where ſo vaſt a Trade has been managed, as in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row compaſs of the four Maritine Provinces of this Common-wealth: Nay it is generally eſteem'd, that they have more Shipping belongs to them, than there does to the far greater part of <hi>Europe</hi> beſides. Yet they have no Native

Commodities towards the Building, or Rigging of the ſmalleſt Veſſel; their Flax, Hemp, Pitch, Wood, and Iron, coming all from a broad, as Wooll does for cloathing their Men, and Corn for feeding them. Nor do I know any thing properly of their own growth, that is conſiderable, either for their own neceſſary uſe, or for Traffick with their Neighbours, beſides Butter, Cheeſe, and Earthen Wares. For <hi>Havens,</hi> they have not any good upon their whole Coaſt: The beſt are <hi>Helverſluys,</hi> which has no Trade at all; and <hi>Fluſhingue,</hi> which has little, in compariſon of other Towns in <hi>Holland:</hi> But <hi>Amſterdam</hi> that Triumphs in the ſpoils of <hi>Lisbon</hi> and <hi>Antwerp,</hi> (which before Engroſt the greateſt Trade of <hi>Europe</hi> and the <hi>Indias)</hi> ſeems to be the moſt incommodious <hi>Haven</hi> they have, being ſeated upon ſo ſhallow Waters, that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Ships cannot come up to it without the advantage of Tides; nor great ones without unlading. The entrance of the <hi>Teſſel,</hi> and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages over the <hi>Zudder-Sea,</hi> is more dangerous, than a Voyage from thence to <hi>Spain,</hi> lying all in blind and narrow channels; ſo that it eaſily appears, that 'tis not an <hi>Haven</hi> that draws Trade, but Trade that fills an <hi>Haven,</hi> and brings it in Vogue. Nor has <hi>Holland</hi> grown rich by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Native Commodities, but by force of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry; by Improvement and Manufacture of all Foreign Growths; by being the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Magazine</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> and furniſhing all parts with whatever the Market wants or invites; and by their Seamen, being, as they

               <p>It appears to every Mans eye who hath Travel'd <hi>Holland,</hi> and obſerv'd the Number and Vicinity of their great and populus Towns and Villages, with the prodigious improvement of almoſt every Spot of ground in the Country, and the great multitudes conſtantly employ'd in their Shipping abroad, and their Boats at home, that no other known Country in the World, of the ſame extent, hold any proportion with this in the Numbers of People; and if that be the great Foundation of Trade, the beſt account that can be given of theirs, will be, by conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauſes and accidents, that have ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to force and invite ſo vaſt a confluence of People into their Country; the civil Wars, Calamities, Perſecutions, Oppreſſions or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, that have been ſo fatal to moſt of their Neighbours for ſome time before, as well as ſince their State began.</p>
