            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>His Majeſty was Graciouſly pleaſed, upon <hi>Tueſday, Nov.</hi> 27. 1688. to adviſe with a Council of his Peers, about the preſent Unhappy State of his Affairs, where they attended his Royal Pleaſure accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to a Summons unto them directed. There were preſent, twenty five Proteſtant Temporal Lords, and nine Lords Spiritual, being the whole number that were within diſtance of appearing according to the time of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. His Majeſty was pleaſed to expreſs himſelf with great Clearneſs and Reſpect upon the Subject of that Meeting, requiring their Lordſhips to deliver their Judgments with all Freedome upon the Matter in hand, wherein they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted themſelves accordingly upon the ſeveral Points that they had in Debate; and upon a full Conſideration of the whole Affair, their Lordſhips came to this Reſolution, (without ſo much as one Negative) that they ſaw no way of Redreſs, conſidering the Grievances and Diſtempers of the People, and the preſent Circumſtances of his Majeſties Condition, but by the ſpeedy calling of a Free Parliament, which their Lordſhips with one voice humbly beſought the King to do: Whereupon his Majeſty was pleaſed to Declare to their Lordſhips, to this Effect; that their Advice was according to his own Inclinations, but it being a Matter of ſo great an Importance, he would take time til the next day to conſider of it. And upon the day following, his Majeſty was pleaſed to Order the Iſſuing out of Writs for the calling of a Free Parliament.</p>
            <p>There were preſent, His Grace the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and His Grace of <hi>Tork</hi> in Nomination, with ſeven Prelates more.</p>
            <p>The Right Honourable the Lord <hi>Chancellour,</hi> the Marquiſs of <hi>Hallifax,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Oxford, Pembrook, Clarendon, Angleſey, Carliſle, Craven, Aylesbury, Burlington, Yarmouth, Berkley, Nottingham, Rocheſter,</hi> Vicount <hi>Falconberg,</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Newport,</hi> Vicount <hi>Weymouth.</hi> The Lords, <hi>Chandois, Paget, Vaughan, Montague</hi> of <hi>Boughton, Maynard, Howard</hi> of <hi>Eſcrick, Oſſulſton, Godolphin.</hi>
