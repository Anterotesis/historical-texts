            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>S<hi rend="sup">ir</hi> Josiah Child's Proposals,
For the <hi>Relief</hi> and <hi>Employment</hi> of the POOR.</head>
            <p>THis is a calm Subject, and thwarts no common or private interest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, except that of the common Enemy of Mankind (<hi>the
Devil</hi>) so I hope that what shall be offered towards the effecting of
so universally acceptable a Work as this, and the removal of the innumerable
inconveniences that do now and have in all Ages attended this Kingdom,
through defect of such Provision for the Poor, will not be ill taken, although
the Plaster at first essay do not exactly fit the Sore.</p>
            <p>In the Discourse of this subject, I shall first assert some particulars, which I
think are agreed by common Consent, and from thence take occasion to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to what is more doubtful.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>That our poor in</hi> England <hi>have always been in a most sad and wretched condition,</hi>
some Famished for want of Bread, others starved with Cold and Nakedness,
and many whole Families in all the out-Parts of Cities and great Towns,
commonly remain in a languishing, nasty and useless Condition, Uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to themselves, and Unprofitable to the Kingdom, this is confessed and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
by all Men.</p>
            <p>2. That the <hi>Children</hi> of our <hi>Poor</hi> bred up in <hi>Beggery</hi> and <hi>Laziness,</hi> do by that
means become not only of <hi>unhealthy Bodies,</hi> and more than ordinary subject to
many loathsome Diseases, whereof very many die in their tender Age, and if
any of them do arrive to years and strength, they are, by their idle habits
contracted in their Youth, rendred for ever after indisposed to Labour, and
serve only to stock the <hi>Kingdom</hi> with <hi>Thieves</hi> and <hi>Beggers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. That if all our impotent Poor were provided for, and those of both Sexes and all
Ages that can do work of any kind, employed, it would redound some Hundreds of
Thousands of Pounds <hi>per annum</hi> to the publick advantage.</p>
            <p>4. That it is our Duty to God and Nature, so to Provide for, and Employ the
Poor.</p>
            <p>5. That by so doing one of the great sins (for which this Land ought to mourn)
would be removed.</p>
            <p>6. That our fore-Fathers had pious Intentions towards this Work, as appears by the
many Statutes made by them to this purpose.</p>
            <p>7. That there are places in the World, wherein the Poor are so provided for, and
employed, as in <hi>Holland, Hambrough, New-England</hi> and others, and as I am
informed now in the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far we all agree: The first Question then that naturally occurs is,
Question, <hi>How comes it to pass that in</hi> England <hi>we do not, nor ever did comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
maintain and employ our Poor?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The common Answers to this Question are, two.</p>
            <p>1. That our Laws to this purpose are as good as any in the World, but we fail in the
execution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:66441:2"/>
2. <hi>That formerly in the days of our pious Ancestors the work was done, but now Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is decreased,</hi> and that is the reason we see the Poor so neglected as now
they are.</p>
            <p>In both which Answers (I humbly conceive) the Effect is mistaken for the
Cause: For though it cannot be denied, but there hath been, and is a great
failure in the Execution of those <hi>Statutes</hi> which relate to the <hi>poor,</hi> yet I say,
the <hi>cause of that failure, hath been occasioned by defect of the Laws them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For otherwise, what is the reason that in our late times of Confusion and
Alteration, wherein almost every party in the Nation, at one time or other,
took their turn at tbe Helm; and all had that Compass (those Laws) to Stear
by, and yet none of them could, or ever did, conduct the Poor into a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of security to them, and profit to the Kingdom, i. e. <hi>none sufficiently
maintained the impotent, and employed the Indigent amongst us:</hi> and if this was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
done in any Age, nor by any sort of Men whatsoever in this Kingdom,
who had the use of those Laws now in force, it seems to me a very strong Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
that it never could, nor ever will be done by those Laws, and that
consequently the defect lies in the Laws themselves, not in the Men, <hi>i. e.</hi> those
that should put them in Execution.</p>
            <p>As to the second Answer to the aforesaid Question, wherein <hi>want of Charity</hi>
is assigned for another cause why the <hi>poor</hi> are now so much neglected, I think
it is a <hi>scandalous, ungrounded Accusation</hi> of our <hi>Contemporaries</hi> (except in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to building of <hi>Churches,</hi> which I confess this generation is not so propense
to as former have been) for most that I converse with, are not so much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to part with their Money, as how to place it, that it may do good, and
not hurt to the Kingdom: For, <hi>if they give to the Beggers in the Streets, or at
their Doors, they fear they may do hurt by</hi> encouraging that lazy unprofitable kind
of Life; and <hi>if they give more than their proportions in their respective Parishes, that</hi>
(they say) <hi>is but giving to the Rich,</hi> for the Poor are not set on Work there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
nor have the more given them; but only their rich Neighbours pay the less.
And for what was given in <hi>Churches</hi> to the <hi>visited Poor,</hi> and to such as were
<hi>impoverished by the Fire;</hi> we have heard of so many and great Abuses of that
kind of <hi>Charity,</hi> that most men are under sad discouragements in relation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>I Write not this to divert any Man from Works of Charity of any kind:
<hi>He that gives to any in want does well, but he that gives to Employ and Educate
the Poor, so as to render them usefull to the Kingdom, in my judgement does better.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here by the way, not to leave Men at a loss how to dispose of what
God shall incline their Hearts to give for the benefit of the Poor, I think it not
impertinent to propose the <hi>Hospitals</hi> of this City, and <hi>poor labouring people that
have many Children,</hi> and make a hard shift to sustain them by their industry,
whereof there are multitudes in the out Parts of this <hi>City, as the best objects of
Charity at present.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to my purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> to prove that the want of <hi>Charity</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
that is now, and always hath been, in relation <hi>to the poor, proceeds from a
defect in our Laws.</hi> Ask any Charitable minded Man as he goes along the
Streets of <hi>London,</hi> viewing the Poor, viz. <hi>Boys, Girls, Men and Women</hi> of all
Ages, and many in good Health, &amp;c. why he and others do not take care for
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66441:2"/>
the setting those poor Creatures to Work? Will he not readily answer, that
he wisheth heartily it could be done, though it cost him a great part of his
Estate, but he is but one Man, and can do nothing towards, it, <hi>giving them
Money as hath been said, being but to bring them into a liking and continuance in that
way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second Question then is,</p>
            <p>Question 2. <hi>Wherein lies the defect of our present Laws relating to the poor?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, that there may be many, but I shall here take notice of one only,
which I think to be Fundamental, and which untill altered, the <hi>poor</hi> in <hi>England</hi>
can never be well provided for, or Employed; and that when the said Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Error is well amended, it is almost impossible they should lack either
Work or Maintenance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The said radical Error I esteem to be the leaving it to the care of every Parish to
maintain their own poor only;</hi> upon which follows the shifting off, sending or
whipping back the poor Wanderers to the place of their Birth, or last abode:
the practice whereof I have seen many years in <hi>London,</hi> to signifie as much as
ever it will, which is just nothing of good to the Kingdom in general, or the
Poor thereof, though it be sometimes by accident to some of them a Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
without effect; I say without effect, because it reforms not the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
nor disposeth the Minds of others to Obedience, which are the true ends
of all Punishment.</p>
            <p>As for instance, <hi>a poor idle Person,</hi> that will not Work, or that no Body
will Employ in the Country, <hi>comes up to</hi> London <hi>to set up the Trade of Begging,</hi>
such a Person probably may Beg up and down the Streets seven years, it
may be seven and twenty, before any body asketh why she doth so, and if
at length she hath the ill hap in some Parish to meet with a more vigilant
<hi>Beadle</hi> than one of twenty of them are, all he does is but to lead her the length
of five or six Houses into another Parish, and then concludes, as his <hi>Masters</hi>
the <hi>Parishioners</hi> do, that he hath done the part of a most diligent Officer:
but suppose he should yet go further to the end of his Line, which is the
end of the Law; and the perfect Execution of his Office; that is, suppose
he should carry this poor Wretch to a Justice of the Peace, and he should
order the <hi>Delinquent</hi> to be Whipt, and sent from Parish to Parish, to the
place of her <hi>Birth</hi> or first <hi>Abode,</hi> which not one <hi>Iustice</hi> of twenty (through
pity or other cause) will do, even this is a great charge upon the Country,
and yet the business of the Nation it self wholly undone: for no sooner doth
the <hi>Delinquent</hi> arrive at the place assigned, but for shame or idleness she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
deserts it, and wanders directly back, or some other way, hoping
for better Fortune, whilst the Parish to which she is sent, knowing her a
Lazy, and perhaps a worse quality'd Person, is as willing to be rid of her
as she is to be gone from thence.</p>
            <p>If it be here retorted upon me, that by my own Confession, much of this
mischief happens by the Non, or ill Execution of the Laws, I say better Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
than you have seen you must not expect; and <hi>there was never a good
law made that was not well executed, the fault of the Law causing a failure of
execution,</hi> it being natural to all Men to use the remedy next at hand, and
rest satisfied with shifting the evil from their own Doors; which in regard
they can so easily do, by threatning or thrusting a poor Body out of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66441:3"/>
verge of their own <hi>Parish,</hi> it is unreasonable and vain to hope that ever it
will be otherwise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the Laws against Inmates,</hi> and empowering the Parishioners to take a
Security before they suffer any poor persons to Inhabit amongst them; it
may be they were prudent Constitutions at the times they were made (and
before <hi>England</hi> was a place of Trade) and may be so still in some Countries,
but <hi>I am sure in Cities and great Towns of Trade they are altogether improper, and
contrary to the practice of other Cities and Trading Towns abroad.</hi> The Riches of
a <hi>City,</hi> as of a <hi>Nation,</hi> consisting in the multitude of <hi>Inhabitants;</hi> and if so,
you must allow <hi>Inmates, or have a City of Cottages.</hi> And if a right course be
taken for the sustentation of the <hi>Poor,</hi> and setting them on Work, you need
invent no Stratagems to keep them out, but rather to bring them in. For
<hi>the resort of Poor to a City or Nation well managed, is in effect the Conflux rf Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
to that City or Nation;</hi> and therefore the subtile <hi>Dutch</hi> receive and relieve,
or employ all that come to them, not enquiring what Nation, much less what
Parish they are of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Question</hi> 3. The third Question: <hi>If the defect be in our Laws, how shall we
find a remedy that may be rational and consistent?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I confess is a hard and difficult Question, it is one of the <hi>Ardua Regni,</hi>
and may very well deserve the most deliberate consideration of our wisest
<hi>Councellors.</hi> And if a whole Session of <hi>Parliament</hi> were employed on this si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
concern, I think it would be time spent as much to the Glory of <hi>God</hi>
and good of this <hi>Nation,</hi> as in any thing that noble and worthy <hi>Patriots</hi> of
their Country can be engaged in: But seeing I have adventured thus far, I
shall humbly proceed to offer some general Proposals that have a tendency
towards the effecting this great Work, which being seriously thought of and
debated by wiser men, may be capable of snch melioration as may render
them in a great measure effectual to the <hi>Kingdom</hi> in general, although at
present, to prevent that common Objection, that great Mutations are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous;
I shall only propose them to be experimented in these parts of the
Kingdom, which are the Vitals of our Body Politick, which being once made
sound, the cure of the rest will not be difficult.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Proposition</hi> 1. First then I Propose, <hi>That the City of</hi> London <hi>and</hi> Westminster,
<hi>Burrough of</hi> Southwark, <hi>and all other places within the usual Lines of Cemmunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
described in the Weekly Bills of Mortality, <hi>may by Act of Parliament be
associated into one Province, or Line of Communication for relief of the Poor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>That there be one Assembly of Men</hi> (and such as they shall from time to
time appoint and deputise) <hi>entrusted with the care for, and treasure of all the
Poor within the said Pale or Line of Communication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>That the said Assembly be incorporated by Act of Parliament,</hi> with perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Succession, by the Name of <hi>Fathers of the Poor,</hi> or some other honourable
and significant Title.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>That all Constables, Churchwardens, Overseers, or other Officers in all Parish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi>
within the said Line, <hi>be subordinate and accomptable to the said Fathers of the
Poor, and their Deputies, for, and in all things relating to the poor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. <hi>That the said Fathers of the Poor may have liberty to assess and receive into
their common Treasury,</hi> for relief of the Poor, <hi>so much Money from every Parish
as they yearly paid to that purpose any of the three Years preceding this Constitution,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66441:3"/>
and to compel the payment thereof, but not of more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. <hi>That the said Fathers tf the Poor, and their Deputies, may have very large
and sufficient power in all things relating to the poor,</hi> and particularly to have and
receive the charitable benevolence of all persons, once every Lords Day, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Parish-Church, and in any other Meeting of Pious <hi>Christians,</hi> and at any
other time or times which they shall think fit.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>That the said Fathers of the Poor,</hi> and such as they shall authorize, <hi>may
have power to purchase Lands, erect and endow Work-houses, Hospitals, and Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Correction,</hi> and to exercise all other powers relating to the Poor, that
any number of <hi>Iustices</hi> of the <hi>Peace</hi> now may do, in their <hi>Quarter-Sessions,</hi>
or otherwise.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>That the said Fathers of the Poor, may have power to send such Poor beyond the
Seas as they shall think fit into his Majesties Plantations,</hi> taking Security for their
comfortable Maintenance during their service, and for their freedom afterwards.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>That the said Fathers of the Poor may have Power to erect petty Banks, and
Lumbards for the benefit of the Poor, if they shall find it convenient,</hi> and also to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the one half of what is paid at all the Doors of <hi>Play-houses,</hi> and have the
<hi>Patent</hi> for <hi>Farthings,</hi> and to do whatever else his <hi>Majesty</hi> and the <hi>Parliament</hi>
shall think fit to recommend to them, or leave to their discretion.</p>
            <p>10. <hi>That the Treasure that shall be Collected for this purpose, shall be accounted sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,</hi>
and that it be Felony to misapply, conceal, lend, or convert it to any
other use or purpose whatsoever.</p>
            <p>11. <hi>That there be no Oaths, or other Tests imposed upon the said Fathers of the
Poor, at their admission, to bar our Nonconformists,</hi> amongst whom there will be
found some excellent Instruments for this good Work, and such as will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
attend it (for if they be kept out, the People will be cold in their
Charity, and in their hopes of success.)</p>
            <p>12. <hi>That the said Fathers of the Poor may constantly wear some honourable Medal,</hi>
such as the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament shall devise,</hi> besides the <hi>Green Staff</hi> which is
now used in <hi>London</hi> to such like purpose, (but upon extraordinary days only)
<hi>to denote their Authority and Office</hi> at all times, and in all places, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the Habits in <hi>Spain,</hi> or rather as have all the <hi>Familiars</hi> of the <hi>Inquisition</hi>
in most <hi>Romish</hi> Countries, with admirable effect, tho' to a wicked purpose;
the consequence whereof will be, that the said <hi>Fathers of the Poor,</hi> being nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous,
and dispers'd by their Habitations and Business, into most parts of
their <hi>Province,</hi> will readily see any neglects of Officers, and as easily redress
them; the <hi>Medal</hi> which they wear about them, being a sufficient Warrant to
command Obedience from all <hi>Parish-Officers</hi> wherever they come, although
their Persons be not known there.</p>
            <p>13. <hi>That the said Fathers of the Poor may have liberty to admit into their Society,
and all Powers and Priviledges equal with them, any persons that are willing to serve
God, their King and Country, in this pious and publick Work, the persons desiring to be
so admitted, paying at their admission 100 l.</hi> or more into the Poors Treasury. as
a demonstration of the sincerity of their Intentions to labour in and cultivate
this most Religious Vineyard. This I only offer, because the number of the
said <hi>Fathers of the Poor</hi> hereafter mentioned, may be thought rather too few
than too many.</p>
            <p>14. <hi>That the said Fathers of the Poor, besides the Authority now exercised by Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66441:4"/>
of the Peace, may have some less limited Powers given them, in relation to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of their own, and Parish Officers, by pecuniary mulcts for the poors benefit in
case of neglect,</hi> and otherwise as his <hi>Majesty</hi> and the <hi>Parliament</hi> shall think fit.</p>
            <p>15. <hi>That the said Fathers of the Poor may have freedom to set the Poor on work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
whatsoever Manufacture they think fit,</hi> with a <hi>Non-obstante</hi> to all Patents that
have been or shall be granted to any private person or persons for the sole
Manufacture of any Commodity, the want of which priviledge, I have been
told, was a prejudice to the Work-house at <hi>Clerkenwell,</hi> in their late design of
setting their Poor Children about making of <hi>Hangings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>16. That all Vacancies by reason of Death of any of the said Fathers of the Poor, be
perpetually supplied by Election of the Survivors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 4. The fourth Question is, <hi>Who shall be the Persons entrusted with so
great a Work, and such excess of power?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a Question likewise of some difficulty, and the more in regard of
our present Differences in <hi>Religion,</hi> but I shall answer it as well as I can.</p>
            <p>In general I say, <hi>They must be such as the people must have ample satisfaction in,
or else the whole design will be lost:</hi> For if the universality of the People be not
satisfied with the Persons, they will never part with their Money; but if
they be well satisfied therein, they will be miraculously charitable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 5. This begets a fifth Question, <hi>What sort of men the People will be most
satisfied in?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Answer, I think <hi>in none so well as such only as a Common Hall of the Livery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of</hi> London <hi>shall make choice of,</hi> it being evident by the experience of many
Ages, that the several <hi>Corporations</hi> in <hi>London</hi> are the best <hi>Administrators</hi> of
what is left to <hi>Chaoitable Vses,</hi> that have ever been in this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> which is
manifest in the regular, just and prudent management of the <hi>Hospitals</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and was wisely observed by Dr. <hi>Collet, Dean of St.</hi> Paul'<hi>s,</hi> that prudent <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastick,</hi>
when he left the Government of that <hi>School,</hi> and other great Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
assigned by him for charitable Uses, unto the disposition of the <hi>Mercers
Company.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But here it may be Objected, That <hi>Country Gentlemen,</hi> who have Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in places of their Residences, and pay out of their large Estates considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
summs towards the Maintenance of their Poor within the afore-limited Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts,
may be justly offended if they likewise have not a share in the distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
of what shall be raised to that purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I answer, the force of this Objection may be much taken off, if the
<hi>City</hi> be obliged to choose but a certain number out of the <hi>City,</hi> as suppose se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
for <hi>London,</hi> ten out of <hi>Southwark</hi> for that Burrough, twenty for <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
this would best satisfie the People, and I think do the work: But if it be
thought too much for the <hi>City</hi> to have the choice of any more than their own
seventy, the <hi>Iustices</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> in their <hi>Quarter-Sessions,</hi> may nominate and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
their own number of Persons to assist for their respective Jurisdictions,
and so to supply the vacancy in case of Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But all must be Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
but one <hi>Body Politick,</hi> or the work will never be done.</p>
            <p>Quest. 6. <hi>The sixth Question is,</hi> What will be the Advantage to the Kingdom
in general, and to the Poor in particular, that will accrue by such a Society of men,
more than is enjoyned by the Laws at present?</p>
            <p>I answer, Innumerable and unspeakable are the Benefits of this Kingdom
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66441:4"/>
that will arise from the Consultations and Debates of such a wise and honest
Council, who being men so elected as aforesaid, will certainly conscionably
study and labour to discharge their Trust in this service of <hi>God,</hi> their <hi>King,</hi>
and <hi>Countrey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> The Poor, of what quality soever, as soon as they are met with, will be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
relieved or set on Work where they are found, without hurrying them from place
to place, and torturing their Bodies to no purpose.</p>
            <p>2. Charitable-minded-men will know certainly where to dispose of their Charity, so
as it may be employed to right purposes.</p>
            <p>3. House-keepers will be freed from the intollerable incumbrance of Beggars at their
Doors.</p>
            <p>4. The Plantations will be regularly supplied with Servants, and those that are sent
thither well provided for.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>The said Assembly will doubtless appoint some of their own Members to visit and
relieve such as are sick,</hi> as often as there shall be occasion, together with Poor
labouring Families both in <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Suburbs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. <hi>Poor Children will be instructed in Learning and Arts,</hi> and thereby rendred
serviceable to their Countrey, and many other worthy Acts done for Publick
good by the joynt Deliberation of so many Prudent and Pious Men, assisted
with such a Power and Purse, more than can be foreseen or expressed by a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate.
Person.</p>
            <p>Quest. 7. <hi>The seventh Question may be,</hi> What shall all the Poor of these Cities
and Countries, being very numerous, be employed about?</p>
            <p>This Question will be answer'd best by the said Assembly themselves when
they have met and consulted together, who cannot be presumed deficient of
Invention to set all the Poor on Work, especially since they may easily have
admirable Presidents from the practice of <hi>Holland</hi> in this particular, and
have already very good ones of their own, in the Orders of their <hi>Hospitals</hi>
of <hi>Christ-Church</hi> and <hi>Bridewell</hi> in <hi>London;</hi> the <hi>Girls may be employed in mending
the cloaths of the Aged, in Spinning, Carding, and other Linnen Manufactures, and
many in Sowing Linnen for the Exchange, or any House-keepers that will put out Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen
to the Matrons that have the Government of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Boys in picking Okam, making Pins, rasping Wood, making Hangings, or any
other Manufactures of any kind,</hi> which whether it turns to present Profit or not,
is not much material, the great Business of the Nation being first but to keep
the Poor from Begging and Starving, and enuring such as are able to Labour
and Discipline, that they may be hereafter useful Members to the Kingdom:
But to conclude, I say the wisest Man, living solitarily, cannot propose or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
such excellent ways and methods as will be invented by the united Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of so grave an <hi>Assembly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The sitting of the said <hi>Assembly</hi> I humbly conceive, ought to be, <hi>De die in
diem; <hi>the</hi> Quorum</hi> not more than thirteen; whether they shall Yearly, Month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or Weekly choose a <hi>President,</hi> how they shall distribute themselves into the
several quarters of the <hi>Communication,</hi> what <hi>Treasurers</hi> and other <hi>Officers</hi> to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy,
and where, and how many, will best be determined by themselves, and
that without difficulty, because many that will probably be Members of the
said <hi>Assembly,</hi> have already had large experience of the Government of the
<hi>Hospitals</hi> of <hi>London;</hi> The manner of Election of the said <hi>Fathers of the Poor,</hi> I
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66441:5"/>
humbly suppose, cannot possibly be better contrived than after the same way
which the <hi>East-India-Company</hi> choose their <hi>Committee,</hi> which will prevent the
Confusion, Irregularity and Incertitude that may attend the Election of Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or holding up of Hands; especially because the Persons to be elected at
one time will be very many; the said manner proposed is, every <hi>Elector, viz.</hi>
every <hi>Livery-man</hi> to bring to <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> at the appointed day for Elections, a
List of the whole number of Persons, such as he thinks fit that are to be Elected,
and deliver the same openly unto such Persons as the <hi>Lord Mayor, Aldermen,</hi>
and <hi>Common-Council-Men</hi> shall appoint to make the Scrutiny; which Persons
so entrusted with the said Scrutiny, seven, or ten days after, as shall be thought
fit, at another <hi>Common-Hall</hi> may declare who are the Persons Elected by the
Majority of Votes.</p>
            <p>If it be here objected to the whole purpose of this Treatise, that this Work
may as well be done in distinct <hi>Parishes,</hi> if all <hi>Parishes</hi> were obliged to build
<hi>Work-houses,</hi> and employ their Poor therein; as <hi>Dorchester</hi> and some others
have done with good success.</p>
            <p>I Answer, that such attempts have been made in many Places to my Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
with very good intents and strenuous endeavours, but all that ever I
heard of, proved vain and ineffectual, as I fear will that of <hi>Clerkenwell,</hi> except
that single instance of the Town of <hi>Dorchestor,</hi> which yet signifies nothing in
Relation to the Kingdom in general, because all other places cannot do the
like, nor doth the Town of <hi>Dorchester</hi> entertain any but their own <hi>Poor</hi> only,
and Whip away all others; whereas that which I design, is to propose such a
Foundation as shall be large, wise, honest, and rich enough to maintain and
employ all <hi>Poor</hi> that come within the Pale of their Communication, without
enquiring where they were born, or last inhabited: Which I dare affirm with
Humility, that nothing but a <hi>National,</hi> or at least such a <hi>Provincial</hi> Purse can
so well do, nor any Persons in this Kingdom, but such only as shall be pickt
out by popular Election, for the Reason before alledged, <hi>viz.</hi> That in my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
<hi>three fourths</hi> at least of the Stock must issue from the Charity of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
as I doubt not but it will to a greater proportion, if they be satisfied in
the <hi>Managers</hi> thereof; but if otherwise not the fortieth, I might say not the
hundredth part.</p>
            <p>I propose the Majority of the said <hi>Fathers of the Poor</hi> to be <hi>Citizens (though
I am none my self</hi>) because I think a great share of the Money to be employed,
must and will come from them, if ever the Work be well done, as also, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their Habitations are nearest the Center of their Business, and they best
acquainted with all Affairs of this Nature by their experience in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Hospitals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Earnestly to desire and endeavour, that the Poor of <hi>England</hi> should be better
provided for and employed, is a Work that was much studied by my deceased
<hi>Father,</hi> and therefore though I be as ready to confess as any shall be to charge
me with Disability to propose a Model of Laws for this great Affair, yet I
hope the more ingenious will pardon me for endeavouring to give aim towards
it, since it is so much my Duty, which in this particular I shall be careful to
perform (though I may be too remiss in others) as shall appear by more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
and apparent Demonstrations, if ever this design, or any other (that
is like to effect what is desired) succeed.</p>
