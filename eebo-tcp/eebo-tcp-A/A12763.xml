            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis small Tract, now aboue two

that worthy Knight the Authour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
with no intent to haue it published:
and being hitherto by me suppressed from

in the right of the Authour as of my

And though at th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Author, he being then in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
yet hath it pleased him since his

vnto it, as his leasure would permit him;
which I haue annexed to the end therof.
And thus haue I attempted to make a

vs at our last par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
haue runne often since in
my minde; and so (perhaps)
haue they done in yours. You
complained (as God would

crost in the building you were
<pb facs="tcp:648:5"/>
in hand with, vpon a peece of
gleabe of your <hi>Appropriate
Parsonage</hi> at <hi>Congham.</hi> I
answered, that I thought God
was not pleased with it, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as it tended to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding

(amongst some other

his portion in your hart,
so in this, though it concerned
your profit, you seemed tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<pb facs="tcp:648:5"/>
It much reioyced mee, and
therefore apprehending the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
I will be bold to adde a

(so I trust, both you and

and besides, to giue you some

               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:648:20"/>
(and in them all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

should offer an oblation
to the Lord, an holy por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Land for the
Priest to dwell on, and to
build the house of GOD
vpon: <hi>Ezeck 45. 1, &amp;</hi> 4. So
that the houses and lands
that our Ancestors haue
dedicated to God in this
manner, for the Churches
and Ministers of this time:
are now also his <hi>right</hi>
and <hi>iust inheritance,</hi> as
well as those which the

               <hi>Israelites</hi> assigned for the

vpon the same reason and
in lieu thereof. But because
it is vncertain when and
how they were brought
into the <hi>Church,</hi> I will say
something touching that
point.</p>
            <p>In the time of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
the vse was (as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<hi>Acts</hi> 2. 45. &amp; <hi>Acts 4.
34, &amp;</hi> 35.) to sell their
lands,<note place="margin">How lands came to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> and bring the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
only, to the Apostles.
For the Church being then
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:648:21"/>
in persecution, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
not to remaine in
any particular place, but
to wander all ouer the
world, for preaching the
Gospell: they could not
possesse immoueable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances:
and therefore
receiued onely the money
they were sold for, distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
it as occasion ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
But after when the
church obtained a little rest,
&amp; began to be settled:<note n="a" place="margin">It appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> who liued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the yeere of Christ 230. that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had then begu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to retain lands in this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, &amp; it may well be, for that <hi>Origen</hi> &amp; <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> shew, that Churches had then possessions.</note> it

found much casualty in

and chused therefore ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to retaine the Lands
themselues, giuen for the

(by suffering the same to

That <hi>himselfe was robbed and

               <hi>Will any man spoile his gods?</hi>
As if hee should say: Can

            <p>9 You see how <hi>Dauid</hi> in
this his sacred fury,<note place="margin">The zeale of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the house of God.</note> was

at pleasure; and like the

the shearer, euen when
his very life was taken
from him. But when he saw
the golden fleece to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the <hi>house of God:</hi>
that is, when hee saw the

a sacred fury; hee leaueth
the mildnesse of the Pascall
Lambe, and taketh vppon
him the fiercenesse of the
Lion of <hi>Iuda.</hi> Then he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth
to bestir him, and
to lay about him. He whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
out them that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned
it; driueth out their
sheep &amp; their oxen, though
they were for the sacrifice:
and ouerthroweth the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

            <p>But ere I depart from
this place of Scripture; let
me note one thing more
out of it, for the greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
of Churches: that
although our Lord bee
heer said, to haue cast these
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:648:42"/>
things out of the Temple;
yet, in truth, they were not
in the Temple it selfe, but
in the outward court or
yard thereof. For within
the inward parts of the
Temple, (namely, the
first, and second Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles)
did no man enter,
but the <hi>Leuite Priests:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Num. 18. 5.</note> and
of them also,<note place="margin">Ebr. 9. 2, 3, 4, 5, &amp;c.</note> none into the
second <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> but the
High Priest. Therefore,
although our Sauiour
Christ, were a Priest for
euer after the order of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedeck:</hi>
yet because hee
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:648:43"/>
was not a <hi>Priest of Leuy:</hi> but
of the Tribe of <hi>Juda</hi> (of
which Tribe <hi>Moses spake
nothing touching the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood:
Heb. 7. 14.</hi>) I take it,
that<note n="a" place="margin">Christ came to fulfill the Law, &amp; not to break it. Therefore (doubtles) he obserued the rules thereof, and the quality of his Tribe.</note> he neuer came within
these parts of the Temple:
nor where the <hi>sacrifice</hi> was,

towards the Temple:
and in the middest where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
(the<note n="d" place="margin">2. Chron. 6. 13.</note> brasen stage which
<hi>Salomon</hi> praied vpon) was
erected. Yet, this very
place, this court, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
yard, would not our
Sauiour permit to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned;
neither with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
matters, nor with car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
so much as a burthen
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:648:44"/>
or vessell through it: <hi>Mark.

not so <hi>Leuetically</hi> holy, as
the Temple: yet it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
to God, with the
Temple: And taken often
in the new Testament, for
the Temple: as in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
before alledged: And
<hi>Acts</hi> 3. 2, 3. By which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
the very Church-yards
themselues (being Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
with the Churches,
and the principall soile
thereof:<note place="margin">Stat. Ne Rectores prosternant arbores in Cimiterio.</note> as an old Statute

haue in them a certaine

kind of <hi>Sanctification:</hi> and
are not therefore to bee

the Ancient Fathers, by
the Canons of the Church:
but the present Lawes of
the Land, haue well proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for them.</p>
            <p>10 But some will say,
that the <hi>sanctification</hi> of
the Temple was <hi>Leuiticall,</hi>
               <note place="margin">More of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and how farre the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is abo.</note>

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:648:45"/>
vnto <hi>three functions;</hi> which
also had <hi>three</hi> seuerall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
assigned to them. The
<hi>first,</hi> belonged to the <hi>Diuine
presence;</hi> &amp; had the custody
of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> 
               <hi>Holiest types</hi> thereof; the
<hi>Oracle,</hi> the <hi>Arke,</hi> the <hi>Mercy-seat,
&amp;c.</hi> and was therefore
called <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi>
or the <hi>Holiest of all.</hi> The <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi>
was for <hi>ceremoniall
worship</hi> &amp; <hi>attonement:</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by sacrifice, oblations,
and other <hi>Leuiticall</hi> rites:
the place thereof being the
the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> (wherein
were the <hi>Holy vessels</hi>) and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:648:45"/>
the Court of Priests, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Altar of burnt sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
did stand. The <hi>third,</hi>
was for simple worshippe,
praier, and doctrine (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any pompe or cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony:)
and the place of
this, was the <hi>outward Court,</hi>
(called,<note n="*" place="margin">1. Chr. 4. 9. &amp; 6. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Atrium populi,</hi> and
<note n="*" place="margin">Acts 31. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Salomons porich;</hi>) which
therefore had in it no <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall</hi>
implement at
all.</p>
            <p>The <hi>two</hi> first of these
functions, with the places
belonging to them; were
indeed particularly appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:648:46"/>
to the Law. For, they
were <hi>Ceremoniall, Mysticall,
Secret, Leuiticall, Iudaicall,</hi>
and <hi>Temporall-Ceremoniall,</hi>
as celebrated with much
worldly pompe. <hi>Mysticall,</hi>
as figurating some spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
things. <hi>Secret;</hi> as either
performed behinde the
Veile or Curtaine: or else
sequestred &amp; romote from
the people. <hi>Leuiticall;</hi> as
committed only to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration;
of that <hi>Tribe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Iudaicall;</hi> as ordained onely
for the saluation of that
people. And <hi>Temporall;</hi> as
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:648:46"/>
instituted onely for a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and not to continue.
But the <hi>Sanctification,</hi> of the
third <hi>function,</hi> and of the
place thereto appointed,
was directly contrary in al
the points alledged to the
former two. <hi>First</hi> (as I said
before) it was for <hi>simple
worship, Praier,</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
which were there to
be performed and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in all <hi>sinceritie,</hi> without
any <hi>ceremony</hi> or <hi>ceremoniall</hi>
implement vsed therein.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> there was no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>mystery</hi> therein to be
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:648:47"/>
seene<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but whatsoeuer was
<hi>mysticall</hi> in the Law, or the
Prophets, was there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> nothing
there, was hidden or secret
from the people, but acted
wholly without the <hi>Veile,</hi>
and publikely for euery
man. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> it was not
appropriate to the <hi>Leuites,</hi>
but common alike to all
the Tribes. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
for the <hi>Iewes</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
but for all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in generall. And <hi>lastly,</hi>
not to endure for a time,
(as those other two of the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:648:47"/>
Law) but to continue for
euer: euen after the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
were called as well as
the <hi>Iewes:</hi> that is, during the
time of the Gospell, as well
as the Law. Therefore,
saith God, by <hi>Isaias</hi> the
Prophet, <hi>cap. 56. 7. My house
shall bee called an house of
Praier, to all Nations.</hi> Hee
said not, an <hi>House of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to all Nations:</hi> for the
<hi>Sacrifice</hi> ended, before the
calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and
so they could haue no part
thereof. Nor an <hi>House of
praier</hi> for the <hi>Jewes</hi> onely,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:648:48"/>
for then had the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
(when they were called)
been likewise excluded.
But an <hi>House of praier to all
Nations,</hi> that is, <hi>Iewes</hi> and
<hi>Gentiles</hi> indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly: which
therefore, must haue relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the times of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.
And consequently, the
<hi>sanctification</hi> of that house,
and of that <hi>function,</hi> is also
a <hi>sanctification</hi> of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>We read not therefore,
that Christ reformed any
thing in the other two fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the <hi>Temple;</hi> for
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:648:48"/>
they were now, as at an
end. But because this third
function was for euer to
continue to his Church:
therefore hee purgeth it of
that that prophaned it; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storeth
it (as hee did mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age)
to the originall sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
And that the future
world (which was the time
of the Gospell) might bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
obserue it, then the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent,
and time of the
Law had done; hee repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
and confirmeth the
<hi>decree,</hi> whereby it was san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified:
<hi>It is written,</hi> saith
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:648:49"/>
he, (as producing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
and wordes of the
foundation) <hi>My house shall
bee called an house of praier to
all people.</hi> Hee saith, <hi>My
House,</hi> as excluding all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
from hauing any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
therein; for, God will
bee Ioynt-tenant with no
man. And it shall bee,
<hi>An house of praier for all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</hi>
that is, publike foreuer;
not priuate, nor appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
to any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor a <hi>denne of
theeues;</hi> that is, no place of
Merchandise, or secular
businesse, as Saint <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rome</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:648:49"/>
expoundeth it. It must not
be an Impropriation; no
man can, or may hold it in
that kind.</p>
            <p>The time also when our
Sauiour pronounced these
words is much to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
as it seemeth to mee.
For it was after he had tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
out the oxen &amp; doues;
that is, the things for the
<hi>Sacrifice.</hi> As though, hee
thereby taught vs, that
when the <hi>Sacrificall</hi> functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Temple was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
yet the <hi>sanctification</hi>
thereof, to bee an house
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:648:50"/>
of prayer, for euer remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>11 This doctrine of our
Sauiour,<note place="margin">Saint <hi>Paul</hi> maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence of the Church.</note> is continued vnto
vs by Saint <hi>Paul:</hi> who, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
the Church with ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and drinking in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
though much good might
follow thereby, (being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
done) as the encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of amity, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
of the poore; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was against the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
of the place: hee
not onely reproueth them
for it, demanding if they
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:648:50"/>
had not houses to eat and
drinke in at home, but ska<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them also (by shewing
the daunger they were fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
into) hee speaketh to
them as with admiration:
<hi>Despise ye the Church of God?</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 12.</note>
As if hee should say, is
your religion now come
vnto that? or is that your
Religion, <hi>To despise the place
that God hath sanctified vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
himselfe;</hi> by making it,
as Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> saith, <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineum
epularum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coment. in 1. Cor. 11.</note> a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queting
house. God won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in <hi>Malachy,</hi> that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:648:51"/>
any should <hi>spoile their gods.</hi>
And the holy Ghost heere
wondereth, that <hi>any should
despise the materiall Church:</hi>
for so Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
it. Thus both of them
wonder at one &amp; the same
thing: that any man should
be so irreligious, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
the reuerence due vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, and that that is
his.</p>
            <p>12 So precise therefore
were the Ancient Fathers
in this point,<note place="margin">The zeale of some of the Fathers to the Church. <hi>Serm. de temp. tom. 10. 21<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of the
Church. Yea, hee termeth
them, <hi>Miserable and wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
men that did it</hi> And de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
against them,
that <hi>If such came Christians
to the Church, they went Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
home.</hi> But when the
Church it selfe came to be
abused! Oh, how Saint
<hi>Ambrose</hi> taketh it, euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Emperour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
great <hi>Valentinian</hi> that
required it for an <hi>Arian: O</hi>
(saith hee) <hi>let him aske that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:648:52"/>

               <note place="margin">Ad Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellinam so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorem: Epist. 33.</note> 
               <hi>my lands, my goods,
and whatsoeuer I possesse, I
will not deny them; yet are
they not mine, but belong to
the poore. Verum ea quae di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uina
sunt, &amp;c.</hi> saith hee, <hi>but
those things that are Gods,
are not subiect to the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the Emperour. If my
lands</hi> (I say) <hi>be desired, enter
them a Gods name; if my body,
I will carry it him; if hee will
haue mee to prison, yea, vnto
death, it pleaseth mee well, I
will not defend my selfe with
multitude of people, neither
will I flie to the Altar, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:648:52"/>
my life, but with all my
heart will die for the Altars.</hi>
And after, in speaking of
the impious Souldiers:<note place="margin">In fine eius<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem Epist.</note> 
               <hi>O
that God</hi> (saith hee) <hi>would
turne their hands from vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
the Church, and then
let them turne all their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons

            <p>My purpose is to bee
short; I will not therefore
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:648:53"/>
now enter any further into
the authorities of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
or meddle with the
Councels and ancient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of the Church which
abound so in this kind of
zeale, and haue established
it (against the <hi>Eustathians,

            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:648:53"/>
13 It seemeth a small
thing to daunce in the
Church-yard,<note place="margin">Sacriledge not to be suffered in the least things.</note> or to eate
and drinke in the Church.
But <hi>sanctification</hi> (saith <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
speaking on this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
<hi>consisteth also euen in the
small things.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coment. in 2. Cor. 11. 22. tom. 9.</note> Therefore <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticus</hi>
aduiseth vs,<note place="margin">Eccles. 25. 27.</note> that
<hi>we giue not the water passage,
no not in a little.</hi> For he that
oponeth the waters but a
little, knoweth not how
great a breach they will
make at length. So is it to
make an entrance into sin,
or to breake the reuerence
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:648:54"/>
of holy things in trifles.</p>
            <p>Therefore God puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
seuerely the petty of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
in this kind: not
<hi>Corah</hi> onely and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
that inuaded the
high function of the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood:
but euen him that
gathered the stickes on the
Sabath day: <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 34.
And poore <hi>Vzzah</hi> himselfe
(whom <hi>Dauid</hi> so much
lamented) that did, as it
were, but <hi>stay the Arke</hi> from
shaking, (2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 6. and
1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 13. 9.) and yet died
for it, because his hand was
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:648:54"/>
not sanctified to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>14 I conclude this point
with the saying of <hi>Salomon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">An admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition to them that meddle with holy things.</note>
               <hi>Pro.</hi> 20. 25. (and let al men
consider it:) <hi>It is a snare for
a man to deuoure that which
is sanctified, and after the
Vowes, to enquire.</hi> A Snare
hath <hi>three</hi> properties. First,
to catch suddenly. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
to hold surely. <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
to destroy certainly. So
was <hi>Vzza</hi> taken ere hee
was aware: hee did but
touch the <hi>Arke,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
hee was catcht.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:648:55"/>
King <hi>Vzziah</hi> did but med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with the incense, and
presently the <hi>Leprosie was
on his face: 2. Chron. 26. 19.
Jeroboam</hi> did but stretch
out his hand against the
Prophet, and presently it
<hi>withered: 1. King.</hi> 13. 4. And
as a man falleth suddenly
into it: so is it as hard to get
out. <hi>Vzza</hi> died in it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently.
<hi>Vzziah</hi> languished
in it all his life, and then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in it also, <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi>
and <hi>Abiram,</hi> were no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
caught in this snare, but
it held them so surely, as
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:648:55"/>
when all <hi>Israel</hi> else fled and
escaped; they, &amp; their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
(most miserable
men) were detained in it,
to their notorious destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>I might heere take iust
occasion to remember
what hath happened to
many in this Kingdom, that
became vnfortunate after
they medled with Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and Church-liuings.
But I will run into no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularities.
Let those men,
and those families, which
are <hi>vnfortunate</hi> (as wee
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:648:56"/>
terme them) consider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
themselues, their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
or some of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors,
haue not been fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
in this snare.</p>
            <p>And let the <hi>Proprietaries</hi>
of Parsonages also well
consider these things. For,
if <hi>Vzza</hi> died, that did but
touch the Arke to saue it:
what shal become of them
that stretch out their hands
against Churches to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
them? If the <hi>sticke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatherer</hi>
was stoned, for so
small a prophanation of
the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> what shall
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:648:56"/>
they looke for, that by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
the Churches, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
also the Sabbath it
selfe, (in a manner) as ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to the publike
sanctification thereof. And
if <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram,</hi>
offended so hainous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in medling with the
things of the Leuiticall
Priesthood, though they
imployed them to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of God: what haue
they to feare, that vsurpe
the things of the Gospel, &amp;
peruert the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wholly to their

owne vse, from the seruice
of God? Yea, that pollute
his Churches and houses
of prayer to seruile &amp; base
offices: leauing the Parishi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
vncertenly prouided
of diuine seruice, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
both of the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
it selfe, and of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of God in generall.</p>
            <p>15 But they will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
themselues with this:<note place="margin">A surmise answered.</note>
that though the Churches
bee sanctified to some pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
yet the sanctity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

things were sanctified by
the hand of man, to be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Ceremony; but the
churches of the Gospel,
are sanctified by our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
himselfe, to be houses
of prayer. Not that prayer
is to be vsed onely in these
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:648:58"/>
places but that these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are onely to be vsed for
prayer. And wee must not
presume that God sleepeth
because hee punisheth not
(now as he did of old) the
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temners of his worship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For as the law consisted in
visible &amp; temporal things,
so the punishments therin,
were for the most part vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
and temporal. But the
Gospel concerneth things
inuisible and eternall, and
therefore the punishments
assigned therein, are for the
most part, inuisible &amp; eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</p>

16 They haue also ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
comfort,<note place="margin">Another surmise answered.</note> and that is,
that though these things
were once Spirituall, now
they are made temporall
by the Lawes of <hi>Dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
and especially, by the
<hi>Stat. of 32. H. 8. cap.</hi> 7. It is
true that those Statutes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
diuers Law-termes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
these things that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
belong to temporall
inheritances: and that the

made them <hi>demandable</hi> by
originall Writs, &amp; hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
certain real actions, &amp;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:648:59"/>
other courses for recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
&amp; conueying of them
in Temporall Courts: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Lay-men could not
in former times haue sued
for things of this nature in
any Court of the Kingdom.
But this prooueth not the
things themselues to bee
therefore temporall,<note place="margin">Dissero non assero.</note> (no
more then that an English
man is a Frenchman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he saileth in a French
bottome.) For vpon the
same reason; the Statute gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
also other actions (for
recouering of <hi>tithes</hi> and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:648:59"/>
               <hi>offerings</hi> withholden, &amp;c.)
in the <hi>Courts spiritual.</hi> They
then that out of the one
part of the <hi>Statute</hi> wil haue
them temporall, are by the
other part in forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
them still Spirituall,
and so to make them like
a Centaure: <hi>prolem bifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mem.</hi>
It were very hard (in
my vnderstanding) to
ground a point of so great
consequence, vpon subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of words, and ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
implications, without
any expresse letter of Law
to that purpose, especially,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:648:60"/>
to make the Houses and
offerings of God, <hi>temporall</hi>
Inheritances. But I see it
is a Law question in my

               <hi>Dier,</hi> whether <hi>tithes</hi>

by any words in those Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.

that euery member might

Diuines of learning and iudgement,
(conceiuing well of my Booke,) sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
that I had departed from the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

the 12. verse of the 83. Psalme. <hi>Onely to
the sanctified things of the Iewes which
(they said) was spoken of all their houses

them (as I thought it fit) <hi>reddere ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem

(because the booke goeth forth againe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a new aduenture, and may encounter
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:648:94"/>
with the like obiections,) I held it now
as necessary to adde something vnto it in

I signifie vnto you, that they which
tooke that exception, accounted both my

as namely, that if it were so heinous a

denounceth such heauy things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, that menaced Gods, <hi>Lay

the rather, doth hee it against such as
with greater fury and impiety afflict
his more peculiar and chosen ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
his <hi>Cleargy,</hi> his <hi>Leuites,</hi> his
<hi>first borne?</hi> Against these I say, that
forbeare not to violate the things
more deare vnto him: His <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
his <hi>Oracle,</hi> his <hi>holy mysteries,</hi>
that is, things belonging to his
honour and diuine seruice, things
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:648:97"/>
and meanes, ordained to the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of his blessed word? For this
is the consequence of destroying our
Churches: this killeth the bird in the
shel: and to a person offending in this
nature, wrote I my Booke.</p>
            <p>By like reason, it may also be said;
that this <hi>Psalme</hi> was framed against
Heathens and Infidels, (which in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
hostility assailed the Church &amp;
people of God with fire and sword)
not against such as be our owne bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
&amp; of the family of the Church,
though (in some sort) they doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury
vnto it. I answere that the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites</hi>
and <hi>Moabites</hi> were also of the
kindred of <hi>Israel:</hi> yea, the <hi>Edomites,</hi>
and <hi>Ismalites,</hi> of the linage of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
aswell as the <hi>Israelites</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues:
yet when they ioined with

went as freely and as fiercely
against them as the rest. So if our
Church be spoiled by her brethren,
her children, or kindred, the sentence
is all one against them, as against
Heathen and Infidels, yea, and that
also more iustly and deseruedly by
the iudgement of the <hi>Prophet,</hi> who
accounteth the treachery of a <hi>familiar

            <p>As for <hi>Luther,</hi> he expoundeth not this

               </gap>
are most acceptable with many. The last

man that hath written vpon the <hi>Psalter,
Lorinus</hi> a Iesuit, (and therefore I will not
presse his authority) yet to doe him right,
very well esteemed amongst great Clarks
of our owne Church for much good lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
(though in matters of controuersie,
full enough of Romish leuin) reciteth
some-what more briefly the former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations
of <hi>Petrus Damianus, Hugo
Cardinalis</hi> and <hi>Iohn Vitalis,</hi> and approuing
those their applications, putteth them still
on into the world, as truly consonant to
the tenor of the Psalme, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
I doubt not hath also many other
expositions, as herbes haue vsually diuers
vertues and operations. But thus the eldest
and newest expositors are wholly for mee,
many also (&amp; of the best of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) of the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
ages, none that I know against me. For
although <hi>Musculus, Bucer, Caluin, Marlorat,
Mollerus,</hi> expound this Psalme historically
of the Countrey and Nation of the Iewes,
yet when then apply it to the Church of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:648:103"/>
Christ (as otherwise there were no vse of it)
they make that application by way of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
&amp; <hi>analogy;</hi> And then is there no cause
to raise an <hi>antithesis,</hi> or contrariety be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them and me. For to reconcile the
matter, S. <hi>Ierome</hi> in his entrance into the
exposition of this Psalme, telleth vs, that
wee may expound it figuratiuely of the
Church (which I vnderstand in matters of
action, gouernement, doctrine) or <hi>histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
of the people of the Iewes and nations</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them. And though <hi>Caluin</hi> himselfe
pursueth for the most part the historicall
interpretation, yet when he commeth to
the 12. verse, he faith; <hi>I terum accusat profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos
homines sacrilegij, quod praedateria licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia
inuolant in ipsam dei haereditatem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus much, and too much touching
this point. As it is saide in the end of the</hi>
Machabees: If I haue done well and as the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
required, it is the thing that I desired: but if
I haue spoken slenderly and barely, it is that I
could. <hi>Let no man therefore rely vpon me,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:648:104"/>
but learn of them that are bound to teach;</hi>
For the Priest slips should preserue knowledge,
and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he
is the messenger of the Lord of Hosts. Mal. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Other things there be, wherein I would
willingly haue enlarged my self a little: but
as <hi>Popilius in Liuy</hi> discribing a circle about
<hi>Antiochus</hi> enforced him to answere before
hee stept out of it. So the Printer (hauing
printed al to the last sheet before I knew it)
restraineth me, <hi>ad articulum temporis,</hi> within
which accordingly I must needs end.</p>
