            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

nor live not in the ſame way of Sinning; yet
Selfiſhneſs, and Pride, and Senſuality, and the love of
Worldly Things, Ignorance and Ungodlineſs are plainly
become the common Corruption of the Nature of Man;
ſo that their Hearts are turned to the World from God,
and filled with impiety, filthineſs, and injuſtice; and
their Reaſon is but a Servant to their Senſes; and their
<note n="m" place="bottom">Rom. 8. 5, 6, 7.</note> Mind, and Love and Life, is Carnal; and this car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Mind is Enmity to the Holineſs of God, and cannot
be ſubject to his Law. This Corruption is hereditary,
and is become, as it were, a Nature to us, being the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Malady of all our Natures. And it is eaſie to know

to renew your Souls, or to reconcile them unto God.
Will a Nature that is Carnal reſiſt and overcome the

Will a Worldly Mind overcome the World? When Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom

eaſily rooted up? O how great and hard a Work is it,
to cauſe a blind unbelieving Sinner to ſet his Heart on
another World, and lay up all his Hopes in Heaven, and
to caſt off all the things he ſeeth, for that God and Glory
which he never ſaw! And for a hardned, worldly, fleſhly
heart to become Wiſe, and Tender, and Holy, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly,
and abhor the Sin which it moſt fondly loveth!
And what can we do to ſatisfie Juſtice, and reconcile ſuch
a rebel Soul to God?</p>

by the true Faith and Repentance they will turn to God.
And this ſhall be the Law according to which he will
judge all that hear it at the laſt; for he is made the judge
of All, and will raiſe all the dead, and will juſtify his

condemn the Unbelievers, impenitent and<note n="x" place="bottom">Luke 16.</note> ungodly,

for which we were created, and from which we
fell. And thus by a Saviour and a Sanctifier muſt all
be reconciled and renewed, that will be glorified with
God in Heaven. All this you may learn from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Scriptures, which were<note n="c" place="bottom">2 Tim. 3. 16.</note> written by the Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

               <p>IX. When you underſtand all this, it is time for you
to<note n="e" place="bottom">2 Cor. 13. 5. Pſal. 4. 4. 2 Pet. 1. 10.</note> look home, and underſtand now what State your
Souls are in. That you were made capable of Holineſs
and Happineſs, you know: that you and all Men are
fallen from God, and Holineſs, and Happineſs, unto Self,
and Sin, and Miſery, you know: that you are ſo far
redeemed by Chriſt, you know, as to have a pardoning
and ſaving Covenant tendered you, and Chriſt and
Mercy offered to your choice. But whether you are
truly penitent Believers, and renewed by the Holy
Ghoſt, and ſo united unto Chriſt, this is the Queſtion
yet unreſolved; this is the Work that is yet to do, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which there is no Salvation; and if thou die before

more ſure) I require thee now, who readeſt theſe
words, as thou regardeſt thy Salvation, as thou wouldeſt
eſcape Hell Fire, and ſtand with Comfort before Chriſt
and his Angels, at the laſt, that thou ſoberly conſider
whether Reaſon command thee not to try thy State;

can adviſe thee, and follow on the ſearch till thou
know thy Caſe. And if thy Soul be a ſtranger to this

without any delay, to make out to Chriſt, and beg his

to thy God, thy Saviour and Sanctifier, and enter
into his Covenant, with a full Reſolution never to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
him; to deny thy ſelf, and the deſires of the Fleſh,
and this deceitful tranſitory World, and lay out all thy
hopes on Heaven, and ſpeedily, whatever it coſt thee,
to make ſure of the Felicity which hath no end? And
dareſt thou refuſe this when God and Conſcience do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

(And if <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi>
were Fancies, this might be believed.) Some he debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
by the power of fleſhly Appetite and Luſt, ſo that

ſhortly die. Whether any deſerve thy Love and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

Will a few days fleſhly Pleaſures pay for the

and thy Proſperity be ſweet at Death, and in the Day

believeſt that there is a God, and a World to come, and
as thou careſt for thy Soul, whether it be ſaved or dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
I beſeech thee, I charge thee, think of theſe things!
think of them once a day at leaſt! think of them with
thy moſt ſober ſerious Thoughts! Heaven is not a May-game,
and Hell is not a Flea-biting! Make not a jeſt of
Salvation or Damnation! I know thou liveſt in a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
world, where thou mayeſt hear ſome laughing
at ſuch things as theſe, and ſcorning at a Holy Life, and
faſtning odious Reproaches on the Godly, and merrily
drinking, and playing, and prating away their Time,
and then ſaying, that they will truſt God with their
Souls, and hope to be ſaved without ſo much ado! But
if all theſe Men do not change their minds, and be not
ſhortly down in the Mouth, and would not be glad to
eat their Words, and wiſhed that they had lived a holy
Life, though it had coſt them Scorn and Suffering in the
World, let me bear the ſhame of a Deceiver for ever:
But if God and thy Conſcience bear witneſs againſt thy
Sin, and tell thee that a holy Life is beſt, regard not the
Gain-ſayings of a Bediam World, which is drunk with
the Deluſions of the Fleſh: But <hi>give up thy Soul and Life
to God by Jeſus Chriſt in a faithful Covenant!</hi> Delay no
longer, Man, but reſolve; <hi>Reſolve immediately, reſolve
unchangeably; And God will he thine, and thou ſhalt be
his for ever.</hi> Amen. Lord have Mercy on this Sinner, and

It is the End and Reaſon of all the reſt; but it hath no

guilt of Unthankfulneſs for a Saviour, and reſiſting his
Spirit and Grace that ſhould have renewed, governed

fleſhly and worldly Vanity, and finfully neglected the
