            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And yet, as it is not very eaſie to diſcover many other Countries, where Nature hath been more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſive of her choiſeſt Bleſſings than in our Own; ſo likewiſe to point out any one Place, where ſhe hath beeen more liberal in diſperſing va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and delightful Objects, than within the Confines of this flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Monarchy, a Scheme of which I take here the boldneſs to preſent to your Honour.</p>

            <head>A PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT will not, I preſume, be thought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs to acquaint the Reader, that theſe Papers had in all probability lain long buried in Duſt and Obſcurity, had not ſome falſe Copies, which by chance came lately to the true Author's notice, ſtole Clandeſtinely into the World under the ſpecious Title of Mr. <hi>Roger's Three Years Travels over</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Wales, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are indeed ſo unadviſedly patch'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo wretchedly Curtail'd, ſo horribly Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and abominably Erroneous, that the right Author was obliged in his own Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication to publiſh from his own true Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript, which hath been formerly, and of late, peruſed by the Hands of ſome Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, a more Authentick Copy. And though he cannot as yet diſcover this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious
<pb facs="tcp:54306:5"/>
Cheat, which has for ſome time walked in Darkneſs, yet to diſcourage for the future all ſuch unbecoming mercenary Attempts, he reſolved at laſt with himſelf, by a more correct Edition, to expoſe the Plagiariſm and Diſhoneſty of ſuch vile Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troons, and ſcandalous Undertakers, which have appeared with ſuch open and brazen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced Effrontery.</p>
            <p>And though indeed they have put on what falſe Diſguiſe they can to Cheat the World, and ſet off the Book with the moſt plauſible Varniſhes, that thereby they might the better recommend it to the Reader, yet there doth appear throughout the whole Series of it ſuch horrible Blunders, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable Miſtakes, ſuch ſilly Shiftings and Turnings both of Things and Places, ſuch crude Apologies for its Brevity, and in ſhort, ſuch a ſhameful Contexture of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Impudence cloſely link'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by that unlearned Fry. To give but one notorious Inſtance here for all, their placing, <hi>Page 99.</hi> the Seven Wonders of the <hi>Peak</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> inſtead of <hi>Darby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire;</hi> though there are divers other as groſs Errours, if it be worth while to rake into them, as their falſe Tranſcribing or leaving out quite divers proper Names of great Significancy; as alſo what chiefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, that as ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely
<pb facs="tcp:54306:5"/>
Features will eaſily diſcover the Spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs of the Brood, ſo no Pen can be ſharp enough to expoſe the Diſingenuity and Baſeneſs of ſuch a viperous Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Now ſuch a ſeaſonable Advertiſement as this is, being ſufficient to caution the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary Reader againſt all other previous Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, will become as juſt an Apology for the preſent Publication of theſe enſuing Papers, which if ſo uſeful and diverting (as the World is told) under a falſe Vizor, will now prove, it is to be hoped, more pleaſing and acceptable in their own true, native Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
            <p>For they will here meet with a more full and accurate Deſcription, though not of every individual Town and Place of Note within the Dominions of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> yet with a true and impartial Account of moſt Cities and Towns Corporate, with their famous Cathedrals and other eminent Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures; of the moſt remarkable Havens and Rivers, of divers curious Caves, Wells and Mines, with many other divertive Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, and hiſtorical Relations, with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ancient Inſcriptions, Epitaphs and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, which were yet never taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of by any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Topographer, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Years ago Penned for the uſe of Two Young Gentlemen, Sons to Mr. <hi>Van-Acker,</hi>

formerly an eminent Merchant in <hi>London,</hi> whom the Author had the happineſs to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company in theſe Travels, is now again Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to make it the more conſummate and inviting.</p>
            <p>So that whoſoever is diſpoſed to Travel Abroad, or to ſee, which indeed is moſt neceſſary firſt, and acquaint himſelf with the Rarities of Nature at Home, may know hereby in what Parts of our Iſland to find them; and for thoſe who having already vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited remoter Regions, are ſo ſtrangely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raviſhed with the proſpect of Foreign Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties, that they are hardly brought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any thing in their own Native Soil equal to ſuch Diſcoveries as they have made in other Countries; this may be ſufficient to inform them, That there is not any thing worth our Wonder Abroad, whereof Nature hath not written a Copy in our own Iſland: And it cannot be too frequently obſerved, that as <hi>Italy</hi> has <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Grotto, and the <hi>Sybil</hi>'s Cave by <hi>Puteoli,</hi> ſo <hi>England</hi> hath <hi>Ochy-Hole</hi> by <hi>Wells,</hi> and <hi>Pool</hi>'s by <hi>Bux<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ton</hi>: We have <hi>Baiae</hi> at the <hi>Bath,</hi> the <hi>Alps</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> the <hi>Spaw</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaltites</hi> at <hi>Pitchford</hi> in <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> the <hi>Pyramids</hi> at <hi>Stonehenge,</hi> Pearls of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and Diamonds of <hi>India</hi> at St. <hi>Vincent</hi>'s Rock.

            <p>So that ſince <hi>England</hi> is not deſtitute of thoſe many taking Things, which all Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers ſo paſſionately admire Abroad, it is very incongruous to pretend to be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with other Countries, and to be Strangers to their own, which is an Epitome of all other; and which upon all theſe, as well as other Accounts, may very juſtly claim and challenge, as a due Debt, all thoſe glorious Elogies which both Ancient and Modern Writers have conferred upon it.</p>
            <p>And having thus briefly declar'd the main Deſign and Scope of this Narrative, I ſhall neither Complement my Reader into its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, nor trouble my ſelf to make any Harangue in Apologizing for its Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance; for as for all Candid Perſons, I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion not but their Cenſures will be as favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as their Humours ingenuous: And as

                  <p>As theſe were the Reaſons which occaſion'd our Journey, ſo we took a time in which it was agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to make one.

                  <p>But the moſt remarkable, and which cannot but have the Suffrage of all Travellers to be the moſt admirable piece of Nature's Workmanſhip in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation is a place call'd <hi>Ochy-Hole,</hi> ſome two Miles diſtant from this City, 'tis a Cave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a high Rock, ſituated among the <hi>Mendipp-Hills</hi> I before mention'd, of which I ſhall endeavour to give a Deſcription as briefly as I can</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Ochy-Hole.</note>After that we had with ſome difficulty climbed up to the top of a Rock, we went along the Brow of the Hill till we came to the Mouth of the Cave, where a Door being open'd that gave us an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, we lighted up Candles to direct us in the way, and took Staffs in our Hands to ſupport us in our Paſſage, and in we ventur'd: Having gone forward ſome few paces, we found the Cave very craggy as well as hollow, and ſo dark, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſure but <hi>Tartarus</hi> it ſelf could reſemble it; the Candles, though ſix in number, and of a large ſize, ſcarce burning ſo bright, as one great one doth uſually in an open Room, we then thought certainly we were arrived upon the Confines of the Infernal Regions, or elſe were got into ſome ſuch diſmal place as the <hi>Italians</hi> tell us the <hi>Sibylline Grotto</hi> is, and we began to be afraid we might probably meet with the ſame unwelcome Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the <hi>Boeotick</hi> Cave of <hi>Trophonius</hi> uſed to give thoſe who were ſo curious to viſit it; namely, that though they enter'd in frolickſom and merry, yet they ſhould certainly return out of it ſad and penſive, and never laugh more whilſt they lived upon Earth: Such dreadful Apprehenſions did at firſt ſeize upon ſome of us, and, indeed, we had cauſe to fear ſuch diſmal Operations might proceed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54306:23"/>
from this, as well as from the other, ſince both were equally uncomfortable, by reaſon of their deprivation from the leaſt glimmerings of light, and conſequently had the ſame Circumſtances to beget both horrour and aſtoniſhment: however we pluck'd up our Spirits, and crept in one after another, as faſt as we could conveniently.</p>
                  <p>The Cave, as we went along, was parted into ſeveral kind of Rooms; the names whereof our Guides informed us to be thus: The firſt was the Kitchen, in which by the Door ſticks out a large maſs of the Rock, which they tell us was the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Head formerly the Keeper of this Cave; it ſeems to bear that kind of reſemblance, and tho' by that is a Stone which they call the Tomb-ſtone, under which they report that he lies interred, and his Dog hard by him too, metamorphos'd into the ſame lapideous Subſtance, yet their Transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations are not ſo ſtrange and wonderful, though perhaps ſomething too fabulous to be given credit to, as the variety the Rock affords into which they are incorporated, part of it gliſtering like Silver, and part like Diamonds, and both appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very pleaſant to the Eye. A little farther on the Right Hand is another piece of the Rock, that bears the reſemblance of a Bell; and on the Left, of a Veſſel, which they term a <hi>Ceave,</hi> in which the Beer of an old Sorcereſs (Couſin to the famous <hi>Circe,</hi> Lady Governeſs of this diſmal Cave) uſed to be work'd in. 'Tis a hollow Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern of a conſiderable depth, always filled with Water, and now and then flowing over, to which the drops of Water which continually trickle down from the top of the Rock, add every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment freſh ſupplies. Hard by this ſtands another Veſſel of hers too, in which, they ſay, ſhe uſed to wet her Malt; they call it the <hi>Eaſt-Hurdle</hi>: 'Tis likewiſe hollow, and of a pretty depth. And how appears to your view the old Witch her ſelf, heating, as it were, her Furnace, which looks at
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54306:24"/>
firſt view black and ſooty, but inwardly ſeems to be a Statue of Alabaſter, by reaſon of its whiteneſs, though it is moſt probably the product of Nature, not of Art, becauſe the place is very unfit and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable for any Artiſt to exerciſe his Skill in, it being very oft ſo low, that it is impoſſible here and there for any one to ſtand upright in it, and therefore it was that we were enforced frequently to ſtoop, and buckle almoſt double, for fear of daſhing our Heads againſt the Rock, until we came to ſome Steps we were to deſcend, where the deſcent likewiſe was tedious and frightful; for on the Right Hand the Rock hung over us very low and ſloping, and on the Left a Rivolet which, with a pretty loud noiſe, glides along the Cave, made us cautious in our Steps, till at laſt we came Sweating into another Room, which is called the Hall; and here at firſt ſight we were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with as great a Rarity as Nature hath in all her Store-Houſes: 'Tis a Ciſtern almoſt ſquare, about ſix Foot each way, and of a conſiderable depth, always brimful of Water, ſupplied by the drops which continually fall from above, and yet never runs over: and the reaſon is this, becauſe as the Water increaſeth, ſo doth the Ciſtern too, and both of them had then been obſerved, within the ſpace of Twenty Years, to have received a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable augmentation; which is the more probable, becauſe the Water is of a petrefying nature; and if any thing be caſt into it, in a ſhort time it diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers this ſecret quality by an outward incruſtation of that which is thrown in. The drops which hang above are like congealed Icecles, as clear as Cryſtal, ſome of which falling down into the Water grow harder in ſubſtance, though they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear pretty pellucid. Round about this Hall hang four Stones reſembling four Flitches of Bacon, for the outſide is blackiſh, and the inſide white. In this place the Daughter of the old Sorcereſs hath took up her reſidence, and appears to your Eye
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54306:24"/>
like a Statue of a Woman big with Child; ſhe is of a different colour from her Mother, being much more dusky. But nothing is more pretty to behold than thoſe which they call the Organ-Pipes, placed upon one ſide of the Rock, and are very like to thoſe we have in our Churches, ſome being of bigger, and ſome of leſſer dimenſions; in the middle of a good reaſonable thickneſs, though at the ends ſharp and ſlender. After ſome more difficulties in our Paſſage, and no leſs dangerous than before, we came into another part of the Cave, more ſtrange than any we had yet ſeen: 'Tis a place which they call the Dancing-Room, ſo well contrived and arched above, that Nature hath here wrought what Art can never be able to attain: If you look up, the variety of Colours which are there to be ſeen by the light of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, and the checquered Configurations of the Rock, which is now very high above your Head, will both feaſt your Eyes and refreſh your Body, which by that time is ſufficiently wearied by the tediouſneſs as well as the trouble of the Paſſage; for there is ſo great a gliſtering, ſuch a luſtre as it were of Silver and Precious Stones about you, that you would be ready to miſtake your ſelf, and think that you were in the Palace of ſome great Monarch of the World, and not in the ſubterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Caverns of the Earth. If you look down, there you will find no ſtony, hard, rugged tract to perplex you, but a fine, even, ſandy Floor to divert you; and indeed it was beyond expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we who had beheld before nothing but ſuch craggy Stones and dangerous Paſſages, ſhould at laſt arrive in ſo ſpacious and delightful a Place: They told us it was not unuſual for the Gentlemen and Ladies in thoſe Parts to bring Muſick and Dance here, the Muſick, by reaſon of the Eccho, making a Melody more ſweet than ordinary. We pauſed and breathed a little here, delighting our ſelves as well with it, as alſo with the reſemblance
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54306:25"/>
of a Chimney, which we took really to be one, it being of that Faſhion, and having in it a kind of black moiſt matter, which, if you touch, it will ſtick to your Fingers and black them like Soot, and yet no Fire was ever known to be there. But we were not as yet ſatisfied, though we were near half a Mileunder Ground in a diſmal Grotto, but went on farther to a place termed the Cellar, that is curiouſly Vaulted; and 'tis very uſual to carry Bottles of Wine, and drink there upon a Stone Table, which is formed out of the Rock. In this place lies a huge Maſſy Stone, which they call the Great Gun; the nature of which is this, take it but up in your Hands, and let it fall down to the Ground, and a great Gun cannot give a louder report: We tried this experiment thrice, but we thought the Rock we were under would have rent in Pieces about our Ears, yet they who were half way in the Cave, or at the Mouth of it, or above it, heard no noiſe at all; this we found experimentally true, for one of the Gentlemen who entred in with us, being beat out with the difficulty of the Tracts, ſtaid about the middle-way, and when we returned back to him, he aſſured us, that where he ſtood he had heard nothing of a noiſe. But at length, at the end of the Cellar, after we had gone down lower ſome few Steps, a Rivolet there was that gave a period to our Progreſs; it was pretty deep, and as clear as Cryſtal, the Water extream cold, but very pleaſant to the Palate, and runs along the Cave ſometimes in a ſmall, and ſometimes in a larger Current, where taking up ſome of the congealed Matter that lies at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of it, we found it very hard, of a dusky co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and of a round conſiſtency, juſt as if a little company of Hailſtones were cemented and joined together, and the River running along under Ground, tho' its Head from whence it firſt ſprings, like that of the <hi>Nile</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> is not as yet plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovered, and conveying it ſelf at laſt out of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54306:25"/>
the Cave ſets, as they ſay, Thirty Mills on work, after it comes into the adjacent Country.</p>
                  <p>When we were got thus far, almoſt a Mile under Ground, as our Guides told us, we began to conſider how we ſhould return, and get out ſafe again from this place of Horrour and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Regions of Light, being afraid to find the ſame Difficulties we had encountred with in our entrance. But though the place was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing reſembling an infernal Abyſs, and our Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage into it proved ſo troubleſom and irkſom, yet we came back without any toil, or rather with great facility and pleaſure, notwithſtanding it is impoſſible to find out the way without a Guide, there being ſo many windings and turnings; nor could the Guides themſelves ever extricate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of this darkſom Labyrinth, but by the light of Candles, whereby they are enabled to ſteer their Courſe. However at laſt we made a ſhift to creep up again to the top of the Rock, juſt as merry <hi>Lucian</hi> tells us old <hi>Menippus</hi> did out from a hole in <hi>Lebadia,</hi> after he returned from Hell, and had ended his Diſcourſes with the Ghoſts below, and went back to the place where we firſt diſmounted, and left our Horſes to graze with the neighbouring Shepherds.</p>
                  <p>After we had got breath,<note place="margin">Bath.</note> and were a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited, we mounted again, and rode away for <hi>Bath,</hi> which by ſeveral old Writers is called <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannum, Akemanceſter,</hi> from the old Roman way called <hi>Akemanſtreet-way</hi>; which, ſay Antiquaries, took its name from them that being full of Aches and Achings, made it their way to this place for eaſe of their Pains. We could not diſcover it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til we came juſt upon it, lying low, and on all ſides ſurrounded with Hills, out of which iſſue forth many Springs of a wonderful virtue, though ſome of them are very Sulphureous and unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to the Taſte. It is watered with the <hi>Avon,</hi> over which it has a Stone-Bridge, and is environed
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54306:26"/>
with a Wall, commodious for its Market-place, and handſomly adorned with three Churches, one whereof is very large and ſpatious, built in the form of a Cathedral, the Steeple is four-ſquare, and hath a Ring of tunable Bells, and the Quire is grac'd with a ſmall but ſweet Organ: And in it are erected ſeveral ancient and ſtately Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Perſons of great Quality, and of ſome Biſhops of this See, who have been moſt noble Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors to it. 'Tis govern'd by a Mayor and Aldermen, and the Aſſizes are generally kept there in the Summer time: But that which is moſt remarkable, and cauſeth a concourſe not only of the Nobility and Gentry, but of the Commonalty too from all parts of the Nation hither, are the Baths, which are not inferiour to any whatever in <hi>Europe:</hi> The Waters herein are hot, of a blue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Colour, ſtrong ſcent, and ſend forth thin Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours; and as, without queſtion, they have ſtrengthened many weak and feeble Limbs, ſo do they cure divers Diſeaſes, which are incident and deſtructive to humane Nature, by cauſing Men to Sweat either more or leſs proportionably to their Diſtempers. There are four or five which are principally in requeſt, one Triangular, and called the <hi>Croſs-Bath,</hi> from the Croſs that ſtood formerly in the midſt of it; 'tis about twenty-five Foot long, and as broad at one end, the heat of it gentler than the reſt, becauſe it has fewer Springs. Whilſt we continued in the Town, we were preſented by the Serjeant of this Bath with a piece of Earth, which was digged up here at the loſs of a Spring; it ſmelt like Sulphur, and burnt like Soot. We ſaw likewiſe a piece of an Elm-Tree, which was digged up at the ſame time, together with the Skull of a Woman taken up then too, which are ſuppoſed to have lain there many Years before the Bath was ſo encloſed. The Orders are ſtrict and regular, and Perſons of the greateſt Quality prefer to bathe here, and to drink
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54306:26"/>
the Water hereof with Limona Sugar, rather than of the other. Hard by this ſtands the Hot <hi>Bath,</hi> not much frequented ſave by thoſe who have quite loſt the uſe of their Limbs, the Water hereof being much hotter than the reſt. Not far from this is that which they call the <hi>Leper</hi>'s <hi>Bath,</hi> which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd to be very efficacious againſt that loathſom Diſeaſe, and an Hoſpital or Spittle, built by <hi>Reginald,</hi> Bp. of <hi>Bath,</hi> for the uſe of poor, aged, decrepit People. About the middle of the Town, nearer to the great Church, are the King and Queen's <hi>Baths,</hi> divided only by a Wall; the laſt having no Spring in it, but receiving the Water from the King's <hi>Bath,</hi> which is about 60 Foot ſquare, and has in the middle of it many hot Springs that make its heat the greater: Each of theſe two <hi>Baths</hi> have a Pump to pump Water upon the Diſeaſed; and I have obſerved ſome Perſons who have been troubled with great Pains in their Heads, or other parts of their Body, have ſuffered very great quantities of this ſcalding Water to be poured on them by their Guides. Hereabouts, formerly, was found an ancient Statue of <hi>Hercules</hi> amongſt other great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of Antiquity, holding a Serpent in his Hand, which was diſcover'd in the Ruines of an ancient Temple, perhaps that which was here Conſecrated to <hi>Minerva,</hi> and it might be thought very convenient, that he being the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telary Patriot of ſuch places, and having ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently expoſed himſelf to hard Labours, and manifold Dangers, might now and then eaſe, and refreſh his wearied Limbs by ſuch Purgations, as the <hi>Bath</hi> could afford him. In this, and other <hi>Baths,</hi> hang divers Crutches of lame and decrepit Perſons, which they left behind them as Trophies of their Recovery, being perfectly cured of their Lameneſs and Infirmity, and reſtor'd again to their former Health and Strength. There is ſtill one behind, which is call'd the Horſe-<hi>Bath,</hi> which is ſaid to be as effectual for the cure of lame and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54306:27"/>
foundred Horſes, and the removal of ſome other Diſtempers, which are incident to thoſe kind of Animals.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Waltham</hi> was of old a ſmall Village,<note place="margin">Waltham <hi>in</hi> Eſſex.</note> or rather a deſolate place beſet with Woods and Briars, which one <hi>Tovius</hi> in the declination of the <hi>Saxon</hi>

Empire, a great Courtier, and a very wealthy and potent Man, firſt Founded, and planted there a Colony of ſome ſixtyſix Men; afterwards he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſing, <hi>Athelſtan</hi> his Son was deprived of his Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor beſtowed it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Harold,</hi> a great Favourite of his, who, having taken poſſeſſion of it, conſtituted in it a Church of Secular Canons, and Dedicating it to the Honour of the Holy Croſs, made his Vows here in hopes of a Victory, when he went to fight againſt <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> the Conqueror; but <hi>Harold</hi> being ſlain, and his Army quite routed by the <hi>Normans,</hi> his Body was beg'd by his Mother, of the <hi>Norman</hi> Duke, and buried in this place. After this, the ſame Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, in the Reign of K. <hi>Henry</hi> II. was by the King's Command much enlarged, and Regular Canons placed there to the number of Twenty-four, and Dedicated to the Holy Croſs and St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> ſaith the moſt Ingenious Mr. <hi>Tanner,</hi> in his <hi>Notitia Monaſtica.

                     <note place="margin">Hartford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</note>We ſtaid not long here, and therefore were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently in <hi>Hartfordſhire,</hi> a County every where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding with fertile Fields, ſat Paſtures, ſhady Groves, and pleaſant Rivolets; and the firſt Town here of any Remark, which preſented it ſelf to our View, was <hi>Ware,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ware.</note> which was built, ſay Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaries, by <hi>Edward</hi> the Senior, King of the Weſt-<hi>Saxons,</hi> about the year 914.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54306:35"/>
But the moſt remarkable thing in <hi>Ware</hi> is the New River, or Aquaeduct, convey'd above 20 Miles together in a continued Channel from this place to <hi>Iſlington,</hi> from whence the Water thereof is diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Pipes laid along in the Ground for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe into abundance of Streets, Lanes, Courts, and Alleys of the City and Suburbs of <hi>London</hi>; the happy Contrivance whereof all the Citizens have daily Experience, and ought to Immortalize the Name of their Inventor, Sir <hi>Hugh Middleton,</hi> who beſtow'd this moſt excellent Gift upon them, and conſummated this good Work ſo uſeful and beneficial to the City at his own proper Coſt and Charges.</p>
                  <p>We lay here one Night in the company of ſome Friends,<note place="margin">Pucke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge <hi>and</hi> Barkway.</note> who came along hither with us for their Diverſion; but the next Morning taking a ſolemn farewell of them, we ſet forward on our Journey, and paſſing thro' <hi>Puckeridge,</hi> and <hi>Barkway,</hi> Towns of good Hoſpitality and Entertainment for Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, we were quickly arriv'd within the Precincts of <hi>Cambridgeſhire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is an extream pleaſant open Country,<note place="margin">Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</note> and a place of ſuch Variety and Plenty, that fruitful <hi>Geres</hi> with a ſmiling Countenance, invites the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious Peaſant to behold with Joy the Fruits of his Labour, whilſt ſhe crowns his Induſtry with a plentiful Harveſt; and as if the Earth ſtrove not to be behind hand with him in conferring other Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes, ſhe in divers places makes ſome Annual Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of another Crop, by adorning the Fields with large Productions of Saffron, by which great Profits do continually ariſe: Beſides, here it is that the green Banks of murmuring Rivers, and ſunny Hills bedeck'd with diverſity of Plants and Simples, call forth the Students from their muſing Cells, and teach them Theory as well as Practice, by diving into their Natures, contemplating their Signatures, and conſidering their Qualities and various Effects. In a word, here is nothing

wanting for Profit or Delight; and though the Northern parts of the County towards the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> lying ſomewhat low, are moiſt and Fenny, yet that Defect is abundantly ſupply'd by the Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Cattle, Fiſh, and Fowl bred in thoſe Fenns, and which makes the Air more healthy, the gentle Gales which are frequently ſtirring, drive away all thick Miſts and Fogs which in ſome parts moſt annoy it; and by this means it is become a fit Seat for the Muſes to inhabit, and we have no reaſon to complain of the Soil, ſince our Wiſe Anceſtors thought it good and convenient to plant a Colony of Learned Men here, and place one of the Eyes of our Nation in this ſpot of Ground, the famous and moſt glorious Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> which we could not in Honour paſs by without a Viſit.</p>

                     <hi>Cambridge</hi> was formerly call'd by the <hi>Britains, Kaergrant,</hi> and <hi>Grantbridge,</hi> from a fair large Bridge made over the River <hi>Grant,</hi> which is now call'd <hi>Cam,</hi> from whence the Town it ſelf receives its Name: It is increaſed much by the Ruines of <hi>Grantcheſter,</hi> ſometimes a famous City ſituated a little above a Mile from this place, and the Caſtle that is beyond the River, the Ruines of which are ſtill to be ſeen, was built, as ancient Records te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, in the firſt year of <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror; and in the fifth year of <hi>William Rufus,</hi> in the year of our Lord, 1092, a Nobleman of the <hi>Norman</hi> Blood, nam'd <hi>Picot,</hi> a <hi>Vice-comes,</hi> or <hi>Sheriff,</hi> at the requeſt of <hi>Hugolin</hi> his Wife, founded a Church, and Dedicated it unto St. <hi>Giles</hi> near to this Caſtle, placing in it a Convent of ſix black Canons, which was twenty years after remov'd to <hi>Barnwell,</hi> a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage near a Mile diſtant from this place, by <hi>Pain Reverell,</hi> where he built a Priory to the Honour of St. <hi>Giles,</hi> and St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> and endow'd it with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues for the maintainance of thirty Canons of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Order: As Mr. <hi>Tanner</hi> informs us.</p>
                  <p>As to the Antiquity of the Univerſity of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> if any Credit may be given to King <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur's
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54306:36"/>

Dom.</hi> 624. makes mention of the Privileges granted to the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> by Pope <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> and takes notice of Doctors and Scholars Reſident there at that time, Why then as it is truly obſerv'd by our moſt Learned Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> in his Antiquities of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Churches: This is a ſufficient Proof to all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie on the Pope's Authority, that in the time of King <hi>Lucius,</hi> and <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> there might be a ſufficient number of Learned Men in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> to have inſtructed King <hi>Lucius</hi> in the Chriſtian Faith; and that it is not improbable that <hi>Eluanus</hi> and <hi>Medwinus</hi> might be of that number, eſpecially conſidering that <hi>Camboritum,</hi> or as many Copies have it, <hi>Camboricum,</hi> was a <hi>Roman</hi> Colony, and mention'd amongſt the beſt Copies among the 28 Cities of <hi>Britain,</hi> and that the <hi>Roman</hi> Colonies had their Schools of Learning, wherein the ſeveral Profeſſors of Arts and Sciences did inſtruct both the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Britiſh</hi> Youth. But what ever Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours the <hi>Romans</hi> were pleaſed to confer upon this place, 'tis certain, it met afterwards with very great Encouragement from divers other Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors; and by the Countenance of <hi>Segebert,</hi> King of the Eaſt-Angles, and other <hi>Saxon</hi> Princes, it held up its Head in a flouriſhing Condition, till about the year 1100, as the <hi>Saxon</hi> Chronicle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us. The cruel and mercileſs <hi>Danes</hi> laid all waſte before them, and <hi>Swene</hi> their King with Fire and Sword, burnt this place to the Ground, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what we read of the <hi>Roman</hi> Captain <hi>Sylla,</hi> who, though otherwiſe as furious as a Tyger, or a Lion; yet when he raged in <hi>Greece,</hi> ſpared the much celebrated <hi>Athens</hi> for <hi>Minerva</hi>'s ſake:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54306:37"/>
Yet, nevertheleſs, when theſe Storms were once blown over, in the time of the <hi>Normans</hi> Learning, began to peep out again, and ſeeing all was clear and quiet, ſprouted up a freſh, recruiting it ſelf by degrees, till at laſt, in progreſs of time, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to its Primitive State, and flouriſh'd more vigorouſly than ever it did before: For in the Reign of K. <hi>Henry</hi> I. for his Learning, ſirnam'd <hi>Beauclere,</hi> it began again to be new modell'd into an Univerſity; and hereupon Religious Houſes and Halls were immediately erected, and they have ever ſince been increaſing to the number of Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, namely, Twelve Magnificent Colleges, and four famous Halls, where the Buildings are ſo U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niform, the Chapels ſo Stately, the Privileges ſo Great, the Government ſo Regular, the Orders ſo Strict, the Ceremonies ſo Decorous, and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments ſo Honourable, that in all the <hi>European</hi> Countries, no, nor perhaps in all the Nations of the World can we find out one Univerſity, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that of <hi>Oxford,</hi> ſo richly endow'd, ſo famous and renown'd for its Structures, ſo admirable for its Diſcipline, and ſo courted and addreſs'd to for its moſt Polite Learning: So that when <hi>Eraſmus</hi> was pleaſed to give us a Strain of his Eloquence, in Decyphering both their Characters, he doth it but in ſuch a Style as is very ſuitable to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and the Elogy is no leſs than what they juſtly deſerve. I have before this, ſaith he, been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly well ſatisfy'd, and have exceedingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced, that <hi>England</hi> hath conſtantly been fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with Men, who have been as Eminent for their Parts, as Learning: But now I begin to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy her Felicity, (had he lived now in our days, he would ſtill have had greater reaſon for this Harangue) by reaſon that ſhe is now ſo enrich'd with all kind of Literature, that by taking the Commendation thereof from other Regions, ſhe doth marvellouſly obſcure and eclipſe their Glory, and yet this Commendation is not only due to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54306:37"/>
                     <hi>England</hi> at this preſent time, for it is well known for divers years paſt, to have flouriſh'd with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of deep and profound Learning: The Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities prove this to be true, which have for their Antiquity and Worthineſs contended with, and outſtripped the moſt ancient and celebrated Academies, that ever were planted in the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an World.</p>
                  <p>It might now be expected that I ſhould further exſpatiate into a more particular Deſcription of theſe Famous and Ample Colleges, and give an exact Portraiture of the large and ſpatious Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drangle of <hi>Trinity-College,</hi> ſo excellently contriv'd, and admirably ſurrounded with a curious Pile of Buildings, which was at firſt founded by King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII.: Of the noble Fabrick of St. <hi>John</hi>'s, founded by <hi>Margaret,</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Richmond</hi> and <hi>Darby,</hi> both which Colleges have of late years been ſo extreamly beautify'd and enlarg'd: Of <hi>Corpus-Chriſti,</hi> or <hi>Bennet-College,</hi> founded by <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> whoſe Library is ſo famous for its divers ancient Manuſcripts, as well as from the great Honour it daily receives from His Grace, the preſent Lord Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who was formerly a Learned Fellow, and ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues the greateſt Glory of it: Of that unimitable Piece of Architecture in <hi>King</hi>'s-<hi>College</hi> Chapel, founded by that Heroick Prince, King <hi>Henry</hi> VI. Of the Publick Schools of the Univerſity, which have been of ſo ancient a continuance, that there is no mention, when, or how they began: Of the Publick Library, which though it be not ſo ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and glorious as the <hi>Vatican,</hi> or <hi>Bodleian,</hi> yet it is ſo well ſtock'd with all kind of Divine and Humane Writers, that there is not ſufficient Room for all the Manuſcripts, and choice Books which are daily given to it, eſpecially if that Order be ſtrictly obſerv'd, of which I have been credibly inform'd, That a Copy of every Book which is printed in <hi>England,</hi> be by the Printer preſented to it.</p>

                     <hi>Chriſt's-College</hi> was firſt began by K. <hi>Henry</hi> VI. and after his Deceaſe, by the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Richmond</hi> and <hi>Darby,</hi> Daughter and Heir of <hi>John,</hi> Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> and Mother to King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. in the place where the College of God's Houſe had ſtood in the Preacher's Street (founded by Mr. <hi>Will.

After ſhe had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated this ſtately Fabrick, making it Quadran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and very Uniform; the next thing ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd was the planting in it a Colony of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Men, whom ſhe deſired ſhould be all devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Service of God, and Study of Divinity, and their number to be Twelve Fellows under the

Government of a Maſter. After this, for the better encouraging of Learning, and the enſtating of this her College in a flouriſhing Condition, ſhe gave ſeveral Scholarſhips for the maintenance of poor Students, the number of which to be about Sixty, as preparatives to the better Promotions that might attend their Induſtry: And that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Learning might be inſeparable Aſſociates ſhe built likewiſe a Chapel, in which all the Members ſhould meet twice a day, and join una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly in their Devotions, in which there is placed a tunable Organ, for the better promoting of fervent Piety. And becauſe Diſcipline is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in Bodies Spiritual as well as Civil, for thoſe whoſe Natures might be ſo baſe and diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous, as that Rewards could not move or incite them to Virtue, ſhe found out the more rough and harſh ways to enforce them, by inflicting ſuch Penalties, as the very Shame thereof might be Spurs and Goads to their future Reformation; Theſe were all comprized in a Book of Statutes, according to the Rule whereof all Perſons, here to be admitted Members, are ſworn to ſquare and regulate their Actions. After all things were ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in this admirable <hi>Decorum,</hi> this matchleſs Lady lived for ſome time in the Buildings her ſelf, which ſhe had deſigned for the uſe of the Maſter, and at her Hours of leiſure wrought ſuch curious Work in Hangings with her Needle, ſome of which are ſtill preſerved in the College to this day, that ſhe ſeems to have been equal to <hi>Minerva</hi> her ſelf, and to have monopoliz'd all Arts as well as Sciences in her Brains, making her Hands as well as Head to give Demonſtration of her admirable Perfections, King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, whether by hearing ſome ſuperſtitious Abuſes that were put upon the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, the Maſter and the Fellows having by ſome vain Perſons been called Chriſt and his Twelve Apoſtles, or whether rather being willing to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the good Example of this moſt vertuous Lady,

added another Fellowſhip, and ſo made the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to be Thirteen. And ſince that by the Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of divers other well-diſpoſed Benefactors, there have been ſeveral Donaries conferred upon it both in Exhibitions and Scholar-ſhip: In pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time the Houſe being repleniſhed with Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and ſo throng'd that the College not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing large enough to receive them all, they were forced to take up Lodgings in the Town. Upon this Conſideration to remove all ſuch Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, and preſerve it in a flouriſhing Condition, divers Perſons of Quality of the Black as well as Scarlet Robe, gave large Contributions for the enlarging of it; and by their Liberality there was ſome Years ago erected a new and far more noble Fabrick than the other, called the New-Building, four Stories high, built of Free-ſtone, and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with curious Embelliſhments in the Front, in the midſt whereof is a ſmall arch'd Cloyſter, and through that a Paſſage into the Orchard; in which are pleaſant Walks, ſhady Arbours, and ſecret Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes for the Fellows to retire to in Summer time: So ready and careful were our Noble Anceſtors to gratifie the Muſes in every reſpect, and to ſuffer them to lack nothing either for Improvement or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. And indeed it hath been the main care and aim of ſuch Perſons, who have been admitted Maſters or Fellows, by their great Improvements in all ſort of Learning, to anſwer thoſe ends and deſigns for which they were admitted. And, not to mention ſeveral Perſons deceaſed, who having received their firſt Rudiments here, became after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward great Luminaries in the Church, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns in the State: His Grace the preſent Arch-Biſhop of <hi>York</hi> is a ſufficient Teſtimony of this, whoſe great Learning and exemplary Piety add now at this time no leſs a Luſtre to the Church, than it doth likewiſe ſtill to this College, where he was formerly a moſt accompliſh'd Member. And as for the preſent Maſter, the Worthy Dr. <hi>Covil,</hi>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:54306:39"/>
my moſt Honoured Friend, whom all ingenious Travellers highly court, and all the Learned juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admire; with the reſt of the Reverend Fellows, who are now of that Society, there cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in any reſpect be greater Ornaments to a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, which ever hath had the Honour to enjoy ſuch worthy Perſons. For, not to look farther back than a very few Years ago, when this Itinerary was firſt drawn up, here was a Learned Knot of Profeſſors all concentred in this place, which was not then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable in any other College beſides; the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Dr. <hi>Cudworth,</hi> then Maſter, was publick Hebrew Profeſſor; the Reverend Dr. <hi>Widdrington,</hi> my Honoured Tutour, from being Publick Orator was made <hi>Margaret Profeſſor</hi>; Dr. <hi>Luke</hi> was Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick Profeſſor: To whom may be added the Learned Dr. <hi>Henry More,</hi> whom his Philoſophical Writings did ſufficiently render worthy of that Title. As for what concerns the particular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the College, we have annually two of the Fellows elected Deans of the Chapel, whoſe Office is to ſee that conſtant Attendance and good Orders be there obſerved, and due Penalties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon all who preſume to abſent themſelves from Divine Service; and likewiſe four Readers, one to read Hebrew, two to read Greek Lectures, and one to hear, moderate, and determine all Logical and Philoſphical Diſputations in Term-time: And for other Offices ſubſervient to theſe; there is a Manciple, Cook, Butler, Porter, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner, with other ſubordinate Servants for the uſe of the College.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have ſet down a Breviate of the Modes and Orders of this Houſe, from whence it will be eaſie and natural to gueſs at the Cuſtoms and Conſtitutions which are in uſe in all other Colleges, by this ſhort Epitome which hath been given here of this.</p>
                  <p>But before I take leave of this moſt flouriſhing College, I muſt not forget the Munificence of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54306:40"/>
ſome late great Benefactors, who by their generous Liberality to it have erected to themſelves a more laſting and durable Monument than the Pyramids of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or the Coloſs at <hi>Rhodes</hi>; The one was the Right Reverend and Learned Dr. <hi>Ward,</hi> the late Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who hath founded here four new Scholarſhips of Ten Pounds a piece <hi>per Annum</hi>; The other Noble Benefactors were the Honourable Sir <hi>John Finch,</hi> Brother to the Earl of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> ſometime Ambaſſador in <hi>Turkey</hi>; and Sir <hi>Thomas Bayns,</hi> a Phyſician, his Companion and Fellow-Traveller, ſometime here a Student, who at their Death added to the College two more conſiderable Fellowſhips and Scholarſhips, for the due encouragement of Learning, and lie interred in the Chapel, as a ſignal Teſtimony of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſoluble Love and Affection they had always even to the very laſt, for this Learned Society.</p>
                  <p>As far the Town of <hi>Cambridge</hi> it ſelf, it is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by a Mayor, who at the entrance into his Office takes a ſolemn Oath before the Vice-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor to obſerve and conſerve the Privileges, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and Cuſtoms of the Univerſity; and as the Aſſizes for the County are for the moſt part kept here, ſo 'tis obſervable that one High Sheriff ſerves for both the Counties of <hi>Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> which borders upon it. The chief Market every Saturday ſupplies it well with Corn, and plenty of other Proviſion: But nothing is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable nor advantageous to it, than the great Fair annually kept within a Mile of it in <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> called by the name of <hi>Sturbridge</hi> Fair;<note place="margin">Stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge-Fair.</note> from whence it received its denomination is uncertain, but this is moſt certain, that of all Fairs or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Marts in <hi>England</hi> 'tis ſuppoſed the largeſt, and beſt ſtored with all kind of Wares and Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, which the <hi>Londoners</hi> take ſpecial care to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port hither. When you are within the Limits, you would rather be ready to imagine your ſelf in ſome great Town, by the variety of Shops and

multiplicity of Booths, than in a wide open Field. Now thoſe Booths are always built for the time in which it laſts, which is about a Fortnight: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are you preſented with Booths only upon the Land, but with Booths upon the Water too, there being particular contrivances in their Boats upon the River, which runs hard by this place, for Rooms and ſecret Retirements, all covered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove for the conveniency of Strangers which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort thither; and indeed here is always a great concourſe of People from all parts of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Not far from this place appears aloft a certain ridge of Hills called <hi>Hog-magog-Hills,</hi>

                  <p>Having paid our Devoirs, and taken a review of that which affords ſo great Variety, we at laſt took our farewell, and bidding it adieu we betook our ſelves into its Neighbouring County of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingdon</hi>;<note place="margin">Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donſhire.</note> 'tis a fruitful Country both for Corn and Graſs; towards the Eaſt it is wateriſh and fenny, and hath formerly been well beſet with Woods. In the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second it had a large Foreſt, which he deſtroyed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting it to other uſes: 'Tis watered by the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Rivers <hi>Avon</hi> and <hi>Ouſe,</hi> which render it very fertile.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Village we arrived at in this County was <hi>Fenny-Stanton,</hi> but found nothing obſervable till we came to <hi>Godmancheſter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Godman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter.</note> a great Country Town, and of as great a Name for Tillage, ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in an open Ground, of a light Mould, and bending for the Sun. Here have been obſerved more ſtout and luſty Husbandmen, and more Ploughs agoing, than in any Town beſides in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for they make their boaſt, that they have in former times receiv'd the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> as they paſſed it their Progreſs this way, with Nineſcore
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54306:41"/>
Ploughs, brought forth in a ruſtical kind of Pomp for a gallant Show. Soon after King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt came into <hi>England,</hi> the Bayliffs of this Town preſented him with Seventy Teem of Horſes all traced to fair new Ploughs, of which when His Majeſty demanded the reaſon, he was anſwered, That it was their ancient Cuſtom, whenſoever any King of <hi>England</hi> paſſed through their Town ſo to preſent him; beſides they added, That they held their Lands by that Tenure, being the King's Tenants. His Majeſty took it well, and bad them make good uſe of their Ploughs, being glad he was Landlord of ſo many good Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in one Town.</p>
                  <p>Antiquaries do affirm it to have been formerly a flouriſhing City, and not only the old <hi>Roman</hi> Coins, which have been digged up here, do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt its Antiquity, but its ancient denomination too: It was formerly called <hi>Duroliponte,</hi> corruptly for <hi>Duroſiponte,</hi> which in the Britiſh Language ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a Bridge over the River <hi>Ouſe</hi>; but this Name being antiquated in the <hi>Saxons</hi> time, it began to be called <hi>Gormonceſter</hi> by <hi>Gormon</hi> the <hi>Dane,</hi> for King <hi>Alfred</hi> having conquer'd the <hi>Danes,</hi> who had made an Invaſion into theſe Parts, reduced them at laſt to theſe Conditions, either forthwith to give him Pledges that they would immediately depart this Land, or elſe that they would embrace the Chriſtian Religion, which latter Propoſal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made choice of, <hi>Guthrus</hi> or <hi>Gormundus</hi> the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> King with Thirty more of his Nobility was Baptiz'd into the Chriſtian Faith, and their Prince adopted by <hi>Alfred</hi> for his Son, who changing his Name to <hi>Athelſtan</hi> appointed him his Station here, and committed the Provinces of the <hi>Eaſt-Angles</hi> and <hi>Northumbers</hi> to his peculiar Charge: And if it be likewiſe allowed that one <hi>Machutus</hi> was here Biſhop, when it was called <hi>Gumica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum, hou! quantum mutatur!</hi> 'Tis certainly now reduced to a poor and deſpicable Condition, to

                     <hi>Huntingdon</hi> is about a Mile diſtant from this place, and is the chief Town of the County, ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate upon the River <hi>Ouſe,</hi> over which ſtands a Bridge made of Stone, which gives entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; the Houſes are fair, and the Streets large; 'tis adorn'd with Four Churches, and had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Benedictine Nunnery dedicated to St. <hi>James,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Notitia Monaſtica,</hi> and a Priory of Black Canons founded about the Year 1140, to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of St. <hi>Mary,</hi> by <hi>Euſtace de Luvetot</hi>; ſome of the Ruins whereof are ſtill to be ſeen. Near the River, upon a high Hill, ſtands the remains of a Caſtle, which was built about the Year of Chriſt 917, by <hi>Edward</hi> the Senior: Afterwards <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> waging War againſt King <hi>Stephen,</hi> upon the account of <hi>Mawd</hi> the Empreſs, who was his Neice, this was ſurrendred upon ſome certain Conditions to the <hi>Scots</hi> King, who did exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beautifie and ſtrengthen it, by making ſtrong Rampires and Fortifications about it, but <hi>Henry</hi> the Second finding it in proceſs of time a Cage on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Rebels and Ringleaders of Sedition, at laſt quite demoliſhed it; and from the top of this Hill is a very pleaſant Proſpect for the ſpace of ſome Miles. The Town, which is ſuppoſed to have been the Daughter of <hi>Godmancheſter,</hi> is governed by a Mayor and Aldermen, and the Aſſizes are held here twice a Year for the Shire, and wants no kind of Proviſion to entertain Travellers, who much reſort hither out of the Northern Parts, the great Road to the City of <hi>London</hi> lying through it.</p>
                  <p>In this Town in the Year 1599 was that Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Religious Cheat <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> born and educated, whom tho' we have ſome juſt Reaſons to curſe in his very Name, and deteſt his Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as odious and execrable, yet ſince proſperous Succeſſes of the moſt cruel Tyrants makes others

                  <p>From hence we paſſed directly into the pleaſant County of <hi>Northampton,</hi>

Sacr Pars pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, <hi>p.</hi> 423.</note> That in the year 716, <hi>Ceolred</hi> King of the <hi>Mercians</hi> died, and was buried in this place. King <hi>Oſſa,</hi> about A. D. 786, made it an Archbiſhops See, which Honour it injoyed for ten years, and then was again ſubjected to <hi>Canterbury.</hi> It was Tranſlated, A. D. 1075. to <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Coventry,</hi> A. D. 1102. but the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops not long after being ſetled here again, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Clinton</hi> built a new Cathedral Church, Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating it to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and St. <hi>Chadd,</hi> and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54306:44"/>
reſtored and augmented the Chapter; and now this City, and <hi>Coventry</hi> with it, make up but one Dioceſs under a double Name, which came to paſs after the ſame manner, and much about the ſame time as <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells</hi> were joyn'd together into one Biſhoprick. When this Town in the late un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy <hi>Civil Wars</hi> fell into a ſtate of Suffering, the Cathedral at that time was a Fellow-ſharer with it, and through the inſatiable Malice of ſome ill Wiſhers to it, it became a Sacrifice to their merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Fury; but ſince the happy Reſtauration, through the indefatigable Zeal, and boundleſs Charity of Biſhop <hi>Hacket,</hi> and other noble and generous Benefactors, it has began again to revive out of its own Aſhes, and to retrieve its Primitive Splendour and Beauty, mounting up aloft with three Pyramids of Stone, which make a lovely ſhew; and for elegant and proportionable Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, will in due time, it is to be hoped, equal ſome other Cathedrals.</p>
                  <p>The next County we viſited, was <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Leiceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</note> which, though in very many parts is deep and Miry, yet the richneſs of the Soil doth ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compenſate for the unpleaſantneſs of the Roads, which is generally fruitful with all ſorts of Grain, eſpecially Peaſe and Beans, of which there are ſo great Stacks, that they cover the Fields with their infinite Numbers, and what is wanting in Wood, is ſupply'd by their Coal-Mines, which they have in great abundance.</p>
                  <p>When we had paſſed through <hi>Boſworth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Boſworth <hi>and</hi> Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</note> a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket Town, famous for the Battle fought upon <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> near it, betwixt <hi>Richard</hi> III. and <hi>Henry</hi> VII. by the Iſſue whereof, the Crown return'd from the Houſe of <hi>York,</hi> to the Houſe of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi>

                     </note> and ſo an end was put to the bloody Wars, that had ſo long continued between thoſe two Houſes. We came to <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> the Metropolis of the County, which is more venerable for its Antiquity than its preſent Comelineſs, or Beauty: I find this to have
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54306:45"/>
been a Biſhop See, about the year 680, and that <hi>Sexwulphus</hi> was firſt inſtalled in the Epiſcopal Chair, at the Command of <hi>Ethelred,</hi> King of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> which continued not long; in 914. <hi>Ethelfleda,</hi> a noble and diſcreet Lady, Rebuilt it, and ſurrounded it with Walls; after which, in the time of the <hi>Normans,</hi> it flouriſhed exceedingly, and Temp. <hi>Henry</hi> I. <hi>Robert,</hi> Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a College of a Dean, and Twelve Prebenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the Church of St. <hi>Marys the leſs,</hi> in the Caſtle. But Crouch-back <hi>Robert,</hi> Earl hereof, having raiſed a Rebellion againſt King <hi>Henry</hi> II. the Town was Beſieged, and taken, and the Caſtle quite diſmant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; hard by which there is a fair, though anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Hoſpital, in the Chapel whereof, <hi>Henry,</hi> Earl of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> his Son, the firſt Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> lie Interr'd, which Duke being very A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and willing to give ſome viſible Teſtimony of his Charity, built this Hoſpital for the uſe and Maintainance of divers poor, aged decrepit Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of both Sexes; and on the other ſide amongſt thoſe flowry Meadows, which the River <hi>Soar</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richeth with its bubling Streams, <hi>Robert Boſſu,</hi> Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> built an Abby of Canons Regular of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Order to the Honour of the Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bleſſed Virgin, of which Order, by the conſent of his Wife <hi>Amicia,</hi> he became him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the chief Canon, and lived in this place Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years a Monk, as hoping to atone for ſome of his former Crimes, by taking upon him this Religious Habit.

In the late unhappy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions this Town had its ſhare of Misfortunes and Calamities, though it hath very well ſince reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd its old Strength and Spirits; being govern'd by a Mayor, Recorder, Twelve Aldermen, and Two Chamberlains, is furniſhed with all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Proviſions on their Market Days, the chief of

which is <hi>Saturday,</hi> ſtrengthned with ſeveral Gates, in one of which is kept their Magazine, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd with divers Fabricks both Sacred and Civil; the Croſs in the High ſtreet is an exquiſite piece of Workmanſhip, and beſides five other Churches, near that which is Dedicated to St. <hi>Martyn,</hi> ſtands a ſtately Edifice, call'd, the <hi>New Hoſpital,</hi> built and endowed by ſeveral Pious Benefactours, for the Uſe of poor impotent Lazars, with a Chapel and Chaplain to read Divine Service, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to theſe helpleſs and indigent Creatures; and to this joyns a ſmall, but compleat Library, which was appointed for the uſe of the Miniſters, and Scholars, which belong to this Town: Hard by St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s Church ſtands the Caſtle, in which the Aſſizes are held for the County; and by St. <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> there is a Wall, which, by the Ruines of it, ſeems to be of great Antiquity, having ſeveral hollow places in it of an Oval form, of which the Inhabitants have odd and ſtrange Conjectures, as if here the Pagans were uſed to offer up their Children to their Blood-thirſty Idols, or that here they made them paſs through the Fire, as the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> did theirs to <hi>Moloch</hi>; but there being little probability of this, I am rather inclined to believe, that they might poſſibly have been ſome Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles for <hi>Roman</hi> Urns, which might have been pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced here, as have been found in divers other parts of the Nation.</p>
                  <p>Not far from hence is <hi>Carleton,</hi>

                  <p>Having reſted at <hi>Leiceſter</hi> one Night, and made
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54306:46"/>
a viſit to ſome Friends and Relations, who were ſeated in this place, the next day we took our leaves both of them and that place, and began a further Progreſs into the County, and having rode four or five Miles further, we came to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Market-Town, call'd <hi>Mount-Sorrel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mount-Sorrel.</note> ſo called from a high Mount ſituated in the middle of the Town. This place hath ſuffered much by diſmal, and raging Fires, and I find in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles, that it was fortified with a Caſtle, in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> III. for the Officers and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that were here in Garriſon, made an incurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into the adjacent Country, to pillage and pick up what Booty they could, which the Caſtle of <hi>Nottingham</hi> having due notice of, reſolved to ſet upon them, and if poſſible, to put a period to ſuch grievous Calamities the poor Neighbouring Peaſants at that time groaned under, whereupon they met, and fought them, took ſome of the chief Ringleaders, diſperſed the reſt, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back Victorious to their own Caſtle, of which brave Exploit, when News was once brought to King <hi>Henry,</hi> he commanded the High Sheriff, for the County of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> to demoliſh the Caſtle of <hi>Mount-Sorrel,</hi> which was never ſince Re-edified to this day.</p>
                  <p>Four Miles further, is another Market-Town, call'd <hi>Loughborough,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Loughbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough.</note> ſome will have this to be the Village that <hi>Cuthwulphus</hi> took from the <hi>Britains,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the year 571, for the <hi>Saxon</hi> Name <hi>Lygean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burh</hi> is of very near Affinity to it; but the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my Learned Friend, Mr. <hi>Gibſon,</hi> ſeems much more probable, who, in his Explication of this place, at the end of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Chronicle, tells us, that it rather ſeems to point at <hi>Leighton,</hi> in <hi>Bedfordſhire,</hi> for after <hi>Cuthwulphus</hi> had taken <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geanburh,</hi> he is reported likewiſe to have taken <hi>Egelesburgh,</hi> i. e. <hi>Alisbury,</hi> in <hi>Buckinghamſhire,</hi> and <hi>Bennington,</hi> now <hi>Benſington,</hi> in <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> and that the Road leads directly from <hi>Leighton</hi> to <hi>Alis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:54306:46"/>
and ſo to <hi>Benſington</hi>; but 'tis very improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that <hi>Cuthwulphus</hi> ſhould ſo order his Marches to paſs from <hi>Loughborough</hi> to <hi>Alisbury,</hi> and yet take no other place in all that long March of his betwixt thoſe two places, which are ſo far diſtant from one another: This hath been formerly reputed the ſecond Town in this County, both for its fair Buildings, and the pleaſantneſs of its Situation, being near unto the Foreſt of <hi>Charnwood,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſhady Woods, and delightful Groves that lie about it, but of late Years this hath likewiſe undergone great Calamities from the ſudden irrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Fire, and hath been almoſt quite deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this mercileſs Element.</p>
                  <p>And here again having been generouſly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by ſome particular Friends in theſe Parts, after ſome returns of Thanks for their great civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and kindneſs, we quickly arrived within the County of <hi>Nottingham.</hi>

If we will take the pains to courſe over the Valleys, we ſhall find the Earth groaning under the heavy burdens of bountiful <hi>Ceres,</hi> and the Fields and Meadows in a careful conteſt which ſhould appear moſt trim and glorious. If we will range the Woods and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, we ſhall hear ſuch Melodies by the mutual reciprocation of Birds and Trees, that one would
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54306:47"/>
think they had got the knack of ſpeaking, and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dona</hi>'s pratling Groves were become viſible to us: If we be ſo curious to dig into the Entrails of the Earth, and take a view of her hidden Treaſures, we ſhall find ſeveral Minerals to gratifie our Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, ſeveral great Quarries of Stone, divers Mines of Coal to provide us with Fuel againſt the bluſtring Storms of Winter. If we be taken with the gentle Streams of Brooks and Rivers, <hi>Trent</hi> will not be wanting to ſatisfie our Deſires, and will afford us, as is reported, thirty kinds of Fiſh to pleaſe our Palates. As for the Towns and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages they are well inhabited with induſtrious Tradeſmen and laborious Peaſants, and ſo 'tis po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous, the Edifices of Nobles and Gentlemen are thick and ſpacious, and ſo 'tis Honourable; the Churches fair and Uniform, and ſo 'tis glorious; and in fine, the Air clear and ſerene, and ſo 'tis ſalubrious. And to begin with that Town, which being the principal of all, gives a Denomination to the whole County, even that alone will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſet forth, and demonſtrate the great Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre and Symmetry of all the other Parts.</p>

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:54306:47"/>
for ſtrength, proſpect and ſtatelineſs, challenge the precedency of moſt Caſtles in the Kingdom. And here the <hi>Danes</hi> held out a very long Siege againſt three Kings united againſt them. For in the Year 868, <hi>Buthred</hi> King of the <hi>Mercians</hi> ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Aethelred</hi> King of the <hi>Weſt-Saxons,</hi> and <hi>Alfred</hi> his Brother to crave their Aid and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance againſt the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Army, which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly obtained, for the two Brothers muſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up a conſiderable Army arrived in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Mercia,</hi> and made no ſtop till they came to <hi>Snotenghaham,</hi> now <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and when the Pagans confiding in their Fortreſs refuſed to give Battel, and the Chriſtians had then no Engines to batter or raſe the Walls, the <hi>Mercians</hi> were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to conclude a Peace with the Pagans, and the two Brothers to return home ingloriouſly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing any feats. After this, ſaith the <hi>Saxon</hi> Chronicle, in the Year 942, the moſt Valiant and Puiſſant King <hi>Edmund</hi> not only reſcued this place out of its <hi>Daniſh</hi> Bondage, but four other Cities, <hi>Lincoln</hi> and <hi>Leiceſter, Stamford</hi> and <hi>Darby,</hi> were by the ſame victorious Hand delivered from the Shackles and Oppreſſions of thoſe moſt bloody Infidels. In proceſs of time King <hi>Edward</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior ſtrengthened it with Walls; and a new Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle was built by <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror. <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth enlarged it with various dwelling Houſes for Commanders and Soldiers, and in the Rock upon which the Caſtle ſtands are ſeveral ſmall Cottages hewn out of it, in which at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent dwell divers poor People: And it is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it was never taken until by a ſubtil Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem it was ſurprized by <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Darby</hi> in the Barons Wars, who having once got this ſoon entred the Town, and then uſed the Townſmen according to his pleaſure. Though I find too in the Life of King <hi>Stephen,</hi> that <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi> invaded this Town with a great Power, and when moſt of the Townſmen were ſlain or burnt
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:54306:48"/>
in the Churches, whither they fled for Refuge. There is a Story of one of them, which was richer than the reſt, that being forced to return to his own Houſe by the Soldiers that had taken him, to ſhew them where his Treaſure lay, he bringing them into a Cellar, whilſt they were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in breaking open Locks and Coffers, convey'd himſelf away, and ſhutting the Doors after him ſet fire on the Houſe, and ſo the Soldiers, being 30 in number, periſhed in the Flames, which catching hold of other Buildings joining to it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt burnt up the whole Town. But that which makes this Caſtle moſt ſignally remarkable, was the diſcovery of the ſecret Amours of <hi>Roger Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer</hi> Earl of <hi>March,</hi> and the Impriſonment of <hi>David Bruce</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> the Relation of which I ſhall ſet down as briefly as I can.</p>
                  <p>After King <hi>Edward</hi> the Second had been Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and Murthered by the Contrivances and Plots of his own Wife Queen <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and King <hi>Edward</hi> her Son had Reigned about Four Years, a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was called at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> where this <hi>Roger Mortimer,</hi> who was the Queen's moſt eſpecial Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, was in ſuch Glory and Renown, that it was beyond all Compariſon; none ſo much Lord Paramount as the Earl of <hi>March,</hi> none appears in ſo great an Equipage, and attended with ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable a Retinue as the Earl of <hi>March,</hi> ſo that the King's Train was inferiour to his, and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Glory eclipſed by the Pomp and Grandeur of one of his Nobles; for he very often would preſume to go foremoſt with his own Officers, and was ſo exceeding proud and haughty, as to make all Perſons cringe and do as great Homage to him as to Majeſty it ſelf: Nay he undertook to order and diſpoſe of all Perſons and Affairs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own Will and Pleaſure; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he one day rebuked the Earl of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> the King's Couſin, for preſuming to appoint Lodgings for certain Noblemen near the Court
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54306:48"/>
without his particular Licenſe and Aſſignation, and having diſlodged the Earl with ſome other Perſons of very great Quality, and removed them a Mile out of Town: He did by this means ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe the Nobility againſt him, that they began to pry more narrowly into his Actions, and being enraged to ſee his Pride and his Uſurpation of ſuch great Prerogatives, they unanimouſly Libelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and gave it out amongſt the People; that this <hi>Mortimer</hi> was the Queen's Gallant, and the King's Maſter, and ſought by all means he poſſibly could to deſtroy the Royal Blood, and Uſurp the Crown, which report did ſo work upon ſome of the King's moſt truſty Friends, that they got <hi>Robert Holland,</hi> who had a long time been Governour of the Caſtle, and knew well all the ſecret Corners therein, to ſwear Secrecy to them, and Fidelity to the King, and accordingly to aſſiſt them in thoſe Deſigns they had in hand: Whereupon one Night King <hi>Edward</hi> lying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Caſtle, both he and his Friends were brought by Torch-light through a ſecret Place under the ground, beginning afar off from the ſaid Caſtle ('tis the Vault which is ſtill call'd <hi>Mortimer</hi>'s Hole) till they came even to the Queen's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which by chance they found open, being Arm'd with naked Swords in they ruſh'd, leaving the King in the ſame poſture at the Door; when they had entred into the Privy-Chamber, they found the Earl of <hi>March</hi> undreſſed, ready to go to Bed to the Queen; but they croſſed his Deſign, and cooled his Courage, halling him away im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by force, upon which the Queen cried out in French, <hi>Good Son, take Pity of Gentle</hi> Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer, ſuſpecting her Son to have been in the Company: The Keys of the Caſtle were preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called for, and every Place with all the Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture committed into the King's Hands, and <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer</hi> was forthwith ſent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> who being Tryed by his Peers, Arraign'd and found Guilty,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:54306:49"/>
was hang'd upon the common Gallows two Days and two Nights.</p>
                  <p>The Articles that were brought againſt him were divers, though his too great Familiarity with the Queen, his unpardonable Treachery to the King, and his ſecret Services to <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> were the chief, having burnt the very Charters by which the <hi>Scotch</hi> King ſtood obliged to do Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the King of <hi>England,</hi> and thereupon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued a great War betwixt them; for King <hi>David</hi> being ſpurred on by the <hi>French</hi> King invaded <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and having made a great Inroad into the Northern Counties, ſpoiling and burning all Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as he came along; at length at <hi>Durham</hi> his Army was routed, and himſelf taken Priſoner; being firſt ſent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> afterwards committed to this Caſtle, where during his Confinement he engraved upon the Walls of his Apartment the Hiſtory of our Bleſſed Saviour's Death and Paſſion, ſome of the Relicts of which are ſtill there to be ſeen. After Eleven Years Impriſonment he was reſtored again to his Kingdom, by paying a good Ranſom for his Liberty; but before he returned, he was one of the Four Kings that was nobly treated by <hi>Henry Picard,</hi> a Vintner, then Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and the King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> together with <hi>Edward</hi> the Black Prince, all bearing him Company at the ſame Table. This was about the Year 1358.</p>
                  <p>But before I leave this Town, I cannot but take notice of one thing more memorable in our Age, this being the firſt place where King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt ſet up his Royal Standard againſt the Rebels in the late unhappy Wars; and when the King's Forces were forced to leave it, the Caſtle was then quite demoliſhed, but of late it hath been curiouſly rebuilt, beautified and furniſhed by his Grace the Duke of <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi>

                  <p>After a little pauſe we rode on two or three Miles further,<note place="margin">Darby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</note> till we came into the edge of thoſe wide and dangerous Moors, which extend many Miles both in length and breadth throughout this County, where being ſeveral Bogs and dangerous Rocks, which do much annoy the Roads that lie through them, and the Roads themſelves very croſs and irkſom to Strangers, we reſolved to take a Guide to conduct us ſafe over them; and the Guide we happened to make choice of was a plain but ſenſible Peaſant, going homeward with his Cart loaded with Stones; the poor Man rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily complied with our Propoſals, whereupon taking a Horſe out of his own Team, and leaving the reſt to graze thereabouts till his return, our Pilot began to ſteer forward: As we rode along we became very inquiſitive after the nature of the Soil, and the modes of the Country, of which our Guide gave us the beſt account which he could. The Country, ſaith he, Eaſtward is fruitful and pleaſant, abounding with all ſorts of Grain, but more particularly with Barley, which makes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Inhabitants conſiderable Maltſters; but the Weſtern, into which we are now entring, and is commonly called the <hi>Peak,</hi> is Mountainous, as you ſee, and Rocky, though Nature makes a ſufficient amends for the Barrenneſs of the Soil by her hidden Treaſures, which are here frequently diſcovered. Its length from North to South is about 30 Miles, and its breadth about 20, and the Moors, upon which we now are, are of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Longitude running along, they ſay, to the very Borders of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and having divers Names
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54306:51"/>
anſwerable to the places through which they are extended, out of which divers Rivolets have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe their Source and Original, who pay all their little Tributes to the more noble River of <hi>Trent,</hi> which receiving all their petty Homages, makes at laſt an acknowledgment of its Royalty to the Ocean. The River <hi>Derwent</hi> divides the County into two Portions, and in that part, which you are now going to view, you will meet with very ſtrange and wonderful Curioſities.</p>
                  <p>As for we poor Folk that live here about theſe <hi>Moors,</hi> and in theſe parts, we make a ſhift to live, but it is hardly, and if any eat their Bread in the ſweat of their Brows it is we; and we ſeem to be in a continual quarrel with the Earth, that firſt gave us a Being, for we are continually opening her Veins, and for Anger, eating even into her very Bowels; ſome of us are employed in the Quarrys for Mill, and Whet-ſtones, and in ſome places to dig Marble and Alabaſter out of the Earth: Others are ſet to look for Antimony, or to dig for Leaden Oar, and after with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, ſometimes, with the loſs of their Limbs, they have got it up from the Mines, they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to hazard the reſt by their indefatigable La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, before they can melt, and ſhape it into Pigs and Sows. Others you will meet with, who by the blackneſs and grimneſs of their Viſage, you would imagine to have come out lately from ſome of the Infernal Regions, theſe are they who work in the Coal-Mines, who, indeed, one would think, by reaſon of the darkneſs and diſmalneſs of the Abyſs in which they work, ſhould thereby be frequently put in mind of the more dreadful Abyſs, even of Hell it ſelf; but they, as well as moſt other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as they are excluded often from the leaſt Glimmerings of Lights ſo they are not terrified with any approaching Shades of Darkneſs, which makes them generally ſuch inſenſate Wretches as they are.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:54306:51"/>The Character this Man gave us of theſe Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, was as ſtrange and uncommon, and he had juſt ended his Diſcourſe, when we Rode by a piece of Ground, which was all incloſed with Stone: We asked him the meaning of it, ſtanding ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone without any other Incloſures near it, who replied, that it was cuſtomary to incloſe ſome of their Grounds after this manner, Wood and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes here to make Hedges with, being a very ſcarce Commodity, and yet that all Hunters who there purſued their Game never baulked them in the leaſt, but made their way over them with great facility, which the next day we found true, for meeting ſome Gentlemen in a warm Chaſe after a Hare, we obſerv'd them to Courſe nimbly with their light Gennets in thoſe places, where we durſt ſcarce Trot, and at laſt poor Puſs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Prey of the unwearied Purſuers. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving paſs'd this Incloſure, we came to the top of a high Hill, where lighting, and walking down by reaſon of the ſteepneſs of the Deſcent, at the bottom we found a little Village; and being thus ſafely got off from the Moors, we took leave of our Guide, and riding two Miles further, we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at laſt at our deſigned Stage.</p>
                  <p>And took up our Inn at <hi>Bakewell,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bakewell.</note> which was made a Borough by <hi>Edward</hi> the Senior; it was called by the <hi>Saxons, Badecanwylla,</hi> in whoſe Neighbourhood, ſaith the <hi>Saxon</hi> Chronicle, in the year 924, King <hi>Edward</hi> Commanded a City to be built, and a Cittadel for the Defence of it 'Tis a Market-Town much reſorted to by the Inhabitants of the <hi>Peak,</hi> (which by the <hi>Saxons</hi> was formerly called <hi>Peaclond</hi>) and found it a place,<note place="margin">Seven Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the <hi>Peak.</hi>
                     </note> from whence we might very appoſitely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh thoſe deſigns we had propoſed to our ſelves, of viewing the ſeven Wonders, which are here ſo famous, whereupon fitting our ſelves again with a Guide, we ſet out for the proſpect of ſuch celebrated Varieties.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:54306:52"/>When we were got about two Miles from that Town, we obſerved upon the top of a Hill, a particular piece of Ground, which was of a ſtrange Nature, as our Guide inform'd us. It was a Field, on which, for the moſt part, there was very good Graſs, which, within the ſpace of a Month, would either Fat, or kill any Horſe that was put into it. As we Rode on, we found our firſt Pilot's Deſcription in moſt points truly verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for we met divers Horſes loaden with Lead and Coals, and were frequently ſurrounded as well with plenty of Leaden Mines, as Quarrys of Stone, and Coals, till at laſt we arrived at the Caſtle in the <hi>Peak,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Caſtle in the <hi>Peak.</hi>
                     </note> which is eight or nine Miles from <hi>Bakewell</hi>; 'tis of great Antiquity by its Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines, and ſeems to have been impregnable by its Situation upon a high and dangerous Rock, which is ſo ſteep, and craggy, that there appears but one way, by which there is any acceſs to it.</p>
                  <p>At the bottom of the Hill, which is near two Miles in the Deſcent, by reaſon of its ſteepneſs and frequent windings, ſtands a Village, call'd <hi>Caſtleton,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Caſtleton.</note> ſufficiently noted for that wide ſubterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Cavern, known commonly by the Name of the <hi>Devil's Arſe</hi>;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The</hi> Devils Arſe.</note> it runs under this Hill upon which the Caſtle ſtands, and at its Entrance is large and capacious, though the further you go in, the more narrow it is, and contracted: Within the Mouth of it are ſeveral ſmall Cottagers, who dwell in little clay Tenements erected therein; the top whereof is of a very great height, and appears to the Eye, as if it was Arched above, and Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd with diverſity of coloured Stones: At our Entrance, the poor People were ready to attend us with Candles and Lanthorns, and by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct we ventured in, though it belonged to <hi>Satan</hi>'s Territories. After we were got a little way with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it, we found it very dark and ſlippery, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a great Current of Water, which runs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Cave, and were often forced to ſtoop, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:54306:52"/>
the further we proceeded, the Rock hung down more low and ſloping; We paſſed ſtill on, till at length we were ſtop'd by the Water, which at that time being deeper than ordinary, and bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up apace in the Cave, cry'd, a <hi>Ne <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltra</hi> to us, though, as they ſay, 'tis uſual, not only to wade over this with great facility, but another Current likewiſe, which runs along the Cave ſome ten or twelve yards diſtant from this to a third, which is impaſſible. The Story of the Shepherd, which paſs'd over all, and at laſt came out into a fair delightful Field, ſavours too much of a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, to be credited; however, 'tis ſuppoſed, could all theſe Waters be once paſs'd over, there might be made ſome new Diſcoveries, though I confeſs I ſhould be extream loath, were it to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe the Fame of a <hi>Drake,</hi> or a <hi>Frobiſher,</hi> to ſeek out a New found Land in ſo diſmal a place, which both by its Name and Nature, hath ſo near a Relation to the Diabolical Regions.</p>
                  <p>Having made our Retreat from this <hi>Stygian</hi> Lake,<note place="margin">Mam-Tor.</note> and being ſafely return'd through the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Poſteriors, our <hi>Exit</hi> was as welcome as our Viſit irkſome, and we proceeded to take a view of the ſecond thing, which deſervedly merits the Name of Wonderful. 'Tis a high and ſteep Cliff, call'd <hi>Mam-Tor,</hi> from the top whereof, the Sand, though the Air be never ſo calm and ſerene, doth continually tricle down Night and Day: The Sight of which put us in mind of that Hill, where poor <hi>Siſyphus</hi> was allotted to Puniſhment, of row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up a Stone which immediately tumbled down again, and ſo wearied the Wretch out in an endleſs Labour; and this bearing ſome little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to that, by the frequent rumbling down of the Stones from above, which falling down from the Precipice with a very great Noiſe, do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten aſtoniſh and afright the poor Neighbouring In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, made us a little ſtand off at a diſtance, believing our Curioſity would not countervail
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54306:53"/>
the Hazards we might run, or the Damage we might receive by our too near Approaches: On the Top hereof ariſeth a Spring, which in ſome places ſtreams along the Cliff, but affords nothing of Variety, ſave that it hath its ſource about that high Mountain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Spring that Ebbs and Flows. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Stones.</note>The third Wonder we found as ſtrange, which was the Spring that Ebbs and Flows like the Sea; and the fourth, which is called the Marble Stones, by their orderly diſpoſition into ſeveral Rows, ſeem rather to have been the contrivance of Art, than of Nature, but that we ought not to derogate in any wiſe from that unimitable Parent, whoſe Productions are for the moſt part ſo rare and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable.</p>
                  <p>Not far diſtant from theſe, the fifth Wonder preſented it ſelf to us, known by the Name of <hi>Elden-Hole,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Elden-Hole.</note> 'tis reputed a bottomleſs Abyſs, and could never yet be fathomed by any Art of Man; the Mouth of it is very wide and craggy, but the inward Receſſes contracted and intricate. The Story of the Ruſtick that was let down with Ropes and Candles, to give an account of this Avernal Pit, and by his diving too far into the Bowels of the Earth, was drawn up Senſeleſs, did too truly verifie that Poetick Aphoriſm, <hi>Coelum &amp; Tartarum ipſum petimus ſtultitiâ,</hi> and paid dear, by the loſs of his Life, for his boldneſs and preſumption, and we are as much in the Dark, concerning its Nature, as we were before: But though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give a poſitive Account of its immenſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundity, yet we may negatively conclude too, that it is not that which ſome repreſent it to be, a place where the bluſtering Winds Rendezvouze and Muſter, for the Experiment will not hold good, That if a Cloth be trown in, it will be roſs'd up again by the inpetuous Blaſts from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; neither did we perceive, but all was very whiſt and ſtill during the time we ſtaid by it, only, if we threw into it a Stone of any bigneſs, when we
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:54306:53"/>
laid our Ears down cloſe to the ſide of the Pit, the Ratling which it made by its fall, would be very diſtinct and audible for a long time toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, until it was got beyond our ſphear of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>Paſſing from this, we rode on two or three Miles further, to <hi>Buxton,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Buxton-<hi>Well.</hi>
                     </note> a Village very Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, in the <hi>Peak,</hi> for the ſixth Wonder it glories in, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Hot Well.</hi> 'Tis incloſed in a fair Stone-Building, erected by the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and the Water, by its Operation, being of a near Affinity with that in the Croſs-Bath, draws hither in the Summer, a great Concourſe of People, of all Ages and Degrees, here being Lodgings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared on purpoſe, proportionable to their Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or Condition. The Fountain daily purging it ſelf, runs away in a continued Current into the adjacent Meadows, and adds a reeking colour to the other Waters with which it unites its Tepid Streams. Not far diſtant from this, was formerly two Springs of a contrary Nature, the one hot, and the other cold, but the Partition betwixt them being ſmall, and no care taken to preſerve them, when we were at the place, the hot one ſeem'd then to be moſt predominant.</p>
                  <p>Here is often very good Company, amongſt whom we gathered up a brief account of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remarkable Places, which at that time we had not an opportunity to view. They aſſured us, That <hi>Darby,</hi>

                     </note> the chief Town of the County was large, and fair, populous, and rich, conſiſting of five Pariſhes, and driving a very conſiderable Trade; that <hi>Quarndon</hi> Springs near that Town, are much of the Nature of <hi>Tunbridge-Wells,</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and the <hi>Spaws</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> as ſtrong of the Mineral, and as effectual in Operation; that <hi>Kedlaſton</hi> Well is ſaid to be ſingular in curing old Ulcers, and even Leproſie it ſelf; that <hi>Stanley</hi> Springs are much like <hi>Quarndon,</hi> but not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo ſtrong of the Mineral; and that near

                     <note place="margin">Pool's-Hole.</note>Not far from <hi>Buxton</hi> is the 7th and laſt Wonder, which is called <hi>Pool's-Hole,</hi> 'tis a hollow Cave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a high Rock, bearing ſome kind of reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to <hi>Ochy-Hole,</hi> which I have before deſcribed, but no way ſo remarkable for ſo many amazing Varieties: Who that <hi>Pool</hi> was from whom it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived its denomination, whether ſome Hermite, that in this cloſe Cell reſolved to live an Ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite's Life, which by his Bed-Chamber here may not ſeem improbable, or what Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> that was, which they tell you betook her ſelf private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to this Grotto, as a ſafe <hi>Aſylum</hi> or Sanctuary, I ſhall by no means undertake to determine; but ſure I am, that the nature of this Cave is not much different from that I now mentioned, for there are ſome Shapes and Figures of Animals here, as of a Lion and a Dog, and there are ſome colours of the Stones within not much unlike to thoſe in the other; beſides the Water which runs along it in a ſmall current doth petrefie, and the modes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved both at our entrance and return are the ſame; for you go in with Guides and Lights, and when we came out we were met by ſome poor Woman, who live near to it, with Water and Herbs to purifie and cleanſe our ſelves from any filth or dirt we might have contracted by creeping along that darkſom Cavern.</p>

                  <p>When we had rode about five Miles further, we came within the limits of <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> to a Town called <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dorche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</note> built at firſt by <hi>Birinus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caer-Dor,</hi> which <hi>Bede</hi> calls <hi>Dorcinia,</hi> and <hi>Leland Hydropolis,</hi> taking its name of the Waters it ſtands upon, ſometimes Walled about and Caſtled, but all now ruined and gone, a round Hill there ſtill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing. Here, as we are told in the Hiſtory of <hi>Allcheſter,</hi> the Superſtitious enſuing Ages built <hi>Birinus</hi> a Shrine, teaching them that had any Cattel amiſs to creep to that Shrine for help, ſuch Blindneſs poſſeſſed them then, that they laid the Commandments of God aſide to follow their own Traditions, and yet ſo blind are their Poſterity, that they praiſe their Doings. That this was a Colony of the <hi>Romans</hi> is very evident from their various Coins and Medals bearing their Stamp, which have been found hereabouts, and it is as certain that formerly it was a Biſhop's See, which <hi>Birinus</hi> the Grand Apoſtle of the <hi>Weſt-Saxons</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced here; for in the Year 635, by the Preaching of this Holy Man, King <hi>Kinegilſus</hi> and all his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple received the Chriſtian Faith, to whom <hi>Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald</hi> King of the <hi>Northumbers</hi> was God Father at the Font, whereupon a Biſhop's See was here fixed. But beſides <hi>Kinegilſus</hi> he Baptized after that <hi>Guicheline</hi> his Son too, and after him <hi>Cuthred</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> about the Year 639. He is ſaid to have inſtituted Secular Canons in his Cathedral Church, who continued till in the Reign of King <hi>Stephen, Alexander</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> converted them to Canons Regular. Upon the Death of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Aethelſtan</hi> his eldeſt Son ſucceeded, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his whole Reign guarded theſe Parts from all diſturbance of the <hi>Danes,</hi> who in <hi>January</hi> 938 held here a Council, as the Learned Mr. <hi>Kennet</hi> informs us, <hi>In Civitate celeberrima quae Dornaceſtre

                  <p>WE diverted our ſelves for ſome little time in the City, but the Pleaſures therein growing nauſeating and irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and the Rural Diverſions more pleaſing and delightful, we reſolved to undertake once more a Pilgrimage of a greater extent, than any we had done before; and the Vernal Seaſon, which then began to attire the Country in all its bravery, did as mightily conduce to quicken our Reſolutions in ſteering our Courſe about the Maritime Coaſts of our Native Soil, as in taking
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:54306:64"/>
a view of that further part of the Continent, to which before we had made no acceſs.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon equipping our ſelves, like provident Pilgrims, with all things requiſite for ſo great a Journey, we ſet forward, and having ſome Friends which accompanied us in our way, our firſt Remove was into the County of <hi>Eſſex,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eſſex.</note> a Country of as great Variety as Delight, of a conſiderable compaſs and very fruitful; 'tis full of Woods and ſhady Groves, enriched with all kind of Grain, abounds with Saffron, and is ſtocked with great Herds of Kine and Hogs; hereupon the Ruſticks have great plenty of Dairies, and make Cheeſes maſſy and ponderous; the Gentry generally are courtly and affable, and the Commonalty for the moſt part pretty well refined; but for them who live in the Hundreds (as they call that part of the County which lying more low and flat, and near to the Sea, is full of Marſhes and Bogs) they are Perſons of ſo abject and ſordid a Temper, that they ſeem almoſt to have undergone poor <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi>'s Fate, and by converſing continually with the Beaſts to have learn'd their Manners.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rumford</hi> was our firſt Stage,<note place="margin">Rumford.</note> about ten Miles from <hi>London,</hi> renowned for its great Market for all manner of Cattle, but more eſpecially celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for its Hogs and Calves. After a little ſtop in this place, we paſſed on through <hi>Burntwood</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerſtone,</hi>

                  <p>This Town ſtands in the Heart of the County,<note place="margin">Chelms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</note> being formerly called <hi>Chelmerford</hi>; 'tis ſituate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two Rivers which meet here, <hi>viz. Chelmer</hi> from the Eaſt, and another from the South, the name whereof, if it be <hi>Can,</hi> as ſome would have it, we have no reaſon to doubt it was <hi>Old Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi> which <hi>Cambden</hi> tells us ſtood anciently in
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54306:65"/>
this place; it was of old very famous for a ſmall Religious Houſe erected by <hi>Malcolme</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and for its Church-Windows (having the Hiſtory of Chriſt and the Eſcutcheons of its noble Benefactors painted in them) which were batter'd down by the Inſtigated Rabble in the late Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion; but that which now renders it moſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned, is not only the Aſſizes, which are held here twice a Year for the County, but likewiſe its great Market for Corn, which the <hi>Londoners</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming down every Week take away in great quantities; and the Vicinity of the Nobility and Gentry, which lying round about it, do very much enhance its Glory, as well as promote its Trade.</p>
                  <p>But the Allurements of this place were too weak to detain us any longer than the Morning; for no ſooner did we diſcern the modeſt Bluſhes upon <hi>Aurora</hi>'s Cheeks, but we prepared our ſelves for the Farewel of our Friends, where mutually embracing each other, with ſome paſſionate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Kindneſs at our departure, we left them to return to the City, and they with a gale of good Wiſhes ſpeeded us forward on our Journey.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner were they departed from us, but a Cloud of Sorrow overſpread our Countenance, and, as if we had ſuffered an Eclipſe of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip upon our Souls by their Separation from our Bodies, we began to think that of all Evils which are incident to Humanity, there is none that equals Privation, upon which account we became for a while a little diſcompoſed in our Thoughts, till <hi>Witham,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Witham.</note> another Market Town about five Miles diſtant from <hi>Chelmsford,</hi> Built, as is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, by King <hi>Edward</hi> the Senior, preſented us with ſome other Scenes of Pleaſure and Diverſion.</p>

                     <hi>Romans</hi> being here planted, or from the River <hi>Colne,</hi> 'tis not much material to enquire; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Coins, which have been digged up here, bearing all the <hi>Roman</hi> ſtamp, do evince its Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; and whether <hi>Lucius, Helena,</hi> and <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> the firſt Chriſtian King, Empreſs, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror in the World, were Born here or no, ſure I am, that the Inhabitants ſpeak great things of her Father King <hi>Coel,</hi> who built the Caſtle, (tho' others will have it Built by <hi>Edward,</hi> Son of King <hi>Alfred</hi>) and the Walls of the Town, having ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted a Statue for him in the midſt of it, which they preſerve with great Reverence to perpetuate his Memory: And 'tis as certain, that in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Croſs which his Daughter found here, they give for their Arms a Croſs engrailed betwixt two Crowns. It ſuffered much of old from the Fury of the <hi>Eaſt-Saxons</hi> about the Year 921, as the <hi>Saxon Chronicle</hi> informs us, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken it by Storm put all to the Sword, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a few, who by ſtealth crept away, and ſaved themſelves by flight, and deſtroyed all its For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, and threw down its Walls; but King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Confeſſor came and Fortified it again, and having repaired all its Breaches, and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened it with a Gariſon, it began by degrees to recover its Loſſes, and retrieve its ancient Splendor and Comelineſs; for, being pleaſantly ſeated upon the Brow of a Hill, which extends its ſelf from Eaſt to Weſt, it quickly drew to it numerous Shoals of Inhabitants, whereby its Buildings were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, and its Churches encreaſed to the number of 15 within the Walls, and 1 without, beſides 2 Religious Houſes, an Abby built here <hi>A.

                  <p>In the late unhappy Civil Wars it had its ſhare of Calamities, for being cloſe Beſieged by their Enemies, the Royaliſts within behaved themſelves ſo bravely, that they could neither take it by Violence, nor enforce it to a ſurrender, till having block'd up all Avenues whereby the leaſt Proviſion might be conveyed to them within, they were reduced to ſuch Exigency and Want, Hunger exerciſing its Tyranny within the Walls, with no leſs rigour than the Enemy did without, that they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by one Enemy to Surrender to another, and to fall by the Sword, rather than die by Hunger: Nor were the Royaliſts more famous for their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Bravery, than the adverſe Party was infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for their Baſeneſs and Treachery; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got poſſeſſion of the Town, they did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſe the utmoſt Rigour and Severity upon the weaker ſort, who could make no Reſiſtance, but even in cold Blood, did they barbarouſly Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Sir <hi>Charles Lucas</hi> and Sir <hi>George Liſle,</hi> Perſons of great Integrity and undaunted Courage; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Victorious to their Malice, being cruelly ſhot to Death by the Sanguinary Hands of the Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Soldiers in the Caſtle-yard; on which Spot of Ground, where they fell down dead, there hath never ſince, as is reported, ſprouted up any Graſs, as there was wont to do, the very Ground it ſelf, it ſeems ever ſince being clad with mourning Weeds, and the Graſs, as it were dreading ſuch execrable Murders, retires and hides it ſelf within the Bowels of the Earth: But tho' juſt <hi>Nemeſis</hi> deſigns perhaps that plat, as a Monument of infamy to ſucceeding generations, yet doth a Vault prepared for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of Sir <hi>Charles Lucas</hi> ſecure both his own and Fellow-ſufferers Body from any farther Attempts of the Sons of Violence; and being wrapped in Lead they lie in that Church, which was next to his own Houſe, and was formerly a fair and Sumptuous Structure, but was ruinated by his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54306:66"/>
who hated the Houſe for the Maſters ſake, and were ſo maliciouſly incenſed againſt all that had relation to that Noble Family, that they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegiouſly violated the Tombs of the Lady <hi>Lucas</hi> and <hi>Killigrew</hi> in the Church adjoyning, and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely uſed their dead Bodies diſmembring, and disjoynting their very Trunks, and wearing their Hair in their Hats by way of Triumph.</p>
                  <p>The Caſtle is now quite demoliſhed, and gone to decay, and though they ſhew'd us a Brazen-Gate, which gives entrance, as they ſay, to a Vault fifteen Miles under-ground, yet the Stories they multiply concerning both, are ſo Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickly idle and extravagant, that there is little cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to be given to any Relations concerning them: As for the Town it is very Rich and Populous, and there are Merchants of conſiderable Eſtates, and great Traders who inhabit it; The chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture of the Place is Stuff and Bays, which are from thence tranſported into divers parts of the World, and there being a Colony of <hi>Dutchmen</hi> planted here, they are induſtrious in keeping up the Trade; nor is it leſs Famous for its Oyſters, which by the general Vogue of moſt Perſons are reputed the beſt in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We betook our ſelves from hence into its Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring County of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> which is divided into too Parts called High and Low <hi>Suffolk,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Suffolk.</note> the former of which is Miry and Dirty, the other more Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and Delightful, but both are of a fat and fertile Soil, the Air is here Wholeſome and counted proper for Conſumptive people; the Country abounds in Rye, Peaſe, and Hemp, feeds abundance of Sheep, and produceth great Store of Butter and Cheeſe; 'tis every where adorned with ſtately Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces and Magnificent Edifices, to which the Parks, Repleniſhed with Game adjoyning, are very conducive to their Profit and Delight.</p>
                  <p>The firſt place of note we arrived at here, was <hi>Ipſwich,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ipſwich.</note> called by the Saxons <hi>Gippeſwick,</hi> ſituate on

the North ſide of the <hi>Stour,</hi> at the foot of a ſteep Hill, commodious for its haven, enriched by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign commerce, repleniſhed with Inhabitants, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with ſeveral Magnificent Churches, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing united into a Corporation is governed by two Bayliffs, who have all other Miniſters befitting their Grandeur to attend them: It has been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly fortified with Rampires and Trenches, but to little purpoſe, it being incapable of Defence by its Situation, becauſe commanded by hills on all ſides, but the South, and South-eaſt: So that the <hi>Danes</hi> did eaſily maſter it 991. who nine Years after reduced it in a manner to a heap of Ruines; in the <hi>Norman</hi> times it began to recover it ſelf, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that it conſiſts at this time of divers Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, graced with many fair Buildings. The <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> built a Caſtle, which held out Stoutly againſt King <hi>Stephen,</hi> but was forced at laſt to Surrender, and is ſuppoſed by <hi>Cambden</hi> to have been demoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Henry</hi> the Second: Here Landed the 3000 <hi>Flemmings</hi> called in by the Nobility againſt the ſaid King <hi>Henry,</hi> when his Sons rebell'd againſt him; and 'tis very obſervable, that in the Civil Wars under the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, this Town ſtood clear of moſt of thoſe Calamities which overſpread and involved the reſt of the Nation: The Streets are kept clean and well Pav'd, and in the midſt of the Market-place, which is ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with rich Shops, Stands a curious Croſs with the Eſſigies of the great and Impartial Goddeſs <hi>Aſtraea,</hi> bearing a pair of Scales in the one Hand, and a Sword in the other, a fit emblem to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind the Magiſtrates of the exact meaſures they muſt uſe in the diſtribution of Juſtice, and with what Severity they muſt proceed in diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding all the contrary acts of Violence and Oppreſſion. The Store-houſes, which are kept for the Kings Ships, do much promote the Trade of the Town; and there is no ſmall Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage rebounds to it by the continual ſupply of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:54306:67"/>
Stores, which upon occaſion are made for the Royal Navy.</p>
                  <p>Before the Subverſion of <hi>Monaſteries</hi> it had its ſhare of ſome ſuch Religious Houſes, and of a Magnificent College begun by Cardinal <hi>Woolſey,</hi> who receiving here his firſt Breath, though of a mean Extraction, being only a Butchers Son, did at laſt attain to ſuch Dignity and Renown, as to ſurmount moſt Prelatical Grandees, that have been in this Nation before him; but as he was mounted up with admiration to the Hill of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, he did at laſt as ſuddenly tumble down head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long from that dangerous Precipice, and though it might have been as truly ſaid of him in one, as it was of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great in another Senſe, <hi>Aeſtuat infaelix anguſto limite Mundi,</hi> that this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocoſm of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Soil was too little and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for his large and boundleſs Thoughts, and ambitious Deſires; yet behold, <hi>Sarcophago contentus,</hi> a little Urn contains all his Pomp and Grandeur, which extended it ſelf from our <hi>Britiſh Iſland</hi> to the <hi>Popiſh Conclave</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and his duſt appears of no finer mold, than thoſe poor Creatures from whom at firſt he lineally deſcended.</p>
                  <p>After ſome reſpite in this Place, we paſs'd on through <hi>Needham, Stow</hi> and <hi>Wulpit,</hi>

                  <p>This Town is call'd St. <hi>Edmunds-Bury</hi> from <hi>Edmund</hi> the Martyr, King of the <hi>Eaſt-Angles,</hi> who for refuſing to renounce the Chriſtian Faith, was ſhot to Death by Arrows at <hi>Hoxon</hi> by the <hi>Danes,</hi> and was buried in this Place: It is further ſtyled by <hi>Antiquaries Villa Fauſtini,</hi> and though it be not the ſame with the Poet <hi>Martial</hi>'s, which he ſo elegantly deſcribes, yet it no ways falls ſhort in any thing, which may render it amiable or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful; for 'tis Situated in a Pleaſant Air, in a
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54306:68"/>
wholeſom Soil, not in any part annoyed with noiſom Fogs, or offenſive Vapours, but ſo libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally enriched by Nature with a contribution of all Varieties, which may illuſtrate and beautifie it, that it draws hither great numbers of Perſons of Quality; and there is hardly to be met withal in any Town Corporate of our <hi>Britiſh</hi> Iſland a more noble Colony, or glorious Aſteriſm of the Gentry, than is viſibly ſhining in this renowned Sphere.</p>
                  <p>The Town it ſelf hath been very famous for a large and ſtately Monaſtery, Founded by <hi>Canutus</hi> in Honour of St. <hi>Edmund,</hi> whom his Father <hi>Suenus</hi> had cauſed to be put to Death, to expiate which Murther, being affrighted with a Viſion of St. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi>; he erected a curious Structure, beautifying it with coſtly Ornaments, enriching it with great Revenues, and offering his own Crown at the Martyr's Tomb. As the Incomes which the Monks hereby enjoyed were very conſiderable, ſo were the Privileges granted to them unſpeakable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the Government of a Seneſchal or Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, who did not only govern them, but preſide over the whole Town beſides; by whoſe ſtrict Order and Diſcipline the Townſmen were ſo awed and kept under, that in King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third's Reign, they roſe up in Arms againſt the Monks, took away all their Gold and coſtly Habiliments, their Books, Charters, with the Aſſay of their Coins, Stamp, and all other things appertaining to their Mint, for which they were afterwards ſharply puniſhed and fined by the King, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to cry <hi>Peccavi,</hi> and make a full Reſtitution of what they had ſo unjuſtly defaulked from them. After this Broil was over, it encreaſed again in ſuch Wealth and Honour, great Offerings being daily made at St. <hi>Edmund</hi>'s Shrine, that it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rather like a City than a Monaſtery, ſo many Gates it had for entrance, and many of them Braſs, ſo many Towers, and above all a moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54306:68"/>
Church; and thus it continued till the final Diſſolution of it by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, ſince which there remains nothing now, but the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſs of that ancient Structure; and yet even ſtill by its Ruins it is eaſie to conjecture what a maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Fabrick it once was.</p>
                  <p>To this adjoins two large Churches of curious Architecture, dedicated the one to St. <hi>James,</hi> and the other to St. <hi>Mary,</hi> and in that ſpacious Church Yard, in which they both ſtand, being only part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a decorous ſhady Walk of Trees, as the Aſſizes for the County are held at the further end of it, in a Court-Houſe erected for that purpoſe, ſo there are divers Monuments diſperſed all over it with various ancient inſcriptions; but three Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphs in a more eſpecial manner we did more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly take notice of.</p>

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54306:74"/>
entertained us with a pleaſant and divertive Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; the Haven is as commodious as the Town beautiful, being fortified both by Art and Nature: For although it be environed almoſt round with Water, on the Weſt-ſide with the River <hi>Yare</hi> (from whence it receives its Name) which hath a draw Bridge over it, and from other Parts with the Ocean, unleſs it be Northward, where there is firm Land, yet it is likewiſe incloſed with a very ſtrong Wall, upon which, beſides Towers, is caſt up a Mount towards the Eaſt, and are planted ſeveral Pieces of Ordnance to defend the Town and command the Sea. There is but one Church, but that fair and lofty, adorned with a high ſpire Steeple, built at firſt by <hi>Herbert</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Norwich</hi>; but there are divers clean and ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Streets, on each ſide of which are ſeveral rows of very uniform Buildings, inhabited by wealthy and gentile Perſons.</p>
                  <p>That this Town is of no great ſtanding, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived its beginning from the Ruines of old <hi>Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annonum,</hi> is the general vogue of all Antiquaries: And 'tis certain that <hi>Cerdick,</hi> a valiant <hi>Saxon</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain coming here to the place, which is ſtill called <hi>Cerdick-ſhore,</hi> about the Year 895, as the <hi>Saxon Chronicle</hi> informs us, together with his Son <hi>Cyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> and five Ships; and finding it much decayed, by reaſon the River <hi>Yare</hi> had diverted its Current another way, planted a Colony of <hi>Saxons</hi> in a moiſt and watery Ground upon the Weſt-ſide of the River, which place he called <hi>Yarmouth</hi>; but the Inhabitants finding both the Air and Soil very prejudicial to them, tranſplanted themſelves to the other ſide of the River, called from the ſame <hi>Cerdick, Cerdick-Sand,</hi> and built this new Town, which in a ſhort time grew ſo potent and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, that they ſtrengthened it with a Wall, and were able to make up ſo ſtrong a Body of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as would frequently make Incurſions upon the Neighbourhood of <hi>Leſtoff,</hi> and the adjacent

Cinque-Ports, againſt whom they had a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Antipathy, becauſe they were excluded by them from many advantageous Privileges, which their Anceſtors had enjoyed: But theſe private Feuds did at laſt end by an expreſs Order from the King, and their Courage was quelled by a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and fearful Peſtilence, which in the ſpace of one Year brought above Seven thouſand Men and Women to their Graves, all which was faithfully Recorded in an ancient Chronographical Table, which formerly uſed to hang up in their Church; ſince which time, as their Grudges have ceaſed, ſo their Wealth hath encreaſed, and 'tis now a place of great Merchandize and Traffick, but eſpecially renown'd for its Fiſhery of Herrings, of which, at the ſeaſon, there is uſually ſuch plenty, that they do not only ſupply our own, but Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Nations too, after they have been by their great care and induſtry dried and ſalted in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Houſes ſet apart for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>The Haven it ſelf is capacious enough for Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of great Burdens, and ſtanding well for <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> affords a ready paſſage to it, and is a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Shelter for the <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> Coal Fleet, when diſtreſſed by Weather; but the North-Eaſt Wind being ſubject frequently to annoy this Coaſt, and drive in the Sand and Beach in great heaps, the Townſmen are forced to be at a great Expence, by removing all ſuch Obſtacles to clear their Haven.</p>

                  <p>But as the Incomes are great, and the Profits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable of moſt Perſons who inhabit theſe Fens, ſo are there ſome Inconveniences which are no leſs intolerable; for their Cattle being commonly a good diſtance from their Houſes, they are forc'd in the Winter, when they go either to Fodder or Milk them, to betake themſelves to their little Boats which they call Skirries, carrying uſually two a-piece, and may be compared to an <hi>Indian</hi> Canoo, and by theſe convey themſelves from place to place, as occaſion requires; and becauſe their Ground lies very low and flat, and Eaſt-ward adjoins to the main Ocean, leſt at any time it ſhould be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown by any ſudden Inundations, as in ſtormy Weather it too frequently happens, they fence in their Lands with great Piles of Wood, and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Banks well lined and ramm'd down againſt the Violence of the Waves, and are forced to keep Watches with great care and diligence, as againſt the Approaches of a moſt dangerous Enemy; and yet, notwithſtanding all their vigilance and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt, they can ſcarce with the ſtrongeſt Barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadoes, they can prepare, defend themſelves from the violent Incurſions and Outrages of the Sea.</p>
                  <p>Here is great plenty of Flax and Hemp, and in all theſe Parts many thouſands of Sheep are fatted for the ſlaughter, but of good Bread and Water, which are the ſtaff of Life, as great a ſcarcity, for the Water is generally brackiſh and ill reliſhed, and the Bread as little pleaſing and toothſom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made for the moſt part of Peaſe and Oats, which yet goes down as favourily with the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, as if it had been moulded of finer Flour.

                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:54306:86"/>We diverted our ſelves for ſome Days in this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, where during our abode we had the Honour to be invited to the Lord Mayors Houſe, who treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with all the Civility imaginable; where I cannot omit to obſerve by the way, that there are no Gentlemen more affable, and Courteous, more Hoſpitable and Generous, more Obliging in their deportment and hearty in their entertainments, to all Strangers and foreigners, than the generality of the Gentry, who are every where diſperſed through theſe Northen Climates.</p>
                  <p>The great ſatisfaction we met withal here made us hope for no leſs in the reſt of our Northern tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, and giving us encouragement for a further Progreſs,<note place="margin">Malton.</note> we ſet forward from <hi>York</hi> to <hi>Malton</hi> a Market Town notable for the great reſort of Jockeys, who flock thither in abundance to the Fair, that is held there every Year for Horſes, 'tis watred by the River <hi>Rhie,</hi> and well frequented for Corn, Fiſh, and Inſtruments of Husbandry; and here are ſtill to be ſeen the ruines of an old Caſtle belonging formerly to the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſcies,</hi> who were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Barons in theſe Parts: and in the Reign of King <hi>Stephen</hi> here was built by <hi>Euſtace</hi> a <hi>Gilbertine</hi> Priory, dedicated to the Honour of the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From hence we ſteered towards the Sea Coaſt, and came to <hi>Scarborough,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Scarbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough.</note> a Town very eminent for its Spaw-water and Caſtle, where <hi>Pierce Gavaſton,</hi> the great favourite of King <hi>Edward,</hi> the Second, was placed by the King to ſecure him from the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, whom he had ſo extreamly incenſed, from which notwithſtanding he was by force drawn away, and immediately beheaded by their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and Order.</p>
                  <p>The Caſtle is Situated upon a Rock, of a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful height and bigneſs, which by reaſon of its ſteep and craggy Cliffs is almoſt inacceſſible, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf into the Sea, wherewith it is encompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, excepting on that Side which opens to the

Weſt, on the top it hath a very fair, green, and large Plain, containing diverſe Acres of Ground, with three freſh Springs, one of which comes out of a Rock, and a Mill to grind Corn in caſe of a Siege; in the ſtrait paſſage which leads up to it ſtands a high Tower, and beneath the ſaid Paſſage ſtands the Town, ſpreading two ſides North and South, but the fore-part Weſtward which is fenced on the front with a Wall of its own; on the Eaſt fortified by the Caſtle, wherein a Garriſon is kept, and on both ſides watered by the Sea: The Town is not very large, but conveniently built of Stone and Slate, and well inhabited, and ſtands bending upon the Brow of the Hill, and ſerved for a Landmark to Ships off at Sea, till it was ſo much defaced in the late Civil Wars: It has a commodious Key, and enjoys a pretty good Trade.</p>
                  <p>About half a Mile from the Town near to the Sea is the Spring which they call the Spaw,<note place="margin">The <hi>Spaw.</hi>

                  <p>From hence the Shore indented and interlaced with Rocks, bendeth in as far as the River <hi>Teeſe,</hi> and by a large compaſs which it fetcheth, there is made a <hi>Bay</hi> about a Mile broad, which from the Famous Outlaw <hi>Robin-Hood</hi> is called <hi>Robin-Hoods Bay:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Robin-Hoods Bay.</note> Here is a ſmall Village, but the moſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated for the Fiſhing Trade: In all theſe parts, for here are caught great quantities of all ſorts of Fiſh in their Seaſons, which not only ſupply <hi>York,</hi> but all the adjacent Country, and hard by the Shore is a little Hully (as they call it) which is much like a great Cheſt, bored full of Holes to let in the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:54306:87"/>
Sea, which at high Water always overflows it, where are kept vaſt quantities of Crabbs and Lobſters, which they put in and take out again all the Seaſon, according to the quickneſs or ſlowneſs of their Markets.</p>
                  <p>Here and all along this Coaſt are great plenty of Herrings; which, coming hither in Shoals out of the Northen Seas the beginning of <hi>August,</hi> are caught until <hi>November,</hi> not only by our own Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermen, but by <hi>Dutchmen</hi> too: Afterward they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe themſelves into the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Sea, where they continue till <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> and then betake themſelves to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Coaſt, and after they have coaſted round about <hi>Britain,</hi> away they hie into the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Ocean, as to their own proper home, where having ſetled and reſted themſelves a while till <hi>June,</hi> they caſt their Spawn and bring forth a young Frie, and then return hither in innumerable companies, and ſo march conſtantly about theſe Iſlands.</p>
                  <p>The great quantity of Fiſh, which is here ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, cauſeth as great a cheapneſs throughout all the neighbourhood, and indeed we found every thing ſo plentiful and cheap in theſe parts, that a five Shillings Ordinary in many other places of <hi>England,</hi> would hardly produce what Sixpence or to be ſure Twelvepence would here.</p>
                  <p>Four Miles further lies <hi>Whitbay,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Whitbay.</note> called by the <hi>Saxons</hi> of old Streaneshalh and Streonesheal, which probably might be taken, as the Learned Mr. <hi>Gibſon</hi> obſerves in his <hi>Gloſſary,</hi> from the <hi>Saxon</hi> word <hi>Heale,</hi> which Signifies a Palace or Hall: It was formerly remarkable for a Monaſtery founded by St. <hi>Hilda,</hi> about <hi>A.

But it would argue great credulity and Surperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to attribute their Transformations to the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of St. <hi>Hilda,</hi> as it would be Folly or Levity to aſcribe to her Holineſs the ſudden and immature Death of certain Wild geeſe, which in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when they change their Air, and ſeek out for freſh Rivers, that are not frozen in the Southern Parts, by flying over ſome certain Fields adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this place (as is reported) ſuddenly fall down dead to the Ground, whereas this may be caus'd by ſome malignant Vapours ariſing from this Soil, which become very noxious and deſtructive to them.</p>

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:54306:88"/>
afterward they ſteep it in pits of Water, which are digg'd for that purpoſe, and when it hath lain there as many Hours as is convenient, they convey it away in certain Pipes laid along the Ground to a Houſe below the Rock, where it is afterward boil'd and clarified, as we find it; the Charge is great, and the Trouble unſpeakable before it can be purified or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd, as it ought; but the great Revenues and Profits that do amount from it, ſufficiently countervail all Expences, and other inconveniencies that attend it.</p>

                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:54306:92"/>From hence the Road led us directly to <hi>Gateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> the utmoſt limits of this Province,<note place="margin">Gateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</note> which ſtanding on the hither ſide of the River <hi>Tine,</hi> hath in all probability been a great Colony of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and was called by the Latins <hi>Capreae Caput, i. e. Goats Head,</hi> by occaſion of ſome Inn, as is generally conjectured, which had a Goats Head for a Sign, a thing not unuſual in other places of the World. Certain it is, that all Hiſtorians name this place <hi>Capreae Caput,</hi> when they give us an account of the Tragical end of <hi>Walter</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> who being placed here by <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, as his Subſtitute and Vice-gerent, became a victim to the Fury of the enraged Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and was ſlain in this place upon ſome great diſtaſt which they took to his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Gateshead</hi> there is a large Stone-Bridge built over the <hi>Tine,</hi> a Town large,<note place="margin">Newca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>upon</hi> Tine.</note> populous and rich, and is the chief place for Trade in all the Northern Parts, being enobled by a notable Haven of ſo great a depth, that it receives Veſſels of very conſiderable Burthens, and is ſo ſafe a Harbour, that all Ships find here a ſure Ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, without receiving any prejudice or damage by ſtreſs of Weather: The Towns ſtands high and low, part upon a Hill, and part in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of it near the River, the Streets upon the aſcent are exceeding ſteep, the Houſes moſt of Stone, ſome Timber, and a few of Brick; it conſiſts of four large Pariſhes with as many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Churches, the principal whereof dedicated to St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> ſtands very lofty on the top of the Hill, and looks more like a Cathedral, than a Pariſh Church, with a fair Steeple of curious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture, beſides which it is adorned with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Market, a handſome Town-Houſe, and an uſeful Key.</p>
                  <p>Through this Town went part of that Wall, which ran along from Sea to Sea, and was built
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54306:93"/>
by the <hi>Romans</hi> to defend the <hi>Britains</hi> againſt the violent Incurſions and Depopulations of the <hi>Picts</hi>; and at <hi>Pandon-Gate</hi> there remains, as is thought, one of the Turrets of that Wall, differing much from the other Gates of the Town in ſhape and Workmanſhip: And though formerly it had the Name of <hi>Monks-Cheſter,</hi> yet after the Conqueſt, when <hi>Robert,</hi> Son to <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, had raiſed here a new Fort to keep off the <hi>Scots,</hi> it got the Name of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> upon <hi>Tine,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> under <hi>Line</hi> in <hi>Staffordſhire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, when the <hi>Scots</hi> came hither and infeſted theſe Parts, they took away Priſoner out of this Town a very opulent Perſon, who having ranſom'd himſelf for a great Sum of Money, no ſooner returned home but he began immediately to fortifie the Town, which the reſt of the Inhabitants joining with him, in a ſhort time they environed it with a ſtrong and ſpacious Wall, ſince which time it hath not only been enabled much better to defend it ſelf againſt all its Enemies, but is become a place ſo conſiderable for all Merchandize, that divers great Fleets of Ships go every Year laden from hence with many Chauldron of Coals, and return home in lieu of them other rich Commodities: And as its Commerce is great, ſo its Privileges are as renown'd, for our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchs have ever afforded it all poſſible Encouragement, for <hi>Richard</hi> the Second made it a Corporation, and ordered a Sword to be carried before the Mayor, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth enlarged its Charter, by making it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a County Incorporate, and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſtill made more honourable Additions to it.</p>
                  <p>During our abode in this place we took a pair of Oars and went down in a Wherry to view <hi>Tinmouth</hi> Caſtle, which is about two Leagues from it.</p>
                  <p>As we paſſed along we found the River <hi>Tine</hi> very navigable and commodious, till we came to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:54306:93"/>
the Mouth, where it empties and diſembogues it ſelf into the Sea, and indeed 'tis there rocky and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, for there ſtands two Rocks oppoſite to each other, upon which if a Ship happen to touch, ſhe is in danger of being quite loſt, ſo that the Saylors are forced to ſteer carefully through this dangerous gulph, and if it be foul weather or Night, when they come near it, keep off at Sea, till a fair opportunity preſent it ſelf for their paſſage.</p>
                  <p>Upon the Mouth of the River is ſituated the Caſtle, which commands the Sea,<note place="margin">Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth-<hi>Caſtle.</hi>

                  <p>On the other ſide of the River,<note place="margin">Sheals.</note> almoſt oppoſite to the Caſtle, is <hi>Sheals,</hi> a village very eminent for its Salt-Pans, where great quantity of Salt is boil'd and made, and on the Banks on both ſides are

many convenient Houſes for the Entertainment of Seamen and Habitation of Colliers: And as here uſually moſt of the <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> Coal-fleet keep their Station, ſo not far from hence ſtands <hi>Jarrow,</hi>

Before the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second we find little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Recorded of it, for <hi>William</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> being taken Priſoner by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> did firſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render it into King <hi>Henry</hi>'s hands upon condition, that unleſs by ſuch a day he paid the Ranſom that was demanded for his Liberty, it ſhould always belong to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> hereupon the King built a Caſtle to ſtrengthen it, all which was afterward releaſed to the <hi>Scots</hi> by King <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt, upon the payment of that Money which before had been promiſed.

upon a great diſtaſt he took againſt the <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> for doing homage to the <hi>Scotch</hi> King, won it again; and not many Years after, when <hi>Baliol</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> had violated his Oath, King <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt brought it under his Subjection, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a while after, when the Fortune of the War began to ſmile upon the <hi>Scots,</hi> it was unawares ſurprized, but in a few days the <hi>Engliſh</hi> regained it; afterward, in that looſe Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, it was betrayed to the <hi>Scots,</hi> and for a long time after it was in vain beſieged by the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Forces, until King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, that moſt Puiſſant Prince, came thundering againſt it, and forced his entrance: Notwithſtanding in the Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, the Caſtle was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized by certain <hi>Scotch</hi> Robbers, but they could not hold it long, for the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> in a few days diſlodged them of their Fortreſs. Scarce ſeven Years were over paſſed, when the <hi>Scots</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered it again, not by force, but by Money, for which cauſe the aforeſaid Earl was Impeached of High Treaſon, but he being a very politick Man, corrupted both their Faith and their Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and ſtraitway reſtored it to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown. A great while after, when <hi>England</hi> was embroiled in Civil Wars, King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth flying into that Kingdom for refuge, ſurrendred it up into the hands of that King, to ſecure him his Life and Safety in that Country; but many Years were not expired before Sir <hi>Thomas Stanley</hi> did again reduce it under the command of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, but not without a great loſs of his Men, and much Blood ſpilt about its Walls; ſince which our Kings have been ſtill ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with new Fortifications, eſpecially Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who to the Terrour of the <hi>Scots</hi> and Safe-guard of this Nation, encloſed it about in a narrower compaſs within the old Wall, with a high Wall of Stone moſt ſtrongly compacted, which ſhe hath ſo forwarded again with a Couter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarp,

ever been reputed a ſort of Military Men, ſubtile, nimble, and, by reaſon of their frequent Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, to which they were formerly accuſtomed, well experienced and adventurous.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Borders have been formerly of a far greater extent, reaching as far as <hi>Edinburgh-Frith</hi> and <hi>Dunbritton</hi> Northward, and taking in the Counties of <hi>Northumberland, Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morland</hi> Southward; but ſince the <hi>Norman</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, they have been bounded by <hi>Tweed</hi> on the Eaſt, <hi>Solway</hi> on the Weſt, and the <hi>Cheuiot</hi> Hills in the midſt.</p>

                     <hi>Feids,</hi> and were reduced by the Princely Care and Prudence of King <hi>James</hi> the Sixth. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I have read a very remarkable Story in the Life of <hi>Robert</hi> the Third, King of <hi>Scots,</hi> how that a dangerous Feud falling out betwixt two great and populous Families in the North, <hi>Thomas Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar</hi> Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> and <hi>James</hi> Earl of <hi>Craford</hi> were ſent to reduce them, who, perceiving the great Miſchief likely to attend their endeavours of a forcible reducement, contrived a more ſubtle way to quiet them; after a repreſentation made to the Heads of thoſe Clans, a part, of the danger of thoſe mutual Feuds, and of the King's Wrath againſt both, they adviſe to conclude their Feuds, as the <hi>Horatii</hi> and <hi>Curatii</hi> did at <hi>Rome,</hi> by the choice not of three, but of three hundred on each ſide to fight, armed with Swords only, in the ſight of the King and his Nobles, whereby the Victor ſhould gain Honour, and the Vanquiſh'd Safety from further Puniſhment, and both regain his Majeſty's Favour, whereof they gave them full aſſurance; the Propoſition is embraced, on both ſides of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Town Mounts raiſed, and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries made for the accommodation of the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, the Combatants are choſen, and on the day appointed, together with a multitude of Beholders, all of them appear upon the place, only one through fear privately withdrew himſelf; this put ſome delay to the Encounter, the one Party look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on it as a diſhonour to fight with the other wanting one of their number, the other Party not finding one who would engage himſelf to make up the number, deſire one of the Three hundred to be put aſide, but of all that number not one could be enduced to withdraw, accounting it an indelible Diſgrace to be ſhufled out of ſuch a choice Company of valorous Men: At laſt an ordinary Trades-man tendreth his Service, deſiring no greater Reward than one ſingle piece of Gold in hand, as an honourable Badge of his Valour, and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:54306:100"/>
an Annuity of a ſmall Sum for Life ſhould he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the Combat; his Demands are ſoon granted, and immediately beginneth the Conflict with as much fury as the height of Wrath, the inſatiable deſire of Honour, and the fear of Shame, more than the fear of Death, could produce, to the Horror and Amazement of the Spectators, whoſe Hearts tremble within them to ſee (as indeed it was a horrid Spectacle to behold) ſuch a ruful ſight of furious Men butchering one another; and obſerved it was by all, that of all the Combatants none ſhewed more, ſhall I call it Valour, than the Trades-man did, who had the good Fate to ſurvive that diſmal Day, and on the Conquering ſide too, whereof only ten beſides himſelf outlived that Hour to partake with many ghaſtly Wounds the Honour of the Day; the Vanquiſhed are kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on the place all to one, who perceiving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be left alone, and being without Wounds, he skippeth into the River, by which means none of the ſurviving Victors being able to follow him, by reaſon of their Wounds, he makes a fair eſcape with his Life.

                  <p>Near this Town upon the Cliffs we met with ſome Stones of diverſe Shapes and Figures very ſtrange and wonderful, ſome reſemble a Muſcle, but are a great deal bigger than they, others were like a Kernel of an Almond large and ſomwhat roundiſh, which are Streaked and crankled like a Cockle-ſhell, but of a more dusky colour; others we found ſomewhat bigger than a Hazlenut, and ſome much leſs, which are like a Cockle too but are as ſmooth and as black as Jet; ſome we diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered

                     <note place="margin">Seding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourn.</note> which being a great thorough-fare is well furniſhed with Inns, a Town of which there are two things more principally Recorded, the one is, that in the Year 1232, <hi>Henry</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Philpott</hi> hath collected it out of ſome old Monkiſh Writers, came with much exultation out of <hi>Sedingbourn</hi> Church, and deſired the People to expreſs their joy, becauſe on that day, by the efficacious Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Church, <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt formerly King

of <hi>England,</hi> and many others, were moſt certainly ranſomed from the Flames of Purgatory.

                  <p>In the Neighbourhood of <hi>Sedingbourn</hi> is <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Newing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</note> which though but a ſmall Village hath afforded ſome worthy Remarks of Antiquity; for not many Years ago there were digged up Roman Urns not far diſtant from the High-way or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Road, it being agreeable to Roman Practice to inter in thoſe Places where their Monuments might be obvious almoſt to every Eye, Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of themſelves, and Memento's of Mortality to living Paſſengers, whom the Epitaphs of great Ones did beg to ſtay and look upon them.</p>
                  <p>From hence the Road brought us directly to <hi>Chatham,</hi>

<pb n="284" facs="tcp:54306:149"/>
but ſo great and diſmal Calamities did frequently attend it, that the Fury of the Elements ſeemed to enter into a Corrivalſhip or Competition with the Fury of Enemies for its Ruine, and the Fire and Sword were joint Confederates to deſtroy it; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, maugre all theſe Caſualties, by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Princes, and their Royal Munificence, it recovered all its Loſſes, and ſurvives in Splendor. In the Year 1225, by the indulgent Bounty of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third it was inveſted with a Wall, and that this Fortification might be of the greater importance, it was ſecured or fenced with a Ditch; it was governed by a Port-Reeve until King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, in the ſecond Year of his Reign, raiſed it to a higher Dignity, and decreed by his Royal Grant, that it ſhould henceforth be under the Juriſdiction of a Mayor and Twelve Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen, and to this Monarch doth the City owe much of its preſent Felicity.</p>
                  <p>The goodly Skeleton of the Caſtle, which yet courts the Eye of the Beholder to the admiration of its former ſtrength, acknowledgeth for its moſt eminent Benefactor, if not Founder, <hi>Odo</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Baicux</hi> and Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> half Brother to <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> the Conqueror, which Fortreſs he afterward breaking forth into open Rebellion againſt his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew <hi>Rufus</hi> did ſeize, but was quickly diſpoſſeſſed by the vigorous Expedition of his Prince, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced immediately to depart the Kingdom. After this, when the Dauphin was invited into <hi>England</hi> by the Seditious Barons, to wreſt the Kingdom from K. <hi>John</hi> their native Sovereign, the Dauphin uniting their ſtrength with his, made ſuch a furious Onſet on the Caſtle, that, like a Tempeſt which beats down all before it, he carried it by Aſſault; the like had been atchieved by <hi>Simon Montford,</hi> Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> when he raiſed an Inſurrection againſt King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, had not that Prince arrived moſt opportunely, and by a ſucceſsful Encounter wreſted both Earl <hi>Warren,</hi> who had ſo reſolutely

maintained it, and that likewiſe from the Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Fury; ſince which time there hath been little of moment acted in this Place; tho it is worth taking notice of what Mr. <hi>Philpott</hi> hath obſerved farther concerning it, that there being much Land in this County held thereof, whoſe Tenure is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Caſtle-guard, upon the day prefixed for the diſcharging the quit Rents relating to it, there is a Banner diſplayed and hung out (antiently it was on the Caſtle Wall) and all thoſe who are Tenants to this Mannor, and are in default by their Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appearance, and do not diſcharge their accuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Duties and Services, the penalty impoſed upon their neglect is, that the return of every Tide of the adjacent River <hi>Medway,</hi> which finds them ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, doubles their Service or Quit-Rents.</p>

This Cathedral was dedicated by <hi>Ethelbert</hi> to St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> as that which he built likewiſe at <hi>London</hi> was to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but whatever the Piety of that Prince, and other Religious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons after him, did in former Ages contribute to its enlargement and beautifying, the late prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faction of ſome injurious Incendiaries, did in a few Months diſpoil and almoſt aboliſh; and the Scars, which ſtill remain in its Sacred Body, are too pregnant Symptoms to convince the World
