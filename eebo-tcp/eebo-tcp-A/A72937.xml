            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The King of Sweden hath already taken diuers good places in Meckelburg, and lyeth now neere Roſtock, but the Imperialiſts are very ſtrong within.

There marched lately 8. ſtrong Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Crabats, intending to relieue that place as they were commanded, but comming neere, before they were awares of it, they were ſo welcommed by the Swediſh, that the moſt part was ſlaine, and the reſt forced to ſaue themſelues by flight.</p>

The ſame was conſented by him the ſaid Great Turke, but there was no prefixed time preſcribed for the execution of the ſame. Wherefore theſe bloodthirſty wretches were at a certaine time and place aſſembled together, to reſolue when, and how this wicked enterprize ſhould be put in practice. When they were ſate in Counſell in this nature; ſuch terrible Thunder-claps, and dreadfull Lightnings fell from Heauen, that their miſchieuous intention was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by fruſtrated. The Thunder and Lightning did caſt them downe one after another to the very ground, did fire and burne the very Cuſhions whereon they ſate, &amp; put them all into no ſmall perplexity, feare, and aſtoniſhment. The Great Turke (who formerly had not willingly condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the cruell and bloody deſſeine) did openly profeſſe, that he did palpably perceiue that ſuch inhumane cruelty plotted againſt ſuch innocent harmeleſſe people, was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether odious, abominable, &amp; diſpleaſing to the Almighty. Whereupon he conſulted what ought to be done to the firſt brochers and inuentors of ſuch villany; and at laſt concluded and reſolued vpon, That ſuch Miſcreants ſhould be puniſhed with <hi>Lex talionis,</hi> that is, be ſerued with the ſame ſawce. It was ſo effected: for all thoſe perſons, that had a hand in this buſineſſe, as many as could be found out afterwards (being diſperſed) were beheaded and put to death.</p>

               <head>From Old-Stattyn the <hi>4.</hi> of October.</head>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, the Peeres and Inhabitants haue very importunately deſired his Maieſty of Sweden to beſiege, and labour to incorporate both the paſſages of Gartz, and Griffenhagen: Their requeſt was thus earneſt in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, to the end that the Country might be freed from the exceſſiue tyranny, burning, and pillaging<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. The reaſon why his Maieſty hath not yeelded to their deſire as yet is,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:173640:6"/>
becauſe he hath another weighty Enterprize in hand, to the which end he hath arreſted and ſtayed many Ships, and laden the ſame with Men, Munition, Victuals, Ordnance, and all neceſſaries. With this Fleet and Army he ſailed very lately hence (the wind being fauourable) he paſſed by Wolgaſt, and went to Straelzondt, where he will land his Army, and march to Mechlenburgh.</p>
               <p>Before the departure of his Maieſty, came Letters to him from the 6. Electors, which Letters did anſwer vnto what his Maieſty formerly had written vnto them: whereupon they required his Maieſty to depart the Confines of the Empire, promiſing that they would vſe all meanes poſsible to obtaine a Peace: But his Maieſty not regarding, but altogether ſlighting their propoſitions, did notwithſtanding proceed, to proſecute his deſigne and enterprize, vnto which the Lord giue a bleſſed ſucceſſe.</p>
               <p>The Imperialiſts being aduertiſed of the departure of his Maieſty of Sweden, fell vpon this Citty with all their poſſible force and might, and vpon the Sconces and other Forts, ſhouting, and crying, and making a fearefull noyſe: but they were ſo receiued at their comming, that they were commpelled to retire with the loſſe of many men.</p>
               <p>This laſt weeke paſt, the Imperialiſts came with ſome Forces before Poſewaldt, which the King of Swedens For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces had taken and beſconced but 4. dayes before; they ſtrongly aſſaulted this place, and at laſt ſet the ſame on fire, inſomuch that thoſe within were not able to abide the heate, and therefore not ſufficiently defend themſelues, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the Imperialiſts maſtered the ſame, and haue miſerably and cruely ſlaine Souldiers, Citizens, men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and children: they found in the ſame 14. Peeces of Ordnance, and other good commodities.</p>
               <p>By reaſon that the peſtilence raignes hotly in Gartz a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Emperours Forces, they flye apace out of the Imperiall Army, vnto the Biſhop of Hall. The Generall Field-marſhall, Count <hi>Torqualto,</hi> the Generall <hi>Cordacke,</hi>

               <p>Thoſe of Maghdenburgh had ſome men in Ambuſh, ſo that they did greatly endamage the Imperialiſts. The Maeghdenburgers came not off without ſuſtaining great loſſe.

The Frontiers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts betake themſelues to the Biſhops Forces, as alſo moſt of the Inhabitants thereabouts, doe flye with all their goods and Moueables into Maeghdenburgh.</p>
