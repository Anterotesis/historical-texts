            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I am so far from triumphing over our Misfortunes, that I call God to witness, <hi>England</hi> can receive none that do not sensibly wound me; but the Wise Man in the Scripture advising us, To consider in the day of Adversity, I think it not unseasonable at this time to recollect the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent State of our Affairs, and under a few short Heads expose the Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Condition of our Country to the view and the consideration of all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interested and honest People. Some of those things I shall offer here, have been already mentioned in Print, and others in private Conversation, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst such whose Judgments tho' in some particulars differed from mine, yet who I have the Charity to believe are guided by Principles of Integrity, and in the pursuit of the ends they drive at prefer the publick Good before any private Advantage of their own. But tho I have sometimes discoursed to the same purpose with men in Place and Power, and such too as have the reputation of good Sence, yet what I have delivered with all the Sincerity man is capable of, has generally met with the Fortune incident to such meagre Doctrines as won't make the Pot boyl, and I have been listened to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40646:2"/>
as Sermons are; more for decency than application. I have therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained my self hitherto from publishing my thoughts so freely, unwilling to oppose the rapid Tydes of Passion and Interest, which for these last five Years have born down all before them, and overflowing the defences of Law and Reason, have brought a deluge of Miseries upon t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But now that the Fulness of time is at hand, and our Ruin almost quite accomplish't, I think I am obliged to contain my self no longer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Table talk, but to do my Country all the Service I am capable of from the Shade I live in, by endeavouring to dispel those Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cribed. For whoever heard that a Country govern'd by Laws was enslaved by a Prince, whom his Subjects had entertained inveterate apprehensions of, even before his accession to the Crown, or would not laugh at the pretence of five or six thousand <hi>Papists</hi> endangering our Religion and Property, when there was a Million of <hi>Protestants,</hi> keepers of the Liberties of <hi>England.</hi> It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a vain Phantome to imagine that a King whose Subjects were suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and watchful over, could surprise us with any material Innovati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This consequence is much worse because nearer at hand, if the Prince be vertuous only in the giddy conceit of the Populace, deluded by the fallacies of artificial men, for such an one carries the secret Venom about him, and is impatient of opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to profit himself upon the dupes of his own Reign. And this is just our case; for by starting at a Shadow, we have embraced the very Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance that we feared, in deposing a Lawful home-born Monarch, who could not, nor had a thought to hurt us, and exalting with a popular, but blind Zeal a little Forreign Prince, who has imbibed by his Education a dislike

               <p>This may be deduced from every Act since the first Scene of this so fatal and expensive Reign; but it not being the subject of this place to launch into a thorow Comentary, I will only hint at what is freshest in our Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and put you in mind of the late admirable Caution in the Conduct of our Fleets and Army. Was it from his Love to <hi>England</hi> that he broke his Promise to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to send a Squadron of men of War into the Mediteranean, which was to be there before the beginning of last Spring, to act in Conjunction with the <hi>Spanish</hi> Admiral, in case the <hi>French</hi> attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any thing in <hi>Naples,</hi> or in <hi>Catalonia</hi>? Was it from his love to our Merchants, that he detained our Ships that had been a Year loaden at <hi>Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> and might safely have ventured last <hi>November</hi> out without a Convoy? But were kept in under an Embargo, because the <hi>Dutch</hi> were not ready, and and neither Sir <hi>G. Rook</hi> nor they permitted to sail until our <hi>Holland</hi> Friends were pleased to joyn them, at such a time that it was true a Convoy became necessary, but such a Convoy as ought not to have been less than the whole Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>al strength of <hi>England</hi>? By this breach of Word with an Ally, his Catholick Majesty owed the safety of his whole Fleet at <hi>Naples</hi> only to the Storm that dissipated Mr. <hi>d' Estrees</hi> Squadron, but by it has since actually lost <hi>Roze</hi>; and by his tender care of our <hi>Smirna</hi> Fleet in keeping them safe so long in Harbour and hugging them as Monkeys do their young ones to death, our <hi>Turkey</hi> Trade, nay and the whole Exchange of <hi>London,</hi> were all at once upon the utmost precipice and brink of ruin.</p>
               <p>I cannot but admire the Courage of our Sanguine Citizens, that still bears up against so many repeated Losses, for tho' the richest of their <hi>Tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I will not go about to compute the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reparable Loss we have suffered by this unheard of Conduct; how much our Staple Manufactures are endamaged, how many Merchants, Insurers, Packers, Dyers, Clothiers, Silkmen, and Weavers must starve or steal for want of business, and the disappointment of those Goods the return of this Fleet would have imported. A little time will demonstrate these effects without a Calculation; but I cannot pass over the industrious Sollicitations for Money, and the engaging arts the Court made use of to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Lands end, which will reach to <hi>Brest,</hi> and sink the Ships within that Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Missionaries were daily employed to soften and restore their aking hearts, and Letters from the Prince of <hi>Condy,</hi> and others were forged, and pretended to be intercepted in <hi>Flanders,</hi> which diminished the late Victory, and augmented the Losses on the <hi>French</hi> side: But when several of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants had been invited to drown their Sorrows in the Cellars at <hi>Kensington,</hi> the Queen thought it a proper Season to send a select Committee of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Board to <hi>Guildhall,</hi> to whose august appearance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>These were some of the Delusions practised to lull poor men into a farther Confidence; to palliate our losses at Sea, and to disguise our disgrace at Land: But there is another Cheat that is still more offensive, because it is more familiar, and more vexatious then all the bare-faced Injuries of our Enemies abroad, because it is a Couzenage diffused all over <hi>England</hi> by A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I will not stay to rake that Kennel, and to insist upon the particular Lyes which every <hi>Gazettis</hi> stuffed with, and am sorry that well-meaning people in the Country suck in so much Poyson with the divertisement of a News-Book, and have such an alacrity in believing what ever is by Licence printed.

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He flourishes with the <hi>male-administrations,</hi> during his Majesties abode amongst us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He tells us no King is to be trusted who has <hi>once</hi> broke his Word.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Lastly,</hi> He acquaints us after all the pains he has taken to Answer it, that <hi>he knows</hi> not whether it is King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Declaration or no.</p>
               <p>As for the Declaration, that was printed last year, besides that I can as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure you, <hi>Doctor,</hi> I never yet saw it Signed with the King's own Hand; I can also assure you that it was as much misliked by many, almost all, of the King's Friends, as it can be exposed by his Enemies.

I am past Wondering at any thing <hi>King William</hi> does, but Posterity will be astonished, that a <hi>Parliament of England</hi> could ratifie such Articles.</p>
               <p>To proceed to another Head, it is notoriously known that several men were Executed by Martial Law <hi>before</hi> it was Enacted. When an Army is no <hi>better</hi> paid, then ours has been, either in <hi>England, Ireland,</hi> or <hi>Flanders,</hi> to empower a Commander <hi>to Shoot a man to Death, because he demands the Money</hi> he has earned for himself, and his Family, with his Sweat, and with his Blood, is a Law that requires great subtilty and argumentation, to prove it equal or just; but to give this power to imperious and cholerick Officers, without examining how many men had been before the settling of it, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in their rage, and to gratifie their own violence. I say to enact this Law without such a retrospection, and without guarding <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> against a too vigorous execution of it for the future, is what little becomes an <hi>English House of Commons,</hi> who ought to have a tender regard to the Life of the meanest Subject.</p>
               <p>Let us come to consider of the numerous Parliamentary Pardons bestowed upon Ministers, who have falen foul upon our Laws; have not the Subjects, even the <hi>Peers</hi> of England been hunted by <hi>Proclamations,</hi> clapt into Prisons for High Treason, and <hi>refused</hi> the benefit of their <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and this
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40646:12"/>
when there was no Information <hi>upon Oath,</hi> as the Law appoints to justifie such a proceedure? And have not the Ministers had all this pardon'd by a <hi>Parliament? Doctor Welwood</hi> does make so many Repetitions himself, that I hope he will not redicule me if I now and then repeat the same thoughts, and set down here, that <hi>Parliaments</hi> heretofore thought fit to punish, and not to skreen such Arbitrary Ministers, to make the reparation of the Subject more easie, more certain; but now they <hi>take part</hi> with the Ministers to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the Subject.</p>
               <p>Another Parliamentary Errour under this Government is, that our Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislators don't at the beginning of every Sessions read the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi>'s own <hi>Declaration</hi>; for there are in it some things that deserve their Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. These are the Words of one Paragraph.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>And we for our part will concur in every thing that may procure the Peace and Happiness of the Nation, which a Free and Lawful Parliament shall determine; Since we have nothing before our Eyes in this our undertaking, but the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Protestant Religion, the covering of all men from Persecution for their Consciences, and the Securing to the whole Nation the <hi>FREE ENJOY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT</hi> of all their Laws, Rights, and Liberties under a Iust and Legal Government.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I don't know, whether the present Gentlemen that meet at <hi>VVestminster,</hi> take themselves to be a <hi>free Parliament,</hi> but if they do, here is a very fair Invitation, which is also in other places expressed by declaring, that the design of his coming should be <hi>to rescue the English Government from the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies and Disorders which had overturned the whole Constitution.</hi> Really if this was true, our Civil Fabrick wants a great deal of Reparation, and if he was in earnest you are to blame that you don't propose solid Securities against Arbitrary Government, and to prevent <hi>the possibility of Slavery for the future,</hi> as the <hi>Declaration</hi> has it in another <hi>place.</hi> But in troth after all, I know not whether the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> takes the present for a <hi>free Parliament,</hi> because that I can name his Highness some Bills, that they have determined very unanimously to be for the happiness of the Nation, to which nevertheless <hi>King VVilliam</hi> has not thought fit to give his assent, no, he did not think fit to concur, tho' some men absolutely attached to his Interest, have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly (according to their Principles) told him that a Prince who comes in for the sake, and upon the Foot of Reformation, can never stand long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he really perform the business, and design of his exaltation.

I believe you need not put your self to any farther trouble about the reallity of this being King <hi>Iames</hi>'s <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>; but if you are still in doubt, there is an Astrologer who is a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner in the <hi>Fleet,</hi> and who was formerly of another Profession, to whom you may apply, and if he is a Master in his Art, he will easily by casting a Figure, find that this Declaration has <hi>passed the Great Seal at St. Germaines,</hi> as well as the <hi>approbation</hi> of many of his Majesties <hi>Friends</hi> here.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman who studies the Stars can spell his own Name out of this little hint, but altho' he <hi>fawned</hi> upon King <hi>Iames</hi> in his Prosperity, and has been a busie little <hi>stickler</hi> against him since his Misfortunes, and has had a mind to have a <hi>flirt</hi> at this Declaration, yet I pitty the hardships that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man has brought upon himself, and wish at last he would mind his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Function, and not trouble himself any more with Politicks, which God and Nature never designed for his Province, He will know I ken, but I will not expose him, who is more miserable already then I wish him, were it in my power to make him otherwayes.</p>
               <p>I have said all I think necessary to the general Heads, and now shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to those things that have not fallen under them.</p>
               <p>In looking over <hi>page</hi> the 6<hi>th.</hi> I perceive Doctor, you have a wonderful good opinion of the Face of Affairs in <hi>Scotland,</hi> therefore if you please I will compare Notes with you.</p>
               <p>My Correspondents, Doctor, assure me that your Country-men are less affected then they were to the present Government, which they say appears by the general obstinacy against taking the Oathes, the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Party ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, and some of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Ministers themselves refusing; and those that have taken the Oaths, even amongst the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Clergy, have taken them with such a Reservation and Explication as plainly shews that they have King <hi>William</hi> in suspition, and that they don't desire to place a Dictato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Power in the <hi>Prince of Orange.</hi> I think I had best send the explanation it self. <hi>We do take the Oath of Allegiance to King</hi> William <hi>and Queen</hi> Mary, <hi>in so far as they defend our Religion, and our Liberties according to the Claim of Right and their Coronation Oaths.</hi> I suppose you have heard of Mr. <hi>Windram</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:40646:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Professor in Divinity at <hi>Glascoe,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iohn Ballendine,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Thomas Linnin,</hi> These men repeated these Words in the name of themselves and the <hi>Kirk of Scotland,</hi> and they demanded, and would not be satisfied till they had got Instruments from the Clerk of the Commission, who was empowered to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster the Oaths unto them, that upon these terms <hi>only</hi> they had Sworn the Oaths and Signed the Assurances Now I have repeated their Explanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, methinks even these men have not bound themselves Hand and Foot. The <hi>Claim of Rights</hi> &amp; the <hi>Coronation Oath</hi> have been, &amp; may again be, broken by <hi>King William and Queen Mary,</hi> and then the <hi>Kirk of Scotland</hi> is at Liberty to step out of the way of their Allegiance; and by what has been done to King <hi>Iames,</hi> such Sallies as those are brought into president. There are prodigious numbers both of Noblemen and Gentlemen, who were living Peaceably, and willing enough to live peaceably, under the protection of this Government, some of whom are Imprisoned, others Fined in a Years Revenue of their Estates, besides many that are Banished, and all this meerly for refusing to take the Oaths at all; and it is no wonder that men of Spirit and Conscience so obstinately refuse the Oaths there, since by them they are to Swear Allegiance to the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> and his Princess as King and Queen <hi>de jure,</hi> as Rightful and Lawful King and Queen of <hi>Scotland</hi>; but besides these that refuse, there are others that are not so well able to grapple with Tribulation, who have taken the Oathes against their will, and with a design never to keep them, for there is nothing more certain than that according the <hi>Scotch</hi> Aphorism. <hi>He that Swears against his Will, is of his old Opinion still</hi>; nor can this Government especially expect any great Security from Oathes, which is it self founded upon the breach of so many solemn and sacred ones. That face of Affairs which you are in love with, seems to me disfigured with greater Oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and more ghastly Hardships then would be necessary to support a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Throne, and I am apt to think those hardships will force the injured Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and many of their Relations upon designs against the Government, to get rid of these particular Oppressions, which perhaps no other motive could so easily and so vigorously have put them upon. This rigid management of <hi>Iohnston</hi> and <hi>Ormeston</hi> (who is Justice Clerk) has so universally disgusted that I have it from men of both parties (men considerable in the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> as well as the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Party in your Country) that those <hi>Cameronian</hi> Dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers have more served King <hi>Iames</hi> then their own Master. The heavy Taxes both upon the Commons and Gentry, which are so great and unusual that they neither will, nor can be paid in many places, have much inflamed <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but they are more inflamed because at the first sitting of their Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they were made believe, that a bloody and execrable Plot would be made out as plain to them as the Sun at noon day, which Plot at last dwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled into a few paultry Letters, which no body evident<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>nth, you charge <hi>King Iames</hi> with endeavouring both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after his Accession to the Crown, to advance the exorbitant great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>France,</hi> and you say that this is a truth so generally known in <hi>Europe,</hi> that even the <hi>Popish Princes</hi> lay it at his door with the heaviest Execrations. These are heavy Charges, but you are pleased to let the proving of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and I protest, <hi>Doctor,</hi> you are the only man in the world, upon whose bare Word I would have believed things of this importance. However from these discoveries of yours, you infer, that the present War is for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of our Country, our Religion, and our Liberties. The Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and English Liberty are so dear to me, that I must consider them first. I did never hear that our Religion and our Country were attacked by <hi>France.</hi> I thought we declared War first against <hi>France.</hi> Well! but you will tell us, that our Religion and Liberty are concerned in the defence of <hi>Flanders,</hi> as well as in that of our own Country, because, if <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pish Flanders</hi> is lost, it is impossible for either our Religion, or Liberty to subsist. I answer, First, that <hi>Flanders</hi> was not attacked, until after this Revolution, and so the danger of <hi>Flanders,</hi> did not draw us into this War. And then Secondly, with submission if we had kept out of this War, and from the expence of a Land Army in <hi>Flanders,</hi> our Trade would have flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished, and our Navy, with the fifth part of that Expence we have been at, might have been so increased as would have secured our Religion and Liberty from all the Power of <hi>France,</hi> and of the whole World too. But farther, supposing I should grant that we must be yet more watchful over <hi>Flanders,</hi> are we nevertheless bound to ruin our selves for its defence? Is not this to submit at present to a mischief, the avoiding of which for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the only reasonable and National motive why we should take any care at all of those Provinces?</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Doctor,</hi> how does it appear that King <hi>Iames</hi> has labour'd for the Granduer of <hi>France</hi>? If you know any thing of a <hi>French League,</hi> produce it. My Lord <hi>Sunderland</hi>'s Letter, Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The disgraces of the latter part of <hi>Edward</hi>'s Reign almost withered all his former Laurels, and <hi>England</hi> was so drained of Money, that its Treasure, with that of the Conquered Provinces, was not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to pay that Army upon its return, which under the conduct of the <hi>Black Prince,</hi> had restored <hi>Don Pedro</hi> to his Kingdom of <hi>Castile,</hi> neither can we discover any better fruits of the Conquest of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, his Reign was short, and upon ballancing of Accounts, nothing fell to our share, but our loss of our bravest Officers and Souldiers, and an immence mass of Money thrown away in that unfortunate War. Upon the other hand Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> by applying her Councils and Thoughts to the Shipping and Trade of this Nation, did so encrease the Wealth and Strength of it, as enabled her to support the whole Protestant Interest, to secure <hi>Scotland</hi> from the <hi>French</hi> Clutches, to recover <hi>France</hi> out of the very Jaws of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> to defend and establish the Common-wealth of <hi>Holland</hi> against all the Power of <hi>Spain,</hi> and at last to break the strength of, and to humble that great Monarch, to whose aspiring Thoughts all <hi>Europe</hi> seemed too mean a Quarry, and whose Ambition could not be satisfied with less then the Empire of the Universe. By these methods she out-did all the bravest Actions of our former Kings, and extended the dread and reputation of the <hi>English</hi> Name, hither to confined to our bordering States, to the utmost corners of the Earth, and hath withal thereby Established such a solid Foundation for our future greatness, as hath already withstood, without any sensible decay, a greater effusion of Blood and Treasure in our last Civil Wars, then was spent in <hi>France</hi> in the Reigns of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, which Reigns nevertheless had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>almost anihilated this Nation. From all this it doth evidently appear that whensoever a King of <hi>England</hi> applys his whole thoughts to the encrease of the Shipping and Trade of this Nation, he must raise our Reputation, Strength, and influences proportionable to the advances he makes in them.

               <p>From all these Instances, and many more that may be met with in Story, I think we may infer that nothing is more certain, than that the love which People have to the rightful Descendant and Successor of a Family that has a long time held the Reins of Government, and which has been submitted to by them, will at last prove too hard for any Fascination with which the People may for a while be inveigled by the arts of an Usurper, and his Emissaries, together with the <hi>Billinsgate</hi> of such Scriblers as your self.</p>

Those Particulars he promises are so beneficial, and I am so confident of his Majesties exact Performance, that as much as you and I differ in Politicks, and the Rights and Titles of Kings, yet I will put the Issue of things upon that, and joyn with you in Prayer, <hi>that God may give him Success in the prosecution of his Right, as he sincerely intends the Confirmation of our Liberties.</hi> I heartily say this Prayer, and I wish no more to facilitate the Restoration of the King, than that all his Subj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I had once thoughts of closing here, but I can't forbear making one observation upon the Words of the <hi>Declaration</hi> cited at the end of my last Paragraph, which observation is this. The King with a Royal <hi>decorum</hi> avoids writing Libels (tho' by what, <hi>Doctor,</hi> you have provoked me to say of the Male-administrations of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> you may see he did not want matter) The King thinks it enough to tell his People, what he will do for them, and not becoming his character to tell the world what the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> has done either against him, or them. He will no more imitate the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> in sending over Invectives, than the <hi>French</hi> King will the <hi>Dutch,</hi> in being so mercinary as to expect repayment for what he has, or shall do for the King. The King declares he will forgive, and be reconciled to all his Subjects that don't after his Landing oppose him (tho' they venture neither Life nor Limb for him) and which is remarkable, there is no expression in this whole <hi>Declaration</hi> which shews the least unwillingness to be reconciled even to his own

Family, notwithstanding the ill treatment and unjust usuage he has met with from them to whom he had been so indulgent. I pray God that the whole Family may be yet reconciled if it be his blessed Will and Pleasure.</p>
               <p>It is time to end; for I have answered all that is material in your Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, and I have tyred my self, and, I believe, my Reader with poring upon it, tho' I have avoided in many places ridiculing your tedious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions, fantastick discoveries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as likewise giving an exact and full detayle of the Ministers, and managements of the present Government. When I first scratched down my rough draught, I designed to have used you a little familiarly, and therefore collected some ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>erials for railery, to which you have very much exposed your self, but upon second thoughts I concluded the Times too tedious even for <hi>Tragicomedy,</hi> and too busie for a long Pamphlet. If you don't some where or other meet with a full Answer to any thing you value your self for, it is because I did not think it of so much weig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t as you do. I have not urged the third part of what I could say against what you have written; but if any body will with care look over what I have said, I presume, no farther Antidote will be wanting to preserve them from the infection of your Libel. Your good breeding, <hi>Doctor,</hi> has not been very remarkable, your Inferences are very weak, and your Ignorance very notorious. To pass by forty other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of either the greatest disingenuity, and most impudent falsificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or else the most apparent Ignorance, that ever appeared in Print; can any thing manifest a more notorious want of knowledge in History then what you say <hi>page</hi> 25<hi>th.</hi> where you peremptorily <hi>affirm that King</hi> James <hi>made more steps in four Years time towards the reconciling this Nation to the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>then was made in</hi> France <hi>it self from the death of</hi> Henry <hi>the fourth until about three Years before the Edict of</hi> Nants <hi>was revoked</hi>; for did not <hi>Lewis</hi> the 13th. who succeeded <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th. attack the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi> by force of Arms, kill many thousands of them in the Field, tear out of their hands no less then 300 Walled Cities and Forts? Did King <hi>Iames</hi> make any Steps like these? Did he attack the <hi>Protestants</hi> by Force? As a Friend, I advice you never to Print again, till you have read and thought more, since had the Press been free, and men had leisure to read Sportive Pamphlets, a man might lash'd you most unmercifully.</p>

            <p>This Reply had been ready against the meeting of the Parliament, if it could have been Printed, for it has been at the Press above two Months, and had it not been so near finished, the History of throwing out Mr. <hi>Brockman</hi>'s Bill, together with the manner of guelding it, would have made a very entertaining Paragraph amongst the Legislative Errours.
