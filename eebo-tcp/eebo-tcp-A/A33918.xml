            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>WHen my Adversary first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd,
I was engaged in
Business for the Press, which
I could not well dismiss, till 'twas brought
somewhat forward. Besides, I was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
at a stand whether to Answer, or not,
and, I think, had left my <hi>Book</hi> to take
its Fate, had it not been for the Charge
of false Quotation.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Author of the Survey, &amp;c.</hi>
his Manner is all over extraordinary, but
in what relates to my <hi>Authorities,</hi> I
think altogether unpresidented; such a
size of Assurance, so unsupported by Proof
and Colour, is rarely to be met with. If
he continues to cast the Cause thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
upon his <hi>Courage,</hi> he must Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
by himself.</p>
            <p>His Eagerness to Defend the <hi>Stage,</hi>
has sometimes transported him into plain
Rudeness: To this I shall only observe,
That Railing is a scandalous Talent, and
an Argument of an ill Vndertaking. When
a Man throws Dirt, 'tis a sign he has no
other Weapon. These are Vnchristian
<pb facs="tcp:54372:3"/>
and Vngentlemanly Sallies, and not so
much as allow'd to Provocation. Having
therefore neither Liberty, nor Fancy for
this way, I shall, for the most part, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look
his Misbehaviour.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Stage,</hi> I almost despair of
doing them any Service: They are more
enclin'd, I perceive, to Repeat their Faults
then amend them: They make no scruple
of coming over again with their <hi>Ill Plays;</hi>
As if Immodesty and Prophaneness were
the more valuable for being discover'd.
But thus to bear up against Evidence,
and go on in Defiance of Religion, is an
odd Instance of Resolution. And besides
the ill Colour of the Quality, 'twill fail
us at the long Run: Courage without
Conscience starts at the other World, and
leaves a Man dispirited when he has most
need of Support. To Consider that we
have done our Vtmost to Debauch Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
will be no Pleasure at such a Iuncture
as This. Vnless therefore we could De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
the Grounds of Atheism, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Sense, if minded, will put us upon a
Provision beyond the Grave.</p>

            <head>AN
ANSWER
To a BOOK, Entituled,
The Ancient and Modern Stages
Surveyed, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>BEfore I proceed farther with my
Adversary, it may not be amiss
to observe, that his Scheme is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective,
and the Compass of his
Defence much short of the Charge. For
he does not apply his Answer to any Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
nor so much as Vindicate one
Passage accused of Indecency and Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
So that were his whole Book true,
the Imputation of <hi>Prophaneness</hi> and <hi>Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,</hi>
would still lie heavy upon the <hi>Stage.</hi>
This Author, to give him some part of
his Character, seems to rely more upon
Stratagem and Surprize, than plain Force,
and open Attack. His Business is all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to perplex the Cause and amuse the
<hi>Reader,</hi> and to Reason, and Represent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss.
In the first place he tells us a Story,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54372:4"/>
which Mr. <hi>Rymer</hi> had told before,<note place="margin">The Ancient and Modern Stages Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>yed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> about
the Original of <hi>Plays;</hi> and charges all the
<hi>Immorality,</hi> and Disorders of the <hi>Stage,</hi>
upon the Head of Idolatry,<note place="margin">P. 7, 8 9.</note> and the Practice
of the <hi>Mimes</hi> and <hi>Pantomimes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 13, 23.</note> And when
he has thus entangled the Dispute, and like
the Scuttle-Fish mudded the Water, he
thinks himself out of Reach; but I shall
endeavour to dive after him, and drag him
to the surface.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In his History of Heathenism and the
Stage, he lays down several unlucky Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and ruines himself in his very De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
He lets us know,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Ancient and Modern Stages Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>that</hi> Paganism
was invented to oblige and captivate the People,
and gain'd its Authority among them by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging
their Sensuality, and gratifying their
Lusts: That the Games and Shewes were the
most engaging parts of their Religion,<note place="margin">p. 10.</note> and that
the Devotional and Pompous part of their
Worship,<note place="margin">P. 12, 13.</note> was ungrateful to the Spectators, who
impatiently expected the Shew. <hi>He informs
us farther, That the Fathers thought it not
safe</hi> to trust their Converts to the Temptations
of so jolly a Religion, that the Portion of
those that embraced Christianity was Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
that their Reward was in Reversion,
and that present Enjoyment is apt to prevail
against a remote Hope.</p>
            <p>Now if Stage-Plays were such Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Diversions, if they indulged Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality
and Lust, seised so powerfully
upon People's Inclinations, and made them
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54372:4"/>
forget the Interests of <hi>Futurity;</hi> If the
Case stood thus, (as the <hi>Surveyor</hi> confesses)
then there were other heavy Articles

bold Liberties and Luscious Pleasures of
the Place, were sufficient Reasons why the
Fathers declaimed against it; and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
their Censures come strong upon
the <hi>English</hi> Theatre.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Infancy of Christianity and the frequency
of Persecutions,</hi>

Behaviour, nor make so great a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the Primitive and Modern
Christians, as our Author would suppose.
If 'tis possible, we have more Reason
to be cautious and self-denying, than
those who lived in the first Ages of our
Religion. For then the History of our
<hi>Faith</hi> was fresh, and the Proofs lay nearer
to the <hi>sense.</hi> Then Miracles were frequent
to refresh their Memory, and quicken their
Zeal. Besides their very Sufferings were
awakening Circumstances, and a Guard
upon their Virtue. Their being so ill used
in this World, was naturally apt to make
them take the more care about the other.
Having none of these Advantages, we
have more need of Discipline and Recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
on; and should stand as much aloof
from Temptation as ever. And therefore
whatever debauches our Appetites, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heats
our Affections, and, as our Author

            <p>The <hi>Surveyor</hi> is now going to take off
the Censure of the Fathers from the Stage.
And here he begins with St. <hi>Augustine,</hi>
who (says he) <hi>absolves their Comedies and
Tragedies from any fault in the Expression,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 22.</note>
               <hi>and accuses only the subject Matter.</hi>

            <p>To this I Answer;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That St. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s Charge against

comprehended Comedy amongst the rest
of their Performances; as appears by his
Instance in <hi>Roscius;</hi> but these Testimonies
were too troublesome for the <hi>Surveyor</hi> to
take notice of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> even in this place,
blames Comedies and Tragedies for being
very foul and faulty in their <hi>Fable</hi> and
Matter,<note n="*" place="margin">Multa rerum turpitudine.</note> and by consequence could not
think them proper for Christian Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> St. <hi>Augustine</hi> does not say that

which qualifies the Proposition, and makes

            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:54372:5"/>
But these Words, <hi>Sicut alia multa,</hi> which
change the Sence, and make clearly against
him, he is pleased to omit in the <hi>English,</hi>
tho they stand staring in the Margin, and
are part of his own Quotation. To fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sifie
thus in the face of Conviction, is like
Stealing before the <hi>Bench:</hi> But thus he is
pleased to detect himself, and to give us a
noble Discovery of his Honesty and Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
at his first setting out. However
he would do well not to rely too much
upon an <hi>English</hi> Reader for the future.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman advances to the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
cited by the <hi>View, &amp;c.</hi> And here he is
pleased to skip quite over the Councils, and
takes no notice of above half the Fathers,
and those he has the Courage to undertake,
he does but touch at. And thus he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes
a Book at the rate that Mice do,
only by nibbling a little at a few of the
Leaves. However I must attend him in
his Method. Let us therefore consider that
little he can afford us from <hi>Clemens Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus;</hi>
where this Father affirms, That
<hi>the Circus and Theatre may not improperly be
called the Chair of Pestilence.</hi> Here the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor
would know, <hi>whence it appears that
the Dramatick Exercises are here aimed at?</hi>
Were the <hi>Mimi</hi> and <hi>Pantomimi</hi> less <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
with the Stage?</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 24.</note> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In answer to these Questions the Reader
may please to understand, that the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor
makes great use of the Distinction
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54372:6"/>
between the <hi>Drama,</hi> (as he calls it) and
the <hi>Mimi;</hi> by this means he hopes to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
the Controversy, and divert the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the Fathers, as if in their Opinion
Comedy and Tragedy were inoffensive Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions;
but I shall endeavour to make
this Evasion unserviceable to him, by
shewing,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That several of the Fathers, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the <hi>View, &amp;c.</hi> censure Tragedy and
Comedy by name. Nay, thus much the
<hi>Surveyor</hi> himself confesses, that <hi>Tragedy and
Comedy is sometimes condemned for Company.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note>
Now if <hi>Comedy</hi> is jointly condemned with
the <hi>other Shews</hi> of the <hi>Theatre,</hi> why does
he endeavour to make the Fathers justifie
or overlook it? Why so much pains to
take off their Censure, and point the Satyr
another way? What needs all this rattling
with <hi>Mimes, Pantomimes,</hi> and <hi>Drama,</hi> as if
there was some Charm and Mystick Power
in the Words? If the Fathers condemn
Comedy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> expresly, 'tis to no purpose
to contest their Sence, and pretend their
Opinion undeclared. He must own there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Ancients</hi> are full against him in
the Point. And since Comedy and Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is thus expresly condemned by the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
we have reason to believe it always
comprehended under their general Censure
of the <hi>Stage.</hi> Which will appear farther
if we consider.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:54372:6"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That Comedy and Tragedy were
the principal and most frequent Diversions
on the Stage.</p>
            <p>That they were the principal, I suppose
the <hi>Surveyor</hi> will allow, upon the account
of the <hi>Fable,</hi> and the Advantage of the
Plot and <hi>Characters:</hi> The <hi>Mimi</hi> being form'd
upon little Subjects, and Vulgar Persons<note n="*" place="margin">Lilius Gyral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus de Poet. Hist. Dial. 6.</note>.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Comedy, &amp;c.</hi> were the most frequent
Diversions of the Stage, I prove thus;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Because the <hi>Mimi,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Diomedes libr. 3. in Fragm. Sueton. primis temporibus ut asserit Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillus, Omnia quaein scenaver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentur in C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Stage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were Originally part of Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
as we may learn from <hi>Suetonius;</hi> and
so in all likelihood they continued a great
while.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Poets who wrote the <hi>Mimi</hi>
or <hi>Farces</hi> were very few, scarcely One to
Ten of the other Dramatists, as appears
from <hi>Athenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Lilius Gyraldus.</hi> Now,
why were the Comick and Tragick Poets
thus over-proportioned to the <hi>Mimographi,</hi>
but because their Entertainments were much
more frequented and esteemed than the
other?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It does not appear that the <hi>Mimi</hi>
were always more Scandalous Compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
than Comedy. 'Tis true we have little
of this kind of Writing remaining; But
by those Fragments preserv'd by <hi>Macrobius,</hi>
and cited by <hi>Lilius Gyraldus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Macrob. Lib. 2<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54372:7"/>
for his Probity and his Wit, but does not
in the least tax him with any Indecency.
Besides, <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his Chapter <hi>De Salta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione,</hi>
informs us, That the Dances proper
to the <hi>Mimi</hi> were Apish and Fantastical;
but that several belonging to Comedy had
a Wanton and Licentious Movement.<note place="margin">S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>alig. Poet. Lib. 1. cap. 18. <hi>p.</hi> 61, 64.</note> So
that of the Two, one would think these
Farces were sometimes the more inoffensive
Performances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> 'Tis certain that the <hi>Mimes</hi> and
<hi>Pantomimes</hi> Represented Comedy and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy
in their Gestures, and Dances, as well
as they did the <hi>Mimi</hi> or <hi>Farces</hi> properly so
call'd. That the <hi>Pantomimes</hi> were concern'd
in the <hi>Drama,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Macrob. Saturn. Lib. 2. cap. 10.</note> is plain from <hi>Cassiodorus, &amp;c.</hi>
who tells us, That they could form
their Gestures into such a significancy,
that with the same Limbs and Features
they could Act either <hi>Hercules,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gyraldus, <hi>p.</hi> 690. de Dial. 6.</note> or <hi>Venus;</hi>
and make the Passions and Character of
of a King, or a Common Soldier, visible
in their Postures, and Motions. Now
Kings and Heroes, we know, were only
counted proper for Tragedy.</p>
            <p>Indeed these sort of Actors were nothing
but <hi>Mimicks,</hi> (tho much farther improv'd
than the Moderns) and therefore as proper
to appear in the <hi>Drama</hi> as in any other
Stage-Performance. From whence it will
follow, that if these <hi>Pantomimi's</hi> were foul
in their Gestures, the <hi>Drama</hi> must answer
to the Indictment; It being oftentimes
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54372:7"/>
only the Business of these <hi>Mimicks</hi> to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the place of the Dialogue, and express
the Passions of the Poem.</p>
            <p>And thus I have plainly prov'd, that
when the Fathers pass Sentence against the
<hi>Stage,</hi> the whole Mystery and Fraternity is
included, so that his Distinction between
the <hi>Drama,</hi> and the <hi>Mimi</hi> and <hi>Pantomimi,</hi>
will do him no service. And this may
serve to make good not only the Testimony
of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> but of the rest of
the Fathers, all his Objections against the
Strength of their Evidence turning mostly
upon this Supposition. But because he
ventures to attack but Two Citations more,
a little farther Consideration of him will
be no great matter.</p>
            <p>I observ'd from <hi>Theophilus Antiochenus,</hi> that
the <hi>Christians durst not see the Heathen Shews up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the account of their Indecency and Profaneness,</hi>
and particularly that <hi>the Stage-Adulteries of
the Gods and Hero's were unwarrantable Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments,</hi>
&amp;c. Here he is positive that the

               <hi>that Tragedy &amp; Comedy
were unconcern'd and nothing but the</hi> Mimi <hi>aim'd

            <p>I must not forget the <hi>Surveyor</hi>'s Sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
That the <hi>Idolatry of the Stage</hi> was the
principal Quarrel the Fathers had against
it.<note place="margin">P. 13.</note> 'Twas for this Reason that they <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd
against it with all their Nerves and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54372:9"/>
Vehemence,</hi> as our Author words it. The
Reader may please to take notice,<note place="margin">See <hi>View,</hi> &amp;c. Chap. 6. <hi>Defence,</hi> &amp;c. p. 84.</note> that
the Fathers had other Reasons for their
Aversion to the Stage, besides the Charge
of Idolatry: However, upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
I shall pursue the Argument a little
farther, and answer, First, That the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were no less Enemies to Immorality
than to False Worship. Indeed, one great
Reason why <hi>Paganism</hi> was so very Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal,
was, because 'twas not only an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous,
but a scandalous Belief: 'Twas
because the Holy Solemnities were Lewd,
and not only mis-led Men's Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
but debauch'd their Practice. Now
nothing in Nature is so counter to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
as Wickedness. Idolatry may
sometimes be an effect of Ignorance; but
Immorality lies always open to Conscience
and inward Reproof. So that where Vice
is cherish'd, and Licentiousness is made
creditable, there the worst Part of Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism
is kept up. The Devil is no less real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Worshipp'd in Lewdness and Obscenity
than he was in <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Iupiter.</hi> And yet
the <hi>Surveyor</hi> has the Courage to affirm,
That <hi>Idolatry is more abhorr'd and expos'd
on the English Stage than any where else. Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi>
expos'd! What, by burlesking the
Bible, by Smut and Swearing, and by hoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as much as in them lies, all Religion
out of the Universe? A most admirable
Expedient! Thus Error is cur'd by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:54372:9"/>
and false Religion destroy'd, by
leaving no Truth to counterfeit!</p>
            <p>The <hi>Surveyor</hi> observes, That the <hi>Fathers
were alarm'd</hi> at the Heathen Stage as at the
Approach of an Enemy; they were afraid
the indulging these Liberties would hazard
the Interest and Belief of Christianity:
<hi>They justly apprehended,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 18.</note> 
               <hi>that from a Liking of
the Entertainments, they might proceed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the Occasion of them.</hi> Now those who
frequent the Theatres, would do well to
consider this Caution: For from liking the
<hi>Plays,</hi> they may come to like the <hi>Practice,</hi>
and slide insensibly from the Diversion to
the Vice and Profaneness. I wish this
Reasoning were not too well grounded
upon Experiment; but nothing is more
natural than the Transition from Pleasure
to Imitation. And thus the Fathers Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
holds strong against the <hi>English</hi>
Theatre. For Lewdness is more catching
than Heathenism; and People are much
sooner surpriz'd by their Appetites, than
by their Ignorance. 'Twas this Indulgence
to Sensuality which captivated the World,<note place="margin">P. 10.</note>
and gain'd Credit and Authority to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganism.
Thus Vice gives the main Force
to the Temptation, makes way for Error,
and by corrupting the Will betrays the
Understanding. And this may serve to
satisfie the <hi>Reader,</hi> that his Topick of
Idolatry is nothing to the purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:54372:10"/>
Upon the whole; Let us suppose, which
is not true, That the Fathers left <hi>Comedy</hi>
and <hi>Tragedy</hi> uncensur'd, and planted their
Rhetorick against nothing but the <hi>Shews</hi> of
the <hi>Mimi;</hi> let us resign our Advantage,
and set part of our Evidence aside; What
would the <hi>Surveyor</hi> gain by it? Alas! un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he can clear the Innocence, and take
off the Imputations upon the <hi>English</hi> Stage;
which he never so much as attempts: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
this can be done, his Cavils and his
Confidence, and all his other Pretences
signifie nothing. For, can we imagine the
Fathers would ever have endur'd the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
of the Modern Stage? Would these
Holy Men have allow'd them their <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Places</hi> of Smut, and their Sallies of
Profaneness? Would they have seen
Lewdness a Profession, and Religion made
sport with, and said nothing against it?
No: Such flaming Provocations as these
would have kindled their Spirits, and
pressed them to the Encounter: Their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr
would have thundred, and their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
been play'd against the Enemy;
and the Warnings of the Pulpit would have
sounded as loud as the Blasphemies of the
Play-house: Where the Honour of God
and the Interests of Eternity suffered so
much, they would have shewn a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
Concern. For like the Hero's in

What strains of Contempt and Distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
are here! Is this all that's due to
the Memory of these Venerable Men? And
must Dignity and Merit be thus coarsly
Treated? Must Dogs and Martyrs be cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled,
and Patriarchs describ'd by Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
from the <hi>Kennel?</hi> These great <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders</hi>
of the <hi>Faith</hi> were never saluted in
this manner before: Jews and Heathens,
tho they might have had no less Malice,
had (as far as it appears) more Modesty
than this comes to. One would think he
learned this Language at the <hi>Olympicks</hi> (as
he calls them) of <hi>Moor-Fields,</hi> or rather
at the Great House that fronts them.
If the <hi>Fathers</hi> are thus despicable, why
does he sollicit for their Votes, and strive
to bring them over to his Party? If he
takes them for his Friends, he uses them
very severely; But I suppose he despairs
of their Favour, and would therefore dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
their Credit. Well; since the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are thus unmanageable, and won't be
tamper'd with, 'tis time to leave them:
If the <hi>Christians</hi> won't do, we must try if
the <hi>Heathens</hi> will prove any kinder. The
<hi>Surveyor</hi> therefore applying to the <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi>
endeavours to bribe them into Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and bring them to a State of Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality.
But here he is much as untoward
in his Objections as formerly.<note place="margin">P. 34.</note> He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<hi>Plato does not appear in his own Person:</hi>
Granting that, <hi>Eusebius</hi> is a good Voucher
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54372:11"/>
for his Opinion.<note place="margin">View, <hi>p.</hi> 354.</note> But after all, <hi>Plato</hi> does
appear in his own Person, and stands fairly
quoted in the Margin. Truly I think I'm
somewhat to blame for troubling my self
with an Author so very Defective either in
Eyes or Honesty. But it seems the Testimony
is not full to the Purpose. Why so? let's
hear it. <hi>Plays</hi> (says <hi>Plato) raise the Passions,
and pervert the Vse of them, and by consequence
are dangerous to Morality.</hi> This I take it is to
the Point; the Impeachment runs high,
and the Articles are plainly mention'd. So
that to evade the Force of the Authority, by
saying <hi>the Nature or Measure of the Danger is
not specified,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Surv. <hi>p.</hi> 35.</note> is not to Argue, but Trifle, and
is in effect to make Blots instead of Letters
with a Man's Ink. My Business in the <hi>View,
&amp;c.</hi> was to sum up the Evidence in few
Words, and not to tire the Reader with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary
Lengths of Quotation: However,
since he calls for't, I'll give it him somewhat
more particularly. 'Tis <hi>Plato</hi>'s Opinion then,
that <hi>the Diversions of the Stage are dangerous to
Temper and Sobriety;</hi>

ground, and Reason grows precarious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Plato</hi> we must go to <hi>Xenophon:</hi> And

               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:54372:12"/>
And does he not shew the Danger of
such a Permission? And is this nothing to
the <hi>English Stage,</hi> where Love and Indecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
are most of the Entertainment? This
Remark not only reaches the <hi>Modern,</hi> but
likewise the <hi>Ancient Dramatists,</hi> as far as
their Compositions were any way licentious.
At last the <hi>Surveyor</hi> owns, That <hi>Bawdry was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
forbidden to be talk'd to young People in</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,
<hi>because of the Heat of the Climate.</hi> Meaning,
that in the <hi>Latitude</hi> of <hi>London</hi> the case is
otherwise: The Elevation of the <hi>Pole</hi> has
taken off the Restraint, and made Modesty
unnecessary: For in these Northern Regions,
and especially in a hard Winter, Smut is a
very harmless Diversion, and a Man may
talk as Brutishly as he pleases!</p>
            <p>He is now advanced to <hi>Aristotle, whose

good Answer to all that he offers in earnest,
yet possibly he may take it ill, if his Story

this it may be answered,</p>

               <hi>First, Aristotle</hi> plainly forbids young People

be very much to blame, without being the
worst of their Kind? Here's room enough
then for <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Reprimand of <hi>Plautus</hi> and
<hi>Terence,</hi> without doing the <hi>View</hi> the least dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>service.
But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Plautus</hi> and <hi>Terence</hi> are not the
<hi>only Poets from whom we can take any measure
of the</hi> Roman <hi>Comedy about</hi> Cicero'<hi>s time:</hi> For
in this very place <hi>Tully</hi> cites several Verses
from <hi>Trabea</hi> and <hi>Caecilius;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tusc. Quaest. <hi>lib.</hi> 4.</note> and blames these
Comick Poets for magnifying Love-Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
making <hi>Cupid</hi> a God, and flourishing
too much upon the Satisfactions of Sense;
tho' nothing of this was done with the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Grosness. This Passage being in the
same place with that quoted by the <hi>Surveyor,</hi>
he must needs see it: From whence the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
may observe how nicely he keeps up to
his usual Exactness. Farther, <hi>Tully</hi> does not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
complain of Comedy, but of Tragedies too.<note place="margin">Tusc. Quaest. <hi>lib.</hi> 2.</note>
He blames them for <hi>representing their Hero's
impatient under Misfortune; such Instances of
Weakness and Discomposure were,</hi> in his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<hi>of dangerous Example: So that let but the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54372:14"/>
Stage</hi> (says he) <hi>strike in with the Prejudices of
Education, and this is enough to baffle the Force
of Virtue, and cut the very Sinews of Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Surveyor,</hi> at the Head of his Remarks
upon this Testimony, brightens his Air, and
would seem to look kindly upon Modesty:
But this Smile,<note place="margin">Surv. <hi>p.</hi> 39.</note> tho' unusual, appears angry
and disturb'd. <hi>He supposes no one will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
licentious Plays; but if some warm-headed
Enthusiastick Zealot pretends to find some Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
really guilty, they are willing to give them
up.</hi> This is the only Passage in his Book, as
I remember, in which he drops the least
Word against Lewdness: But then he touches
the Point very tenderly, clogs the Censure
with a great many kind Proviso's,<note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note> and is
strangely out of Humour with those <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick
Zealots</hi> that make any Discovery.
And to make all sure,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> he lays in for <hi>Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and Encouragement to the prevailing Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the main Part of the Performance.</hi> For
Example, if an Apothecary mixes up Poison
with a Receipt, yet if it does not weigh as
much in the Scale as the rest of the Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients,
all is well enough, and the <hi>prevailing
Merit</hi> of the Dose, tho' it murthers the Patient,
ought to be <hi>encourag'd.</hi>

               <hi>Livy</hi>'s Authority comes after <hi>Tully,</hi> and
must be considered.<note place="margin">Survey, <hi>p.</hi> 44.</note> This <hi>Evidence,</hi> says the
<hi>Surveyor,</hi> comes <hi>not near our Case,</hi> were the
Credit on't unexceptionable. His Reason is
because <hi>Livy speaks of Stage Representations<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

general, but the</hi> Drama <hi>was not known amongst
the</hi> Romans <hi>at this time when the</hi> Ludi Scenici
<hi>were invented.</hi> I'le try to make an Argument
like this. For Instance: The City built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Seven Hills, and upon the <hi>Tyber,</hi> was by
no means <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Tarquinius
Priscus;</hi> Why so? Why, because tho it
stood upon the same Ground, it was not near
so big as 'twas afterwards in the Reign of
<hi>Augustus.</hi> But for all this fine Reasoning,
<hi>esse</hi> and <hi>bene esse</hi> are Notions of the same Subject.
'Tis true, things are not always perfected at
their first Invention; but I thought the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
and Improvement they might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
receive, would not alter them in their
Name and Nature. And as to the Business
in hand, I have already shewn, that <hi>Comedy</hi>
and <hi>Dancing,</hi> and all the Diversions of the
<hi>Stage,</hi> were perform'd together at first: And
that the <hi>Drama</hi> and the <hi>Ludi scenici</hi> were the
same, I shall take for granted at present, and
afterwards prove it by the <hi>Surveyor's</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and by St. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s too, who men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
the Original of <hi>Plays,</hi> explains him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
expresly in <hi>Comedy,</hi> and <hi>Tragedy. De
Civit. Dei Lib. 2. cap.</hi> 8. His next Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
is to Quarrel with the <hi>Translation:</hi> To
clear this the Historian must be cited. Now
<hi>Livy</hi> giving an Account of the Original of
<hi>Plays,</hi> assigns this Reason for the Relation;<note place="margin">Dec. 1. Lib. 7.</note>
               <hi>Vt appareat quam ab sano initio res in hanc vix
opulentis regnis toler abilem insaniam venerit.</hi> He
affirms the Original of Plays were commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54372:15"/>
because they were brought in upon
the score of Religion; and to remove a
Mortality. This being thus reported by <hi>Livy,</hi>
I Translated the Passage above-mentioned as
follows;<note place="margin">View, <hi>p.</hi> 235.</note> 
               <hi>That the Motives are sometimes good,
when the Means are stark naught.</hi> And where's
the Mistake of this rendring? Don't the
Words of the Author, and the Consequence
of the Practice, plainly justifie the Constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?
Nay, his own Interpretation makes
his Objection unreasonable. For he Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slates
<hi>Vix tolerabilem insaniam, &amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Survey, <hi>p.</hi> 45, 46.</note> An <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
extravagance which scarce the We<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Nation can bear.</hi> Now if the <hi>Profusion at these
Shews</hi> were ready to break the Back of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire, had not I reason for saying
in the Version, <hi>That the Means were stank
naught, and the Remedy worse than the Disease?</hi>
But this puts me in mind of another Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to be adjusted. The <hi>Surveyor</hi> contends,
That <hi>Livy</hi> in this place <hi>does not condemn the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality,
but the Luxury, and Profu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>sion at these
Shews.</hi> The <hi>Luxury</hi> of these Diversions, if
it must be call'd so, I suppose consists in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-pleasing
a Vitious Palate; But let that
pass. The <hi>Surveyor</hi> supports his Conjecture
from the Citations adding, That this <hi>Iusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
or Disorder, <hi>was greater than the We<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </note> 
               <hi>could well bear.</hi> Now says the <hi>Surveyor,
Wealthy People have as much need of M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>y
as the Poor.</hi> No doubt on't; and are in more
danger too of miscarrying in that Matter.
For, as my Adversary has observed, a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54372:16"/>
is too apt to <hi>grow Wealthy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Survey, <hi>p.</hi> 12.</note> and <hi>Wanton</hi>
together: This made <hi>Sal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>st</hi> complain, <hi>That
the Riches of the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire occasioned the
Decay of Discipline, and the Dissolution of
Manners.</hi> Without Care, People's Virtue, I
mean their Sobriety, is apt to sink with the
Rise of their Fortunes; Their Appetites for
Liberty are more awaken'd by Opportunity
and Temptation: They have more Money
to purchase their Pleasures, and more Leisure
to enjoy them. And besides, such Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
are farther within the danger of Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
and ill Example; 'Tis no wonder
therefore to hear <hi>Livy</hi> affirm, That a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
almost overgrown with Wealth and
Power, should be in greater danger of Play-house
Infection, then when they were Poor,
and more slenderly establish'd: For then their
Necessities were some Security; They could
not go to the Expence of Vice, nor had so
much time to be Debauch'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That <hi>Livy</hi> by <hi>this Distraction,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Insania.</note> meant Licentiousness, will appear by his
Censure of the <hi>Stage</hi> in another place, which
we shall come to by and by.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Surveyor</hi> rages mightily about my
Mistranslating the following part of the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
which runs thus:<note place="margin">Cum piaculo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum magis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitio animos, quam corpora morbi infice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</note> 
               <hi>The Remedy in this
case is worse than the Disease, and the Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
more infectious than the Plague.</hi> Here I
confess my Edition mislead me, which, (as
I remember, for I have lost the Book) has
<hi>inficerent,</hi> instead of <hi>afficerent,</hi> tho I must
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54372:16"/>
own this latter Reading appears the best.
But notwithstanding this accident the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor</hi>
shall be no loser, for <hi>Livy</hi> shall make
it up to him another way. And not to defer
his Satisfaction, this Historian informs us,
<hi>That when a Theatre was building by the Censors
Direction,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Quum locatum Ã  Censoribus Theatrum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trueretur, <hi>p.</hi> Cornelio Nasica auctore tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam inutile, &amp; nociturum publicis mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, ex Senatus consulto destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum est. <hi>Liv.

               </note> Scipio Nasica <hi>spoke against it in the</hi>

and got an</hi> Act <hi>for the pulling it down.</hi>
Here <hi>Livy</hi> not only pulls down the <hi>Play-house,</hi>
but gives such a Reason for the doing
it, that one would think should have kept it
in Rubbish ever after. And if he questions
the Authority of <hi>Livy</hi>'s <hi>Epitome, Sigomus,</hi> not
to mention <hi>Vossius,</hi> may satisfie him; who
delivers his Opinion in these Words; <hi>Nam

            <p>We must now proceed to the Testimony
of <hi>Valerius Maximus;</hi> And here the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor</hi>
will make sufficient Amends for being
somewhat in the Right before. This Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
he affirms relates to the <hi>Arena,</hi>
and concerns none but the <hi>Gladiators</hi> and
<hi>Caestiarii:</hi> And then very liberally again
quotes his own Confutation in the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin;</hi>

In earnest does this Critick not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the difference between <hi>Theatres,</hi> and
<hi>Amphitheatres,</hi> and that the first were for
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54372:17"/>
               <hi>Plays,</hi> and the latter for <hi>Prizes?</hi> A little
School-Learning would have set him right in
this Matter, and likewise prevented the
Misfortune of making <hi>Scenica portenta</hi> signifie
<hi>Gladiators;</hi> which I think has more of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy
in the <hi>Translation,</hi> than in the Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology
and Story. And now I suppose it
may be pretty plain, that either the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor</hi>
does not understand <hi>Latin,</hi> or is not
fit to be trusted with it. Farther, the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor</hi>'s
Mistakes are the more unpardonable,
because <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> spends almost this
whole Chapter in describing the Rise and
Progress of <hi>Plays,</hi> the Buildings and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corations
of the <hi>Theatre,</hi> together with the
Checks they received from the Government.

keeping up to their ancient Customs.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Prisci moris, observatia. <hi>Val. Max. L. 2. cap.</hi> 6.</note> Now we
are to observe, that the <hi>Massilienses</hi> were a
Colony of the <hi>Phocenses</hi> in <hi>Ionia,</hi> who not
being willing to submit to the <hi>Persian</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
quitted that Country, and settled
in <hi>Gaul.</hi> Now this Removal was in the
Reign of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> in the very Infancy of the
Stage, when there was nothing but some
rude beginnings of Tragedy at <hi>Athens;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lilius Gyraeld. de poet. Hist. Dial. 6.</note> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
the <hi>Massilienses</hi> came from <hi>Phocis,</hi> where
neither <hi>Aristotle</hi> or <hi>Lilius Gyraldus</hi> mention
any thing of the settling or Invention of
the <hi>Drama:</hi> By consequence, if the <hi>Massi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienses</hi>
were so tenacious of their Original
Customs, they could have no such thing as
Tragedy and Comedy among them; These
Entertainments being, as far as it appears,
posterior to the forming of their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
This will appear farther, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that, as <hi>Suetonius</hi> observes, the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the <hi>Mimicks</hi> was Originally part of
Comedy<note n="*" place="margin">Vid. supra.</note>; so that let us suppose, which we
can't grant, that the <hi>Drama</hi> was as ancient
as the Government of the <hi>Massilienses,</hi> and
in use among them, yet we can't with any
colour suppose, that the <hi>Mimi</hi> were distinct
from <hi>Comedy</hi> at that time of day; so that if
the <hi>Massilienses</hi> were such Admirers of the
first Plan of their Government, and stood
off so nicely from all Innovation, they must
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54372:18"/>
exclude the <hi>Drama</hi> as well as the <hi>Mimi,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
the Form of their Stage would be
changed, and their Customs receive an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>

why the Inhabitants of <hi>Marseilles</hi> refused to

               <hi>It was because the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

            <p>3. The introductive Clause which leads
to this Discountenance, points it clearly on
the <hi>Drama. The</hi> Massilienses (says the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor)
<hi>were extreamly strict and severe in their
Government and Administration</hi>

               </note>. Now by
the <hi>Surveyor's</hi> Account of the <hi>Mimes</hi> and

them. For they, says he,<note place="margin">Surveyor, <hi>p.</hi> 24.</note> Danced Naked,
and were in their Gestures foul to the last
Degree of Scandal. I would gladly know,
what Instance of Severity it could be to
deny Admission to such Monsters as these?
Is it indeed an Argument of extraordinary
Rigour not to allow the grossest Liberties,
and which had often been marked and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
at <hi>Rome?</hi> A Government can't be
said to be remarkably Rigid, unless they tie
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54372:19"/>
up their Subjects to particular Restraints, and
bar them the Freedoms commonly practised
elsewhere. The <hi>Massilienses</hi> therefore having
this Character of Severity, it must be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they would not admit of the more
inoffensive Performances of the Stage; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they refused the Diversions of Comedy
and Tragedy, which were then generally
permitted in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Mimus,</hi> the Word which the <hi>Surveyor</hi>

               <hi>The</hi> Massilienses, (says he) <hi>cleared their
Country of</hi> Comedy, <hi>and all sorts of</hi> Stage-Plays.
This they did because they looked
upon them as the Nurseries of Lewdness.
And <hi>Suetonius</hi> tells us, That <hi>Augustus</hi> being
at the point of Death, ask'd some of his
Friends, <hi>Ecquid iis videretur mimum vitae com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode
transegisse.</hi> Now I would ask the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor</hi>
what he thinks of this Matter? Did
the Emperor enquire whether he had been a
good <hi>Pantomime</hi> in his Life? Whether he
had acted like a finish'd Debauchee, and been
Lewd without Shame or Measure? Did <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi>
affect such a Character as this, or think
his Memory would be obliged by it? Such
a Supposition would be a Libel upon <hi>Nero,</hi>
who when he came to dye had the Justice to
be displeased with his own Lewdness.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:54372:19"/>
The meaning therefore of this Question
of <hi>Augustus</hi> must be, Whether he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved
himself well in his Station, and acted
his Part handsomly, as a good <hi>Player</hi> does
upon the <hi>Stage;</hi> From whence it will follow,
that <hi>Mimus</hi> must be taken for a <hi>Play</hi> in its
usual signification. But 'tis time to dismiss
<hi>Valerius Maximus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Surveyor, <hi>p.</hi> 50.</note> and pass on to <hi>Seneca,</hi> who
it seems <hi>has but little to say to the Matter.</hi> He
should have said, he has but little to say to
<hi>Seneca:</hi>
               <note place="margin">View, &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 236.</note> However, let the <hi>View, &amp;c.</hi> decide
that Question. Well! if <hi>Seneca</hi> says but
little, he is resolved to fortifie his Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and help him out. For he frankly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses,
<hi>That the</hi> Roman <hi>youth were generally cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by the Countenance which</hi> Nero <hi>gave to
the Stage, and to all those Arts which gratified
and indulged the Senses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Surveyor, <hi>p.</hi> 50, 51.</note> 
               <hi>and that this Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher's
Complaint was not unreasonable.</hi> Truly I
think so too, or else I had never cited him.
In this place the <hi>Surveyor</hi> is somewhat kinder
than ordinary, for here he not only quotes,

<hi>Text</hi> and <hi>Margin</hi> to make my best of. This
Knack of Writing and Recanting at the same
time, is a good subtle Expedient: For if
ever he should be questioned for publishing a

substantial Proof he has confuted himself,<note place="margin">Survey, <hi>p.</hi> 51.</note> and
that it's to be hoped may stop the Prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I must confess I like an Author that

               <note n="*" place="margin">Spectaculum, <hi>p.</hi> 52.</note> is <hi>general.</hi>
Why then they are all comprehended:
Then he may be sure the most remarkable
<hi>Shews,</hi> such as the <hi>Stage,</hi> are concerned in the
Caution; especially since the Author has else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
expressly declaim'd against <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

I perceive all this Skirmishing has nothing

to come to the Assault in good earnest,
and enter upon the <hi>Breach</hi> of the Quotation,
for there, if you will believe him, I have <hi>made
a shift to steal in Two Falsifications.</hi> Now to try
this Cause, and discover the foul Play, we must
read the <hi>Deed</hi> in the Court. The Original runs
thus. <hi>Tunc enim per voluptatem vitia facilius surre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punt.</hi>
The Translation thus: <hi>For there Vice makes

of Pleasure.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">View, <hi>p.</hi> 236.</note> And where is the harm
of all this? Harm! Why I have corrupted

The <hi>Then,</hi> the Circumstance of Time
was the Bugbear; All the infection lay in
the Clock, or the Sun-Dial: For People may
see what <hi>Shews,</hi> and go to what <hi>Place</hi> they

do it at no <hi>Time;</hi> This is exactly the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor</hi>'s
Reasoning; and thus he proves the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54372:20"/>
Indictment.<note place="margin">Surveyor, <hi>p.</hi> 53.</note> The next <hi>Falsification</hi> is my

<hi>renders</hi> them otherwise, I'm satisfied he'l do
it worse. Indeed I think these Objections
are not made <hi>in the Disguise</hi> of Sence. To
conclude, if I was so unfair as to <hi>steal in Two
Falsifications,</hi> I had, it seems the Discretion
to steal them out again; for 'tis plain, there's
none of them to be found at present.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> appear next, and are
given up by him. But then he is never at
a loss, for when he can't Reason he can
Rail, and so the Book goes on as well as
ever.</p>
            <p>I produced <hi>Ovid</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> to shew
that the <hi>Audience</hi> at the Play-house was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
as well as the Entertainment:<note place="margin">Surv. <hi>p.</hi> 55.</note> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this the <hi>Surveyor</hi> insinuates, That if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Solitude and Retirement will se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
us, we must not go to Church; for
there is mixt Company, and bad Designs
too sometimes. Under favour, this does not
follow. To go to Church is our Duty: Now
a Man's Business, and especially when Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
is his Guard: And God will let no
Body miscarry for their Obedience. Besides,
the Quality of the Employment, the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the Place, and the Majesty of the
Presence, is apt to furnish good Thoughts,
and check those which are otherwise.</p>
            <p>But at the <hi>Play-house</hi> the Case is quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent:
This is a Place where Thinking is
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54372:21"/>
out of Doors, and Seriousness Impertinent,
Here our Reason is apt to be surpriz'd, and
our Caution disarm'd; Here Vice stands upon
Prescription, and Lewdness claims Privilege
to Solicit. Nay, the very Parade, the Gaiety,
and Pleasure of the Company, is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
its danger: These Circumstances height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with Luscious Dialogue, lively Action,
and airy Musick, are very likely to make an
unserviceable Impression. And thus we see
our standing is but slippery, and the Tide
runs high against <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood:</hi> And as
for the Protection of Heaven to bring us off,
'tis Presumption to expect it. If we will sit
in the <hi>Seat</hi> of the <hi>Scornfull,</hi> and make Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
our Diversion, Providence we may be

               </gap>ll withdraw, and leave us to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of another <hi>Influence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To do the <hi>Surveyer</hi> Right, he is somewhat
of my Opinion in this Matter. He <hi>won't de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
but a promiscuous conflux of People of all
Ages,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Survey,</hi> p. 55, 56.</note> 
               <hi>Sexes, and Conditions, will make the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
of Intrigue go forward, and facilitate En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes
of this Nature.</hi> But he is afraid, if
a <hi>Restraint</hi> were laid upon People, and they
were kept out of Harms way,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> it would be
worse with them: And for the truth of this
Conjecture, he appeals to the Experiment of
<hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> where he observes there is
a great deal of Care, and yet a great deal of
Miscarriage. It may be so; but if they are
bad under Caution, 'tis to be feared Liberty
would never mend them. His reasoning about
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54372:21"/>
the <hi>Imagination</hi> being <hi>vitiated (p.</hi> 56.) for
want of Freedom is very slender, for Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
makes a Thief; The Temptation rises
upon sight, for Sence is stronger than Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
and Life, than Painting. If the
strength of the Stream forces the Bank to
give way, the making the Breach wider, is
not, I suppose, the proper Method to stop
the Torrent. He had best perswade the
<hi>Dutch</hi> to pull up their Dikes and their Dams;
because in several Countreys where the Sea
is left to its Course, it does no manner of
damage. I confess I never heard that the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> were all Fools till now:
But it seems so 'tis with them: For they are
still perfect Strangers to themselves, and know
nothing of the Temper of their People, after
so many Ages for Information. But of all
Men, the <hi>Surveyor</hi> should not have been se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
upon the Reservedness of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Surveyor,</hi> p. 35.</note>
because he had allowed it in the <hi>Persians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
His Reason was, because the <hi>Heat of
the Climate, and the Warmth of their Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
hurried them very precipitiously</hi> (as he Phrases
it) <hi>into Irregularities.</hi> Now <hi>Spain</hi> is as hot as
<hi>Persia;</hi> Why then all this Partiality? That
that's Sawce for a Goose is Sawce for a
Gander. Why must the Poor <hi>Spaniard</hi> be
maul'd for his Caution, and for preventing
his Family from being <hi>hurried very precipitiously
into Irregularities?</hi>

               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:54372:22"/>
But after all, the <hi>Caffres</hi> and <hi>Soldanians,</hi> the
Monsters of <hi>Africk</hi> both in Figure and Folly,
and which, (as to some of them) whether
Men or Munkeys, has been disputed. These
<hi>Aequinoctial</hi> Sages are much Wiser, it seems,
in the Guard of Virtue, than the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
and <hi>Italians!</hi> For <hi>in many places under the Line,
where the People go constantly naked, the familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Objects takes away all Wantonness of
Imagination,</hi>

<hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> be reformed by <hi>Africk,</hi> and

Must People go <hi>naked</hi> to secure their Modesty?
These are wonderful Discoveries, and one
would almost conclude by the drift of them,
that the Man had a fancy to turn either
<hi>Adamite</hi> or <hi>Pantomime.</hi> These <hi>Artificial Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties</hi>
of Cloaths spoil all: They disserve
the Interest of Virtue, and are an Impolitick
Contrivance. This fine Phrase puts me in
mind of his Quareling a Sentence of mine
for want, as he pretends, of Syntax and
Grammer: And therefore upon this occasion
I must tell him, That if the Charge was true,
Sence without Grammar, is somewhat better
then Grammer without Sence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ovid,</hi> by the <hi>Surveyor's</hi> Confession, <hi>pleads
guilty,</hi>

But then he fences against the Testimony
with his usual evasion, and turns it all upon
the <hi>Representation of the</hi> Mimi:<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> but the next
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54372:22"/>
Verse to that, in his <hi>Margin,</hi> will be sufficient

               <hi>I have,</hi> says he, <hi>at length run

They would not suffer the Sobriety of their
Discipline, and the Gravity of their Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
to be affronted so much as in jest.
Yes, the <hi>Surveyor</hi> grants they <hi>were afraid the
Luxury of the</hi> Drama, <hi>as 'twas practised at</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
<hi>might soften their Youth,</hi> and enervate
their Minds:<note place="margin">

to be afraid of inserting the Citation at
length? But the <hi>Lacedemonians were only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54372:24"/>
to preserve the Martial Spirit of their People.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Survey,</hi> p. 67.</note>
How does that appear? Were the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
only for one good Quality? Had they
no concern for the Vertues of Peace, and the
Securities of good Correspondence among
themselves? That's strange! <hi>Plutarch</hi> calls them
a <hi>Nation</hi> of <hi>Philosophers,</hi> and makes them
strict Observers of Regularity in general.
But for the <hi>Surveyor's</hi> sake, let us suppose them
<hi>Ambitious only of Military Glory:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Even this
Point could not be gained without Sobriety
of Manners. For, if we observe, we shall
find the <hi>Persians, Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Romans, &amp;c.</hi>
were always best Soldiers, when they were
best Men. Indeed they held their Empire, as
it were of Virtue and Moral Philosophy.
For when they came to Debauch, they grew
quickly good for nothing; and dwindled by
degrees from Cowardise to Servitude. Insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificancy,
to speak softly, is the Natural
Consequence of Lewdness. Dissolution de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys
both the Will and the Power to be
Serviceable. It makes Men impatient of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline,
Quarrelsom and Mutinous, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to bear the Fatigues of War. A Lewd
Soldier often fails in point of Corporal Force,
is deserted even by his Limbs, and has no
Constitution to be Brave, tho never so wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:
I mean as to Campaigning, and a Course
of War. Thus when the <hi>Stage</hi> is suffered to
Debauch a Nation, and bring Vice into Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54372:25"/>
People will be in danger of having more
Confidence than Courage. This is the way
to soften a <hi>Martial Spirit,</hi> and destroy the
Principles of Honour. And thus <hi>Military
Glory,</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> Vertue, and every thing else
that's worth the owning, must take their
Leave in a short time. This Consequence
was Wisely foreseen by the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi>
and guarded against accordingly.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Surveyor</hi> rallies once more, and tells
us, That <hi>Plutarch</hi> says indeed, <hi>that the</hi> Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
<hi>did not admit Comedy nor Tragedy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Survey,</hi> p. 66.</note> 
               <hi>but says
not a syllable of Forms, and Regulations.</hi> This
is wonderful Civil! If he grows thus good
Natured, I must Dispute with him no longer.
I beseech him, What does he think I argued
against in the <hi>View,</hi> was it not against the
Liberties of Tragedy and Comedy? If he
fancies I wrote against <hi>Punchianello,</hi> or the
<hi>Water-works,</hi> he is much mistaken. If the
<hi>Lacedemonians</hi> refused to admit Tragedy, or
Comedy upon any Condition, they refused to
admit them under any Form. To go farther
with him, His old Starting Hole is stopt, for
he can't so much as pretend, that the <hi>Mimi</hi>
would pass the Test, where the <hi>Drama</hi> was
thus discouraged. But I am almost to blame
for taking notice of these Objections.</p>
            <p>We must now take a Turn in <hi>Italy.</hi> From
hence I brought a famous Instance, how se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
the <hi>Roman</hi> Government treated the

               <hi>Stage</hi> under all its Latitude and Distinctions.

in the time of St. <hi>Augustine?</hi> Is this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Credit so low, that he can't be trusted
for a Citation? This Treatise of <hi>Tully</hi> was too
well known at that time a day to be counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited;
so that if St. <hi>Augustine</hi>
               <note place="margin">St. August de Civ. Dei Lib. 2. cap. 13.</note> was unfair in
the Citation, he wanted both common Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty,
and common Sence.<note place="margin">View, <hi>p. 240.</hi>
               </note> And after all, I
can't perceive that <hi>Tully</hi> has here deposed
more against the <hi>Play-house,</hi> than <hi>Livy</hi> did
after him, who comes next to be Examined.
This Author, to make <hi>short</hi> work of the Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
informs us,<note place="margin">Liv. Dec. 1. L. 7.</note> That the <hi>Common Players
were expelled their Tribe, and refused to serve in
Arms.</hi>
               <note place="margin">View, <hi>p. 241,</hi>
               </note> Here the <hi>Surveyor</hi> makes a miserable
Pother; Reasons backwards and forwards,
and makes Might and Main for the old Cover
of the <hi>Pantomimes:</hi> And thus by his running
upon the <hi>File,</hi> and Doubling, we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
he is almost spent. In answer to what
he offers, I shall first take notice of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions:
He grants, in the first place, that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54372:26"/>
the <hi>Romans</hi> went on the same Grounds with
the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> in discouraging the <hi>Stage.</hi>
They were afraid their <hi>Military Virtue</hi> might
suffer by it:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Surv.</hi> p. 70, 71.</note> Now of this Supposition I have
made my Advantage already.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Surv.</hi> p. 71, 74. Ibid.</note> He affirms, That <hi>the Practice of
the Stage among the</hi> Romans <hi>fell into the hands
of Slaves:</hi> From whence one would imagine
'twas pretty plain that the <hi>Romans</hi> thought
this Business was too coarse for Persons of
higher Condition. Indeed his Reason for
this Custom is very pleasant: He says <hi>this
Profession was thrown up to the Slaves,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>upon the
account of its being a polite Exercise, and too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
a Diversion for the rest of the</hi> Roman <hi>Youth.</hi>
Now I would gladly know how it comes
about, that Slaves are so much better bred
than their Masters, and <hi>Mob</hi> than Persons of
Quality? Upon the <hi>Surveyor</hi>'s State of the
Chronology, this was extreamly unlikely:
For if this hapned before the Settlement of
the <hi>Drama,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Surv.</hi> p. 73.</note> the time lies against him; for
then the <hi>Romans</hi> had not conquer'd the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite
Countries, nor made any Inroads upon
<hi>Asia</hi> or <hi>Greece.</hi> But let <hi>Acting</hi> be as Polite
as the <hi>Surveyor</hi> pleases, 'tis plain the <hi>Romans</hi>
look'd upon it as unreputable,<note place="margin">P. 74.</note> otherwise
they would never have left it <hi>wholly in the
hands of Slaves and Mercenary Foreigners.</hi>
These Concessions one would think were
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54372:26"/>
frank enough; but we shall have more of his
Liberality by and by; and in the mean
time I shall consider his Evasions.</p>
            <p>In the first place he endeavours to avoid
the Blow,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Surv.</hi> p. 72, 76.</note> by fencing with the Distinction
between the <hi>Ludi Senici</hi> and the <hi>Drama:</hi> But
this is meer Supposition and chimerical Fancy,
and directly overthrown by a Quotation of
his own from St. <hi>Augustine:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Surv.</hi> p.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

care to keep his Margin a little in Order; a
bad <hi>Memory,</hi> and a bad <hi>Cause,</hi> do very ill

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> He argues, That <hi>this Mark of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy
set upon the Histriones,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Surv.</hi> P. 73.</note> 
               <hi>can't properly stick
upon the Actors of Tragedy and Comedy as such,
that Law having been made long before the</hi> Drama
<hi>was brought to</hi> Rome. First, with his Favour,
this Mark of Disadvantage must evidently
stick upon the <hi>Actors</hi> of Tragedy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
that by his own Argument: for they,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Surv.</hi> p. 76.</note> and
only they, as himself informs us, were call'd
<hi>Histriones.</hi> He is now got off the Pin of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,
and falls down to <hi>Conjectures,</hi>
and argues like any <hi>Almanack:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Surv.</hi> P. 74.</note> He fansies
<hi>therefore the Mime's and Pantomime's were aim'd

to be originally part of the <hi>Drama,</hi> by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
if the <hi>Mime's</hi> were struck at by <hi>this
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54372:27"/>
Law,</hi> the <hi>Drama</hi> will be concern'd in the

               </note> as <hi>Scaliger</hi> observes, being prior

as the <hi>Surveyor</hi> confesses, could not

were parted; from whence it will follow,
that the <hi>Drama</hi> must be affected with the
<hi>Censure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as this Law was an early, so 'twas

               </note> as appears by the

            </p>
            <p>And now having evidently proved the
<hi>Dramatick Astors</hi> under the Discouragement of
the <hi>Roman Constitution,</hi> we need not stand to
the Courtesie of his Supposition, for to that,
after a little struggling, he is willing to come.
Nay, at last he yields up the Supposition for

I suppose he wont quarrel at his own

I shall endeavour to drive him out

That the <hi>Play-house</hi> was censur'd by

Pleaded for Fees, and Traded for Gain too,
without any such Disadvantage to their
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54372:28"/>
Condition. Why then should Mettals trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mute

the Intention of this Law was to hinder

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the <hi>Play-house</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> was

mentioning the Rise of <hi>Plays</hi> much after the

why the <hi>Actors</hi> of the <hi>Fabulae Attellanae</hi> had

               <note place="margin">

was not unreputable. What <hi>Tully</hi>'s Opinion
was of the <hi>StÃ ge,</hi> has been sufficiently shewn
already: As to this Objection,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>View,</hi> p. 274<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>

obviated in the <hi>View,</hi> &amp;c. by <hi>Tully</hi> himself,
that I can't imagine why the <hi>Surveyor</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
it, unless to fill up the <hi>Page.</hi> But
<hi>Tully</hi> made an Acquaintance with <hi>Roscius:</hi>
Most certainly, <hi>Roscius</hi> was considerable in
his way, and it seems one of the most Moral
in his Profession: And besides, 'tis likely <hi>Tully</hi>
might learn something of Gesture and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation
of him. In short,<note place="margin">

<hi>defended his Cause.</hi> That's true; he defended
him in an Action of Debt: But what's that
to his Profession? Can't a Lawyer plead for
his Client, without justifying his Practise,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54372:29"/>
and answering for his Trade? But I'm afraid
I have consider'd this sort of Reasoning too
much, and therefore shall proceed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Surveyor</hi> urges,<note place="margin">

<hi>Laelius were publickly suspected to have assisted</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<hi>in the Composition of his Plays.</hi> Suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed!
Then it seems 'twas no very creditable
Business. This is an odd way of Arguing,
if positive Evidence from unexceptionable
<hi>History</hi> and <hi>Law,</hi> may be set aside by remote
Conjectures, which would signifie nothing,
if prov'd; I say, if the best Evidence may
be thus over-rul'd, we must never prove

               </note> Mr. <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi>
gives up for an <hi>unreasonable Custom;</hi> but
the <hi>Surveyor,</hi> who loves neither Yielding nor

Banter. He finds fault indeed with the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54372:29"/>
               <hi>Translation;</hi> but disproves it in no particular:
But fails in his own <hi>Version</hi> by his own Rule;
for he renders <hi>Histrio</hi> by <hi>Droll-Actor,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as

and signifies the <hi>Players</hi> in their best Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.
Farther, by his citing the Law at
length, it appears, that <hi>Histrio,</hi> or an <hi>Actor</hi>
in the <hi>Drama,</hi> has as little a Character as a
<hi>Pantomime:</hi> Nay, the Language falls rather

               </note> 
               <hi>has done</hi> Cicero <hi>a
great deal of wrong,</hi> in the Character of <hi>Roscius.</hi>
In the first place, my Citation of St. <hi>Augustine</hi>
is right to a tittle; and therefore I can have
nothing to answer for. And that St. <hi>Augustine</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:54372:30"/>
was the least to blame, we have no just Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to suspect. For, first, we are to observe,
that <hi>Tully</hi>'s Oration, <hi>Pro Roscio,</hi> cited by Mr. <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi>
is a great part of it lost, we have neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
nor end of it. But in St. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s time
<hi>Tully</hi>'s Works were entire. Now because a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
is not in part of an Argument, to conclude
it was not there at all, is an odd way of reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And if 'twas not in this Oration, there
was room enough for it in the rest of <hi>Tully</hi>'s
Works, which are now lost.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Words and Sence of this Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and that cited by Mr. <hi>Dennis,</hi> are so very
different, that 'tis next to impossible, that
St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> if he quoted from Memory,
should mistake the one for the other: And
yet he quotes it roundly, and Reasons po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively
upon it. From whence (says this
Father) <hi>Tully was most clearly of Opinion, that
the better a Man was, the less fit he was to make
a Player.</hi> And can we imagine a Person of
S. <hi>Augustin</hi>'s Character, could mistake so mark'd
and memorable a Sentence? He that was
so well acquainted with the Heathen Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and particularly with <hi>Tully,</hi> having
publickly taught Rhetorick in his younger
time? To change the Words of an Author
to so strange a Degree, to so very foreign a
signification, could be nothing but Design.
Now can we imagine that St. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s
Conscience could digest such a Practice as
this? Would he who had wrote a whole
Books against Falshood and Lying, be guilty
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54372:30"/>
of so notorious an Instance himself? What,
in an Author so well known as <hi>Tully,</hi> in a
Sentence so very remarkable, and in a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
written for the Satisfaction of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens?
For now we are to observe, that
St. <hi>Augustine</hi> was encountring some Pagan
Objections about the Gospels, and proving
the Consistency of the <hi>Evangelists</hi> with each
other. Besides, there was no necessity for
so wretched and ridiculous an Expedient:
The Controversie did not languish for this
Citation; for as pertinent as it was, St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
could easily have gone on without it.
But possibly the <hi>Reader</hi> may think I have taken
too much notice of a Calumny so much without
colour: To return therefore to the <hi>Surveyor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here once for all, I can't but wonder
at his Captiousness and Noise against the
Method of my Quotations: <hi>The Authors,</hi>
says he, <hi>were not cited at length, and in their
own Language, which it seems could be nothing
but Design.</hi> That my Meaning was fair, I
have made good already; and that my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
was defensible, is no less plain, for I
always took care to cite <hi>Book, Chapter,</hi> or <hi>Page,</hi>
and sometimes <hi>Edition</hi> too. Now how could
Imposition and foul Play lie hid under such
a Punctuality? When this was done, what
need was there of stuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ing the <hi>Margin</hi> with
Greek and Latin? Why should I give my
self a needless Fatigue, and trouble the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Reader</hi> with a foreign Language to no
purpose? All unnecessary Quoting is either
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54372:31"/>
Pedantry or Ostentation. The <hi>Surveyor</hi> has
neither Reason nor Custom for his Demands.
What then would the Man be at? I hope
he did not expect I should get a <hi>Certificate,</hi>
or make <hi>Affidavit</hi> in proof of my Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?
'Tis true, his making a squabble about
the Testimonies has now somewhat alter'd
the Case; Insomuch that I am sometimes
forced to bring him to the Test of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,
to discover his Honesty.</p>
            <p>And now having set the Testimonies right,
the rest of the <hi>Surveyor</hi>'s Book will go off
apace.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Surveyor</hi> Complains of my Censuring
the <hi>Musick and Gestures of the Playhouse only
upon Report, having never heard of one, nor seen
t'other.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Surveyor, <hi>p.</hi> 99.</note> As to the Playhouse Musick, he has
given me no occasion to resume that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
neither did I meddle with their Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.
But here he runs too fast. I only told
him,<note place="margin">View, <hi>p.</hi> 278.</note> I was no Frequenter of the <hi>Playhouse.</hi>
I must tell him, I have been there, tho not
always for Diversion. I am not so much a
Stranger to that place, as not to have seen
the Behaviour of their Women bold, and
the Gestures lewd sometimes, witness the
<hi>Hostess in Bartholomew Fair!</hi> His appeal to
the Ladies in this Case is strangely out of
the way. He has reproach'd them too much
in the <hi>Dedication,</hi> either to expect their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
or depend on their Decision. The
Outrage is very gross and comprehensive, as
will appear at the first sight. <hi>Women,</hi> says
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54372:31"/>

               <note place="margin">Epist. Ded.</note> 
               <hi>and weak
Men, whose Fears are stronger than their Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
will be awed into a Perswasion before they
are convinced of the Truth of it. For such People,
in most Cases, measure the certainty of Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by the Confidence of him that pronounces them.</hi>
Here's a Flourish for ye upon the whole <hi>Sex!</hi>
Here's Decency of Application, and Strains
of Breeding and Conduct! And does the
<hi>Surveyor</hi> call in the Ladies to Vouch for him
after this Usage? After he has disabled their
Character, and thrown them out of Sence
and Capacity? His Modesty and Judgment,
I perceive, are much of a size: These Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
I suppose, were calculated for <hi>Russia,</hi>
or rather for <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are said to have no Souls. I asserted in
the <hi>View, &amp;c.</hi> with reference to the <hi>English
Stage,</hi> That if <hi>they have any advantage in their
Instrumental Musick, they lose it in their Vocal:</hi>
Their Songs <hi>being often rampantly l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>wd, and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious
to a flaming excess:</hi>
               <note place="margin">View, <hi>p.</hi> 280.</note> 
               <hi>Now the ancients,
as we have seen already, were inoffensive in this
respect.</hi> Here the <hi>Surveyor</hi> falls a railing very
liberally, and if his Logick would but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
his Language, there was no enduring
him: But the best on't is, his Reasoning
usually makes amends for his Railing: And
so it happens at present, for at the first open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Cause, he does no less than give
it up. He grants the Chorus of the <hi>Ancients
was harmless enough.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Survey, <hi>p.</hi> 103.</note> But then the Reason he
proves it by is somewhat untoward. This
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54372:32"/>
               <hi>Musick,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 101.</note> says he, <hi>consisted of Hymns and Praises
of their Gods, and therefore Lewdness would have
been impertinent.</hi> On the contrary, the Pagan
Idols were lewd, and their Worship was
lewd, and if the Hymns had been so too,
they had been all of a Piece. Where then
was the impropriety? But then this, as
St. <hi>Paul</hi> observes, was for the most part <hi>done
in secret:</hi> For Nature was not wholly subdued
by Idolatry. 'Twas therefore the force of
Modesty, and the regards of Virtue, which
made the Chorus inoffensive, and not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with Religion, as the <hi>Surveyor</hi> sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests.
And is not the ancient Stage much
better than the Modern upon this account?
For they declin'd Smutt, tho their Religion
allow'd it. But these are resolv'd to charge
through their Creed, and to have it at any
purchase of Infamy and Danger. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the <hi>Chorus,</hi> if that was inoffensive,
as the <hi>Surveyor</hi> truly affirms, then the Vocal
Stage Musick of the Ancients was inoffensive,
for they had no Songs but in the <hi>Chorus;</hi> I
Challenge the <hi>Surveyor</hi> to produce one else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
in all the Old Tragedy and Comedy
extant: And does it not follow from hence,
that the old <hi>Drama</hi> was inoffensive, not only
upon the Comparison, but even without it?
His running off to the gross Liberties of the
<hi>Mimi</hi> is a poor relief: For, <hi>First,</hi> By thus
retreating from the Subject, he quits the
Field, and leaves the <hi>Antient Drama</hi> in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of the Advantage contested.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:54372:32"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In all his Ramble and Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
about the <hi>Mimi,</hi> he neither offers to
prove his Point by Argument or Testimony:
He neither gives any Instance, nor cites any
Author; so that the whole of his Cause lies
only in Affirmation and Assurance. His say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That <hi>all who are acquainted with the</hi> Roman
<hi>Stage, know his Charge against the Mimi to be
true,</hi> is like the rest. I must tell him, he
does not know it to be true, and therefore
should not object it. Nay, as far as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
'tis untrue; for the Lewdness of the
<hi>Mimi</hi> consisted more in Gesture, than Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.
I charged the Stage <hi>with encouraging
Revenge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">View, <hi>p.</hi> 283.</note> 
               <hi>and mistaking the Notion of Honour:</hi>
This he denies, and would make us believe,
that a Vindictive Humour is <hi>almost always
made the Mark of a Tyrant or a Villain in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Survey, <hi>p.</hi> 108.</note>
But by his Instance in <hi>Don Manuel</hi> he
mistakes the Point: The Disorders of Princes
was not the Dispute in that place: 'Twas
private Revenge which was principally aimed
at, as appears by the mention of <hi>Duelling.</hi>
And is not this Humour incouraged by the
<hi>Stage?</hi> Don't their Characters of Figure quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
in <hi>Comedy,</hi> and Murther in <hi>Tragedy?</hi> Is
it not Honourable to do it, and Infamous to
refuse it? And thus, by these Maxims, a
Man is bound to be Damn'd in Defence of
his Honour, and can't be a Christian without
being reckon'd a Poltron. To say this, Frensy
is countenanced in Life, and that <hi>a Poet is
obliged to draw according to Nature is a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54372:33"/>
Plea.</hi> At this rate Rapes and Adulteries
must be Acted, and all sort of Blasphemy
repeated,<note place="margin">View, <hi>p.</hi> 35, 383.</note> that Nature may be shewn in her
Colours: But this I have answered already.
And therefore his saying,<note place="margin">Defence, <hi>p.</hi> 10, 15, &amp;c.</note> That <hi>there can be
no Breach of Morality, without offending against
the Laws of the Drama;</hi> His saying this, is in
effect, to make the Poets Soveraign Judges of
Good and Evil; To give the Stage a Power
Paramount to Gospel and Law, and to make
Vice the Standart of Virtue. By this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
they may bring all the Stench of the
<hi>Stews</hi> upon the Board, and Poyson <hi>Cum Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilegio.</hi>
For, what is all this, but a close
Imitation of Life? Now if <hi>any Man dislikes
these Figures,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Surv. <hi>p.</hi> 119.</note> 
               <hi>let him do it at his Peril,</hi> says the
<hi>Surveyor, for then he finds fault with Nature,
not with the Poet.</hi> Nay, if <hi>those Pictures be
drawn according to the Life, he might as well
snarl at the Wise Providence which governs the
World, because he meets more ugly Faces then
handsom ones,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>more Knaves and Fools than Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Men, &amp;c.</hi> This is admirable Reasoning!
For, in the first place, to suppose Ugliness so
very common, is a Satyr upon Mankind, and
is remote both from Truth, and Decency:
But to make <hi>Knavery</hi> the effect of <hi>Providence,</hi>
as this Author does by the drift of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning,
and the force of his Comparison, is
next to Blasphemy. To proceed from his
Supposition to his Inference: Does the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor</hi>
think there's no difference between Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Defects and Moral Turpitude, and are
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54372:33"/>
Ugly Faces as catching as Ugly Practices?
Certainly, no. The Deformities of Behaviour
are much more dangerous than those of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Understanding. Lewdness and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism
are infectious, but Folly is a disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to none but him that has it. Now,
if we are obliged to guard our Virtue, and
avoid ill Discourse, Why not in the Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house,
as well as in other places? Unless we'l
say, that the Wit and Figure, and Success of a
Libertine mortifies his Example, and makes him
less dangerous: And then by the same Rule we
may conclude, that the malignity of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper
is a good symptom of Health, and
that People are likely to do least mischief,
when they are best prepared for't.</p>
            <p>I must now attend the <hi>Surveyor</hi> in his Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman Tragedy,</hi> in
which he pretends the <hi>Ancients</hi> were defective
in the Morality of their <hi>Fable.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Survey, <hi>p.</hi> 126.</note> And upon
the comparison of some few Instances, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to throw the preference upon the
<hi>Moderns.</hi> In this Enquiry he spends a great
part of his Book, which were it never so
lucky, would be but little to his purpose.
For, to say no more at present, this Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
would reach no farther than Tragedy,
Comedy does not enter the Dispute upon this
Head, and therefore must be left defenceless.
He throws away abundance of Ammunition
upon this <hi>place,</hi> which if he could carry it,
would not be worth the Storming: This will
appear upon the progress of the Contest;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54372:34"/>
and in the mean time I shall endeavour to
repel the Attack, and disappoint him in the
little Advantage.</p>
            <p>In pursuing this Point, the <hi>Surveyor</hi> falls
into a mighty Vein of telling <hi>Stories,</hi> which
by the length and manner of them, one
would fancy were told more for his own Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
than the <hi>Readers.</hi> Here we must
take him by Tale, and not by Weight;
measure his Arguments by the Page; And if
a Man could be confuted by the Yard, he
might possibly have done my Business.</p>
            <p>He begins with the Fable of <hi>Sophocles</hi> his
<hi>Oedipus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Survey, <hi>p.</hi> 131.</note> and Censures it for <hi>being very deficient
in the Moral.</hi> And yet in the next Words
he owns <hi>it may serve to put us in mind of the
Lubricity of Fortune, and the Instability of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Greatness.</hi> Call you this <hi>Moral</hi> very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient!
Does it not hold forth a Lesson of
Justice and Moderation to great Men? Does
it not teach the proper use of Prosperity,
and prepare us for the Turns of Adversity?
This <hi>Moral</hi> is so far from being deficient
in a Play, that it would make a good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
But the ground of the Quarrel is,
this <hi>Moral</hi> is too good for such a Heathen as
<hi>Sophocles,</hi> and therefore he must not have it.
Not have it! What,<note place="margin">Survey, <hi>p.</hi> 131.</note> tho the Poem uses it
expresly as such? that's confessed: For all
that the <hi>Surveyor</hi> not only finds fault with
Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> but wont give <hi>Sophocles</hi> leave to
understand the Moral of his own <hi>Fable.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 133.</note>
This is very hard. But since he is resolv'd to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54372:34"/>
refine upon <hi>Sophocles</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> let's
see what he'l make on't. Now this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
tells us, that the <hi>genuine Moral of the
Fable</hi> ought to have been shewn in setting
forth <hi>Oedipus</hi>'s; <hi>Misfortunes,</hi> as a result of his
<hi>Impiety, in advancing his own Iudgment above
that of his Gods;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Survey, <hi>p.</hi> 133. 145.</note> 
               <hi>and thinking by his own Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to reverse the immutable Decrees of Destiny,
and upon this account his Vanity deserv'd the
heaviest Chastisement.</hi> To this I answer,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That if this were the <hi>Moral,</hi> it
would not be without Instruction: It might
shew the vanity of contesting with Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and teach submission to the Decrees of
Heaven, that People should conclude the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
just by the Hand that sent it, and
not repine at the Mysteries of Providence.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this Sence is not <hi>the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
Moral,</hi> appears by the <hi>Surveyor's</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
in which he grants, That Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>was not so universal among the Antient Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
but many held the contrary.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>And if</hi> Oedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus
<hi>was one of this Number, he grants his Moral
falls to the Ground.</hi> Now, that <hi>Oedipus</hi> was
no Predestinarian, I think is pretty clear from
his Management: For if he believed a Fata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
he must believe his Misfortunes irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trievable,
and why then was he so weak as
to attempt the preventing it? Why then did
he quit his Fortune and his Friends, throw
up the Expectations of a Crown, and run
rambling after a known Impossibility? Such
a Piece of Pilgrimage is fitter for a Goose
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54372:35"/>
then a Hero, especially one who could look
through Mysteries, untie Riddles, and had a
reach of Understanding above the rest of
Mankind. 'Tis plain therefore, <hi>Oedipus</hi> did
not imagine himself under a Necessity of
of Murthering his Father. He thought the
Oracle pronounced no more then a Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Truth; He took it for a fair warning,
but believed the Event might be secur'd by
Care, and Caution.</p>
            <p>Farther, By this Scheme of Fatality the
reason of Punishment is destroyed, and by
consequence the <hi>Moral</hi> sinks with it. For,
why should <hi>Oedipus</hi> be punished for attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>reverse Destiny,</hi> when all his Actions
were pre-ordain'd, and he had not so much
as his own Will in his power? Where there
is no Choice, there can be no Fault: Alass!
Upon this Supposition his <hi>Vanity</hi> was una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable,
and he could no more help the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing
with Fate, than he could over-rule it.
For as the <hi>Surveyor</hi> has it from <hi>Seneca,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Quicquid patimur mortale genus,</l>
                  <l>Quicquid facimus venit ab alto.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To make <hi>Oedipus</hi> smart for questioning the
Oracle in this Case, is against all Reason and
Justice: And the Poet might as well have
brought him to Execution, because he could
not fly. And thus we see the Poet will shift
much better by himself than with the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor's</hi>
Assistance. The <hi>Moral</hi> of the rest of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54372:35"/>
               <hi>Sophocles</hi>'s Plays is either good, or not bad, by<note place="margin">Survey. <hi>p. 150, to</hi> 165.</note>
his own Confession, and therefore that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
is at an end: 'Tis true he excepts a little

               <hi>Orestes</hi>'s killing his Mother, tho not Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
by the <hi>Surveyor,</hi> lies harder upon <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phocles</hi>
than the other. But when we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that he was put upon this Practice by

and the Abuse of his Bed; This Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I say, upon the Heathen Theology,
seems to excuse the Fact.</p>
            <p>We are now to proceed to <hi>Euripides,</hi> who
is blam'd by the <hi>Surveyor</hi> for not contriving
his Fable to the Advantage of his <hi>Moral.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Survey, <hi>p.</hi> 164<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 178.</note> To
this it may be return'd, That his Instances of
Mismanagement in this Poet are but few:
And even all of those few<note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note> won't hold;
and where they do, the Plays are defensible
upon another Head.</p>
            <p>And because he makes <hi>Orestes,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
produced by him, a Sample of the rest,
it may not be amiss to shew the <hi>Reader</hi> in a
Word or two, how unfairly <hi>Euripides</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
by the <hi>Surveyor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To begin, <hi>Hecuba</hi> his first Play, has a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
sufficiently instructive. For, here <hi>Polydo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
comes from the other World to discover
Treachery and Murther. And <hi>Polymnestor,</hi>
King of <hi>Thrace,</hi> being the guilty Person, is
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54372:36"/>
punish'd with the loss of his Eyes: This Piece
of Revenge is executed by <hi>Hecuba,</hi> Mother
to the Murther'd Person, and being question'd
for the Fact, she is acquitted by <hi>Agamemnon;</hi>
as indeed she well might, having done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
unjustifiable by the Principles of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganism.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Phaenissae</hi> is full of <hi>Moral</hi> Sentences,
and as to the <hi>Fable,</hi> the Misfortune of <hi>Laius</hi>
and his Posterity is declared to proceed from
his disobedience to the Oracle:<note place="margin">Eurip. Phaeniss. <hi>p.</hi> 112. Ed. Cantabr.</note> which holds
forth this Lesson, That 'tis dangerous to go
counter to the Instructions of Heaven; and
that our Duty should always over-rule our
Desires.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hippolitus Coronatus</hi> is taxed by the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor</hi>
with a defective <hi>Moral,</hi> because an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offensive

            <p>The <hi>Surveyor</hi> grants <hi>Alcestis</hi> a Moral Play,
and the same may be said of <hi>Andromache:</hi> For
here <hi>Hermione,</hi> who injur'd the Royal Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<hi>Andromache,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Androm. <hi>p.</hi> 319, 320.</note> grows almost distracted

            <p>

<hi>Andromache</hi> and her Son <hi>Molossus,</hi> is disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
in his Barbarity by <hi>Peleus,</hi> who
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54372:36"/>
comes in the nick of time to the rescue of

Andromache</hi> is left in possession of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
Married to <hi>Helenus, Hector</hi>'s Brother,
and the Crown settled upon her Son <hi>Molos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus:</hi>
And to enrich the <hi>Moral</hi> farther, the

            </p>
            <p>The Moral of the <hi>Supplices</hi> is not amiss.
The Case stood thus. <hi>Creon</hi> King of <hi>Thebes</hi>
refusing Burial to the Chiefs slain before that
Town, <hi>Adrastus,</hi> the only surviving Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate,
applies to <hi>Theseus</hi> King of <hi>Athens,</hi> for
Assistance, desiring to be put into a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to take care of the Funerals of his
Friends. For to have these Solemnities un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perform'd,
was a sad misfortune among the
Heathens, who believed the Ghosts of the
Deceased had no rest, till their Bodies were
burnt, and their Bones buried, according to
that of <hi>Virgil.</hi>

            <p>The Tragedy of <hi>Helena</hi> gives Countenance
to Probity: For, by the Structure of the

detain'd Prisoner in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and proves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
to her Husband <hi>Menelaus,</hi> tho courted
by <hi>Theoclymenus</hi> King of that Country. In
short, she conceals <hi>Menelaus</hi> upon his arrival,
makes the King believe he was Wreck'd, and
desiring leave to solemnize his Funeral on
the Shoar, gets an opportunity to escape the
Tyrant, and set sail. <hi>Theoclymenus</hi> finding
himself betray'd, and suspecting his Sister
<hi>Theonoe</hi> in the Plot, resolves to Murther her;

Here the <hi>Moral</hi> lies upon the surface, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently

            <p>To conclude, <hi>Euripides</hi>'s <hi>Electra</hi> stands upon

            <p>From this short Survey the Reader may

all.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Surveyor</hi> therefore is much mistaken
in making the <hi>Ancients</hi> so negligent in their
<hi>Fable:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Survey, <hi>p.</hi> 194.</note> As if a good <hi>Moral</hi> from them was
rather the effect of Casualty than Choice.
There are four Tragedies of <hi>Euripides</hi> still
unmention'd; that is, his <hi>Orestes, Medea,
Hercules Furens,</hi> and <hi>Ion:</hi> Here I confess the
Byass of the Fable is not so well contriv'd,
as in the rest.</p>
            <p>But then he may be in a great measure
excused upon these Two following Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Because <hi>Euripides</hi> takes care to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
the Malignity of his Fable by Moral
Sentences, and Philosophical Advice,<note place="margin">Survey, <hi>p.</hi> 164.</note> of
which, as the <hi>Surveyor</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>onfesses, he is very
liberal. Yes: <hi>The Anciens,</hi> says he, <hi>deliver'd
their Instructions in Wise Sayings scatter'd in
the Dialogue, or at the Close;</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 191.</note> Now these <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences</hi>
were possibly more intelligible to a
Common Understanding, than the Mystery
of <hi>Plots,</hi> and the Revolution of <hi>Fables:</hi> And
therefore when the rest of the <hi>Play</hi> was not
stuffed with Lewdness, might govern in the
Minds of an Audience, and make a signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54372:38"/>
Impression: But, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That which
goes farthest in the Justification of <hi>Euripides</hi>
is, that the Disposition of the <hi>Fable</hi> was sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in his power: The Subject was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
History, or received Tradition; from
which 'twas unsafe to vary. For, to cross
upon common Belief, and give Matter of
Fact the Lye, was the way to spoil the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
and Relish of the Poem. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
therefore, as the <hi>Surveyor</hi> remarks from
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> being forc'd to take the <hi>Fable</hi> as
they found it,<note place="margin">Surv. <hi>p.</hi> 187, 188.</note> the fault lay in the History,
which made the Poet more excusable.</p>
            <p>And this may serve to shew, that <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides</hi>
is much better complexion'd than the
<hi>Surveyor</hi> was pleas'd to draw him. He is
mistaken likewise in affirming, That <hi>Euripides
does not touch the Passions like</hi> Sophocles: For,<note place="margin">Survey, <hi>p.</hi> 164</note>
no less a Judge than <hi>Quintilian</hi> gives him the
preference: <hi>He had,</hi> says he, <hi>an admirable
stroak at the Pathos in general; And for raising
Compassion, was clearly superior to</hi> Sophocles.<note place="margin">In affectibus vero cum omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus mirus, tum in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And if <hi>Quintilian</hi>'s Authority stood in need

to say nothing farther, might vouch
for him.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Euripides</hi> the <hi>Surveyor</hi> goes backward
to <hi>Aeschylus,</hi> but this <hi>Poet</hi> will quickly be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engag'd,

that I <hi>took all</hi> Seneca'<hi>s Plays for the Work of

               <note place="margin">Survey. p. 183.</note> His Reason is, I suppose, because
I call'd them <hi>Seneca</hi>'s <hi>Tragedies:</hi> Because I did
not distinguish between the <hi>Plays</hi> written by
<hi>Marcus,</hi> and those by <hi>Lucius Annaeus Seneca;</hi>
and run out into Pedantry and Foreign Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.
But enough of this.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Surveyor</hi> remarks,<note place="margin">P. 182.</note> that all <hi>Seneca</hi>'s <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies
are of Greek Extraction:</hi> (for the <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>

And so much the better, for then, where
they need it, what I have offer'd for the
<hi>Greeks,</hi> may serve for their Apology. Then
the Plan of the <hi>Fable</hi> takes it's refuge in <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story;</hi>
and comes down with Excuse to the
Poet. Besides, the <hi>Surve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>or</hi> takes notice, that
<hi>Seneca</hi> refines upon the Justice of <hi>Euripides</hi>
in his <hi>Hippolytus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Survey. <hi>p.</hi> 189.</note> and mends his <hi>Moral.</hi> Why,
this is just as one would wish. But then the
Man grows angry, because I did not distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
the Plays of <hi>Seneca</hi> the Philosopher
from the rest, and exempt him from Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
Why,<note place="margin">Survey. <hi>p.</hi> 184.</note> truly I had no leisure for tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
in Criticisms: And moreover, I could
not wholly excuse him; for his Rants (if
they belong to him) are sometimes as extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
as may be<note n="*" place="margin">Senec. Troad. Act. 3.</note>.</p>
            <p>His Parallel of <hi>Ajax Oileus</hi> with a late Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
won't hold. For <hi>Ajax</hi> was sunk in
his Blasphemy, and had his Breath stop'd
with a Thunderbolt:<note place="margin">Survey. <hi>p.</hi> 187.</note> He is <hi>no Person of the
Drama;</hi> But what then? This Instance is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54372:39"/>
to shew the Poet's Justice, and make
an Example of the Crime.</p>
            <p>His pretended Division of Tragedy from
<hi>Aristotle</hi> into <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Pathetick,</hi> is strangely
misrepresented. By this Distinction he would
make us believe, that according to <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
the <hi>Pathetick Tragedy</hi> had no regard to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
and Poetick Justice. But this is not
only contrary to Matter of Fact, but to the
Authority of the Citation.</p>
            <p>For, <hi>Aristotle</hi> makes four Branches of his
Division of Tragedy, and not two only, as
this Author quotes him. These four kinds of
Tragedy the Philosopher forms upon the four
principal Excellencies relating to this
Art.</p>
            <p>The first sort he calls <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, or that
which turns chiefly upon Intrigue, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery;
The second is the <hi>Pathetick,</hi> the
Beauty of which consists in the skill of
touching the Passions, and awakening Terror
and Pity to an unusual degree. Now if the
<hi>Fable</hi> was well cast, and Poetick Justice ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
as I have prov'd it often happen'd;
in this case I say, this sort of Tragedy,<note place="margin">Survey. <hi>p.</hi> 226.</note> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
jot as instructive, or in other words as
<hi>Moral,</hi> as any other.</p>
            <p>The 3d sort was distinguish'd by a plain
and pompous Narration without surprize of
Incidents or Revolution of Affairs. Here the
Gods made a great part of the Dialogue,
and the Peculiarity of it lay in the Majesty
of the Presence, of the Subject and Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:54372:40"/>
The fourth is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> or <hi>Moral,</hi> so called
because,<note place="margin">Aristot. de Poet. cap. 18.</note> as appears by the Instances, and the
learned Paraphrast <hi>Goulston,</hi> it dealt chiefly
in virtuous Examples, and Characters of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and Piety. In a word, the Distinction
goes more upon Person, Character, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
than upon <hi>Fable</hi> and Event. And
thus 'tis plain, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> was far from
having any of the Surveyor's fancie's in his
head: For all these kinds of Tragedy not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
their Difference, were equally
capable of a good <hi>Moral,</hi> and of adjusting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and Punishments, And therefore this
Philosopher was no such <hi>inexhaustible Spring</hi>
of <hi>Corruption,</hi> no such <hi>everlasting Source</hi> of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Survey. <hi>p.</hi> 195.</note>
as this Gentleman and his terrible
Rhetorick would make him.</p>
            <p>Having now disabled his Instances of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
and vindicated the <hi>Antients;</hi> the
Design of his Attack is defeated. And his
long Declamation, into which he has ramm'd
so many hard words,<note place="margin">Survey, <hi>p.</hi> 196. 197, &amp; deinc.</note> will recoil upon himself;
and discharge nothing but Smoke and Noise,
Paper and Powder.</p>
            <p>For by this time I suppose 'tis pretty clear
that my <hi>Satyr</hi> (as he calls it) <hi>does</hi> not <hi>come</hi>
near <hi>so full upon the Antients,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Survey. <hi>p.</hi> 201.</note> as <hi>upon</hi> the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For first, As we have seen the Old Tragedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
were generally unexceptionable in their
<hi>Fable;</hi> and when they were not, tis because
they were tied down to the Models of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
and Religion,<note place="margin">Survey <hi>p.</hi> 187, 188.</note> upon which account both
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:54372:40"/>
               <hi>Aristotle</hi> and the <hi>Surveyor</hi> are willing to make
them an Allowance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Antient Tragick Poets were
clean in their Expression. And</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They are not near so full of
Profaneness and Atheistical Rants.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Surveyor</hi> is resolv'd notwithstanding
to produce some Modern Tragedies, which
tho they have little to say, are to look boldly
upon the Court, and pass their Resolution
for their Innocence; And here <hi>Shakespear</hi>'s
<hi>Hamlet</hi> is brought first, and a great many
Words spent to prove the Regularity and
Instructiveness of the <hi>Fable.</hi> But, what's all
this to the Controversy?<note place="margin">Survey. <hi>p. 201, to</hi> 206.</note> My Exceptions to
<hi>Hamlet</hi> related only to his Indecencies of
Language; and how handsomly the <hi>Surveyor</hi>
justifies that, we shall see afterwards. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
here the <hi>Surveyor</hi> was resolv'd to set up
a King of Clouts of his own making; and
then to fall on and Conquer him with great
Bravery: Or, perhaps his Heart being better
than his Sight, he might mistake the <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mill</hi>
for the Gyant.</p>
            <p>His next Instance is in the <hi>Orphan,</hi> against
the <hi>Fable</hi> of which tho I did not except, yet
'tis by no means so staunch as he would
make it. For here's no just Distinction of
Fate upon the Merit of the Persons; but the
good and bad, the innocent and guilty, fall
under a common Misfortune.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:54372:41"/>
               <hi>Cleomenes</hi> comes next under the <hi>Surveyor's</hi>
Examination: This Play he taxes extreamly
<hi>with the want of a Moral.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Survey.</hi> p. 212.</note> And does this
prove, that the <hi>Fable</hi> of the <hi>Moderns</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable
to the <hi>Antients?</hi> What makes him
argue on my side? How some People's Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
rides their Judgment! He must be throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Criticisms about, tho he falls upon
his Friends, and weakens his Argument by
his Discovery.</p>
            <p>The Two remaining Tragedies are <hi>Don Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bastian</hi>
and the <hi>Mourning Bride.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> View <hi>and</hi> Defence.</note> Now he
knows I have made several material Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
against these <hi>Plays,</hi> which he does not
attempt to remove. I must tell him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
once for all, that the Justification of
the <hi>Fable</hi> is no Answer: For I did not charge
the <hi>Moderns</hi> with being being Infection all
over: No, they may do Execution enough
without that.</p>
            <p>Besides, the Fable by his own reasoning
<hi>works least sensibly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Survey.</hi> p. 222.</note> it sleeps as it were in the
Veins, and is slow in the Operation. But
foul Images, and profane Discourse, are of
a quicker Dispatch, and like the Plague sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and sure. And then the Decency, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Sentences, and Gravity of the <hi>Antients</hi>
were a sort of Counterpoyson to the <hi>Fable:</hi>
For, as the <hi>Surveyor</hi> observes, the <hi>Discourse
of the Antient Tragedy was frequently Moral,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Survey</hi> p. 225.</note>
               <hi>when the Fable was not.</hi> To which I must add,
that when the Moderns are staunch in their
main <hi>Fable,</hi> their Episodes and Under-Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54372:41"/>
are much out of Order, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
Vice by giving it success.<note place="margin">View, 142, 146, &amp; alib.</note> He would
gladly put in still for some Advantages to
the <hi>Moderns,</hi> with respect to the <hi>Moral;</hi> but
the Claim sticks cruelly in the making out.
He mentions Three Particulars, the Two first
of which are no more than one, and that is,
that</p>
            <p>The <hi>Moderns are never at the Expence of a
Miracle to bring about a wicked Design,</hi> as the
<hi>Antients</hi> have notoriously done.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Survey.</hi> p. 218.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To this I answer,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That he has over-charged the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients,</hi>
and multiplied his Instances beyond
Matter of Fact; as appears by what I have
proved already.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In those few <hi>Plays</hi> where the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation
is true, they represented the History
of their Theology, they had Common Belief
for their Excuse, so that it seems rather the
fault of the Religion, than the Poet. And
as for the <hi>Moderns,</hi> their standing off from
this Conduct seems to proceed more from
Management than Scruple; By the Liberties
they take in other Cases, we have no reason
to believe they declined this ill use of <hi>Machine</hi>
out of Conscience: But because they know
this Expedient won't take: The Method looks
unnatural, and the Credulity of the Audience
is not high enough to make it go down.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:54372:42"/>
His Second Advantage for the <hi>Moderns</hi> is,
that <hi>their Malefactors are generally punish'd.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Survey. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </note>
The <hi>Antients</hi> did the same, as I have prov'd
from the Three <hi>Greek</hi> Tragedians. But after
all, the <hi>Moderns</hi> are far from being so careful
in the execution of Justice as he pretends.
For I'm mistaken if Libertines that expose
Vertue, and droll upon Religion, are not
great Malefactors. To steal Property, is not
so bad as to steal Principle; For this latter
Practice extinguishes the Notion of Right,
and makes Thieving Universal. He that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys
the Distinction of Good and Evil, is
the worst Tyrant; for he encourages all Men
to be like himself. Now these sort of <hi>Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors</hi>
are cherished and rewarded by the
<hi>Modern Stage.</hi>
               <note place="margin">View, &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 142, 146, &amp; alib.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Surveyor</hi> proceeding in Defence of the
<hi>Moderns,</hi> affirms, that the <hi>Fable of every Play
is undoubtedly the Author's own,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Survey <hi>p.</hi> 219.</note> 
               <hi>whencesoever
he takes the Story, and he may model it as he
pleases; The Characters are not so, for these the
Poet is oblig'd to take from Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I answer,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> In contradiction to his Assertion,
That when the Poet writes from History, he

            <p>His last Effort upon the <hi>Fable</hi> of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients</hi>

and has not so much as a jot of the due

he gives for this Censure is, because such

Treatment of Virtue and Vice, and
Male-administration upon Merit, is in the
Opinion of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> a Neglect of Humane

of <hi>Dramatick</hi> Law, then certainly this Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher
did not over-look the Respects of
Justice in his Preceps for Tragedy.</p>
            <p>This, if need be, will appear farther from
the Qualifications he requires in his Hero,
who is to suffer at the latter end of the Play.
This chief Person he would have of a Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling
size for his Morals, neither remarkable
one way nor t'other: He would not have
him flamingly Wicked, for then no body
would be concern'd for his Misfortune, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion

                  </gap>.</note> whom <hi>Aristotle</hi> says 'tis scandalous to make
unhappy. Thus we see he suffers for his
Faults, he is made a Malefactor, tho not to
the degree of falling unpitied. And thus
the Example works the right way, and the
Audience is alarm'd into Caution. Thus
they are held to their Good Behaviour, and
the <hi>passion</hi> of <hi>Terror</hi> is <hi>purg'd;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Arist. de poet. cap. 6.</note> which advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
could never follow if the <hi>Hero</hi> had no
Faults to justifie his Misfortune. For to see a
good Man punish'd for that he can't help, is
the way to make the Passions of the Tragedy
run Riot, and grow mutinous against Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence;
and is rather an Argument for
Despair than Circumspection. And this may
serve to shew, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> was not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
of Poetick Justice.</p>
            <p>And that <hi>Horace,</hi> who goes upon the Plan
of the <hi>Antients,</hi> was of the same mind, is
evident from his Advice to the <hi>Chorus,</hi> 
               <q>to
appear for Virtue, and perform the Offices
of Friendship; To recommend Justice, and
pray the Gods that Fortune might follow De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert</q>

Now the <hi>Chorus,</hi> we know, was to
unite with the Subject, to support the Design
of the <hi>Play,</hi> and represent the Sence of the
Poet. If therefore <hi>Horace</hi> would have the
<hi>Chorus</hi> solicit thus strongly for Justice; he
expected, no doubt, the <hi>Catastrophe</hi> should be
govern'd by the same Instructions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:54372:44"/>
And thus I have endeavour'd to detect his
Calumnies upon the <hi>Antients,</hi> to vindicate
their <hi>Fable,</hi> and to disappoint him in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
upon the Comparison. And alass! if
the <hi>Moderns</hi> could have carried this part
of the Preference, it would have done
them but little service. A formal Piece of
Justice at the end of a Lewd Play, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a Piece of Grimace, and a Politick
Hypocrisy. 'Tis much such a strain of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
as it would be to let a Mad Dog loose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Crowd, and then knock him on
the Head when he has bitten a great part of
them. And yet this poor Excuse has no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
in Modern Comedy, where Libertinism
comes generally off with Victory and Flying
Colours.</p>
            <p>And to this Performance of the <hi>Stage</hi> the
<hi>Surveyor</hi> now leads me, and begins with the
<hi>Definition</hi> of <hi>Comedy:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Defence, <hi>p.</hi> 6, 7, 8.</note> But against the Latitude
and Construction of his Interpretation, I
have argued in my <hi>Defence,</hi> of which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Method, he takes no notice.
And by his Description of the Business of
Comedy, we have no reason to expect any
good from it.</p>
            <p>He says the design of Comedy is <hi>rather
Civil Prudence than Morality,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Survey, <hi>p.</hi> 232.</note> and as he is pleas'd
to go on, we are not to expect it should <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
Grace, or mend Principles.</hi> Then as for the
<hi>Characters,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 234.</note> tho he would <hi>not have them all Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,</hi>
he means not just to qualifie them for
<hi>Newgate,</hi> or <hi>Tyburn;</hi> But then especial care
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:54372:44"/>
must be taken, that there is no Person of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety
amongst them: No, <hi>they must be all
Men of Pleasure;</hi> for if they are tainted <hi>with
too much Honesty,</hi> they will disagree <hi>with the
Company,</hi> and <hi>spoil the Projects of the Stage.</hi>
Well! I perceive the <hi>Surveyor</hi> is resolv'd,
notwithstanding his Pretences to the contrary,
to make the Modern Writers of <hi>Comedy</hi> more
Licentious than the <hi>Antient;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rudens. Act. 4. sc. 7.</note> for <hi>Doemones in
Plautus</hi> informs us, that the Comick Poets in
his time us'd to pretend to Discipline, and
throw in Lectures of Morality. And tho the
<hi>Surveyor</hi> takes care to get all his Characters of
Figure debauch'd, and won't suffer any thing
of Conscience or Regularity to tread the Stage,
for fear the Audience might suffer by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample:
Yet <hi>Plautus</hi> was of another mind,
for in his <hi>Captivi</hi> all the Characters are sober,
and well in order, and particularly <hi>Tyndarus</hi>
and <hi>Philochares,</hi> Two young Gentlemen, are
Men of Vertue; and so is <hi>Lusiteles,</hi> another
of the same Quality and Age, in his <hi>Trinummus.</hi>
And then as to Persons farther advanced in
years, there are several Instances both in <hi>Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
and <hi>Terence,</hi> of Behaviour not exception<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
But our <hi>Stage</hi> has refined upon the old
Model: Their Characters must be all Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,
their Diversion Smut, and their Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
Swearing and Profaneness. Their Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
is not to <hi>teach Morality,</hi> but Lewdness,
not to <hi>confer Grace,</hi> but to Debauch Nature,
not to <hi>mend Principles,</hi> but to destroy them.
Indeed, how can the Consequence of such En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54372:45"/>
be otherwise? where the Persons
are all Libertines, where they run such
lengths of excess, and balk nothing that
makes a Jest. Where Profaneness is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
season'd with Wit, and Lewdness po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
with turns of Fancy. Where the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
is made Palatable, the Mischief for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified,
and their Weapons Pointed, to pass
the better through a Man's Body. Now,
who would learn <hi>Civil Prudence</hi> and <hi>Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
from such Instructions as these? where
a Man will be in danger to bring away
much more Vice than Discretion. Is it worth
one's while to get <hi>Caution</hi> with the loss of
Conscience? Or, Have his Pocket Pick'd only
for the sake of Wit and Dexterity? Who
would choose <hi>Bedlam</hi> for his Seat of Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
Or, see <hi>Posture Clark</hi> do his Tricks,
and Act his Metamorphoses, with the Plague
about him?</p>
            <p>'Tis true,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Survey,</hi> p. 336.</note> the <hi>Surveyor</hi> is contented, that
not only a Gentleman of <hi>Wit,</hi> but of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
too, should be <hi>introduced into Comedy;</hi>
but then he guards again in limitation, for
he must be <hi>a Man of wild unreclaim'd Honour:</hi>
A Man of Wild Honour! Truly, I think,
no Man's Honour can be Wilder then his
Notion: Honour without Probity is next to
a Contradiction in Terms, and besides, 'tis
good for very little. For, to speak plainly,
'tis nothing more than Pride and Fashion, and
Civility to a Man's self. I don't say but Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Figure may be sometimes out of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54372:45"/>
in <hi>Comedy,</hi> and he misreports me in affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the contrary<note n="*" place="margin">Surv. <hi>p.</hi> 238.</note>: But then this should not
be done without Restrictions, and Guard of
Behaviour.<note n="*" place="margin">Defence, <hi>p.</hi> 8, 10.</note> And besides they should be
disciplin'd accordingly. When Dramatick
Gentlemen of Sence are Knaves, or Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees,
the Poet should take care to make
them Losers by their Liberty: They should
mortifie them for their Misbehaviour, treat
them with Disappointment, and put them
out of Countenance. And here the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
ought to rise in proportion to the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
for fear the Figure should otherwise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
the Lewdness.</p>
            <p>And to do the <hi>Surveyor</hi> right, he is himself
sensible of the necessity of this Conduct, at
least in some measure. For he grants by
implication, that the Poet is obliged to bring
his Libertine to <hi>a sence of his Extravagance,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Survey, <hi>p.</hi> 237.</note>
               <hi>and a resolution of Amendment.</hi> But that even
this is not done appears sufficiently in my
<hi>View,</hi>
               <note place="margin">View, <hi>p.</hi> 242, 246, &amp; alib.</note> and may be made good much farther
from the <hi>Plays</hi> cited in the <hi>Preface</hi> of my
<hi>Defence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I pass on, I am oblig'd to take
notice of his saying, that <hi>Fools of what Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
soever,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Survey, <hi>p.</hi> 235.</note> 
               <hi>are the proper Goods and Chattels of
the Stage, which the Poets may dispose of as they
think fit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By his favour, to make Weakness of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
the Subject of Comick Mirth, has
neither Religion nor good Nature in't: To
expose a Man for being born without Sence,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54372:46"/>
is a Satyr upon the Creation; 'tis just as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
as it would be to beat a Dwarf for
being under S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>x Foot high. Thus to make
sport with the Misfortunes of Nature, and
insult unavoidable Infirmities, is down-right
Barbarity. Beside, such sort of Ridicule
can cure no Distemper, nor Recover any
Body; Not the Patient, for he is uncapable
of Remedy; And as for other People, they
are out of danger of the Disease, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
need no Preservative. To proceed:</p>
            <p>The <hi>Surveyor</hi> finding the Arguments of the
<hi>View</hi> somewhat troublesome,<note place="margin">Survey, <hi>p.</hi> 239, 105, &amp; alib.</note> would gladly
throw them off upon the score of Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation:
As if they were only a few noisy
glittering Sentences, put together to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
Now, tho I am no Pretender to the
Talent of Haranguing, yet suppose the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
was true, 'twould do him no service.
For Oratory is by no means inconsistent with
Logick. No, Perspicuity of Proof, is, as
as <hi>Longinus</hi> observes, one part of the <hi>Sublime.</hi>
Indeed Rhetorick is nothing but Reason well
dress'd, and Arguments put into Order. To
affirm, That Sence won't agree with proper
and moving Expressions, is a strange Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.
'Tis as much as to say, that a good
Suit of Cloaths is a very naughty thing:
For let it sit never so easie, yet if it happens
to look handsomly, 'twill be sure to weaken
a Man's Body, and take away the use of his
Limbs. But I must follow him.</p>

               <hi>Ben Iohnson,</hi> I took notice, never scrupled
to confess,<note place="margin">View, <hi>p.</hi> 159. 164.</note> that <q>'twas the Office of a Comick
Poet to imitate Justice, and instruct to Life.
And Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> at last came up to the same
Opinion.</q> This Rule the <hi>Surveyor</hi> was sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
agreed very ill with the <hi>English</hi> Stage.
And thus finding himself streighten'd moves
for new Liberty, and tho he stands by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
had much rather bend the Rule,
then reform the Practise.<note place="margin">Survey. <hi>p.</hi> 241.</note> If you'l believe
him, this sort of Discipline is impracticable:
For <hi>the Licentiousness of Men of Fortune, unless
it be such as brings their Vnderstandings into
question, must never be censur'd or exposed in
Comedy.</hi> That is, if a Libertine ben't a Fool,
he may be as Lewd and Profane as he pleases,
and yet have fair Quarter, and make a good
Hand on't. Yes; for, as the <hi>Surveyor</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,<note place="margin">Surv. <hi>p.</hi> 242.</note>
               <hi>how immoral and offensive this Misbeha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
may be to sober People, the Man must escape
the Censure of Comedy, because he can't be tried
in her way.</hi> That's hard! Why, then, if she
must make Malefactors, and won't punish
them, let her Court be put down. If <hi>Sence</hi>
is a Protection to Debauchery, and the most
offensive Immoralities must not be touched;
If Vice must appear only for Favour and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
for Parade and Diversion; If all this
Liberty is presumed on by the the Laws of
Comedy, and the Privilege of the <hi>Poem?</hi> Then,
I say, the very Definition condemns it. 'Tis
a Nusance in its Nature, and Poyson in its
Constitution.</p>
            <p>

I urged there was no arguing from some<note place="margin">View, <hi>p.</hi> 149.</note>
Instances of Favour to Vitious Young People
in <hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Terence;</hi> That the Consequence
would not hold from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
those Pagan Poets had a greater Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
of Liberty in their Religion. To this
his Answer,<note place="margin">Surv. <hi>p.</hi> 242.</note> to make it short, is, <hi>that these
Poets, especially</hi> Terence, <hi>were too great Masters
of their own Art to take an improper Liberty, only
because 'twas not dangerous.</hi> Who told him,
it was an <hi>improper Liberty?</hi> The Measures of
Practice are form'd upon Rules of Notion,
and Schemes of Belief: Now the Directions
for Life and Manners, are strangely different
in the Divisions of Heathenism and Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
And therefore those Liberties might be
proper enough in the first, which are into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
in the latter. But this Objection will
be rallied afterwards, and therefore I shall
now pursue it no farther. But the <hi>Surveyor</hi>
has a small Reserve: <hi>The Laws of</hi> Rome, says
he,<note place="margin">Surv. <hi>p.</hi> 24<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>were very severe, and required Regularity of
Life; The</hi> Magistrates <hi>likewise, and Censors of
Manners, would never have suffer'd Examples
of such ill Consequence to have been produced o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly.</hi>
From whence he would have it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that if <hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Terence had suspected
the Indulgences above-mention'd, had tended any
ways to the Debauching of their Youth, they durst
not have ventur'd them into publick View.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I answer in a Word; That the
<hi>Roman</hi> Magistrates notwithstanding the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of their Government, suffered the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:54372:47"/>
of the <hi>Pantomines,</hi> and therefore might well
allow of much lesser degrees of Liberty in their
<hi>Comick Poets:</hi> I say, they suffered the <hi>Panto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mimes,</hi>
against whom the <hi>Surveyor</hi> Declaims
so heartily,<note place="margin">Surv. <hi>p.</hi> 24, 28, &amp; alib.</note> and charges so very high with
Scandal and Brutality. And if these gross
Entertainments would go down, why should
they take check at the more inoffensive sallies
of Gallantry? As the Case stood, tis no
wonder if a lucky Libertine should some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
pass Muster.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Terence Coppied faithfully
from Nature and depicted Humane Life in its
true and just proportion:</hi> Let them <hi>depict</hi> what<note place="margin">

they please, they did not Study the worst Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
tho their Pencil was sometimes bold,
they shaded many Blemishes, and aimed at
the fairest Resemblance.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Surveyor</hi> rises in his Resolution; and
and sticks not to affirm, that if the <hi>Images,</hi>
answer Life, the foulness of them can never
be a Fault.<note place="margin">Surv. p. 244.</note> So far from that, the Crime lies
quite on the other Side. For to be displeas'd
<hi>with a true Representation</hi> tho' never so hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
is no better than to <hi>quarrel with Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
whose Creature Mankind is;</hi> Say you so,
does providence make Monsters in Vice, as
well as in Figure? Can't a scandalous Play
be disliked without arraigning of Providence?
I thought Wickedness had not been the
Work of Creation, but Misbehaviour; And
that God had made the Man, but not the
Sinner. What wretched shifts these Men are
put to, to make Lewdness passable!</p>

However, the <hi>Surveyor</hi> is resolved not to
quit his Hold: He will have it that when
<hi>Nature is not wrong'd these Liberties</hi> of making
Vice successful, and what you please besides, are
an unalienable Right: It seems they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayl'd
upon the <hi>Poets,</hi> and descend by course
of Law, from the <hi>Roman</hi> to the <hi>English Stage:</hi>
Yes,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> say's the Surveyor <hi>they have a Right to all
the Priviledges of their Predecessors.</hi> That is a
Christian has a clear Title to imitate all the
wickedness his Heathen <hi>Predecessors</hi> have pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
before him.</p>
            <p>In the course of the Argument, I prefer'd
the precepts of <hi>Horace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">View, <hi>p.</hi> 149.</note> to the Example of
<hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Terence,</hi> and cited him for the
contrary opinion. How can that be replies
the <hi>Surveyor,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Surv. <hi>p.</hi> 244.</note> since <hi>Horace draws Youth</hi> with
the same Features and Complexion that those
Comick Poets had done before? And in proof
of his Assertion, he produces the Picture.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>This</hi> Description, continues he, is <hi>not a

               <hi>but a Rule to draw them by.</hi> I agree with him:
But then, as they have a Byass to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
they ought to have the Consequences
too: The Poet should make them smart for
the Prodigality of their Humour, for their
Ungovernable Heats, and the Folly of their
Appetites. And that this was <hi>Horace</hi>'s Opinion
appears from the rest of his Advice<note n="*" place="margin">

               <note place="margin">Surv. <hi>p.</hi> 47, 49.</note> Not at all: 'Tis plain, <hi>Horace</hi>
condemns Obscenity, and that the <hi>Roman</hi>

And if they would not allow it in
their <hi>Rustick Satyrae,</hi> where there was some
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:54372:49"/>
pretence of Character to cover it; 'Twould
have gone down much worse, in the more
Polite Diversions of Comedy.</p>
            <p>I gave a short Character from <hi>Horace</hi> of
the serviceableness of the Antient Poets,<note place="margin">View, <hi>p.</hi> 149.</note> to
Government and Private Life, and that by
Consequence they aim'd more at Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
then Pleasure. This, the <hi>Surveyor</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers,
was <hi>but a Compliment to Poetry in general,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Surv. <hi>p.</hi> 249.</note>
               <hi>and that Comedy was not invented in the time of
Orpheus.</hi> Granting all that; If the Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was to Poetry in general, one would
think it should reach to all the parts of it.
And tho <hi>Orpheus</hi> might live before Comedy,
<hi>Horace</hi> was long enough after it. And this
is he who informs us, that the Usefulness of
the Antient Poets, and the Sobriety of their
Conduct, gain'd them their Reputation.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Sic honor &amp; nomen, divinis vatibus,<note place="margin">De Art. Poet.</note> atque</l>

            </q>
            <p>As much as to say, that the Reward was
fasten'd to the Merit: And that if later Poets
would purchase their Fame, they must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
their Pattern.</p>
            <p>From the Directions of <hi>Horace</hi> to the <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
I infer'd, that this Poet would allow no
Countenance or good Fortune to an immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Character. And foreseeing it might be
replied, that Tragedy was only concern'd, I
endeavour'd to remove the Objection. To
this the <hi>Surveyor</hi> opposes the Authority of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:54372:49"/>
               <hi>Horace,</hi> as if the <hi>Chorus</hi> was put down with
<hi>Old Comedy.</hi> For,
<q>

                  </l>
                  <l>Tupiter obticuit sublata jure nocendi.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Case was thus;<note place="margin">Lil. Gyrald.</note> The <hi>Old Comedy</hi> in the
<hi>Chorus</hi> had taken too much Liberty with the
Government,<note place="margin">De Poet. Hist.</note> and outrag'd Persons of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
by Name.<note place="margin">Dial. 6. <hi>p.</hi> 765, 766.</note> Upon this <hi>Alcibiades</hi> had
<hi>Eupolis</hi> thrown over-board for his <hi>Baptae,</hi> and
got a <hi>Bill</hi> passed, That the <hi>Stage</hi> should at
their Peril name no Body in their Satyr.</p>
            <p>This is the Law which <hi>Horace</hi> refers to;
And therefore his Testimony proves no more,
than that the Liberty of the <hi>Chorus</hi> was si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenc'd,
which Restraint was consistent enough
with the Use of it.</p>
            <p>And to prove the <hi>Chorus</hi> did not expire
with <hi>Old Comedy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">View, <hi>p.</hi> 150.</note> I produced for Evidence
<hi>Aristophanes</hi>'s, <hi>Plutus.</hi> But against this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
the <hi>Surveyor</hi> starts two objections, for
he'l neither admit the <hi>Plutus</hi> for <hi>New Comedy;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Surv. <hi>p.</hi> 153.</note>
nor so much as allow it as <hi>Chorus.</hi> I must try
if I can perswade him out of his Rigour. In
the</p>
            <p>First place then, why must not the <hi>Plutus</hi>
pass for <hi>New Comedy?</hi> Tis plainly not <hi>Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</hi>
Right, the <hi>Surveyor</hi> grants as much;
The <hi>deviations,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Surv. <hi>p.</hi> 254, 258.</note> says he, <hi>in it from the former
practice, make it lead up the Van of the Middle
Comedy.</hi> Now the difference between <hi>Middle</hi>
and <hi>New Comedy</hi> seem'd so insignificant to the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:54372:50"/>
learn'd <hi>Turnebus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Duplex est apud Graecos Comaedia Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua &amp; Nova. Turneb in Lib. 10. Instit. Quintil. cap. 1. Surv. <hi>p.</hi> 259.</note> that he branches the <hi>Greek</hi>
Comedy into no more than two Divisions,
<hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New.</hi> To which I may add, that

            </p>
            <p>His next objection is that the <hi>Plutus</hi> has no
<hi>true Chorus:</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Surv. <hi>p.</hi> 253.</note> Just now it had none at all: But
I find he flags in his Prosecution. But why
is it no <hi>true Chorus? Aristophanes</hi> who wrote
the Play, I suppose liked it well enough, and
calls it a <hi>Chorus;</hi> and tis somewhat hard his
word cannot be taken; If he did not make
it as he should do, he must answer for it not
I.<note place="margin">Scalig. Poet.</note> 
               <hi>Dacier</hi> likewise affirms the <hi>Chorus</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued

               <note place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 7.</note> Nay the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor</hi>'s
<hi>Scaliger</hi> confesses the <hi>Chorus</hi> was taken
out; and if so, one would think twas in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
But the <hi>Chorus</hi> seems to be in a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to defend it self, and to have all reasonable
Requisites,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

and offers to sing in the Parabases.<note place="margin">Chor. in Plut. Act. 5. sc. 3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But after all, the <hi>Surveyor</hi> won't allow it
to be a <hi>legitimate Chorus:</hi> No! Not when
<hi>Aristophanes</hi> was the Father on't, and owns
the Issue! Well, I can't produce the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and therefore if one Side of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogy
won't satisfie, I must leave him. But
I'm to blame for talking of these matters, for
it seems I read no more of the <hi>Plutus</hi> than
<hi>the List of the Persons of the Drama;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Surv. <hi>p.</hi> 262.</note> why
then, I had a notable guess with me, for I
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:54372:50"/>
have abstracted the <hi>Dialogue</hi> for some Pages
together,<note place="margin">View, <hi>p.</hi> 39.</note> as the Reader may perceive if he
pleases: I think a little more Modesty would
do this Author no harm.</p>
            <p>My Inference from <hi>Aristotle</hi> (as <hi>oblique</hi> as
it is) for the Continuance of the <hi>Chorus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Survey. <hi>p.</hi> 263.</note> I
shall venture with his Exceptions, only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
that where he says the <hi>Magistrates gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Chorus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 265.</note> 
               <hi>means nothing but paying the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:</hi>
He should have said the <hi>Actors</hi> in the
<hi>Chorus;</hi> for so <hi>Aristotle</hi> is interpreted by <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
and <hi>Goulston.</hi> And whereas he affirms <hi>'tis
certain,</hi> Menander <hi>had no Chorus;</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 267.</note> He should
have given us something better than his
bare Word for't, considering <hi>Menander</hi> is
lost, and there's no appealing to the Author.
If he argues, that <hi>Menander</hi> had no <hi>Chorus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his Imitator <hi>Terence</hi> has none, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
is not good. For tho a <hi>Chorus</hi> is
not to be found in the Remains of <hi>Plautus</hi>
and <hi>Terence,</hi> yet <hi>Dacier</hi> is positive, that the
<hi>Romans</hi> made use of it in Comedy,<note place="margin">Remarques sur L' Art Poetique D' Horace Tom. 10. p. 298.</note> and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
the <hi>Fabulae Attellanae</hi> for an Instance.
He can't deny but that <hi>Moliere</hi> has reviv'd
the <hi>Chorus</hi> in Comedy: But then he pretends
the Poet was <hi>in his second Infancy, and us'd
this Expedient only as</hi> Crutches <hi>to support the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity
of his Age.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Survey. <hi>Ibid.</hi> &amp; p. 268.</note> But this Exception goes
upon a Mistake, both in the Reason, and the
History. <hi>First, Moliere</hi> was no such Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit
Person, for he Acted in his <hi>Malade Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginaire</hi>
not many Hours before his Death:
And, as I remember, the Writer of his Life
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:54372:51"/>
reports him not to have outlived his
Four and fiftieth year. And then, <hi>Secondly,</hi>
That the <hi>Chorus</hi> is no sign of a languid, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
Muse is clear from <hi>Quintilian,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Instit. Or. Lib. 10. cap. 1.</note> who
prefers the Spirit, Vigour, and Elocution of
the <hi>Old Comedy</hi> to that of the <hi>New.</hi> Now,
the <hi>Chorus</hi> the <hi>Surveyor</hi> grants had always a
part in the <hi>Old Comedy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He would gladly know to <hi>what end I would
have a Chorus in the English Comedy:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Survey. <hi>p.</hi> 268.</note> To this I
can only answer, That I am surpriz'd at his
Question, having given him no manner of
occasion for't.</p>
            <p>He goes on in his Defence of the Modern
Comedy, and alledges, that the <hi>success of
Libertines is not given to the Licentiousness,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 271.</note> 
               <hi>but
to the Wit and Sence,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which are predominant
in the Character.</hi> To this I answer,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That to make Lewdness Fortunate
and Fashionable, is a dangerous Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
For it takes off the Restraints of Shame,
gives a Varnish to the Vice, and heightens
the Temptation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Treating loose Characters with
Sence and Respect, provokes to Imitation,
and makes the Infection catching. Many
People are more inclinable to talk Wittily,
than to act Wisely. Now the Wit is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
not to be come at without the Liberti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism;
for the Matter is so contriv'd, that
the Sugar and the Ratsbane must go together.
The Wit, I say, lies generally in Luscious
Indecencies, and Outrages of Virtue and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:54372:51"/>
Religion: 'Tis brisk only because 'tis bold,
and rather spits than sparkles: Its Spirits are
but Lees a little alembick'd, and like some
Wood it shines only in its Rotteness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 272.</note> As to his <hi>Forgers</hi> and <hi>Pick-pockets</hi>
he talks of, his Conveyance, I take it, is not
very clean. If he must make use of these
Gentlemen, let his Pickpocket be seated on
the <hi>Bench,</hi> let him appear with Figure and
Equipage, swagger in the <hi>Court,</hi> ridicule the
Judges, and banter the Laws; and always
have a Pack'd Jury to bring him Honourably
off. Let but this be done, and then we need
not question but the Mystery of Cutting a
Purse would soon drop its ill Character, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
into a Creditable Profession; and it
may be, as much Studied as <hi>Coke upon Littleton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I urged in the <hi>View, &amp;c.</hi> That <hi>Horace</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
expresly mention'd the Progress of
Comedy,<note place="margin">View, <hi>p.</hi> 151.</note> advised the Poet to form his Work
upon the Precepts of <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> and
the Models of Moral Philosophy; and from
hence I infer'd, that by <hi>Horace</hi>'s Rule the
Poet was oblig'd to Sobriety of Conduct, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this the <hi>Surveyor</hi> replies, That <hi>the List
of Qualifications mention'd by</hi> Horace, <hi>seem pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
only for Tragick and Epick Poetry.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Survey, <hi>p.</hi> 275.</note> His
Reason is, because the Business seems too pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
and too much rais'd for <hi>Comedy.</hi> But
under favour, there's no need of <hi>Buskins:</hi>
For the Description descends to private Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
to the Regards of Blood, and the Laws
of Friendship: Now these Duties, in the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:54372:52"/>
Judgment of <hi>Quintilian,</hi> were taught no
where better than in the Comedies of <hi>Menan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi>

of <hi>Horace,</hi> to relate to <hi>Comedy. (Tom.</hi> 10.
p. 57.)</p>
            <p>The <hi>Surveyor</hi> makes another little stand,
and fences with the Distinction between <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
and <hi>Poetical Manners;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Survey. <hi>p.</hi> 277.</note> affirming, that
<hi>Horace</hi> is to be understood of <hi>Manners</hi> only
in the latter Sence. But by this Gentleman's
favour, 'tis pretty plain, that <hi>Horace</hi> must
mean both; To what purpose else should he
recommend the Rules, and Writings of <hi>Plato,</hi>
and <hi>Socrates?</hi> These great Men gave no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions

            <p>The <hi>Surveyor,</hi> who is extreamly eager to

               <note place="margin">P. 278.</note>
It may be so: However, 'twas sufficient for
Purpose and Occasion. And besides, this
place gave him notice of another, where
there is a Description much as full, tho not

the <hi>Surveyor</hi> cries, <hi>I run upon the wrong Scent,</hi>
argue too fast from the Premisses, and <hi>because
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54372:52"/>
Modesty is the Character of Women,</hi> misinfer,<note place="margin">Surv. <hi>p.</hi> 286, 287.</note>
that <hi>no Woman must be shewn without it.</hi> Yes,
I stand by the Conclusion, That no Woman
ought to be shewn without <hi>Modesty,</hi> unless she
appears for Censure and Infamy, or, as
Mr. <hi>Rymer</hi> speaks, <hi>to be kick'd in Comedy.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> Defence, <hi>p.</hi> 10, 11, 16, &amp;c.</note> And
even then, there ought to be a Regard to the
Audience; and tho the Character is foul, the
Language should be clean.</p>
            <p>But to bring single Women, and Quality
fo that Sex, under these Disorders, is still
more unaccountable. 'Tis a direct crossing
upon Nature and Custom, and a breach of
Manners, both Ceremonious and Poetick.
For, do Virgins and Bawds. Discourse in the
same Dialect? Is there no difference between
Ladies and little Prostitutes? Or, Is Rampan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Lewdness the Character of Breeding?
If not, why is Nature thus disguis'd, and
Quality mismark'd, and all to the Disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of Sobriety? But the <hi>Surveyor</hi> objects,
<hi>That tho Courage is the Characteristick of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sex,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Survey. <hi>p.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>yet 'tis neither Solecism nor general Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front,
to represent a Man a Coward.</hi> To this I
answer,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That Courage is not reckon'd a
Quality so essential to a Man, as Modesty to a
Woman; The Expectation of it is not so
general, nor the Failure so monstrous; and
therefore his Instance is not parallel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There are some Circumstances
and Conditions of Life, which tie this Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification
faster, and as it were incorporate it
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:54372:53"/>
to the Sex<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and that is Breeding, Quality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And to argue upon his own similitude;
Tho to <hi>represent Men sometimes as Cowards, may
be no Solecism,</hi> yet to represent <hi>Hercules</hi> or
<hi>Hector,</hi> such, would be great Impropriety.
Now, Decency of Language is as much the
Character of Gentlewomen, as Bravery is of
Heroes; so that to give a Lady the nauseous
Liberties of a Procuress, degrades her in her
Quality, and is both affronting and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This Practice, as I have prov'd it,
being frequent, and without Censure upon
our <hi>Stage,</hi> is still more unpardonable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I observ'd, that this Freedom
was a Breach of good Behaviour to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
of which he is pleas'd not to take
any notice.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Surveyor</hi> urges farther, <hi>That the Vices of
particular Women,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Survey, <hi>p.</hi> 290.</note> 
               <hi>are no Affront to the Sex in
general;</hi> But this Excuse, were it true, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Limitation, would not serve his Turn.
For I have prov'd, That the <hi>English Stage</hi>
have given the Women a Coarse Character
in general,<note place="margin">View, <hi>p.</hi> 171, 172, 173.</note> and play'd their Satyr upon the
whole Sex.</p>
            <p>But before I proceed, I must not forget how
the <hi>Surveyor</hi> takes occasion to tell us, That <hi>in
Plays the Characters are neither Vniversal nor
general:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Survey. <hi>p.</hi> 288.</note> His first Reason is, because <hi>Marks so
comprehensive are the Impressions and Signatures
of Nature, which are not to be corrected or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
by us.</hi> Now one would have thought
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:54372:53"/>
the Characters would have been the better
for answering the truest proportion; and
coming up to the Standard. This appears to
have been <hi>Horace</hi>'s Opinion, who recommends
it as a Rule to his Stage Poet.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Respicere exemplar vitae morumque jubebo<note place="margin">De Art. Poet.</note>
               </l>
               <l>Doctum imitatorem, &amp; ver as hinc ducere voces.</l>
            </q>
            <p>That is, as <hi>Dacier</hi> interprets him, <q>Nature
is the right Plan for <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Manners.</hi>
And therefore a good Poet, who has a
mind to bring a Covetous, or Ambitious
Person upon the Stage, will choose to form
the Image more upon Idea, than Example;
and Paint him rather from general Notion,
than particular Life,</q>
               <q>Et ver as hinc ducere voces.</q>
            </p>
            <p>For this is consulting the Original, and
the way to <q>give Truth, and Strength to the
Resemblance. Whereas to draw from Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
in the World, is, as <hi>Plato</hi> speaks,
no more than a Second-Hand Likeness, and
but Copying at the best.</q> In Individuals a
Quality is often cramp'd and disguis'd by
other Passions, and does not strike out to its
full extent: But an Idea considers the progress
of Inclination, makes way for Fancy and
Freedom, and gives a Character its just Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
and Distinction. And therefore those
Images which are fit for Sight, should be taken
from thence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:54372:54"/>
The <hi>Surveyor</hi> objects in the next place, That
<hi>such comprehensive Marks give us no Idea of the
Person Characteriz'd,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>but what is common to the
rest of the Species, and don't sufficiently distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
him.</hi> But the reason of this Objection
stands upon nice Ground, and will be apt to
run off into unwarrantable Practice: To keep
the Character within the Crowd, is the most
inoffensive Method. Indeed the Distinction
ought not to turn upon Persons, but Things,
The Quality should be mark'd, but not the
Man; and the Vice expos'd, without point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Vitious.</p>
            <p>For to descend to Particulars, and fall to
<hi>Characterizing,</hi> is no better than Libel, and
Personal Abuse. In short, the Poet should
endeavour to abstract the Fault from the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi>
to hover in Generals, and fly at the
whole Covey: For if he once comes to single
out his Quarry, he discovers himself a Bird
of Prey.</p>
            <p>His saying the <hi>Impresses, and Signatures of
Nature, are not to be corrected or improv'd, and
therefore not to be meddled with,</hi> is a great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake.
For if these <hi>Impresses</hi> and <hi>Signatures,</hi>
are any better than <hi>Iargon,</hi> he must mean the
good and bad Qualities incident to Humane
Nature. Now take them either way, and
his Proposition is not true. For, First, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's
Miscarriages are by no means inevitable.
The Blemishes in Conduct, and Character, are
the Consequences of Choice. The Faults of
Nature in this sence, are none of her Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:54372:54"/>
and therefore very capable of Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And then, as for the Virtues, and noble
Qualities, if they are sometimes heighten'd
above Practice, where is the harm on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>t? Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
does not reach up to the utmost extent
of Power. And therefore if Nature was
shewn to the best Advantage, and stretch'd
to the length of her Capacity, the Pattern
might be serviceable, and awaken to Industry,
and Imitation.</p>
            <p>We are now coming to the Parallel of the
<hi>Expressions,</hi> and here the <hi>Surveyor</hi> gives in a
Collection of <hi>Smut</hi> and <hi>Prophaneness,</hi> in
which he pretends the Poets of <hi>Greece</hi> and
<hi>Rome,</hi> are more Licentious than ours. He
acquaints us besides, according to his Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
Flourishes, that he has some hundreds
of Instances in Reserve. And yet after all,
he <hi>desires the Reader to take notice,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Survey, <hi>p.</hi> 292.</note> 
               <hi>that he does
not charge these Passages as Faults, or Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
upon the Antients, &amp;c.</hi> How careful he
is not to fall foul on Debauchery? He
seems afraid left the Reader should mistake
him for a Person that lay under some faint
Prepossessions of Modesty. Yes: The Pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of Virtue, and the Pretences to Religion,
are uncreditable Qualities, and a Man must
clear his Reputation of them as well as he
can! He charges the Licentiousness of the
<hi>Antients</hi> with Immorality! By no means!
That would be <hi>soure</hi> and <hi>Cynical</hi> indeed! He
understands himself better than to range
Smut, and Profaneness, under Immorality!
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54372:55"/>
Such a Censure would recoyl upon himself.
If these Practices are Faults, then his whole
<hi>Book</hi> is little better than a Defence of Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and a Plea for Irreligion. The truth
of this Imputation, tho a severe one, is very
evident: For having brought several gross
Instances of Indecency out of <hi>Plautus</hi> he
justifies the Imitation of them; And roundly
affirms, That since <hi>Antient, and Modern Poets,
ought to be govern'd by the same Laws, 'tis but
reason, that one as well as 'tother, should be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
the benefit of them:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Survey. <hi>p.</hi> 293.</note> That is, the benefit
of Smut and Lewdness. Thus the <hi>English
Dramatists</hi> are brought off without the least
Blemish or Blot in their Scutcheon. But here's
more Comfort for them behind: For he is
pleas'd to affirm,<note place="margin">P. 367.</note> That <hi>if the Passages of the
Antient Poets were compar'd with those produced
by me out of the Moderns, the comparative Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Profaneness of the latter would vanish.</hi>
And yet he takes particular care to inform the
<hi>Reader,</hi> That he <hi>does not charge the Antients
with any Faults, or Immoralities upon this score:</hi>
Adding withall, That the <hi>Moderns</hi> ought to
have the Benefit of the same Liberty. From
whence 'tis plain to a Demonstration, That
this Author has given the <hi>Stage</hi> a greater La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
and prompted them to an Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in Distraction. They may, it seems,
lard their Plays thicker with Obscenities, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
their Oaths faster, and double their Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies.
Well! I perceive Wickedness
would have a glorious time on't under this
<hi>Surveyor!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:54372:55"/>
But is he sure after all, that <hi>the Antient and
Modern Poets, as Poets, are to be govern'd by
the same Laws.</hi> Is there no difference between
the Doctrines of Heathenism and Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?
Are the Objects of Worship the same
in both? And are Knowledge and Ignorance
to be treated with the same Allowance? I
thought the <hi>Modern Poets,</hi> as well as other
People, had been under the Jurisdiction of
God Almighty, and tied up to the Laws of
the <hi>Gospel.</hi> But it seems the Stage is all <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chises,</hi>
and Privileg'd Ground: The Muses
have a particular Exemption, and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
is dispenc'd with by the <hi>Poet.</hi> This is
the <hi>Surveyor</hi>'s Reasoning. However, to give
him his due, he has formerly been not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
of this Opinion. For elsewhere he
tells us, That <hi>the main business of a Chorus is
cut off by our Religion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Survey. <hi>p.</hi> 268, 269.</note> which is the reason we
<hi>have no Hymns nor Anthems sung upon the Stage,</hi>
but make use of Smutty Songs in stead of
them. I find then by his own Confession,
that the change of Religion has some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon the <hi>Stage:</hi> This was his former
Judgment, but he improves by Writing, and
his last <hi>Will</hi> must stand.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Surveyor</hi> in his <hi>Parallel,</hi> blackens the
<hi>Antients</hi> most unmercifully, and swells their
Charge beyond all Truth and Proportion.
This is done to make the Moderns look the
more tolerable, and keep them the better in
Countenance. But a little Pains will serve
to wipe off most of the Spots, and restore
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54372:56"/>
them to their Complexion. And here I
can't help observing, That let the Antients
be as faulty as may be, the <hi>Surveyor</hi> should
by no means pretend to discover it: For he
has already fully acquitted the <hi>Greek</hi> and
<hi>Roman Dramatists</hi> of all Imputations of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency,
and roundly pronounced, That tho
the <hi>Mimi</hi> were scandalously Lewd,<note place="margin">Survey. <hi>p.</hi> 23, 24.</note> the <hi>Drama</hi>
was not at all. But to return:</p>
            <p>Before he draws out upon the Old Poets,
he endeavours to defend his <hi>Ophelia.</hi> And
here he tells us a long Story, how <hi>warrantable
her Love was,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Survey. <hi>p.</hi> 293, 294</note> how <hi>artfully manur'd,</hi> and strongly
<hi>forc'd up;</hi> And by his Description, one
would think he was raising a Muskmelon.
But then, as ill Luck, and the Poet would
have it, her Humble Servant <hi>Hamlet killing
her Father by mistake, and counterfeiting Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
ruined all. This Misfortune <hi>must needs
make horrible Convulsions in a Mind so tender,</hi>
and, as the <hi>Surveyor</hi> Compliments the Ladies,
<hi>in a Sex so weak.</hi> Well: Her Father was
kill'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But, what then? Must she needs
Lament in Smut, and pay her Respects in
Distraction? Are Luscious Expressions the
Natural Effect of <hi>Deep Sorrow,</hi> and can't she
appear <hi>Tender,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 294</note> without being Rotten?</p>
            <p>However,<note place="margin">P. 296.</note> to do the <hi>Surveyor</hi> right, he has
produced the Exceptionable Lines, for 'twas
the <hi>Song</hi> which I complain'd of. And this,
if you'l believe him, is so innocent, that
there's <hi>no fear of offending the Modesty of the
most Chast Ear.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 295.</note> I'm sorry he seems to have
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:54372:56"/>
lost the very Notion of Deceny. He's
more to blame for <hi>transcribing,</hi> then <hi>Ophelia</hi>
was for Singing this Ditty, because he wants
her Madness for his Excuse. Now 'tis but
an untoward Business, when a Man is the
worse for being in his Wits.</p>
            <p>But now the <hi>Surveyor</hi> is come to his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>section
of the <hi>Old Poets:</hi> And here his Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the Body is admirable; and to
magnifie his Skill, he spies out more Diseases
then e're the Patient died of. He often ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns
an Innocent Expression, and when 'tis
not so, his Paraphrase is much grosser than
the Text. For 'tis generally his way when
he lights upon a sore place, to make it much
worse for the Dressing. However, he seems
to have gotten a very agreeable Subject: For
his Ink flows amain, and his Invention grows
very copious: He seems to Swim at his Ease,
and his Fancy plays down the Stream,
and tumbles in the Mud, with great Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            <p>He begins with <hi>Sophocles</hi>'s <hi>Antigone:</hi> This
Lady he pretends makes some Intemperate
Discoveries, and does not keep up to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies
of Sex, and Condition. To under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
something of the <hi>Fable,</hi> this <hi>Antigone</hi>
was by King <hi>Creon</hi> her Uncle, sentenc'd to
be shut up in a Cave, and starv'd to death,
only for burying her Brother <hi>Polynices</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the King's Order: She was likewise
contracted to his Son <hi>Haemon.</hi> Now, tho
she had stood firm against the Menaces of

               <hi>Creon,</hi> and shewn her self Brave and good
Natur'd to an extraordinary pitch; yet
when she comes to be led to Execution, her
Fortitude gives way a little to the Tenderness
of her Sex; she breaks out into some natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Starts of Concern, and according to the
Custom of that Age, and the Eastern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,
<note n="*" place="margin">Iudg. 11. <hi>v.</hi> 37.</note> laments her dying young and single.
But she makes a shift to govern her Language,
and keeps her Passion from boiling over. I
shall transcribe his most serviceable Line, in
which she Complains of the Disappointment
of her Fortune, and that she must go off.</p>

Well: <hi>Dolus latet in Generalibus</hi> is a true say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
The <hi>Surveyor</hi> has hid himself in a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio,
and now is safe enough:<note place="margin">Virg. Aeneid. 8.</note> He loves like
<hi>Caeus</hi> to make a Smother in his Cave, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
his foul Play. Indeed I think the Smoke
is his best Defence, and the finding him out
the hardest part of the Enterprize. To come
up with him.</p>
            <p>His Instance in <hi>Hermione</hi> and <hi>Andromache,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Surv.</hi> p. 312. <hi>Androm.</hi> p. 301, 302, 303.</note>
is altogether short. They chide, 'tis true, a little
too warmly for their Quality, if we Breed
them by our own Times; but nothing foul
or disorderly passes between them: And as
for <hi>Creusa,</hi> his quarrel with her is nothing but
ill-will: For she does not in the least run her
self a ground in her Story,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ion.</hi> p. 317, 333, 334. P. 351.</note> but relates her
Misfortune with great reservedness. Neither
does her Son <hi>Ion</hi> put any uncivil Question
to her. His Modesty is very defensible, if
not his Manners: Tho' even in this latter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
the young People upon the Stage are
now more free with their Parents than this
comes to. And lastly, <hi>Electra</hi> is innocent of
the Accusation he brings against her. 'Tis
true, she encourages <hi>Orestes</hi> to kill his <hi>Mother,</hi>
but then she stands clear of Indecency, and
says nothing in that respect, misbecoming
her Character: So far from that, that she

won't so much as mention the Debaucheries of
<hi>Aegystus;</hi> no not when she was recounting
his other Villanies, and triumphing in his

in Murther and Injustice, but when
she came to his Lewdness, she cuts off her
Story, and declares it, no fit Subject for a

Length and Circumstances. Sometimes to
distinguish a foul Thought, they deliver it
in <hi>Scripture Phrase,</hi> and set it in Gold to make
it sparkle the better. In short, they omit
nothing to explain the Mystery, and culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
the Interest of Debauchery: Nothing
that may fortifie the Poison, and make it

            <p>The <hi>Surveyor</hi> opens the Case farther against<note place="margin">Surv. <hi>p.</hi> 329, 330.</note>
               <hi>Plautus,</hi> and presses the Particulars of the
Charge. And first his <hi>Amphitruo</hi> is loaded
with a heavy Accusation. But the best on't
is, here's a mistake of the <hi>Person,</hi> which is
enough in all Conscience to quash the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment.
That Rankness of Language which
the <hi>Surveyor</hi> charges upon <hi>Plautus,</hi> is all <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpolation,</hi>
and belongs to another Author.
Now as the Poet has no reason to answer
for what does not belong to him, so these
<hi>ungenuine Additions</hi> were particularly except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by me.<note place="margin">View, <hi>p.</hi> 18.</note> My Adversary, if he writes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake,
must needs know these decent Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were nothing to his purpose. But pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
the Nosegay was made up, for a Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
to the <hi>Reader,</hi> and to oblige his own
Smelling: And to make <hi>Plautus</hi> amends for
giving him more then his due, he's resolv'd
to take something from him: For at the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
end of <hi>Amphytrio,</hi> he slides away the
word <hi>facere,</hi>

and makes <hi>Compliance</hi> sound up to obscenity.<note place="margin">Amph. Act. 5. Sc. 2.</note>
But this is no wonder, for I observe the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor</hi>
is mightily light-finger'd this way, and
generally steals off the Modesty of an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.
And to aggravate the Theft, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
is more Malice, than Necessity: For he
does not filch, to make use of his Neighbours
Goods, but to destroy them.</p>

His Objection against the Morality of the
Dialogue between <hi>Demaenetus</hi> and <hi>Argyrippus</hi>
in the <hi>Asinaria,</hi> is out of the Question: I
warranted no farther than the <hi>Expression,</hi> nor
that neither, but with reference to the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His next Instance is in the <hi>Curculio,</hi> where
<hi>Phaedromus</hi> and <hi>Planesium</hi> salute each other

observe, they had not seen one another for
some time, and the Visit was made with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty:
And under such Circumstances, had
they been both of the same Sex, they might
have discover'd some Affection extraordinary.
However he can't say the Expression is foul,

I have much more reason to condole with
him for the loss of his own. For <hi>Olympio,</hi>
upon whom he would make his Advantage,
will do him no service, the Liberties of this
Slave in the <hi>Casina</hi> are expresly barred both
by Name and Play, and stand first in the List
of the Exception. I grant <hi>Cleostrata</hi> urges

               <hi>Olympio</hi> to tell the Story,<note place="margin">View, <hi>p.</hi> 17.</note> but then tho the
Drift of her Fancy may be amiss, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion

one Line, which, if not interpreted to
her Ignorance,<note place="margin">Survey, <hi>p</hi> 337.</note> is no more then a double <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendre.
Artemona</hi>'s Allegory in the <hi>Asinaria</hi>
is somewhat less offensive than this, tho
none of the most reserv'd. Thus he has
made a shift to muster up two exceptionable
Sentences of Women of some Consideration
in <hi>Plautus.</hi> But alass! What are these to the

Here the Weeds are extreamly rank, and

the <hi>Reader</hi> might be plentifully furnish'd

            <p>The <hi>Surveyor</hi> has something farther with
<hi>Artemona,</hi> and pretends <hi>her Frankness gave her
Slave</hi> Parasitus <hi>the boldness to put a very unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

This was somewhat of the Case of the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<hi>Demenetus,</hi> who was discover'd at Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

that the Appearance was fair, is evident
from the Slaves Advices to his Mistress: He
desires her to stay a little for Information

            <p>I observ'd farther to the Advantage of

exception: And this latter was only guilty
of one over airy Expression.</q> But it seems
the <hi>Surveyor</hi> is somewhat sharper at these En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries,
and after his rummaging over 20 Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
has catched <hi>Periplectimines</hi> tripping in

is against the <hi>Epilogue</hi> in the <hi>Casina.</hi>
And here I grant the Principle is ill enough,
but that is foreign to the Question. But for
any other Objection, I can't perceive the
strength of it. For, as to the last Line, upon
which I suppose he founds himself, this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
seems rather to contain an ill Wish, and
a Menace of Disappointment, than any thing
else.<note n="*" place="margin">Vid. Donat. in Loc.</note> Besides; As to Debauch't Principle,

the <hi>Prologue</hi> to the <hi>Plot and no Plot,</hi> is as bad

            <p>And can the <hi>Surveyor</hi> now find in his heart
to compare the <hi>Prologues</hi> and <hi>Epilogues</hi> of

            </p>
            <p>And here his Spleen against the Church dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
him extreamly, and indeed almost
throws him into Fits. He would gladly say
something to purpose against the Clergy, but
the Subject fails him. This makes him rail
most unmercifully; for Spight and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
together are generally very Clamorous
and Impertinent.</p>
            <p>To shew the unreasonableness of the <hi>Stage</hi>-Scurrilities
upon the <hi>Clergy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>View,</hi> p. 127.</note> I endeavour'd to

            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:54372:65"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> Because of their Relation to the
Deity, <q>where I observ'd that Christian Priests
are the Principal Ministers of God's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
They Represent his Person, Publish
his Law, Pass his Pardons, and Preside in
his Worship.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I thought these things had been so plain
that they needed no confirmation, but since
the <hi>Surveyor</hi> contests the Point, I shall briefly
make it good. Now, I desire to know of
the <hi>Surveyor,</hi> what it is to Represent another?
Is it not to be his Agent, and to Manage his
Affairs by vertue of his Authority? And
does not the Priest Seal Covenants in God's
Name?<note place="margin">St. Math. 28. 19.</note> Does he not Baptize by Commission,
and Exercise part of that Power which our
Saviour had upon Earth?<note place="margin">St. Ioh. 20. 21.</note> The <hi>Surveyor</hi>'s Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
upon this Head is amazingly ridieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous:
For by his reasoning no Man can <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
the Person of God,</hi> without being <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
of the Divine Attributes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Survey.</hi> p. 346, 347.</note> and able <hi>to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
the Figure of Omnipotence.</hi> As much as
to say, That a Prince can't send another as
his Ambassadour, unless his Person, Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
and Appearance, is equal to his own.
And therefore if the Ambassadour falls short
of his Master in the Advantages of Body, or
Mind, in the Extent of his Dominions, or
the Magnificence of his Retinue; If any
thing of this happens, let the Credentials be
what they will, the Characters it seems sinks,
and the Representation becomes impossible.
This is strong Reasoning, I confess, for it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54372:66"/>
argues the World in Pieces. At this
rate Princes must Travel to keep the Peace,
and Transact all their Matters by Interview,
and Personal Visit: <hi>For a Plenipotentiary</hi> is a
dangerous thing: They can't prefer a Subject
to an Embassy, without communicating their
Royalty, and making an Equal to themselves.
And thus the <hi>Surveyor</hi> has gone a great way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
breaking the Correspondence of <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
Farther, I thought the <hi>Surveyor</hi> would have
allow'd <hi>Angels,</hi> at least, for their Name sake,
to have Represented God almighty: But by
this Reasoning <hi>Michael</hi> himself is struck out
of Capacity, and the highest Order of Spirits
unqualified for the Office: For no Created
Being has any of the <hi>Divine Attributes,</hi> nor
which is more, can have them.</p>
            <p>He says the Regards that I insist on for the<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Survey,</hi> p. 347, 348.</note>
Priesthood, belongs to the <hi>Governours of the
Church.</hi> Now, tho he mayn't know it, Priests
are Governours, within their Precinct; They
have <hi>Regimen Animarum,</hi> the Guidance of Souls,
and the Concerns of Eternity in their Care,
and that one would think were none of the
least Interest of the Parish. I grant <hi>Theatrum</hi>
is a hard Word to construe, but I fancied
the <hi>Surveyor</hi> might have known the <hi>English</hi> of
<hi>Rector</hi> well enough. By this time, I hope,
the <hi>Representation</hi> may be allow'd. But then
as to the Authority of <hi>publishing the Laws of
God, passing his Pardons,</hi> and <hi>presiding in his
Worship,</hi> these Privileges, he says, were pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to the <hi>Apostles.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Survey,</hi> p. 348.</note> But his Affirmation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:54372:66"/>
the Holy Scriptures teach us, That <hi>the
People are to seek the Law at the Priest's Mouth,
for he is the Messenger of the Lord of Hosts.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Malach. 2. 72 Art. 37.</note>
And the Church of <hi>England</hi> in her Form of
<hi>Ordination</hi> gives the Priest Authority to <hi>preach
the Word of God,</hi> and <hi>to Minister the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>St.</hi> Joh. 20. 21, 23.</note>
And which in her <hi>Articles</hi> she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
to belong to the Supream Civil Power:
And as for the Power of <hi>Passing Pardons,</hi> and
giving Absolution, 'tis founded upon that
Solemn Commission given by our Saviour.
<hi>As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you,
whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto
them, and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd.</hi>
And can any one imagine that Words
so plain in the Expression, and so solemn in
the Occasion, are void of Weight and Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification?
Not to mention the right they
imply of Admitting into the Church, and
Excluding from it; Not to mention this,
they must amount to this Meaning at the
lowest, That those who neglect this Ordinance
of God, and refuse to apply for Absolution to
Persons thus Authoriz'd, shan't have their Sins
forgiven, tho otherwise not unqualified.
And thus, to put a resembling Case, a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor
can't have the benefit of the Prince's
Pardon unless it passes the Seals, and runs
through the Forms of Law. And that this
Power was not peculiar to the Apostles, but
design'd for a standing Advantage, and settled
upon the Successions of the Hierarchy; is
plain by the Doctrine, and practice of our
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:54372:67"/>
own Church: For at the Ordination of
Priests the Authority of <hi>Remitting</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining</hi>
Sin, is confer'd in the same Words,
<hi>Whosesoever Sins ye remit, &amp;c.</hi> And in the
Office for the <hi>Visitation for the Sick,</hi> the Priest
making express mention of his <hi>Authority</hi> from
our Saviour, absolves the Penitent <hi>from all
his Sins, in the Name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as this Authority of the Priest is thus
fully maintain'd by the <hi>Church,</hi> so 'tis no less
acknowledg'd by the <hi>State:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Eliz.</note> For the Book of
<hi>Common Prayer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">14 Car. 2.</note> with the <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Ordination,
&amp;c.</hi> stands upon a bottom of <hi>Law,</hi> and
has Two <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> to defend it. For
tho the Spiritual Privileges of the Priesthood
are independent of the Civil Magistrate, yet
the <hi>Statutes</hi> above-mention'd imply an Assent to
the Charter deliver'd by our Saviour, and
are a fair Acknowledgment of the Power.
And thus, the <hi>Surveyor,</hi> to make a Blow at
the <hi>Clergy,</hi> has charg'd through Gospel and
Law, contradicted the <hi>Bible</hi> and the <hi>Statute</hi>-Book,
and fallen foul upon the Highest Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But still he <hi>questions,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Survey. p. 348.</note> 
               <hi>whether</hi> the <hi>Commission</hi>
of every Christian Priest <hi>be of equal extent
and validity</hi> with that of <hi>the Apostles.</hi> I grant
the first part of his Proposition: That the
Apostles had peculiar Advantages in their
Authority, and that their Jurisdiction was
larger than that of succeeding Priests, or
Bishops either, is not denied. But tho their
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54372:67"/>
Commission was larger, 'twas not more valid
than that of the present Priesthood. For
this stands upon the Authority of the <hi>New
Testament,</hi> upon the Credit of undoubted
Succession, and the known Practice of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom
for almost Seventeen hundred years
together. What, tho <hi>they are not call'd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
by God himself,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>nor endued with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
and Miraculous Faculties,</hi> does this
affect the Credibility of their <hi>Credentials?</hi> I
suppose Princes are the Ministers of God,
and deputed to Govern under him; And
must the Proof of their Commission depend
upon <hi>Miracles</hi> and <hi>immediate</hi> Designation?
Must they be proclaim'd from the Clouds,
and Anointed by an Angel from Heaven?
And are not their Subjects to own them till
they can make out their Title by Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Evidence; by the Gift of Tongues,
and raising the Dead? The absurdity of
these Consequences may inform the <hi>Surveyor,</hi>
that there's no need of a Miraculous <hi>Creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Surveyor</hi> in stating the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Ordinary Priests, and the <hi>Apostles,</hi>
makes several Mistakes: And were he in the
right, the Dispute is foreign to the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy.
He affirms the Apostles <hi>Doctrine</hi> had
<hi>no other Evidence than their own Affirmation and</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Survey,</hi> p. 349.</note>
               <hi>the Works that they did:</hi> Yes: They had more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
the Completion of Prophecies, and
the Agreement of the <hi>Old Testament;</hi> And
these Corroborating Circumstances, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:54372:68"/>
considerable. He goes on, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
in abatement of the present Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
That Persons of this Order <hi>have no
natural Gifts above other Men, to warrant a
Pretence to an extraordinary Mission.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 349, 350.</note> Is the
Bounty of God then confin'd to Privilege<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>
of Nature? Or, Is he not at liberty to chuse
what Officers he pleases? I conceive the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor</hi>
won't deny this. Had the Apostles
then any of these Advantages above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?
so far from that, that they seem ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to fall short of the common Standard.
Their Apprehensions at first were very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
and their Reason check'd by a low Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
And which is more, they were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
chosen for these Disadvantages: For this
made their Doctrine the more unquestion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and the Evidence of their Inspiration
the greater. To see such unpromising Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
so Wise in their Discourse, so Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
in their Actions, and so Unusual in
their Success, must needs convince the World
that God was with them. And thus the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor</hi>'s
Assertion is false both in Fact, and
Reasoning.</p>
            <p>His saying, That this Commission of the
Apostles and their Successors, expir'd upon
the Conversion of Princes to Christianity,
is a great mistake: The Church is still Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent,
her Authority unalterable, neither
is she in Things purely Spiritual, <hi>subordinate</hi>
to the Civil Power. This Truth I have else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
proved at large,<note place="margin">Moral Essays, Office Chap.</note> and thither I refer the

The <hi>Surveyor</hi> in speaking to the <hi>Importance</hi>
of the Priests <hi>Office,</hi> would not allow him to
<hi>preside any more in Gods Worship, than a Clerk
in Parliament presides over the House,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Survey.</hi> p. 352.</note> 
               <hi>because be
reads the Bills, and Petitions to them.</hi> It seems
then the Relation of the Priest, and the
Congregation, is the same with that of the
<hi>Clerk to the Parliament.</hi> What would this
Author be at? Does he mean, that when
the Priest reads the <hi>Bible,</hi> the People may
Debate whether it shall pass or not, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
into <hi>Yeas</hi> and <hi>Noes,</hi> about saying <hi>Amen</hi>
to the Lord's Prayer. One would think by
his worthy similitude, that the People went
to Church to be Worship'd, and that the
<hi>Liturgie</hi> was only a Parcel of Humble Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
put up to the <hi>Parish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Surveyor is extreamly desirous to have<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Survey.</hi> p. 356.</note>

But against this Liberty, I have given my
Reasons at large; which when the <hi>Surveyor</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>View,</hi> &amp;c.</note>
has replied to, he may possibly hear farther
from me.</p>
            <p>My Adversary is now upon arguing against
the Plea of <hi>Prescription,</hi> and would gladly make
out, that the Heathen <hi>Stage</hi> has Treated the
Priests as Coarsly as the Christian. And
here <hi>Aeschylus</hi> is as surly as before, and won't
so much as appear in the Cause. However,
<hi>Sophocles</hi> lay in his way, and in he must
come; But then this Poet by his Air and
Heaviness, looks more like a Prisoner than a
Witness; Well! We must hear his Deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54372:69"/>
in his <hi>Ajax Flagellifer,</hi> What then is to
be done here? Does the Poet bait a Priest
like the <hi>Relapse?</hi> By no means. Does he
Represent a Priest in his <hi>Play?</hi> Not that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Then I suppose he spoke ill of him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
his Back? I confess that was not as it
should be. The best on't is, the Mischief
lies in a little compass: 'Tis all in a Line or
two at the end of the Play: Here the <hi>Chorus,</hi>
in regard of the surprizing Events they had
observ'd, are pleas'd to say, <hi>That seeing, was
Believing, and that ne're a Diviner could tell
before-hand, how matters would go.</hi>

            <p>Now if this Instance must have an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
I reply; That Prophets or Diviners
held a very small Proportion to the rest of
the Priests, so that the Censure, tho gentle,
falls only on the Skirts of the Profession.
But then to go even thus far, looks like
straining upon <hi>Sophocles.</hi> For the natural
meaning of the <hi>Moral</hi> seems to be thus;
<q>That Humane Foresight is short, and the

then rigs out this Pious Translation;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O Nature,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Surv. 362.</note> 
               <hi>what a Curse art thou upon Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals!</hi>
As much as to say, He has found a
Heathen President for the Blasphemy of the
<hi>Moderns:</hi> Whereas 'tis notoriously evident,
that here is not the least glance against Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence;
And that only the Endowments
and Advantages of Nature are meant by the
Expression.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Orestes</hi> is no more the <hi>Surveyor</hi>'s Friend
than <hi>Electra</hi> his Sister. For when <hi>Menelaus</hi>
question'd him about the Murther of his
Mother, he pleads the <hi>Oracle</hi> in his Excuse.
And when the other was surpriz'd at the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity
of the Order, He replies,
<q>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>

            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:54372:72"/>
That is, <q>We are not to dispute the Gods
Commands, but obey them, for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature is too big for Humane Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings.</q>
And if the <hi>Surveyor</hi> thinks this
too much a Paraphrase, <hi>Orestes</hi> shall speak in
his own Translation. 'Tis thus:<note place="margin">Survey. <hi>p.</hi> 362.</note> 
               <hi>We serve
the Gods whatever they be.</hi> Why then, it
seems, he did not question their Being, but
thought Religion very well worth the mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Yes: His Piety appears farther in his
next answer, for when <hi>Menelaus</hi> seem'd to
wonder why <hi>Apollo</hi> did not rescue him from
his Misfortune; He tells him,</p>
            <q>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>.</q>
            <p>That is, as the <hi>Scholiast</hi> interprets, <q>The
Gods are not suddain in their Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
But take time in Rewards, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,
to Try the Good, and Recover
the Evil.</q>
            </p>
            <p>His Objection from the <hi>Cyclops</hi> is fully<note place="margin">View, <hi>p.</hi> 94.</note>

must be cited, and the Gyant brought in,

a little <hi>Greek,</hi> tho nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,

            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Ion,</hi>

and advises her to another Revenge,
more in her Power.<note place="margin">Ion. <hi>p.</hi> 335.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude with <hi>Euripides, Hecuba,</hi> says
the <hi>Surveyor,</hi> thinks the Gods <gap reason="foreign">

and then he had been right.<note place="margin">Survey. <hi>p.</hi> 362.</note> As for <hi>Seneca</hi>
he stands barr'd:<note place="margin">Troad. 118.</note> Why then is his Athei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
<hi>Chorus</hi> produced,<note place="margin">

of the Earl of <hi>Rochester?</hi> Was this
Transition made for the Benefit of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
or in Honour of the Deceas'd? Not
the latter, for that Noble Lord, abhor'd such
Prophane Liberties at his Death. Thus, to
Refresh the Blemishes of his Life, is the
greatest Outrage to his Memory: 'Tis almost
enough to raise him upon the <hi>Surveyor,</hi> to
make his Ghost resent the Usage, and flash Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
in his Face; But after all, 'tis highly
improbable that the <hi>Chorus</hi> spoke the <hi>Poet's
Opinion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Surv. <hi>p.</hi> 363.</note> if, as <hi>Heinsius, Scaliger,</hi> and others
believe, 'twas written by <hi>Seneca</hi> the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher:
For every Body knows he was far
enough from being an Atheist.</p>
            <p>And now we have done with Authorities;
And here, tho the <hi>Surveyor</hi> has but very bad
Luck with his <hi>Poets,</hi> yet he has taken great
care to conceal the Misfortune; For in his
Citations he mentions neither <hi>Act,</hi> nor <hi>Page,</hi>
but refers to the <hi>Plays</hi> at large. This, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
is the right way to discourage the
<hi>Reader's</hi> Enquiry, and make him rather Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
than go Look.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:54372:73"/>
And now I may safely affirm, That several
single <hi>Plays</hi> of the <hi>Moderns,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> View, <hi>and</hi> Defence, ref.</note> have not only
more, but some bolder Passages of Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
than all he has cited from the <hi>Antients</hi>
put together. And which is harder still, I
have made but a slender Discovery of the
<hi>English Stage.</hi> Thus some People Refine upon
Heathenism; Thus they improve upon their
Creed, and make amends in their Lives, for
the odds of their Understanding!</p>
            <p>In the Close of all,<note place="margin">Survey. <hi>p.</hi> 367.</note> the <hi>Surveyor offers Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothetically,</hi>
as he calls it, that is faintly, to
justifie the <hi>Stage-Freedoms</hi> with the <hi>Nobility.</hi>
But, by his favour, this Ridiculous Character
must either be drawn for single Persons, or
Quality in general: Now either way his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr
falls under his own Lash; For from hence
it must follow, that he who makes a <hi>Lord</hi>
of a <hi>Fool,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Survey. <hi>p.</hi> 365.</note> 
               <hi>makes a Fool of a Lord,</hi> which he
grants is <hi>no Compliment.</hi> But the <hi>Surveyor</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not reply'd to my Reasons against this
Liberty, I need say nothing more upon the
Argument.</p>
            <p>I have now done with the <hi>Surveyor,</hi>
               <note place="margin">View, <hi>p.</hi> 175. Defence. <hi>p. 25. to p.</hi> 31.</note> and
heartily wish him a better Subject: For a bad
Cause, besides its own Evil, is apt to produce
a resembling Defence: It often runs an Author
upon Calumny, Coarse Expedients, and Little
Management: Which, as they are no sure Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
to raise a Character; so, at one time or
other, they'l certainly displease a Man's self.</p>
