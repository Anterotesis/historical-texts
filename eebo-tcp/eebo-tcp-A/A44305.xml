            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath been, and is the lot of the Lord's Militant-Church, to be toſſed with manifold tempeſts, and to be (as it were) grinded betwixt the two mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones of a profeſſedly profane and atheiſtical world, and of a party pretending highly for Truth and Piety, hanging out the Flag of the faireſt Profeſsion for both; whiles both are really undermined and fought againſt. Such are the deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing methods of that ghoſtly enemy of mens Souls, that not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in his work of peſtering the Church by profaneneſs, (theſe who have received the truth in love, and have it inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately ingrafted in their hearts, abhorring that way; yea, ſuch as have but the literal knowledge of the Goſpel, being thereby moved to abſtain from, and led to eſcape the groſs pollutions that are in the world) He takes another courſe, debauching ſome cleanly like inſtruments under fair forms of godlineſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the power of it, to promote the efficacy of his deceit upon well-meaning people, enſnaring them (by their means) into erroneous Doctrines, or impious and ſcandalous Practices. As the former ages of the Church of Chriſt, have abounded in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences of this kind; So alſo, ſince the light of the bleſſed Reformation (after a long and dark night) did break up, the enemy hath ſtudiouſly ſowed his tares while the good grain was in ſowing, and in deep deceitfulneſs accommodating his tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the courſe then begun and carried on, would put in to be a Reformer, and did yoke in his lightſome-like and well-dreſſed Agents to be (with others) purgers and builders of the Church of God. By theſe men, walking under moſt ſpecious
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99891:3"/>
colours of great humility, fervent zeal, ſincere devotion, real mortification and ſelf-denyal, (graces, where they are in truth, never ſufficiently valued) he did inſinuate himſelf into, and poſſeſs himſelf of the mindes of the ſimple, apt to believe every thing, and led them away captive into moſt dangerous errors and damnable practices: So that in the event, theſe ſhining glorious-like purgers and builders of the Temple of God, proved dreadful defilers and deſtroyers thereof. This moved the heroick <hi>Worthies</hi> employed by God to waſte and pull down the Kingdom of Anti-chriſt, to turn their golden and mighty pens againſt that glittering ſeed of the Serpent, theſe celeſtial Prophets (as they were then termed) who by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing, were undoing the work of God in their hands; and who, under pretence of further and through Reformation (as they called it) did really hinder the courſe of the Goſpel. What wreſtlings the eminent Servants of God, <hi>Luther</hi> (who was by them accounted a little leſs Antichriſt then the Roman, and who dyed an heart-broken man becauſe of them) <hi>Zwinglius, Melanchton, Calvin, Bucer, Bullinger</hi> and many others, had with this ſort of men, their own Writings, and the Hiſtories of that time can teſtifie. We ſpeak of the Sect of the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi> (ſo called from their moſt common, but not from their greateſt errors) a Sect which under much toleration, becauſe of the ſeeming harmleſsneſs and holineſs of its favourers, grew to that ſtrength in <hi>Germany, Switzerland</hi> and other parts, that it became formidable to the States and Countreys where it had place, and which at laſt (letting the mask fall off) did break forth fearfully in groſs voluptuouſneſs, tumults, rapines, horrid murthers, blood-ſhed and rebellions againſt lawful Magiſtrates and Princes, (whom they thought they were called of God to root out, as being the ungodly of the world) And in theſe tumults, confuſions and rebellions, there periſhed above one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men. The contagion of this way hath, leſs or more, ſpread it ſelf to ſome other reformed Churches; and lately did come to ſome ſtrength in <hi>Britain</hi>: A thing which was juſtly feared,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99891:3"/>
and wiſely foreſeen, by men of great gravity, judgement and wiſdom in our Neighbour Land,<note rend="inter">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Whitgift and <hi>Mr.</hi> Hookers</note> near one hundred years ago; who expreſſed in their Writings, their jealouſies and fears, that <hi>England</hi> might be taken and tainted with the infection of that evil. Theſe godly, ſage and ſagacious perſons, were neither ſo tranſported with paſsion, nor ſo void of charity, as to impute the direct intention of bringing in the errors of that way, unto thoſe who were contrary minded to them in the matters of Church-diſcipline. But, when they ſeriouſly conſidered the tendency and conſequence of ſome of their Principles who were vehement for the form of Diſcipline, which they deſired to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude upon that Church, and the conformity of ſome of their Practices to the way of the Sect of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> in other Countries; they did, upon too good ground, fear the breaking out of that evil, which we in our dayes have ſeen come to paſs in a very high meaſure: And, who knows where it ſhall ſiſt? It is a thing too too evident, that under ſundry external forms of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; that myſtery of iniquity worketh to the confuſion of humane Societies, to the bringing of divine Ordinances into contempt, and to the introducing of Libertiniſm, Quakeriſm, Rantiſm and Atheiſm. That Chamelion-like and various Sect, can ſhroud it ſelf under divers external forms of Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. If it be true that Dr. <hi>Ameſ.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Freſh Sute, p. 93.</hi> the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> in <hi>Zealand</hi> and <hi>Frieſland</hi> have their own Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops: in the Congregational and Independent way, there are many of that ſtamp; nor is the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> way ſo priviledged, but that under the lap thereof, men of that furious ſpirit do lurk.</p>
            <p>It is not intended by any thing that ſhall be ſaid of the naughty courſes of others, to caſt any blot upon thoſe who are deemed the moderate men of that way. Only it muſt be ſaid, that they would do themſelves a great deal of right, if the concerns of Gods glory, and the honour of his reformed Churches, the compaſſion due to Souls ſeduced, and ready to be ſeduced, and the true intereſt of their own Reputation might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99891:4"/>
with them, by ſome evidence of a publick deed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim and damn the ſcandalous and ſhameful Doctrines and Practices, whereby evil men ſtrive to ſupport the Presbytery. Otherwiſe, what marvel is it, that they be looked upon in the eſteem of theſe who value them as involved in the guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance and conſent to all the vile things that iſſue from <hi>Napht.</hi> and his party? And that this Libeller be looked upon as the common allowed Advocate of the Presbytery, and who reads the Book, will with ſome ground ſay, <hi>crimine ab uno diſce om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi> Neither is it our deſign or will, to grieve or give offence to the generation of the humble, meek and ſelf-denyed ſeekers of Gods face, partakers with us of the ſame pretious faith, and running to obtain the ſame prize of the inheritance with us, (however differing in judgement in ſome particulars) nor ſhall we take them as partakers with this furious Author and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents. For who can imagine, that a meek people, who hath the promiſe of Gods teaching, ſhould be ſo far tranſported, as to take the circumſtantials of Religion, for the great and weighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Law and Goſpel, without which known and beloved, none can come to God? Who can think, that an intelligent people ſhould account, that the concerns of Chriſts Kingdom and their own ſalvation, doth lye with ſo much ſtreſſe upon this point, that the weakeſt and moſt ignorant Miniſter ſhall have a poteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive parity with the man of greateſt Gifts, Learning and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; that the Miniſter weakeſt in his Prudentials, ſhould have equal Authority in mannaging the matters of Gods houſe, with the wiſeſt and one of the moſt noted prudence; that the youngeſt, raweſt, moſt unexperienced Miniſter, ſhould have as much pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in ruling the houſe of God, as the man fulleſt of years, whoſe judgement is conſolidated and ripened for Government, and who hath for a long time given ſuch documents of good and wiſe behaviour, that makes him fitter to rule the younger ſort, then to be ruled by them? Or, who can ſee the prejudice to Chriſts Kingdom and pretious ſouls, if ſuch a worthy perſon (as is deſcribed) be intruſted with an inſpection over other Brethren
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99891:4"/>
and Churches in a reaſonable bounds, not with a dominative or lordly power, but paternal and fatherly; not to do after his own ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrement, and as one unchallengeable in his actions, but to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by acts of the Church and Land, and to be reſponſible to his Superiors in caſe of maleverſation, not to rule ſolly, but with the conſent and counſel of Presbyters? Can this way be diſrelliſhed by ſober Chriſtians, being ſo ſtrongly pleaded by the light of ſound reaſon, making ſo much for the comlineſs and order of Chriſts Church, being ſo ſuitable and correſpondent to the antient Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (where there were Prieſts and chief Prieſts, and ſeveral ranks of Miniſters, an order which was neither typical nor temporal, but hath a ſtanding reaſon reaching us) being ſo conform to the beginnings of Chriſts or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the New-teſtament Miniſtry (where there were Apoſtles above the ſeventy Diſciples) being ſo agreeable to the Apoſtles conſtitution of the Government of the Churches of the New Teſtament, which was in an imparity of Power in Miniſters, (as is luculently exemplified in the Power of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> who were no Evangeliſts, nor ever accounted ſo by the Spirit of God) And finally, our aſcended glorious Saviour, having honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſons inveſted with that precedency by Letters written by his Secretary <hi>John</hi> unto them, <hi>Rev. 2.3.</hi> chap. wherein he ſhews the approbation of their office and power, reproving their neglects, yet honouring them with the ſtile of Angels to the Churches, or his Meſsengers in ſpecial manner. <hi>To the Angel of the Church of</hi> Epheſus, &amp;c. which cannot without notable perverſion of the Scripture be otherwiſe underſtood, but of ſingle perſons preſiding over Presbyters. And this order Chriſts Church and dear Spouſe, having ſince that time retained in all places, where Churches were conſtitute without exception, in all times without interruption, untill this laſt Age, wherein through hatred of corruptions adhering thereto under Popery, and becauſe of the enimity of the popiſh Biſhops to the Reformation, ſome have utterly, without any reaſon, rejected the office it ſelf. Who can think, that a Chriſtian people will not readily follow
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99891:5"/>
the foot-ſteps of the flock in former generations? Neither is there any intention to provoke any fearers of God, who have been perhaps in an hour of tentation miſcarried to irregular courſes, following too readily in the ſimplicity of their hearts cunning leaders, who have had too much dominion over their faith; theſe we judge worthy of greateſt tenderneſs in dealing with them: nor are we without hope, <hi>that God who ſtills the noiſe of the ſeas, the noiſe of the waves, and the tumult of the people, Pſ. 65. v. 7.</hi> will in time allay their animoſities and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke the ſtormy wind and ſeas of their paſſions, that they may be ſtill, and that he will bring them to conſider their wayes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they have exceeded, and give them to know how ill and bitter a thing it is to forſake their own mercies in the ordinances of God, for the want or having of this or that form of external Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. But theſe we aim at in this parallel with Anabaptiſts, are the Naphtalian party, <hi>i. e.</hi> the furious ſort of theſe, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct of this teacher and his like, make ſport of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, murders, aſſaſſinations, that have ſo hardened and harneſſed their hearts (as appears by their writings and deeds) that they have become ſtout in a dedolent greedineſs to commit any wickedneſs, which they account meet to ſerve their deſign, as if their ſuppoſed good cauſe could legittimat the worſt courſe, who make no reckoning, as their Doctor here profeſſes, of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning Thrones, making the Land drunk with the blood of the Inhabitants, multiplying fatherleſſe and widows in the midſt thereof, and introducing greateſt confuſions and calamities, that may make all faces gather blackneſs, and all to ſmite on the thigh, crying, <hi>alas for the day!</hi> if ſo be, they may upon the ruins of all, erect the idol of pretended parity of Miniſters; which when they have ſet up, the imperious agitators will, (as they have done formerly) baffle, if any offer be to level them to others, and howſoever the weaker brethren muſt be entertained with fair words, and noddified with notional diſputes anent their parity with the beſt, that they may think themſelves ſomewhat: yet, how diſdainfully was it, and yet would be taken
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99891:5"/>
if theſe low ſhrubs ſhould eſſay a practical parity with the tall Cedars in the Government of affairs. Imparity was then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a title, now it is with it, and there is our change and great defection; and ſurely <hi>that which hath been, will be, and there is no new thing under the Sun.</hi>

            <p>This furious <hi>Napht.</hi> coming in upon the back of the <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi> as another invenomed Egg, hatched (be-like) by one and the ſame Cockatrice; the ſecond juſtifying the rebellion to which the firſt did inſtigate, and inflaming to more, may let them, who will not ſhut their own eyes, ſee the myſtery of Anabaptiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal confuſion, working and ſpreading: for, although the Author pretendeth highly for Presbytery, which he and his complices (Hawks of the right neſt) have long ago hewed down in this Church, as to the practice of it: Yet, evident it is, that his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences for Presbytery are but Prefaces to ſome further great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of miſchief to the Church and State. For, having ſold himſelf to work confuſion and rebellion, he goes about to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all the powers ordained of God in moſt cyclopick boldneſs, diſplaying a banner againſt all inveſted lawfully with any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Civil or Church power, bending his ſpirit to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, to renew and revive our confuſions, and to bear people in hand, that groſſeſt rebellion is religious duty and real godlineſs. And in managing his matters, the Author behaves not himſelf like <hi>Naphtali, (the hinde let looſe, which giveth goodly words,</hi> or <hi>words of goodlineſs, fairneſs and pleaſantneſs,</hi> as, <hi>Gen. 49.21.</hi> it is ſaid of <hi>Naphtali;</hi> who therefore <hi>is ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with favour, and full of the bleſſing of the Lord,</hi> Deut. <hi>33.23.</hi>) But, as in his heart there are evil treaſures of wickedneſs; So, in his lips and pen there is a burning fire, he ſtrives to enflame all with the rage of his tongue, and runs upon all ſorts of Authorities from the higheſt to the loweſt, like a ſavage Beaſt or wild Boare let looſe to waſte and confound mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably both the viſible Kingdom of Chriſt in the Land, and the civil Kingdom thereof ſetled upon the beſt foundations; and that his Book might want nothing of the compleatneſs of an infam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99891:6"/>
Libel, he falls upon particular perſons by name, to aſperſe their credit, the conſtant integrity of whoſe converſation, will eaſily ſtop his foul lying mouth in the conſciences of Gods people who know them.</p>
            <p>What to do anent this bundle of impudent lyes and falſhoods, groſſe ſlanders and revilings, was much doubted. Upon the one hand, it was thought beſt to neglect the rage of this man (if one that hath ſo much renounced humanity, as he is here ſeen to do, may be ſo termed) leaſt by being noticed, he might think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſomewhat, eſpecially leaſt people (who as they affect, are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily opinionated) might have too much matter to feed their humour, to furniſh their light diſcourſes, and to enſnare their ſouls, by repreſenting to them the matters of this Libell (worthy to be buried in oblivion) they being too apt (whatever <hi>ſalvo</hi> might be added) to receive the poiſon without the antidote ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their prejudices. It ſeemed alſo a matter full of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs to a well compoſed heart, to enter into a fire of endleſs ſtrife and continual reciprocation of altercations, wherein a man is not likely to find more truth then he hath already, (truth in the moſt important matters in the Book, having been of old ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vindicated by learned hands, and nothing now oppoſed, but old ſongs, chanted over and over again) although like enough to loſe much of that charity and calm and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed temper of heart which he had before. What man is he, that knowing, how much more important work he hath upon his hand, for his own ſalvation, and honouring God in his ſtation in the world, would willingly engage in endleſs conteſts with perſons, whoſe idleneſs gives them too great opportunity of evil doing; and who having caſt by the Lords work in building his Church, are too much ſet to do Sathans work in diſſipating the ſame? It ſeemed honourable enough to decline this contention and ſtrife, which is like the letting out of waters, in expectation that either the mans conſcience (if it be not infinitely corrupted) may confute him in moſt of his aſſertions and ſtanders, or that his manifeſt unchriſtian dealing may help to open the eyes of ſuch
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99891:6"/>
he labours to delude, and bring them to abhorre his way, or that the really religious and righteous dealings of Church and State may more forcibly put him to ſilence then words or writings can. Sometimes keeping ſilence is ſeaſonable, the man according to Gods own heart, would not ſuffer <hi>Shimei's</hi> revilings to be repayed upon the head of that dead dog; <hi>Hezekiah</hi> diſcharged to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer a word to railing <hi>Rabſhakeh; Jeremiah</hi> the Prophet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted by the falſe Prophet <hi>Hananiah,</hi> went his way and ſaid nothing; the wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> forbids to take heed to all words that are ſpoken and to anſwer a fool according to his follie. The Lord of Kings and Prophets, ſometimes anſwered not his accuſers a word. So it ſeemed fit to let alone an inſolent and froward rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and mocker, and not to laviſh out pretious time, which might be better beſtowed, upon one that gives ſuch viſible evidences both of a reaſonleſs and unchriſtian ſpirit, whoſe Libel may be reckoned amongſt the things <hi>quae ſpreta exoleſcunt,</hi> and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be anſwered with nothing but <hi>ſilence</hi> and <hi>contempt.</hi> But upon the other hand, it ſeemed ſomething hard, (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in ſuch a diſtempered time) to ſuffer an inſolent perſon, in whoſe mouth is a rod of pride, to caſt the truth down to the ground without controll, and to tread upon and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over a holy and righteous cauſe, and upon honourable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of all ranks, engaged in the maintenance thereof in ſo abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, deſpiteful and intolerable a way, and not give him any check. Not to put ſome ſtop to this furious driver, who again and again aſſaults this Church with vile lyes and reproaches, looked like the deſerting and betraying of an honeſt and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able cauſe, or like the hirelings ſeeing the wolf and flying and leaving the flock to be deſtroyed with deluſion, <hi>fugiſti quia ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuiſti.</hi> There is an evil ſilence that leaves men in ſin, as well as an evil ſpeaking that leads men to ſin; and we are not only to give an account <hi>pro otioſo verbo,</hi> but <hi>pro otioſo ſilencio;</hi> for, idle ſilence, when God and the publick neceſſity of the Church, or Society whereof we are members, calls for a valiant (not bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhly violent and forcible that way, ſuch as this man pleads
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99891:7"/>
for) and rational contending for the truth. It is ſinful puſilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity, and not warrandable prudence to ſee truth fall in the ſtreets and not lift it up. And verily, this man ſeems to be amongſt theſe, of whom <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes, <hi>Prov. 26.5. who muſt be anſwered, leaſt he ſeem wiſe in his own conceit;</hi> and to be amongſt theſe, <hi>Tit. 1.10, 11. unruly and vain talkers and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, whoſe mouths muſt be ſtopped,</hi> that the gangrane of his words may not creep further to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and ſubverſion of Church and State.</p>
            <p>But the great difficulty, in dealing with this man of no fore-head, (or if he have any, it is of the hardeſt mettal) of little conſcience, but of infinite loquacity, and of a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled tongue, which is a treaſure of all reviling language, (whereof he is exceedingly profuſe, in beſtowing it upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of all ranks) The great difficulty (I ſay) in dealing with him was how to moderate and temper a ſtile of writing toward ſuch a one; <hi>Difficile eſt Satyram non ſcribere contra Satyrum</hi>: for hardly can a man meet in any book with more bitter invectives againſt all Authorities and Dignities, appointed and approven by God, then are here to be found. All that have gone that path before him, ſeem but children in wickedneſs in compariſon of him. He deſerves to be in the firſt claſſe of theſe, <hi>Jude 8. who deſpiſe Dominion, and ſpeak evil of Dignities.</hi> Yet it muſt be confeſſed, that the man deſerves well (albeit beſide his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) of all the Authorities civil and eccleſiaſtical in the Land, for while others do politickly keep in, <hi>ſupprimit Orator quae ruſticus edit inepte,</hi> He hath plainly laid open the ſpirit of the faction, for which he is Advocate, and gives (as we will hear) fair warning to the King, that he muſt not expect impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity (if they can have their will,) and to all the Nobles and Magiſtrates, whoſe places and dignities, forfeited <hi>(as he ſaith)</hi> by them, private perſons, in a <hi>Phineas</hi>-like ſpirit, are allowed to poſſeſs, removing and taking order with them for great apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and patroniſing abominations (as he ſpeaks) but eſpecially to all the miniſtry, (whom he calls <hi>Wolves</hi> and <hi>Theeves</hi>)
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99891:7"/>
and mainely to the Biſhops what they are to expect; for loading them outragiouſly with all ſorts of reproaches, which his wicked heart could prompt him to utter, he directly endeavours to ſtir up the people <hi>to embrew their hands in their blood, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them in their innocency, with tragical oh<hi rend="sup">s</hi>!</hi> awakening the rage of the rudeſt multitude (which he calls zeal of God) to execute judgement on them, that the fierce anger of God may be turned away; and tells them if they do not ſo, <hi>they are plagued with ſtupidity and blindneſs.</hi> All ſorts of rulers in the Land, may ſee their <hi>dittay</hi> and their <hi>doom</hi> drawn in this Libell; and the man ſhould have thanks for diſcovering the malitious bloody and cruel deſigns of his party, that theſe who are concerned, being fore-warned, may be fore-armed, <hi>profeſſa perdunt odia ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictae locum;</hi> when the ſnare is ſett in a mans ſight, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to fall into it, that will fall into it. When a mans deadly enemies proclaim their intentions, if he take not warning and be not upon his guard, who will not think, that in his lifetime he were worthy of a fair hood and bells, and becauſe he periſhes in the ſnare that was ſet in his ſight, he will be thought worthy of <hi>Abners</hi> Epitaph, <hi>Dyed</hi> Abner <hi>as a fool dyeth</hi>? This man will make us wiſe, whither we will or not, and force us to keep our eyes in our head.</p>
            <p>But as to this infamous Libeller, how irkſome a thing were it to follow him cloſely in all his fooliſh reaſonings that are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally interlaced and larded with foul revilings? How unſuitable were it for one, who deſires to keep the conſtant compoſure of a Chriſtian ſpirit, to indulge a humour in retaliating, according as the indignity of his abuſes requires: verily, in dealing with men of this ſtamp (outragious in their opprobrious ſpeeches) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders of the truth are at a great diſadvantage, in regard of theſe who have ſober and grave adverſaries to deal with. But it almoſt tranſcends humane patience, to treat myldly with ſuch an inſolent one as this, who tranſgreſſeth ſo far the bounds of all humane modeſty in dealing with all ſorts of perſons in Authority, as will be ſeen anone,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:99891:8"/>Although then, a more then ordinary vehemency of a keen ſtile ſhould be uſed, in beating down the fierceneſs of one ſo exceſſively in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent (whoſe intemperate pride deſpiſeth moderate remedies) good and wiſe men will not judge it very criminal, but at leaſt, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what excuſable. Shall Maſters of confuſion, indulging themſelves in their proud moroſity, unworthily demean themſelves toward the ſober defenders of the truth? and will not this be ſufficient Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for them, to put forth ſome ſting, and uſe ſome meaſure of vehemency in this caſe? Should ſuch a perſon as this, who (as the Poets feign of <hi>Hecuba,</hi> metamorphoſed into a mad barking bitch, after the deſtruction of <hi>Troy</hi>) barks and bawles, and dares with his furious petulant and peſtilent pen overrun and beſpatter King, Parliament, Council, Nobles, Judges, Biſhops, Miniſters and all ranks of people in the Land? ſhould he be ſmoothed and ſtroaked with ſoft words? might not poſſibly a too faint-like and toothleſs defenſe of the truth tend to harden him and his complices, and breed ſuſpition of ſome ſigns of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, diſtruſt and timorouſneſs in owning the truth and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of the cauſe that is owned againſt him?</p>
            <q>Sed motos praeſtat componere fluctus.</q>
            <p>It ſhall be fitter to conſider what becomes us to utter, then what becomes him to hear, or what he is worthy of. There lyes indeed a tentation in theſe nameleſs writings (which therefore, it is to be wiſhed were not in uſe) to exceed in paſſions and to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter words <hi>(incognito)</hi> that will not be ſtood to; but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, <hi>that we have not ſo learn'd Chriſt, as to render revil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for reviling, and that mans wrath works not the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God;</hi> (though ſometimes it is for peoples edification to ſee the due characters of ſuch as lead them out of the way) ſo far as humane infirmity permitts, the truth ſhall be ſearched af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſpoken in love; all bitterneſs, wrath, anger and clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our with all malice being put away: but if any thing aculeat and pungent do eſcape, it not being uſed in any private cauſe or quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, but in the publick concerns of truth, of the Church of God and of the State of the Common-wealth, nor proceeding from any
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99891:8"/>
private revenge (there being room enough in our fraternal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for any, who will leave their unchriſtian, ſanguinary and inhumane wayes) it will at leaſt be excuſed by the judicious and wiſe. And if any ſuch thing be, it is heartily wiſhed, it may prick the Libeller to repentance for theſe things, wherein he hath already put himſelf to ſhame.</p>
            <p>But to prepare for conſideration of the matter of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Libel, it ſhall be fit, to advert how palpably and cloſely this man treads in the foot-ſteps of the old Maſters of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the Anabaptiſts: It ſhall not be ſaid, that his complices or he, are arrived to the owning of the higheſt myſteries of that Sect, in the points of Enthuſiaſme and Libertiniſme, nor that they are ſo cruel, as to exclude Chriſtian infants from their Birth-right priviledge of Baptiſme; howbeit, it is worthy to be conſidered, how far the common demand of expreſſe command or example in Scripture, for Epiſcopacy may reach the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts concluſion concerning infants. And this man, doth let fall ſuch tenets, as ſmell too rankly of the foul ſcum of the high flown Anabaptiſtical and Enthuſiaſtical way; while he tells us, (<hi>pag. 21.</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>That meer private men may now a dayes, take their impulſes of Zeal, as a ſufficient call, to pull down all Magiſtrates from their ſeats which they abuſe, to execute judgement on them, and to place themſelves in their rooms;</hi> thinking, that <hi>Phineas</hi> act may juſtifie them, and while he tells us, <hi>pag. 105. that a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters external call, is not in ordination by them, who have power upon trial of gifts; but in having ſuch a viſible evidence of the call of Jeſus Chriſt, as in reaſon and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity doth obliege all men, to receive the perſon ſo called, as truly ſent:</hi> Theſe with ſeveral other points, tending to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertiniſme; yea, and to the aboliſhing of the ſenſe of groſſeſt ſins in people, are vented here, as may be ſeen in the progreſs. But our maine work ſhall be, to ſhew the face of this mans way, and how Anabaptiſtical-like it looks, in ſome particular practices, wherein the ſimilitude will hold without much halting, that if he will not be he healed, others may be warned.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:99891:9"/>
               <hi>1.</hi> The Sect of Anabaptiſts laboured much, (as the learned men that knew them and dealt with them declare) to overthrow Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, in the places where they lived; they repreſented the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular powers unto the people, as the ungodly of the world, inſtigat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtirring them up, to pull them all down, as the oppreſſors of their liberty in ſpirituals and civils: They denied all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to Magiſtrates in Church matters, averring, they ought not to medle in matters of Religion or Faith, nor uſe any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion on men, ſo much as to urge them to the uſe of the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal meanes of Gods worſhip. And upon the ground, (<hi>Luke, 22. The Kings of the Nations,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>it ſhall not be ſo amongſt you,</hi> which is preſſed againſt Superiorities amongſt Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) They pleaded with no leſs plauſibleneſs againſt ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Magiſtrates, amongſt and over Chriſtians, although when they came to ſome ſtrength at <hi>Munſter,</hi> they would have their own King, <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> the Taylor.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> As they ſtudied to overthrow the ordinance of Magiſtracy, ſo alſo the other divine ordinance of Miniſtery; theſe being, as it were, the two great lights, the Sun and the Moon, which God hath appointed to guid the world: Theſe maſters of confuſion, would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh them both, that they might vent their wares in the world, for deſtroying not only humane Societies, but the Souls of men. In order to the ruine of the Miniſtery, they declaimed moſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly againſt all of that function, (that were not of their way) as <hi>Hirelings, Thieves</hi> and <hi>Wolves, Ignorant-beaſts, Prieſts of Baal, curſed Creatures, Servants of Sathan,</hi> and what ever elſe their invenomd hearts could prompt them to utter againſt Chriſts Miniſters to work their diſgrace amongſt the people, and ſo to defame them, that they might be uſeleſs in the ſervice of God: Their great work was, to exclude faithful Miniſters from the eſteem of Gods people, that they might affect them only, and that they might have ready acceſſe to poyſon them with their perverſe Doctrines and Dictates of ſublime, unconceivable non-ſenſe, ſet forth under the garb of a glancing novelty of words.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> They bent themſelves to work diviſion in the Church of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99891:9"/>
God, and to move people to forſake the aſſembling of themſelves together in Church-meetings, and to follow them to ſeek Chriſt in private Conventicles, where they might with freedom enough open their hearts, and debauch them into their way. The Church meetings they reckoned no better of, then as of droves and herds of hoggs, confuſed mixtures, unworthy the name of Churches and wherein no bleſſing was to be expected to the Ordinances.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> They were above all men arrogant and proud deſpiſers of ſuch as were not of their way, as being men without God in the world, reprobate and wicked, denying to them even common ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5.</hi> When any of theirs were puniſhed, either for their errors, or for fellony, murther or rebellion, they heavily lamented the removeal of the dear ſervants of God; crying them up for Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, and complaining tragically, that truth and godlineſs was oppreſſed; and that men, who would have all things done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods word, were not ſuffered to live in a perſecuting world.</p>
            <p>How neer this man (with his complices) doth approach to the manners of that odious Sect in theſe particulars, may ſome way appear from this <hi>Libell,</hi> and the <hi>Apology.</hi> When the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that ſtirreth in theſe furious writings (eſpecially in <hi>Naphthali,</hi> wherein the evil man waxeth worſe and worſe) is conſidered; how much confuſion may be ſeen to be portended to Church and State, if hearts be infected with the Doctrines therein held forth. It is greatly to be wiſhed and prayed for, that the Lord may give his people ſuch underſtanding, that they be not ignorant of the wiles of Sathan, who drives a deeper deſign againſt this poor Church and Land, then the ſubverſion of this or that exterior form of Church-Government. The controverſie reſts not in matters touching a Biſhop, or a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, which (if mens paſſions or prejudices might permit) may be for the advantage of the Goſpel well conſolidated by their mutual paying of due reſpects one to another, the epiſcopal inſpection not abrogating, but ſtrengthening the due right of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99891:10"/>
Presbyters, and Presbyters not deſpiſing that lawful inſpection, but all concurring together in a kindly mutual aſſiſtance, and amicable conjunction, for carrying on the real intereſts of Chriſts Kingdom without imperiouſneſs on the one ſide, and without froward diſorderlineſs on the other. But this polemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Presbyterian (as he would ſeem to be, though he and his brethren in evil have ruined that way of Presbytery long ago) accounts ſuch matters too low to ſtand upon. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign his Libel runs upon, is to open a gap to endleſſe rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, under whatſoever conſtitution of Church-Government. And not only to bring all our Magiſtrates from the higheſt to the loweſt under diſgrace (which is the next ſtep to deſtruction, and to make them a ſacrifice to the fury of the wicked people) but to ruine Kingly Authority and Magiſtracy, the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, and to diſſolve humane Societies and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms (as ſhall be ſeen) and eſpecially to ruine this Kingdom. There is a great noiſe made, (it may be, it is not cauſles, and it were to be wiſhed, Rulers looked to it) of the increaſe of Popery: but truly, when the ſpirit of ſuch writings as this, is conſidered, it will be found, there is cauſe to fear, (unleſs the wiſdom and goodneſs of God, and the prudence of the King and Governors under him prevent) That as one way, the Roman Antichriſt may come in; So, ſome furious ſucceſſor of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> under pretence of a <hi>Phineas</hi>-like ſpirit, come in another way, upon our Church and Land, to lay it waſte, and to make it a field of confuſion and blood; the ſeeds of future miſeries, being too viſibly ſowen by this man and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices; whoſe mouths, are full of Blaſphemies, as their hearts and hands are full of blood. That this Libell and the like, are not more quickly followed, with meet animadverſions, is not to be marvelled at by any, who knowes they are like the Peſtilence that walks in darkneſs; and that hardly do they come to the hands of any, but ſuch as are willing to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by them, being intended for the blinding of theſe, not for the opening the eyes of others; Yet now, (that this piece
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99891:10"/>
is in our hand) it (with its fellowes) deſerves ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and what ſhall be ſaid, ſhall be reduced to theſe heads, <hi>viz.</hi> The Libellers endeavour to confound humane Societies and to overthrow Magiſtracy; His injurious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings of the Kings Majeſty, Parliament, Council, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, Judges, Town of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> &amp;c. His reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es againſt the Miniſtery of the Church and all ranks thereof, with his unſound Doctrines anent their Callings and Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; His endeavours to diſſipate the Church of Chriſt in this Land, and therein to ſtate a perpetual ſchiſme; His Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable pride and contempt of all others; His tragical com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of perſecution, and vain glorying in the Martyrs of his way. In touching upon theſe, the moſt material things of his book ſhall be ſpoken to, in the following part of this treatiſe; withall, for the Reader's edification, we ſhall now and then turn aſide to uſefull digreſſions. As, <hi>1.</hi> Concerning his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Supremacy in Church affairs, which this Libeller calls falſly an uſurpation of the Crown of Chriſt. <hi>2.</hi> Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Covenants and obligation thereof, and the falſly alledged perjury in owning Epiſcopacy. <hi>3.</hi> Concerning the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantableneſs of the Epiſcopal office, falſely called by the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller Antichriſtian uſurpation. <hi>4.</hi> Concerning the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the calling of the preſent Miniſtery of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whom he calls <hi>Thieves, Wolves,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>5.</hi> The ſinfulneſs of ſtating a ſeparation from our Church-aſſemblies, which he calls <hi>Curats Conventicles.</hi> Thoſe things being with any ſatisfaction ſpoken to, once for all, (for, Who can endure that profuſion of preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous time, as to be alwayes drawing the rug-ſaw of contention about ſuch matters?) will contribute to clear our judgements and allay our animoſities. The Lord give us underſtanding in all things, and bleſſe us with truth and peace.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. The Libeller his endeavours to confound and diſſolve humane Societies, and to overthrow Magiſtracy in this Land.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OD Almighty, having made Man a rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and fit for ſociety, (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as the Philoſopher ſpeaketh) hath appointed (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides aeconomical Societies) the coalition of people into greater Bodies, conſiſting of many Families under one Political Government, for mutual help to be given by men (one to another) in their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities; for protection both of the whole Body, and of every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber intereſſed in the Society, and for the procuring of the good and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of all in this life, and in a better. That theſe Societies might be orderly regulated in their acts, the God of order hath appointed ſuperiour Powers and Heads over the multitudes of men, in ſeveral bounds of the world where he hath diſpoſed their habitations. Magiſtracy, God's Ordinance, is that golden claſp and band, that holds together humane Societies in a conſiſtent unity, that mens corruptions may not daſh them one upon another, as pot-ſheards, to their mutual ruine and general confuſion. Magiſtracy is as the vital Spirits of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Societies, without which they were but as dead carcaſſes; it is as the Nerves and Sinews in the Body, without which there could be no right motion. Hence there are no Nations ſo barbarous, but by natural inſtinct and the dictates of reaſon, are led together into politick aſſociations for their ſubſiſtance in general, for the mutual help one of another, and for the protection of the weaker againſt the violence and wrongs of the ſtronger. And by a divine inſtinct, great multitudes of men embodyed together, are brought to humble themſelves and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Magiſtracy of one ſort or another; which is not a meer device of wiſe men, but an holy Ordinance of the only wiſe God. <hi>Vocatio eſt</hi> (ſaith <hi>Calv. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>inſt. cap.</hi> 20. S. 4.) <hi>non modo ſancta &amp; legittima
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99891:12"/>
coram Deo, ſed ſacerrima &amp; in totâ mortalium vitâ longè honeſtiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſima.</hi> Now, albeit the Lord hath not, by any precept, particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the bounds of every embodyed political Society (there being ſome greater, ſome leſſer, acting under their ſeveral Heads and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Magiſtrates) Yet when politick Bodies are ſetled in voluntary aſſociations, or what ever way in the courſe of Divine Providence they have been reduced to live under the ſame Laws and Authorities, and have continued long in the union of a common intereſt, under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of Magiſtracy, to break off from the body in ſeditious ſeceſſions, cannot but be diſpleaſing to God. And they are no other then Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands, confounders of humane Society, fighters againſt God and his Ordinance, who (working upon the advantages they have from peoples diſcontentments upon whatever pretence) do inſtigate them either to cut off themſelves from the body of the Common-wealth, whereof they are Members, or to fall with violence upon the whole body, (though they be the far leſſer part thereof) or to invade the inviolable (by Subjects) Majeſty of the ſupreme Authority, which bears the ſacred impreſs of God. How far this Libeller goeth this way, ſhall appear by his Tenets.</p>
               <p>This Libeller's mind is plainly this,
<q>That when the ends of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are manifeſtly perverted, the injured perſons (one or moe) obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation thereunto ceaſeth, the band thereof is diſſolved, they are liberate from it, and do relapſe into their primaeve liberty and priviledge; and as the ſimilitude of their caſe and exigence of cauſe doth require, may upon the very ſame principles again aſſociate and joyn for their better defence and preſervation, as they did at firſt enter into Societies.</q>
Thus he, Pag. 16. Pag. 150. And further he avows,
<q>That not only no obedience, but no alleagiance <hi>(n. b.)</hi> is to be given to any created Power on earth, but with this reſtriction, <hi>in defence of Religion and Liberty, according to the Covenants,</hi> Pag. 177.</q>
And what Religion he means, in application to the hypotheſis of the Times, he explains plainly, Pag. 54. where he ſayes,
<q>The extirpation of Prelacy is the main covenanted Religious Duty, in the endeavour whereof, all the zeal of the faithful ſhould be concentred.</q>
And as to the liberty of the Subjects, the determining of what it is, muſt not be referred to the Subjects Repreſentatives in Parliament: For, ſaith he, Pag. 102.
<q>The Parliament, under pretence of vindicating and declaring the Kings juſt Right and Prerogative, have wholly corrupted and innovated the well-tempered and firm conſtitution of our ancient Government, and utterly ſubverted the liberty of the Subject, Pag. 95.</q>
So that what
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99891:12"/>
this liberty is, muſt be referred to the private diſcretive judgement of every man, and this muſt determine him to his Acts of violent reſiſtance, and vindication of liberty according to the Covenant. And in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the caſe of the Nation in theſe Times, the man is ſo far tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported as to teach the people,
<q>That their liberty is ſo far loſt, that they are reduced to the condition of a moſt inſupportable and unnatural conqueſt, which ſhould be a moſt juſt cauſe and provocation to all ingenuous Spirits and good Patriots, to undertake the aſſerting of their own liberty upon the greateſt peril, Page 116. And that the preſſures and grievances of the Nation, by reaſon only of that Court of Commiſſion for executing the Laws anent Church matters, do far exceed all the preſſures and injuries of that Spaniſh inquiſition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the United Provinces have juſtified and approved their revolt from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> Page 126.</q>
So that this mans deſign is clear from his words, to diſſolve and confound this Kingdom, to move them who will be taken in his ſnare, to renounce Allegiance to the King; to revolt from him, as having better cauſe then the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces had to revolt from the King of <hi>Spain</hi>; to combine themſelves in new Societies to their own mind (they being now relapſed into their primaeve liberty, and the obligation to the Government being looſed) and that every man and every Party, as they find themſelves ſtrong enough, ſhould upon their own diſcretive judgement of what is their due civil Liberty, as well as what is right Religion; and upon their greateſt peril undertake not only violent reſiſtance of all powers above them, but valiant vindication of Religion and Liberties, and reforming what they think amiſſe <hi>vi &amp; armis,</hi> even to the puniſhing all and whatſoever perſon that will oppoſe them in their way.</p>
               <p>The particulars ſhall be after ſpoken to, but now more generally we conſider his fundamental Doctrines of confuſion. That the true ends of inſtituting civil Government, are the true happineſs of People here and hereafter, and the glory of God: and that Magiſtrates and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours are oblieged to proſecute theſe ends, no judicious Chriſtian will queſtion. All the queſtion is, anent the Duty of the fearers of God, in the caſe of the perverſion of the ends of Government by theſe in whoſe hand it is, whether, when this perverſion is manifeſt, the band and tye to the Government ceaſeth, as to the perſons injur'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; and whither this be the caſe, as matters are now ſtated, that private perſons, or any number of them, are for the preſent (ſuppos'd) perverſions of the ends of Government, diſoblieged from all tyes to the ſame, and relaps'd into their primaeve liberty and priviledge, to combine
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99891:13"/>
in Societies which are to their mind (as at firſt they did aſſociate themſelves in the political bodies whereof now they are members) for their own good and preſervation.</p>
               <p>As for the general poſition, or affirmative reſolution to the former queſtion, it is undoubtedly both unchriſtian and unreaſonable. When was there at any time greater perverſion and ſtraying from the ends of Government, then was in the times of many of the holy Prophets of God, and in the times of Chriſt, his holy Apoſtles and the primitive Chriſtians, who were both repleniſh'd with much light to know their duties, and much zeal to act for the honour of God againſt all perils and dangers whatſoever lying in their way? Government was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by manifeſt Idolatry and horrid Tyranny, many monſters of men poſſeſſing the thrones of Soveraignty: yet, look over all the ſacred Writings of the holy Prophets, look to the hiſtory of the life and actions of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, or to the hiſtory of the great Lights of the primitive Church for many hundreds of years, and ſee if any of the teachers taught ſuch doctrine, that in caſe of the manifeſt perverſion of the ends of Government, people did relapſe into their primaeve liberty and priviledge, to combine with whom they pleaſed, to forſake the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with theſe political bodies with which they were conjoyn'd, or that they were liberated from the obligation and band to the civil order and Government under which they were; or if that was the ſenſe of any of the godly, zealous Chriſtians, and fearers of God in theſe times, who alwayes keeped themſelves pure from ſinning againſt God, refuſing obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto mens unlawful Commandments, but the Doctrine of theſe new Chriſtians never came in their hearts, that they ſhould make ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions from the civil Societies wherein they lived, ſo long as they keep'd within the bounds over which ſuch or ſuch Government was, and account all their obligation to abuſed Government diſſolved: Yea upon the contrary, as there are never to be found amongſt the people fearing God, any ſuch rentings of the States and Common-wealths they lived in, approven of God, or injoyn'd by his Prophets in his name; So, in reproving ſins and menacing judgements againſt theſe in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, (albeit they grievouſly abuſed their places) yet the Prophets, Apoſtles, and Chriſt alſo, ſtudied to preſerve reſpects to the Soveraignty and Powers ſet over People; and while they warn'd all from the higheſt to the loweſt to amend their wayes, they guarded againſt ſeditious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions of the Common-wealth on any pretext, never preſcribing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion and revolting (the greater ſin) as the cure of Tyranny or irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſneſs in the Actings of Powers. What abuſers of Government,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99891:13"/>
and perverters of the ends thereof, were <hi>Tiberius Claudius, Nero, Domitian?</hi> &amp;c. yet Chriſt will have <hi>Caeſars</hi> due given him; and his Apoſtles preſſe ſubjection to them, Honor to be given them, Tribute to be paid to them, Prayers to be made for them; not for deſtroying them and their Government, but for preſerving their Perſons and ſanctifying their hearts, that they might govern rightly and peaceably, (a Prayer Point-blank contrary to endeavours to diſturbe their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms by ſeditious courſes, to diſſolve and diſſipate them, and to take vengeance on their perſons.) So that they muſt needs be the diſciples (not of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Peter</hi>) but of <hi>Judas</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> and of <hi>Theudas, Acts</hi> 5.36, 37. who upon account of perverſion of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, teach any part of the people to diſſolve and confound the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties whereof they are members, and that the obligation being looſed from the Government, they may break off from it, and erect themſelves in new Combinations and Societies with whom they think beſt. If this may paſſe for good divinity, the grand enemy ſhall never want oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of caſting Fire-balls in humane Societies, and working confuſion and every evil work.</p>
               <p>But as this poſition is very diſſonant from Religion, ſo it is no leſs to ſound reaſon, for it hath a clear tendency, to the breaking and crumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in pieces of all humane political Societies, all Commonwealths and Kingdoms of the World, which no wit of Man can preſerve from diſſolution, if once this Principle be drunk into the hearts of People and ſink there: For by this mans opinion, the judgement of the perverſion of the ends of Government in tyranny, oppreſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is alwayes put over to the diſcretion of the ſufferers of prejudice by it, (were they never ſo few, in compariſon of the whole body of the people) they may pronounce upon the ſame, and according to their diſcretive judgement, of the injurious perverting of Government, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine their actions, for renouncing or revolting from the ſociety in which, and Government under which, they are, and nothing ſhould hinder them from this, but want of probable capacity to through their work, (as he often ſpeaks) So wiſe and cautious muſt his followers be, (though not conſcientious) that in working a miſchief, they light not upon a miſchief.</p>
               <p>Good God! to what times are we reſerved, wherein the unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable audaciouſneſs of men, dare preſent ſuch poyſon to a Chriſtian People; and to attempt the breaking them in pieces by ſuch Doctrines, which both Religion and ſound Reaſon abhorres? Dare this Libeller ſay, that this is a fundamental conſtitution of political Societies,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99891:14"/>
that at the arbitrement and luſt of any minor part of private perſons, pretending a perverſion of the ends of Government, (a pretence that will never be wanting, to malecontents and malapert wicked ones even katherines and highlandiſh theeves, and it is real to them, if they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves be admitted Judges) they may make ſeceſſion from the Society in which they are embodied, and renounce their obligation to the Government thereof? Is not ſuch a principle, rather contra-fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to all humane combined Societies? and were it at firſt entring of the Society, expreſly propoſed, that when ever any minor party ſhould account the ends of Government perverted, they ſhould be at their primaeve liberty again, to break off from all the magiſtratical Order, and from ſociety with the major party of theſe, with whom they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined: Would not the overture of ſuch a condition be rejected with indignation and upon juſt reaſon? for that were to open a gap to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ſeditions, diviſions and fractions. And all rational men would judge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it were better not to joyn in ſociety with ſuch men, then to joyn in ſuch termes.</p>
               <p>Again, ſuppoſe there be a breaking off from a magiſtratical Power, and major part of a ſociety, upon pretenſion (which will never be wanting to cover ſedition and confuſion, ſuch is the corruption of men) of a perverſion of the ends of Government; the party making ſeceſſion, may haply meet with that ſame meaſure they gave to the Community, wherewith they were formerly joyned. For, when they have combined and embodied themſelves in a Society, if a minor party ariſe amongſt themſelves, with the ſame accuſations againſt them, which they had againſt the body they did ſeparate from; Muſt not that ſame party, have the ſame priviledge of Primaeve liberty, to combine and erect a corporation by themſelves, which they claimed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? will not they plead, that the obligation to the Government and Society ceaſeth, and they are free to erect a new one? And where ſhall there be a ſtand, till humane Societies be miſerably broken in pieces, which ſeems to be Satans deſign, by this Mans Doctrine?</p>
               <p>Further, can this aſſertion ſubſiſt, that neither alledgiance or fidelity, nor obedience, is to be given unto any created power, but in defence of Religion and Liberty? That obedience is not to be given unto any Creature on earth, againſt Religion, or the Revealed Will of God, ſhall be eaſily granted; we abhorre the very thought of ſo doing. Again, it ſhall not be ſaid, that obedience is to be given to Powers, againſt the Liberty competent to us, as Subjects, and conſiſtent with Soveraignty; yet ſo, that the meaſure of that Liberty, muſt not be made by every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99891:14"/>
mans will; but by the Declarature of the Parliament, repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of the Subjects, which beſt knows what thereunto belongs: But to ſay, that all (not only obedience, but) alledgiance and fidelity, due to any created power, is indiſpenſibly reſtricted to this qualification, <hi>in Defence of Religion and Liberty, viz.</hi> of the ſubject, is a moſt falſe aſſertion. It is known, that a reſtriction excludes all other caſes, which are not in the reſtrictve propoſition included; now it is certain, there may be caſes, wherein we ought to obey the Magiſtrate, and yet the act of obedience cannot be properly and directly ſaid, to be either in defence of Religion, or the Liberty of the Subject; there may be ſome cauſes that properly concern his own honour; wherein defence of Religion is not concerned, (the Magiſtrate perhaps not being of our Religion) and far leſs defence of the Liberty of the Subject, (unleſs by a very remote and unneceſſary conſequence) yet am I bound to him in cauſes concerning his honour; this made the Miniſters that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted with the Doctors of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> decline to acknowledge that clauſe of the firſt Covenant, <hi>in defence of Religion &amp;c.</hi> to be limitative or reſtrictive of duty to the King, affirming it onely to be ſpecifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiven, aming duties to him in ſome reſpects, or in reſpect to ſome things, not excluding others: Yea, the General Aſſembly, 1639. will not have that clauſe in the Covenant reſtrictive; for in their ſupplication to the Commiſſioner and Council, they ſpeak thus:
<q>We have ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemly ſworn and do ſwear, not only our mutual concurrence and aſſiſtance, for the cauſe of Religion, and to the utmoſt of our power, with our Means and Lives, to ſtand to the defence of our Dread So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, His Perſon and Authority, in the preſervation of true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Liberties and Laws of this Kirk and Kingdom; but alſo <hi>(n. b.)</hi> in every cauſe that may concern His Majeſties Honour, ſhall concur with our friends and followers, as we ſhall be required, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
So Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Obedience to the King is there extended, beyond what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly mentioned in the Covenant, (in defence of Religion and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.) But further, as to the point of Alledgiance or Fidelity, that is another matter then Obedience: Alledgiance to a King imports, owning him as Lawful and Rightful King, and that none others have power over him; together with fidelity to his Perſon, Crown and Dignity, againſt all conſpiracies and treaſon. Obedience is the reſult of this acknowledged Soveraignty, (where commands appear lawful.) A man may keep Alledgiance and Fidelity to the King, albeit ſometimes there may be commands given, which cannot be obeyed, becauſe of Gods countermand; many learned Prieſts and Papiſts in <hi>England,</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:99891:15"/>
took the Oath of Alledgiance, when firſt it was emitted and injoyn'd, albeit they thought they could not give obedience to the King, as to matters of Religion. But this man is plain in his aſſertion, that no Alledgiance is due to the King, except with this reſtriction, <hi>in defence of Religion</hi>: And (as he ſaid) a main part of his Religion is to erect Presbytery, and root out Prelacy; So that if Presbytery be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, people are taught to renounce Alledgiance to the King. How contrary is this to the <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> cap. 23. S. 4. Difference in Religion doth not (ſaith the <hi>Confeſſion</hi>) make void the Magiſtrates juſt and legal Authority, nor free the people from their due obedience to him: But this man will have no Alledgiance due to him, nor Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but in defence of Religion; which it is like he will not defend, if he be of a different perſwaſion in matters of Religion, and ſo muſt his Authority be made void.</p>
               <p>The contrary Theſis we muſt reſt upon, that although a ſupreme Magiſtrate defend not Religion, yet Alledgiance and Fidelity is alwayes due to him, and Obedience alſo in all things lawful. It is the Lords way for keeping humane Societies from groſs diſorders, to allow to ſuch as are in ſupreme Power by lawful calling, the honour due unto their place, even although in the main things they pervert the ends of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; not glorifying God by advancing true Religion, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honouring him by falſe Religion, or ſeducing others to their evil way, and perſecuting them who follow not their unlawful commandments. Yet, where adminiſtrations of Juſtice in civil things are tolerably ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, and civil Societies by Magiſtratical Authority kept in tolerable order, (that there be no general out-breakings in outragious oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions) God will have due reſpects payed to the places of Authority and perſons therein inſtalled, and will reckon dreadfully with them for any perverſions of the ends of Government, in his own time. Though <hi>Caeſar</hi> give not God his due, yet it is Chriſts mind that we give <hi>Caeſar</hi> his due, and his Apoſtles mind that he ſhould be honoured; not for his perſonal faults or abuſe of his power, but becauſe he is inveſted with power from God; which though he abuſeth, yet it remains the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God. And hereunto Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> fully agrees, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>inſtit. cap.</hi> 20. S. 24, 25. &amp;c. where at length he aſſerts,
<q>
                     <hi>That Alledgiance and Obedience (in things lawful) is due even to the worſt of Princes, and who do moſt manifeſtly pervert the ends of Government, by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Subjects, (of which our queſtion is now) S<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 25.</hi> Si Dei ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum reſpicimus longius nos deducet (viz. <hi>then to give alledgiance to good Princes</hi>) ut non eorum modo principum imperio ſubditi ſimus
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99891:15"/>
qui probe &amp; qua debent fide, munere ſuo erga nos defunguntur ſed omnium qui quoquo modo rerum potiuntur, etiamſi nihil minus praeſtent quam quod ex officio erat principum. <hi>Again,</hi> Omnes <hi>(ſaith he, ſpeaking of evil Princes)</hi> illa ſancta Majeſtate ſunt praediti, qua legittimam poteſtatem inſtruxit Deus. <hi>Again,</hi> In homine deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimo, honoreque omni indigniſſimo, penes quem modo ſit publica po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtas, praeclara illa &amp; divina poteſtas reſidet, quam Dominus juſtitiae &amp; judicii ſui miniſtris verbo ſuo detulit, proinde à ſubditis eadem reverentia &amp; dignatione habendus eſt, quantum ad publicam obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiam attinet qua optimum Regem, ſi daretur, habituri eſſent.</q>
Again, S. 27. he ſayes of an evil King,
<q>Aſſumptus eſt in Regiam Majeſtatem, quam violare, nefas eſt. <hi>Again,</hi> Nunquam in animum nobis ſeditioſae illae cogitationes veniant tractandum eſſe pro meritis Regem, nec aequum eſſe, ut ſubditos nos ei praeſtemus, qui viciſſim Regem nobis ſe non praeſtet.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Any may ſee, that in the matter of Civil Government, Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> was of another and a better ſpirit than theſe men, who inflame the people with their ſeditious Doctrine; and tells them, if the King do not his duty, their alledgiance to him and obligation to his Government ceaſeth; and no alledgiance nor obedience due to him, when he does not (or does contrary to) his duty.</p>
               <p>But, 2. As the Poſition in it ſelf is moſt unchriſtian and irrational, ſo the application of it to the caſe in theſe Times, made by this Maſter of confuſion, is moſt unjuſt; for (not to ſpeak of the firſt times of Reformation, wherein he ſayes, that there was ſuch perverſion of the ends of Government, as made the obligation of the injured Subjects thereto to ceaſe, Pag. 16.) he repeats the ſame more fully, Pag. 150. to juſtifie the late Inſurrection againſt the King; as if now there were ſuch manifeſt and notorious perverſion of the ends of Government, that the band thereof is looſed, and people are relapſed into their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeve liberty, to joyn in new Societies and Combinations as they ſee fit, rejecting the old. Now, may not any ſee the deſperate deſign of this Libeller and his like, to diſſipate and diſſolve the immemorially ſettled frame of this Nation and Kingdom, which through divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, hath in many generations ſubſiſted under our lawful Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns, for the common benefit of the Subjects at home, and to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and renown of the Nation abroad; yea, and to the glory of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, which hath through many ſtorms, in ſeveral ages, preſerved us in this comfortable conſtitution. But behold, a foul gap is now opened to let in all confuſion upon us, and to diſſipate and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99891:16"/>
break us in pieces miſerably, (if ſuch wicked Doctrine take upon people, God guard their hearts, we hope <hi>ſanctiores ſunt aures &amp; corda auditorum quam linguae Doctorum,</hi> as to this) Now it is left to the arbitrement and luſt of every party, even leſſer party of the people, to break off the old union with the Nation, to erect themſelves into new Societies and Combinations, as being now as free as if they had not been members of this Nation; they are relapſed into their primaeve liberty, and now every Paroch in <hi>Galloway</hi> is allowed to can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonize themſelves into a free Re-publick, or to become a little Kingdom of <hi>Ivetot,</hi> or make Combinations, and Heads of theſe Combinations, as they ſee fit; for they are liberate and looſed from the old Society and Government, becauſe the ends thereof are ſo manifeſtly perverted: And wherein, forſooth? Doth not the true Proteſtant Religion, as it is held forth in Scripture, and was publickly confeſſed by our firſt Reformers, (which Confeſſion is regiſtred, <hi>Parl.</hi> 1. K. <hi>James</hi> 6.) through Gods mercy, continue with us, without variation from it in the leaſt? Doth not the Kings Majeſty protect and advance this bleſſed Truth of the Saving Goſpel, and incourage and invite all according to his power to embrace it? Is he not willing and deſirous that the Laws be vigorouſly executed againſt Papiſts, and all perverters of this ſound Doctrine? If there be deficiency in execution, the blame lyes elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where then upon him. Are Gods people, or any people in the Land, ſpoiled of their lawful civil Liberties? What one thing hath he done without conſent of the peoples Repreſentatives in Parliament, at which any may except as a grievance? What burthen hath he laid upon their Eſtates, but by Law, of by their own conſent in a neceſſary exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence? What ſhould be the great ground then of ſo horrid a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring of the body of this Common-wealth and ſeceſſion from the civil Society, and from ſubjection to the lawful Government thereof, as this man teaches and would perſwade? What is that ſo fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal perverſion of the ends of Government, that may, to any minor party that pleaſes, bear the Weight of a rational licence to reject the Government and the Society of the Common-wealth, to erect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into new ſeparate and politick Bodies? Or, that may perſwade them, as the caſe ſtands, they are relapſed into their primaeve liberty, like the Fiſhes of the Sea that have no Ruler? Or that now being liberate, they are free (as they were at firſt) to combine themſelves in new Societies as they ſee fit? It muſt ſurely be ſome great thing that ſhould warrand ſuch great actions. It were too much to queſtion their judgement, to aſſert, that they indeed think, that becauſe the

moderate Epiſcopacy, and inſpection of ſome Miniſters over others in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of the Land to hold them to their duties, (eſtabliſhed by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Laws) is now re-eſtabliſhed by the King, with conſent of his people in Parliament, (the lawfulneſs of which ſhall be afterwards ſpoken to) That therefore this, and legal courſes for carrying on of this, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground for ſo unnatural a rupture, although the King ſhould not, for the pleaſure of an inconſiderable party, recede from owning and proſecuting his juſt Laws concerning this; experience having abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly taught, that giving way to evil humours and unreaſonable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, is but a mean to provoke to greater inſolencies. But under ſuch pretenſions againſt a lawful way, ſurely ſomething lurketh that doth not yet appear: For, ſuppoſing a change of the eſtabliſhed way, it is folly to think the matter ſhould there reſt; this man and his party are of another ſpirit then to be ſatisfied with ſuch low matters, (were they according to his mind) for all, alongs in his <hi>Naphtali</hi> and <hi>Apology</hi> Prerogative is the mark that is ſhot at as well as Prelacy, (as we ſhall ſee) the one is as great an eye-ſore as the other. And were all other quarrels that ſeemed to touch upon Religion laid aſide, yet is not the battel done without retrenchment of Royal Prerogative (even in civil things) which as well as in Eccleſiaſtical, is diſputed down in the <hi>Apology,</hi> but moſt weakly and fooliſhly. And ſtill alſo, the liberty of the Subject ſhould be a ſubject of controverſie; wherein this high-flown man, his Party and complices, will not have the Parliament to be Judge, what is the true Liberty of the People (conſiſtent with So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty) or what not, (for this man ſets forth the late Parliament, as the great betrayers of the Liberty of the People) but every Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanter muſt make his diſcretive judgement his rule, to determine his actings for the Liberty of the People. And if there be any Party in ſufficient capacity to take the fields, they will, and muſt, according to their diſcretion, carve out the meaſure of the Subjects Liberties, (which it is like will be large enough, at leaſt, toward themſelves, if not toward others) and will account themſelves bound by Covenant, (according to their own interpretation) to fight to death for what they count Liberty; and to forſake the Government and Society of others in the Land, (though they be the far leſſe part) and erect new Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their own under new Heads, that they may injoy their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted Liberty, which the perverted Government deprives them of, and from which therefore they are looſed and liberated for ever, and reduced to their primaeve liberty to chooſe Government and Societies as beſt liketh them.

               <head>CHAP. II. Of violent reſiſtance to the Powers ordain'd of God, by meer private perſons their Subjects.</head>
               <p>THe point of violent reſiſtance to the Supreme Magiſtrate by Subjects, hath been hotly and violently debated both elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where and in thoſe Lands upon ſad occaſions. The more moderate Aſſerters of it, do not give the liberty of ſo doing unto meer private perſons, nor againſt Princes <hi>integrae Majeſtatis,</hi> or who have come to their Kingdoms without pactions of reſtraint put on them by the people: nor do they at all grant the liberty of this reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but in the caſe of immaneſt Tyranny and extreameſt Cruelty, againſt the Body or moſt conſiderable part of the Body of the Common-wealth or ſuch like, or in caſe of ſudden perſonal extra-judicial, illegal invaſions, importing irreparable loſſe of life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (wherein judicious Royaliſts will not much differ from others) nor do they grant a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to proceed beyond the bounds of <hi>inculpata tutela,</hi> innocent and harmleſſe ſelf-defence; for if either there be a preventive invaſion of the Magiſtrat, or a ſucceeding revenge if he be brought under, all agree that this exceeds <hi>moderamen inculpatae tutelae,</hi> ſo men are not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſelf-defenders, but Magiſtrate-invaders. And whatever power of defence is allowed to inferiour Magiſtrates with the People, yet, that meer Subjects, or private perſons, ſhould take on them power of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or puniſhing the Supreme Magiſtrate, or puniſhing him, it is abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the common ſenſe of Chriſtian and Learned men.</p>
               <p>But this Libeller goes a great length: for, not only doth he allow the body of the People, with inferiour Magiſtrates, to make violent reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the King, whenſoever they think he wrongs them; but allows
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99891:17"/>
any part of the People (only requiring that they make ſure that they are in probable capacity to carry through their matters) to riſe in Arms and make violent reſiſtance to all the Magiſtrates ſupreme and ſubordinate; yea, and againſt all the major part of the people. And albeit Magiſtrates act according to Laws agreed upon by the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives of the people; yet this man allows any part of the People (though no Magiſtrate be amongſt them) to take Arms againſt all Magiſtrates, and violently reſiſt them, when they think their Laws either unjuſt, or the puniſhments executed unjuſt; and he maintains, that paſſive ſubjection to unjuſt Laws and Puniſhments, where there is power to make active violent reſiſtance, is a greater ſin then active obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to unlawful Commands of Magiſtrates. This ſeems ſtrange Doctrine, but more and worſe will be ſeen in the following Chapter But that he may get no wrong, look upon his own words, (referring what he ſpeaks of puniſhing Magiſtrates to the following Chapter.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is</hi> (ſaith he, Page 8.) <hi>a neceſſity of Convocations and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations, not only without, but even againſt Authority; and it is ſufficiently warranded before God and all men for neceſſary and juſt ends. Again, the power of ſelf-defence,</hi> Page 14. (as he calls violent reſiſting the Magiſtrate) <hi>is competent to all men by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct of pure nature, and is the principal rule of righteouſneſs, and a priviledge competent to all men ſeparately and joyntly, not needing any other prerequiſite, but intollerable injury, and is compleated in exerciſe, by a probable capacity to encourage to it. And to ſuffer injury under ptetext of the good of the Common-wealth, is for the deluſion of an empty name and for the luſts of others, really to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive a mans ſelf of all ſhare and benefit in it.</hi> Page 15. <hi>propelling by force injuries done in the cauſe of Religion, is the juſteſt quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, that men in their primaeve liberty could be engaged into.</hi> And, Page 16, 17. <hi>Combinations for aſſiſtance in violent oppoſition of the Magiſtrate, when the ends of Government are perverted (which muſt be referred to the diſcretion of them, who minds inſurrection) are neceſſary by the Law of Nature, of Charity, and in order to Gods glory; and for violation of this duty, of delivering the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed from Magiſtrates, judgements comes upon people.</hi> And, Page 18, 19. <hi>not only power of ſelf-defence, but vindicative and reforming power is in any part of the people againſt the whole and againſt all Magiſtrates, and if they uſe it not, judgement comes on (ſuppoſing their capacity probable to bear them forth) and they ſhall be puniſh'd for their connivance, and not acting in way of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99891:18"/>
vindication of crimes and reforming abuſes.</hi> And, Page 28. <hi>they are but Flatterers, and Men that have renounced Conſcience, who ſay, that abſolute ſubjection in ſuffering may be given to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority abuſing their power, and not abſolute obedience to their Commands; and whatſoever reaſon</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>pleads for abſolute ſubjection in ſuffering, will far more rationally and plauſibly infer unlimited and abſolute obedience. Abſolute obedience may be more rationally yeelded, then abſolute ſubjection to ſuffering.</hi> Page 157. <hi>to reſiſt and riſe up againſt perſons abuſing Authority, is to adhere to God; and</hi> Page 155. <hi>The late riſing was altogether lawful, righteous and neceſſary.</hi> But, what needs inſiſting on his juſtifying of any number of private perſons, riſing up and reſiſting the whole Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and Body of the People, when ever they think they have cauſe? ſeing this is the main ſcope of his Book, and more too, even to ſtate them in a punitive power of all who are againſt them, and a power to pull down all Authorities that are in their way, as after ſhall more clearly appear.</p>
               <p>But upon this point of reſiſtance, (which he liſpeth out as innocent, harmleſs ſelf-defence) it is fit we ſhould now (abſtracting from the other queſtions of private perſons vindicative and punitive power, till the next Chapter) ſpeak ſomewhat. It is the ſubtilty of Sathan and of mans corruption, that moſt horrid ſins and crimes, are covered under very ſmooth termes, and cloaked with ſome Vizard of Vertue, or with ſomething ſo plauſible and ſweet to ſelf-nature, that few there are who will not own it.</p>
               <p>Innocent ſelf-defence and a mans preſervation of his own beeing, is ſo plauſible a Plea, that every one in any vexation that comes upon them, from any (juſtly or unjuſtly) are much inclined to take hold of it. It is true, the God of nature, who hath given a beeing to all creatures, hath alſo given them inclinations and propenſions, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve themſelves againſt oppoſition, deſtroying nature, the very inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate creatures have this: Fire preſerves and defends it ſelf againſt water when it is caſt upon it; there is a fight between the two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary qualities of theſe creatures, the fire with a noiſe reſiſting the water, that it be not quenched with the contrary qualities of that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So alſo are the ſenſitive creatures, the beaſts are carried (<hi>impetu naturae</hi>) to oppoſe every thing that tends to their deſtruction, and to preſerve their own beeing, untill they be over-powered: And all this ſelf-defence, is without ſin; for they being onely under natures Law, and not under any Legal reſtraints of the exerciſe of their ſelf-defending

power, by Gods word, nor under any rule of reaſon in the exerciſe thereof, do and may to the uttermoſt (in all caſes) endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour their ſelf-preſervation, and nothing can hinder them from it, but <hi>major vis,</hi> and a Phyſical force greater then theirs is: And this ſelf-defending or preſerving power and propenſion, God hath given alſo unto Men, yet otherwiſe then to inanimate creatures, or unto beaſts; for theſe being under no other Law or Order, but that of meer Nature, that onely ſeeks its own preſervation, and labours in ſelf-defence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, againſt all things afflicting nature <hi>caec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But Mans natural propenſion to defend himſelf, is ſubordinated unto, and limited by, the higher Laws of Reaſon and Grace, and regulated by reſpects to the eternal good of the Soul, in following duties to God, (albeit with vexation and trouble upon the outward man) a rational and gracious man, will advert leſt in ſelf-preſervation, as to his body or outward ſtate, he bring not on ſelf-deſtruction, as to his Soul: It was wiſely ſaid by <hi>Thomas,</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">•</hi>.2<hi rend="sup">•</hi>. <hi>queſt.</hi> 70. <hi>art.</hi> 4. <hi>ad</hi> 1. <hi>Ideo Homini data eſt Ratio,</hi> (and I may add <hi>Gratia) ut eá ad quae natura inclinat, non paſſim, ſed ſecundum ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis, vel gratia ordinem exequatur, &amp; ideo non quaelibet defenſio ſui eſt licita ſed quae fit cum debito moderamine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is too groſs Divinity,<note rend="inter">Lex Rex, p. <hi>344.</hi> Apol. p. <hi>162.</hi>
                  </note> to bring arguments from Beaſts, (who being under no Law of Reaſon nor Grace, to limite their propenſions, may alwayes in all imaginable caſes, defend themſelves with force) to perſwade men that they may do the like, and that their propenſion for their external preſervation, is no more under any reſtraining rule, to ſtop the exerciſe of it, then that of Beaſts is. There are many caſes of Rational and Gracious reſtraint, of the exerciſe of that natural propenſion for ſelf-preſervation, upon Men, which are not upon Beaſts.</p>
               <p>For, 1. the Libeller, (it is hoped) will not allow ſelf-defence, (of violent and forcible defence, not of moral, we do here alwayes ſpeak) or violent reſiſtance of the Magiſtrate, when Men are not in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Capacity to mend themſelves, or when it is ſeen to be to no purpoſe; In this caſe, he will ſay it is no fault, for a Man not to uſe violent reſiſtance, becauſe Reaſon tells him, it is to no purpoſe; ſelf-defence of a rational creature, ſhould not be meerly natural, but rational; it is natural to a Man to defend himſelf, as it is to a Beaſt, but not in the ſame way, not alwayes when a Beaſt (upon which, there is no reſtraint of reaſon) may do it. It will not be denyed, that the obligation of violent ſelf-preſervation ceaſeth, when a Man is put
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99891:19"/>
out (by a Phyſical-force,) of all probable Capacity to help him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Man who is juſtly condemned to death, both according to a juſt Law, and by a juſt proceſs according to the Law; though he were in probable capacity to defend himſelf, with uſing Force and Violence upon the Magiſtrate: Yet were it utterly unlawful for him, to uſe violent ſelf-defence againſt the Magiſtrate, with re-offending him; (what ever may be ſaid of Flying, in ſuch a caſe, when a door is opened, which is no violent reſiſting) For, as it is a ſinful reſiſting of the Ordinance of God, to refuſe Obedience to the Magiſtrates Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Commands; So it is no leſſe ſinful reſiſtance of the Ordinance of God, to reſiſt and re-offend the Magiſtrate lawfuly puniſhing, or to uſe force againſt him for ſelf-preſervation, when we are by Providence, brought under the hand of Juſtice; if the violence uſed by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, on the Perſon legally ſentenced, be juſt, the violence of the party againſt the Magiſtrate, cannot but be unjuſt and ſinful; for, the violence cannot be matterially juſt upon both ſides. Here is a clear caſe, where natures Law of ſelf-preſervation, (at leaſt in a way of violence) muſt ceaſe and be ſilent, before the Law of Reaſon and the Will of God, revealed to Men: They are too bold, and come too near to Blaſpheme God, <hi>(Lex Rex)</hi> who ſay, <hi>That it were a mighty defect in Divine Providence, that Men ſhould not have at large a liberty to defend themſelves violently, as Beaſts have; And that Men were in a worſe condition then Beaſts, if as Beaſts have alwayes power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves violently, with their Hornes, Heels, Teeth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So Men ſhould not have as large a liberty in every caſe, to uſe violence upon Magiſtrates, putting them to vexation, or perhaps troubling them, in life, ſtate,</hi> &amp;c. Men have nobler Prerogatives above Beaſts, albeit, they be reſtrained of that brutiſh liberty, which Beaſts have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes and againſt all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. May not the exerciſe of this priviledge, of ſelf-defence and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent reſiſtance, be reſtrained by the Grace of God, and the power of His Command for ſubmiſſion, abiding upon a Mans ſpirit? How eaſily could <hi>Iſaac,</hi> have defended himſelf, againſt the violence of his aged Father, in binding him, to be laid on the Altar, to have his throat cut, and his body burnt? Yet, conſcience of the pleaſure and command of the Soveraign Lord of life and death, makes him, to forbear ſelf-defence, or violent reſiſtance; neither was this forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the ſin of ſelf-murther, or againſt the ſixth Command; but a highly Gracious act and eminent Obedience, to the firſt and greateſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99891:19"/>
Commandment. Forbearance of ſelf-defence and violent reſiſtance, was there a vertue; an act of obedience and abſolute ſubjection to God, the Lord of his life, not much beneath <hi>Abrahams</hi> obedience, that is ſo highly commended from Heaven.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Are there not alſo ſome caſes, not of this extraordinary ſort, wherein ſelf-defence, which this Libeller fooliſhly calls the ſupreme Law of Righteouſneſs, and principal Rule of it, Page 14. (of which we ſhall hear a little anon) muſt ceaſe: As, may not the defence of our temporal life in ſome caſe ceaſe, for the preſervation of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life of our neighbour, when it comes to that, that the defence of the one ſhould be the certain loſs of the other? 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralem vitam ſuam pro aeterna vita proximi non dubitabit Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus amittere,</hi> Auguſt. <hi>ad Conſent. lib.</hi> 6. which the School-men have driven ſo far on, that they have thought, that a man in the ſtate of Grace, being invaded by another in the ſtate of ſin, ought rather to be content to be ſlain by the private aggreſſor, then to ſlay him being in ſuch a ſtate of ſin and damnation: to which we ſhall hardly ſubſcribe, leſt it ſhould ſtrike againſt the lawfulneſs of the warrs of godly men againſt wicked invaders; juſtice may, and muſt be done, in warrs and otherwiſe, whatever be the ſouls eſtate of the ſufferer; that is to be referred to God, and is ſealed amongſt his ſecrets: yet, that there may be ſuch caſes, that (when need is) the preſervation of our own tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral life may be forborn, for the certain preſervation of the ſoul of another, ſeems agreeable to the cited Scripture.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Doth not the obligation to ſelf-defence ceaſe, (ſpeaking of ſelf-defence as to the temporal life) for the publick good and preſervation of the Common-wealth, or of the Head of the Common-wealth, the King? I know this Libeller jeers at a mans ſuffering, (under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of the good of the Common-wealth) intolerable and inevitable injuries) and ſayes, <hi>It is but for the deluſion of an empty name, only for the luſts of others, really to deprive a mans ſelf of his whole ſhare and intereſt in the Common-wealth,</hi> Pag. 15. Yet, better Divines then he a great deal, have concluded it as moſt rational, that a man is bound to ſuffer the greateſt extremity of death, rather then that for ſparing of his ſuffering, the Common-wealth, or Head of the Common-wealth, or main publick Perſon, ſhould ſuffer.

Certainly, this is far contrair to this mans Divinity; who will have none to ſuffer under pretext of the good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, if they be innocent, (whether really or in their own eyes) <hi>For why,</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>that is for an empty name and luſts of others, to deprive a mans ſelf of his ſhare in the Common-wealth.</hi> What then? if a man do loſe his ſhare in the Common-wealth and be found in the way of his duty, he is no loſer, he gets a better ſhare then that is. If a General command a Souldier, for the certain good of the Army, (upon the well-being whereof, the good of the Common-wealth depends) to go to ſuch a part or poſt, where, in his own mind, he ſaw certain death triſting with him; would this Author teach the Souldier to ſay, <hi>Shall I expoſe my ſelf to certain death for an empty name of the good of Army and Common-wealth, and at the luſt of the General, loſe all my ſhare and intereſt both in Army and Common-wealth?

It is agreed amongſt the Learned, that ſelf-preſervation (as to temporal life) when it comes in competition with the preſervation of the King or Head of the Common-wealth, or a publick Perſon moſt neceſſary to the Common-wealth, muſt ceaſe and cede thereunto; as the Hand in the natural Body will be caſt up (though it ſhould be cut off) to hold off a deadly ſtroke from the Head, <hi>Ameſ.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99891:20"/>
whereunto the great command of love to our neighbour, by Gods Law, is reſolved, and whereby it is interpreted,</hi> P. 14. therefore it is to be preferred to all duties to men, according to this mans mind. True it is, there is a due order of our charity and love to men and our neighbours; and true love to our ſelves, is indeed the rule and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of love to our neighbour: we are firſt to love our ſelves, and then our neighbour as our ſelves, (not as much, but as truly and ſincerely; for it is not the quantity, but the quality of love, not equality but ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilitude of love to our neighbour, in proportion of that to our ſelves, that is required.) But it is untrue, that in the exerciſe of this love of our ſelves, in ſelf-defence or preſervation of our bodies, ſtands the principal rule of righteouſneſs: For, there may be caſes, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome are pointed at) wherein a man is bound to prefer the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of others, to the preſervation or defence of his own natural life; and yet in ſo doing, a man doth truly love himſelf more then others, in doing his duty to others, although with the loſs of his own life and ſurceaſing the defence of it, (<hi>ſe magis diligit ad finem ſuum ultimum,</hi> as the School ſpeaks.)

But too many are ſo much upon ſelf-defence and preſervation of the natural life by any means, that in preſerving their bodies, they deſtroy their ſouls; and ſo do not indeed love themſelves ſo much and ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly as they ought to do.</p>
               <p>But the great knot of the queſtion anent ſelf- defence is this, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meer private perſons, one or moe, ſeparatly or joyntly, when they are or think themſelves unjuſtly afflicted, and extremly injuriouſly handled by the Magiſtrate, or Supreme Power, proceeding according to Laws agreed to, betwixt himſelf and the body of the Community? whither or not (upon ſuppoſition that theſe Laws are not juſt and right) may private perſons defend themſelves againſt the violence of the Magiſtrate thus proceeding, even by violent re-offending; yea, in order to their own defence, cut off the Prince or Magiſtrate whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, or their Miniſters and Officers ſtanding in their way, or when they are puniſhing them and afflicting them according to Law? This is the

true ſtate of the Controverſie, at this time: and needleſs it were to run out upon what the two Martyrs (as <hi>Napth.</hi> calls them, Page 27.) <hi>Lex Rex,</hi> the Book might have been better termed <hi>Exlex Exrex</hi>) and the Apology hath ſet down tediouſly, touching <hi>Scotlands</hi> defenſive Arms, as they call them. What ſenſe the people of <hi>Scotland</hi> (when they have come to liberty) have of theſe arms, their late repreſentative hath declared; and it were to be wiſhed, that the memory of ſuch ways might be ſo buried, that the poſter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This only ſhall be ſaid, that theſe Diſputes of defenſive Arms (in both theſe Martyrs) proceed (as upon their main foundation) upon moſt untrue and malitious miſrepreſentations of matters of fact; all or moſt of the Arguments run upon falſe Hypotheſes and bitter, untrue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ctions on the late King. As if, 1. he had been the firſt invader of the Nation, whereas it is known, his Authority was firſt invaded, his Laws troden upon, his Proclamations openly deſpiſed, his Caſtles vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſeiſed, illegal Tables and Courts ſet up, his Subjects, walking ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Laws, perſecuted; his Arms he took, were not invaſive againſt the Nation, but defenſive of his own Authority, of his Laws and the perſons of orderly walking Subjects; and for reducing theſe who had ſtrayed from their duty. 2. They repreſent him in their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent writings, as <hi>Nerone ipſo neronior,</hi> a great perſecutor of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, intending the total ruine and deſtruction of the Proteſtant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and the total ruine and deſtruction of the whole people of the Land; In a word, as the immaneſt and moſt conſummate Tyrant in the World (upon ſuch ſuggeſtions doth the plea for defenſive Arms go.) But the World knows, that that King lived and died a Proteſtant, and not one, either ignorant or formal, or profane (as too many alas are) but having great knowledge of the truth, ardent zeal for it, and being exemplarly devote, and to the great confuſion of his enemies, he laid down his life as a glorious Martyr for the true Religion of God, and laws and Liberties of the people. If there was any thing that could not have a favourable Interpretation in that unhappy Book that gave the riſe to the troubles, how timely was it retired, and great ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſecurity given for Religion? If through default of Miniſters of State, any thing had creeped in, that could not abide the teſt of Law, how willingly was it reformed?

ſinful people, his fatal end might be brought on, not becauſe he had been a Tyrant, but becauſe he had not been ſuch.</p>
               <p>But I am ſenſible of a digreſſion. The caſe now to be noticed is much different from what then was. Then the <hi>Primores Regn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> (upon miſtakes which ſince they have had opportunity to reſent) were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily engaged in oppoſition to the Soveraign: but now a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made by this Libeller to all meer private perſons, (not having any Nobles and Magiſtrates amongſt them) to make inſurrections againſt all Magiſtrates from the higheſt to the loweſt, and againſt the plurality of the people (if they think themſelves in probable capacity) and what confidence will not deſperate men deſigning confuſion have? and not only ſo, but a liberty is given them by this man to pull all Magiſtrates out of their ſeats, to inſtall themſelves, and to puniſh Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, who (as he ſayes) have forfeited their right by the abuſe thereof. If this Doctrine hath not a native tendency to the ruine and deſtruction of this Nation, and of all Nations where this evil ſeed ſhall take root, let them who are judicious declare.</p>
               <p>That Magiſtrates have no power nor warrand from God to abuſe their Authority, or to oppreſſe and deal injuſtly, is a thing out of all queſtion, (they who do ſo, will make a ſad reckoning for it to the great Judge of all, here and hereafter.) But when the corruption of theſe who are in power, leads them to abuſe their Authority, either in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king unjuſt Laws, or puniſhing according to theſe, the queſtion is, what is (in this caſe) the duty of meer private Subjects, whither they ſhould with violence oppoſe all Magiſtrates (under whom they are) from the higheſt to the loweſt, (together with the plurality of the Body of that Community whereof they are Members) yea; and in their own defence, deſtroy them all (if they be in probable capacity for ſuch work, and if they cannot eſchew this and preſerve themſelves) yea farther, if after they have ſubdued (Providence ſo permitting or ordering) all the Magiſtratical power and major part of the people, they may uſe a vindicative, avenging and puniſhing Power upon all? (being only perſons of private capacity) This (as will appear by this and the next Chapter) is the true ſtate of the queſtion at this time, as the Libeller in his Book hath ſtated it.</p>
               <p>Upon the reſolution of this queſtion, this Advocate of the ſeditious Party ſhakes hands with many Papiſts (albeit ſome of the more Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, are of a contrary opinion) aſſerting, That any perſon that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly condemned or purſued, (or that thinks himſelf ſo dealt with, by the Magiſtrate or Judge, (whatever he be, Supreme or Subordinate)

may defend himſelf by Arms againſt the Judge or Magiſtrate, and his Officers and Miniſters; even by ſlaying them, if he cannot otherwiſe eſcape: becauſe, in that caſe, the Magiſtrate is an unjuſt Invader.

But the queſtion is, (as hath been ſaid) whether, when the Magiſtrate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds according to Law, agreed unto by himſelf and the body of the Community, (ſuppoſe upon the matter, it be <hi>Lex male poſita,</hi> or no right or juſt Law) may any part of the people, or meer private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, (who think themſelves in capacity ſo to do) offer violence to the Magiſtrate, or to his Miniſters and Officers, proceeding according to Law, or if they ought to ſubmit to puniſhment, (or elſe flee) if they cannot obey the praeceptive part of the Law; being bound up, (as they ſay) in conſcience. As for private perſons, going out further to revenge wrongs done them on the Magiſtrate, or puniſhing them, that is to be ſpoken to hereafter: But this now is the true ſtate of the buſineſs, at this time, anent violent reſiſtance of the Magiſtrates; (all of them, from the higheſt to the loweſt, and of the whole body of the Nation) by any minor part of private perſons, who apprehend themſelves in capacity for that work.</p>
               <p>It ought to be well conſidered, and it may be eaſily perceived, how Satan in theſe laſt and worſt of times, is mainly labouring to bring in confuſion into humane Societies; to raiſe ſcandals upon Religion, and to tempt and provoke the Princes of the World, to diſlodge the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99891:23"/>
Church of God, out of their Dominions; becauſe of the ſeditious Principles and unquiet Practices of ſome Profeſſors thereof; (though Religion, is innocent as to theſe) which tend to the diſſolution of the State-government; yea, and alſo, of all Church-government.</p>
               <p>It is to be marked, that when <hi>Lex Rex</hi> had in ſeveral places (See Pag. 463. and, Pag. 313.) vented that Principle, in reference to the Civil Government: <hi>That no Man is bound in Conſcience to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection paſſive, under unjuſt puniſhments, inflicted by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, more then to active obedience unto unlawful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands; and that paſſive obedience, under unjuſt Sentences, comes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no Command of God: Yea, that it is a ſin againſt Gods Command, to be paſſively ſubject to an unjuſt Sentence; And that it is an act of Grace and Vertue, for a Man to reſiſt the Magiſtrate violently, when he does him wrong, and a ſelf-murther againſt the ſixth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, not to reſiſt, when he offers to take the life without cauſe, though, not without Law,</hi> pag. 314.322. When, I ſay, theſe Doctrines were broached, in reference to the Common-wealth; they were very quickly tranſlated, and applied to the Church, by this man and his party; who pleaded ſome years ago, very ſtrongly (as they thought) for non-ſubmiſſion unto, and counteracting of, all the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories of the Presbyterial Government, whenſoever the perſons injured, thought the Sentence wrong and unlawful; ſo that no excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate private perſon, ought to ſubmit to the Sentence of any, or all the Judicatories, if he thought the Sentence wrong and unlawful; and no Miniſter ſhould leave his Minſtery, but continue acting in it, if he thought the Sentence of depoſition, given againſt him by any, or all the Judicatories of the Church, unjuſt: And they cryed out, (if this might not be admitted for ſound Doctrine) that Presbytery was turned into Papacy and abſolute Tyranny; yea, they proceeded further then the point of counteracting, for the Agitators of the ſchimatical Party, would take upon them to poſſeſſe the power of the moſt eminent Church-judicatories, (they being the far minor Part) and did in that ſelf-created capacity of Government, over all others, in this Church, act, (excluding others, who were the greater Part) thinking, that though they were the far leſſer Part, yet being the founder, (in their own judgement) the Government and managing of it, belonged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; and not unto the corrupt plurality of Miniſters, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved all to bow before them: And how well their Practices in the Church do homologate with their Practices as to the State (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from one and the ſame Principle) we may now ſee. For it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99891:24"/>
is the way which they clearly own, that every private perſon, (when and ſo long as they are able, or are in probable capacity, to act violently againſt the Magiſtrate) ought to counter-act him violently, when he thinks the Magiſtrate wrongs him; (for this muſt be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to every Mans private diſcretive judgement, as <hi>Naphtali</hi> tells us, pag. 148.) and nothing excuſes from this violent reſiſting, but <hi>quando deſunt vires temporales.</hi> No ſubmiſſion is to be expected from them, by Magiſtrates, (when they Govern not according to their mind) but when they cannot otherwiſe do; nor any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, or out of any Principle of Conſcience, but prudential and politick, becauſe they are not in probable capacity to give him Battel; if they had the tempting opportunity and capacity, the caſe would be altered: Then not only violent reſiſtance ſhould come to be duty, but pulling of the Magiſtrate out of his chair of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (as we will hear) puniſhing him, and placing themſelves, though but private Men, in his room.</p>
               <p>How contrary ſuch principles and practices, of private Mens non-ſubmiſſion to, and counter-acting of, Church-judicatories, (ſuppoſed to do wrong) are unto the Word of God, how ſubverſive of Church-government, how introductory of Schiſme, Hereſies and all Miſchiefs into the Church, is well diſcovered by the learned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewer of the Pamphlet, intituled, <hi>Presbytery</hi> no <hi>Papacy, Proteſters</hi> no <hi>Subverters:</hi> And with equal reaſon, may the ſame grounds be made uſe of, againſt this Mans inciting all private perſons to counter-act the Magiſtrate violently; when they think he doth them wrong, or when they account their Sentences unjuſt. As certain confuſion comes on the Church, if the Principles of that Party, be entertained; ſo, let Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple once drink in this Mans Doctrine, in reference to the State, there ſhall be no end of ſedition, no ſecurity for the powers ordained by God; for, any private perſons are made judges of the juſtice of the Magiſtrates Sentences and Puniſhments; (and what Man will readily condemn himſelf, if he may be admitted to be judge in his own cauſe?) And upon their own private judgement, of the injuſtice of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates dealing with them, are allowed, without any further prere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, to uſe violence againſt him; pull the ſword out of his hand, and pull himſelf out of his ſeat; onely, there muſt be probable capacity for this, and nothing excuſes from not doing ſo, but want of that capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city: If that be wanting, there muſt be ſubmiſſion to unjuſt Sentences; not out of any conſciencious reſpect to the Power, but <hi>ad redimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam majorem vexationem.</hi> This is the Libellers mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:99891:24"/>Such Doctrine ſurely is neither conſonant to Gods Word, to the practices of his dear and approven People, to the mind of his ſoundeſt Servants, nor to ſound Reaſon. Who ever will conſult the holy Oracles of God, will find, that not only is obedience commanded to be given to Magiſtrates in their lawful injunctions, and ſubmiſſion, not only for wraths-ſake, but alſo for conſcience-ſake, to their juſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſin and wickedneſs, (who ever re-offends or violently reſiſts the Magiſtrate in either of theſe, no doubt reſiſts the Ordinance of God, and receive to themſelves damnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2.) but alſo, that there is a ſubmiſſion required to be yielded them, even when they put us to ſuffer wrongfully and unjuſtly, may be evidently gathered from Scripture grounds; in the caſe of unjuſt ſuffering, God hath not left his people without direction what to do, in reference to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates abuſing their power.</p>
               <p>It is true (as hath been ſaid) the Lord hath not given a moral power or warrand to any inveſted with Authority, to do evil or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly; concerning that the queſtion is not: But the queſtion is, what duty is owed, by the Subject, unto the Magiſtrate, (eſpecially the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme; for, there may be remedies had againſt the injuries of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior by appellation) in caſe of his male-adminiſtration and unjuſt Laws, or Sentences according to theſe Laws, or Executions according to Sentence; whether they may violate or violent the perſon inveſted with Authority, and not ſubmit to him, but counter-act him by force in ſelf-defence againſt his violence: or, if they be bound in conſcience, or by any Law of God, to ſubmit humbly to what he inflicts, (although unjuſtly) if they can neither move him by their humble petitions to forbear them, nor can flee from his wrath, or go out of his Dominions. This man and his Complices maintain, that if the Magiſtrate abuſe his power in making unjuſt Laws, or puniſhing according to theſe; any private man or company of men, that think themſelves ſtrong enough for the Magiſtrate, ought never to ſuffer, but uſe forcible reſiſtance againſt the Magiſtrate abuſing his power; and that all the patience that is required of Chriſtians, toward oppreſſing Magiſtrates, is only to bear ſuffering patiently when they are out of capacity of acting, and may not better do; and to ſuffer patiently, when they ſee they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the violence of the unjuſtly-dealing Magiſtrate with a ſufficient contrary violence. This Doctrine, favouring ſo ſtrongly of carnal ſelfie-nature, and being too ſuitable to the way of beaſts, who know no other thing but to be carried with a natural <hi>impetus</hi> to repay violence with violence till they be over-powered, we utterly diſlike, and do
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99891:25"/>
aſſert, according to the Holy Scriptures, That even when Magiſtrates deal unjuſtly, or put any to ſuffering wrongfully, (albeit they are for this to give a dreadful account, and albeit Subjects are to judge of their actions as they deſerve, and not approve their malverſation, but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly witneſs againſt it, as there is opportunity) yet, ſuffering perſons are bound to a paſſive ſubmiſſion or obedience, enduring wrongs done to them not only with reſpect to Gods providential Ordinance, (by which their ſuffering comes to paſs) but with reſpect to his inſtitutive Ordinance of Magiſtracy, wherewith the perſons afflicting them are inveſted, (albeit in the particular acts concerning them, abuſing their power) For, albeit the abuſe of the power be not of God, yet the abuſed power is of God; and the perſon inveſted therewith muſt have reſpect from the ſufferer, (other reſpect then is to be given to a private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vader) <hi>intuitu officii,</hi> not <hi>intuitu abuſus officii</hi>; and this reſpect is patient ſubmiſſion under the affliction, though unjuſtly inflicted; and not daring to re-violent the perſon inveſted with Magiſtratical power (although in a particular toward us he abuſe his power) to commit our perſons and our cauſe to him that judgeth righteouſly, not offering to move ſedition, albeit we were able for it. If we ſhall only look to theſe three things in the Scripture, we ſhall ſee ground for what is ſaid.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider what is required of Children toward their Parents un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly afflicting them, and likewiſe from Servants toward their Maſters; and by analogy we may learn ſomewhat of the mind of God, of the duty of Subjects to their Princes, who are their political Fathers, and have a deſpotical and lordly power over them. For Children, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.9, 10. <hi>We had Fathers of our fleſh, who corrected and chaſtned us after their own pleaſure, and we gave them reverence</hi>; which in the apodoſis of the ſimilitude, is expon'd <hi>ſubjection, v.</hi> 9. This is not only ſpoken of <hi>narrativè</hi> but <hi>approbativè</hi> (if it were not ſo, the argument taken from our carriage to Parents to enforce reverent ſubjection to God, were not good.) The Apoſtle approves the reverend ſubjection of Children to their Parents, though unreaſonably and with mixtures of unjuſt paſſion correcting them: he allows not the deed of the Parent for his own pleaſure afflicting the Child, but allows the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend ſubjection of the Child under ſuch unreaſonable and unjuſt deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Servants, be ſubject to your Maſters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but alſo to the froward. For this is thank-worthy, if a man for conſcience toward God endure grief, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering wrongfully,</hi> &amp;c. v. 20. <hi>If when ye do well and ſuffer for it,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99891:25"/>
ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God: For even hereunto were ye called.</hi> No Maſter had a moral power or warrand from God to afflict his ſervant wrongfully, (that was not acceptable to God, but diſpleaſing to him) yet, that Servants ſhould endure a ſuffering lot in, and for, following their duty to God, with ſubjection to their Maſters afflicting them, and that from a principle of conſcience toward God, was a thing acceptable to God. And hereunto were Servants then called; it is not only ſubjection to patient ſuffering for their faults they were called to, nor only ſubjection to endure ſuffering in well-doing, meerly out of prudence, or becauſe they could not help it, not being in probable capacity to violent their Maſters though they would; but a ſubjection to endure wrongful ſufferings from their hands, from a principle of conſcience toward God moving them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard their authority, albeit abuſed by putting them to grievous trouble wrongfully.</p>
               <p>And though, perhaps, they will ſay, there is great difference between reſpects due by Children to their Parents, and Servants to their Lords and Maſters, and that which is due by Subjects to Kings, (the King neither having properly paternal, nor yet deſpotick nor lordly power over his Subjects.) And they will ſay alſo, there is great difference between the evils ſpoken of in theſe Texts, to be endured by Children or Servants, corrections, bufferings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that irreparable loſs of life, wherein (ſhould it come to that) ſubjection without reſiſtance is preſſed to the wrongful Sentences and Proceedings of the Magiſtrate or Prince. Though, I ſay, they will, and do aſſert this, to ſhow the diſparity of the caſes; yet, 1. There is a full parity and agreement of theſe relative Powers, Paternal, Maſterly and Magiſtratical or Royal, in this, that in the inflicting of evils upon thoſe who are under them, (ſuch as are competent to them to inflict within their ſphere) a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, reverend ſubjection is due from their inferiours, (without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent inſurrection againſt them) even when they abuſe their power in ſome particulars, not in way of juſtification or reſpect to the abuſe, but in a humble conſcientious regard of their being inveſted with that power they do abuſe. 2. Kings are not Fathers of our fleſh, or by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, nor can they be truly called ſo, (political and parental power are different things, although they may be co-incident in one and the ſame ſubject, as moſt probably they were in the firſt political Governments that were in the world) Yet, as Kings and Magiſtrates ſhould have fatherly hearts to their Subjects, (they being a ſort of official Fathers to them to procure their good, and to defend them from evil, every
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99891:26"/>
King ſhould be <hi>Abimelech, i. e.</hi> my Father King) So Subjects ought to have ſuch hearts to their King, as Children have to their Father, giving them ſpecial reverence, ſubjection and obedience from their very ſoul and inward affections; and although ſometimes they are not ſuch as they ſhould be, yet they ought to account their perſons (ſealed with Gods Ordinance and the Image of his Soveraignty) ſacred and invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable, reſolving to ſuffer any thing of them, rather then to be guilty of parricide, (although under the colour of ſelf-defence.) Gods Law, in the fifth Command, hath injoyned reverence and ſubjection to Princes, under the title of Parents; <hi>Calvin, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>inſt. cap.</hi> 8. ſhews, the end of that Command is (under the name and title of Parents, Father and Mother) to ſhew us, that all the degrees of eminency God hath ordered to be over us, ſhould be inviolable; <hi>Oportere nobis eſſe inviolabiles, quia omnium eſt eadem ratio.</hi> God (ſaith he) under the name of the moſt amiable relations of Father and Mother, leads us to ſubjection to all Superiors: <hi>Hoc</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>de ſubjectione prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptum cum humani ingenii pravitate valde pugnat (quod ut eſt cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitudinis appetentia turgidum aegre ſe ſubjici ſuſtinet.)</hi> Therefore (he adds) to commend this ſubjection, he hath communicate his own name to them who are in eminency, <hi>In unum ipſum</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ita conveniunt, patris Dei ac Domini tituli, ut quoties unum aliquem ex iſtis audimus, Majeſtatis illius ſenſu animum noſtrum feriri opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teat, quos ergo iſtorum facit participes,</hi> &amp;c.

It ſhall not be aſſerted, that there is no difference, between a Royal or
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99891:26"/>
Magiſtratical power, and that which is called dominative and maſterly; ſeing, (beſides other differences) they do mainly differ in this, that the Maſter or Lord of Slaves, hath his own profit mainly before his eyes, (which he may under Gods glory lawfully have) but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of his Slaves onely ſecondarily; and alſo in order to his own good, which is maintained, by their well doing. But a King or Magiſtrate, ſhould think, that his power is primarily ordinated to the publick good of the community it ſelf, and only ſecondarily and conſequently to the good of himſelf; it being profitable for him, that the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth ſhould flouriſh. 2. In this, that a dominative and maſterly power (ſuch as was of old in uſe, and under which, people were made Slaves, either having their lives ſpared in a juſt War, and quitting their liberty to ſpare their lives; <hi>(ſerva &amp; ſerviam)</hi> or being ſold and bought, by the poſſeſſors money, (which was no way, like the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our hired ſervants, free to go off when they will) did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt theſe, who were inveſted with it, with a greater power over the bodies and goods of theſe, who were either ſold Slaves, or ſaved in War, (and parting with their liberty, for ſaving their lives) then a Magiſtratical or Kingly power, ought to claim over ſubjects, not of ſuch a condition, (albeit cruelty ſhould be, according to Divine Law, avoided by any inveſted with any of theſe powers.) 3. In that the perſon that hath domination or Maſterly-power, (as was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily of old (albeit we have ſcarce a ſhaddow of that power, which Maſters then had over Slaves abſolutely, ſurrendring their liberty to them) hath the Slaves in ſubjection to him, more out of fear and conſtraint, then love or delight; but a King or Magiſtrate hath his inferiours under him, in a civil, free, liberal, voluntary and loving ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; knowing, that in the Government, their good is aimed at by the Ruler, more then his own; and his ſubjects will not, (or ought not) for his good and honour, which is inſeparably connexed with their own good, ſpare to expend Life and Fortunes, or what they are or have, as publick neceſſity requires. Yet, though there be theſe differences, betwixt the Dominative or Maſterly, and the Royal or Magiſtratical Power, the inferiors ſubjection in ſuffering, (even wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, if God permit in his Providence the power to be ſo abuſed) is no leſſe under the one Power, then under the other, by vertue of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law. Subjects are Sons to the Soveraign, (their Father, and Nurſe-father to the Church of God) but they are alſo Sons, that do under God ſerve him, (though they be not Slaves) It is ordinary in Scripture, not only to find conquered People called Servants to the

Conqueror, as, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.14. they of <hi>Edom,</hi> became <hi>Davids</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, but alſo, ordinary Subjects to Kings were called Servants to them (not only their menial Servants, nor only their Guard, nor their Officers onely; but generally their Subjects were called Servants, and the King their Lord, as <hi>Davids</hi> Subjects, warring againſt the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.24. are called his Servants, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.4. <hi>We will ſerve thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>Iſrael</hi> to <hi>Rehoboam, i. e.</hi> we will be Subjects to thee; Subjects, for the publick good, the Honour of the Prince, (whom they term, their Soveraign Lord) and for every ones private good, are Servants to the Prince in a free, voluntary, ingenuous, loving way; they are his Servants, as willingly and chearfully ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to him, as their Soveraign, although he alſo be in a ſenſe, their Servant, (not in relation of an inferiour to his ſuperiour, for ſo the Magiſtrate is only the Miniſter of God for the Peoples good, and never called their Miniſter) but in relation of the meanes to the end, he is their Servant, as Angels are miniſtering Spirits, for the heirs of Salvation: And Miniſters of Chriſt, are Miniſters and Servants to the People, though in regard of their official power, they are not ſubject to the People; but rules over them, according to Chriſts Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee ſubjection, without violent reſiſtance, in caſe of wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſuffering, is the duty of all inferiours toward their ſeveral correla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; Neither hath it any weight to make diſparity of the caſes, the ſufferings to which Children or Servants are to ſubmit without violent reſiſtance, as but corrections or buffetings, not tending to death or mutilation; but the ſubjection required to the Magiſtrate who bears the Sword, (when he abuſeth the ſame) imports ſuffering death, (if he proceed ſo far) which is the greateſt evil of puniſhment, and which is not eligible where lawful ſelf defence is at hand.

violently to re-offend the Powers above them; why not in leſſe evils too, theſe gradual differences of inflicted evils cannot make ſuch variation in the point of duty, ſeing the ground holds equally ſtrong; if a man may reſiſt the Magiſtrate for abuſe of his Power, he may do ſo alſo againſt his Father or Maſter on the ſame ground, and if he may not ſo deal with them, he may not deal ſo with the Magiſtrate nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Again, our Lord and Saviour did foreſee and foretell his Diſciples, that they were to meet with perſecution from the Powers of the world for truth and righteouſneſſe ſake. And, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.10. pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth them bleſſed, who are perſecuted for righteouſneſſe ſake, and who are perſecuted and reviled falſly for his ſake, aſſerting, that their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is great in Heaven, So, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. <hi>If ye ſuffer for righteouſneſs ſake, happy are ye,</hi> &amp;c. v. 17. <hi>It is better ye ſuffer for well doing, then for evil doing,</hi> &amp;c. In ſuch Texts, there is a commended ſuffering for Chriſt and righteouſneſs ſake, having the encouragement of a promiſe of reward (conſequently it muſt be a ſort of commanded ſuffering, ſeing God commends, and rewards nothing but what he commands) it is a ſuffering contradiſtinct from ſuffering for evil doing: ſubmiſſion to ſuffering for evil doing, is out of all queſtion a duty, becauſe in that caſe, the reſiſtance is a ſinful reſiſting of the Ordinance of God, and of theſe who are inveſted with that Ordinance of Magiſtracy while they lawfully uſe it. But there is a further matter commended or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned in theſe Scriptures, even a cleanly ſubmiſſion to ſuffering in, and for well doing, (when God in his Providence permits Rulers ſo to abuſe their power) which paſſive ſubjection or ſubmiſſion, is not grounded on the Rulers abuſe of his Power through his corrupt will, but upon the peculiar command of God enjoyning ſubmiſſion in ſuch caſes, to prevent ſedition and confuſion.</p>
               <p>The Author of <hi>Lex Rex, quaeſt.</hi> 30. jeers at paſſive obedience, as a chimaera, as a dream, and as involving a contradiction: And he thinks he ſpeaks acutely in ſaying, God never gave to any a command to ſuffer for well-doing, nor at all to ſuffer, (ſuffering depending on the free-will of another without us, and not on our own free-will, and ſo not falling under any command of God to us) but he reaſons very ſophiſtically, inferring, that becauſe meer ſuffering, which neceſſarily depends on the action of another, is not commended to us, therefore ſubjection to ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or paſſive obedience is not commanded when the Magiſtrate inflicts ſuffering. It is impoſſible indeed, that meer paſſion (as to be whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, to be hanged or headed) ſhould be the object of an affirmative or
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99891:28"/>
preceptive command of God (though the Magiſtrate may have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to inflict theſe) but ſubjection to the paſſion, may fall under a command, and this is called paſſive obedience, which implyes more then meer paſſion or ſuffering; even a diſpoſition and motion of the heart to lye under that lot with an eye to God, whoſe ordinance is uſed upon the ſufferer. Only it is called paſſive obedience, becauſe as to the preciſe ſuffering the puniſhment, there is no external action done, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by the Law or Command of the Magiſtrate (as there is in active obedience) although there be ſome diſpoſitive or preparatory actions in order to ſuffering (not inferring a direct co-operation to a mans own ſuffering) which he may and ought to do, as going to a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows on his own feet, or up a Ladder, or laying down his head on a Block that it may be ſtrucken off. It is an error to ſay, that ſuch paſſive obedience is not commanded of God, but only the <hi>modus rei,</hi> that it be done patiently and chriſtianly, when it cannot be by force avoided. For it is clear, that paſſive obedience, or ſubmiſſion and ſubjection to ſuffering (where the Magiſtrate hath juſt cauſe to inflict the puniſhment) falls under a command of God (that ſame command that forbids reſiſting the Magiſtrate in doing his duty, enjoyns ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and paſſive obedience to him, although we were able by force to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver our ſelves out of his hand.) In conſcience we are bound not to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him violence in doing his duty, though there were power in our hand ſo to do, ſo that it is not only <hi>modus rei</hi> that in this caſe is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, (<hi>viz.</hi> that we ſuffer patiently in a chriſtian way, when it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be avoided) but <hi>res ipſa,</hi> that we ſubmit to the ſuffering, if there be no occaſion of flying, without uſing force againſt him. Beſides, that in this caſe, Chriſtian patience and violent reſiſtance are incompatible, there can be no Chriſtian patience oppoſite to Chriſtian ſubmiſſion and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Powers ordained by God doing their duty. But, if it might ſtand with violent reſiſtance, it ſhould be oppoſite to this Chriſtian ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. Therefore, it appears to be a groundleſſe aſſertion, that no paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive obedience or ſubmiſſion to ſuffering is under a command. For, it is clear there is a command for this ſubjection we have ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>But then the difficulty is, if paſſive obedience to unjuſtly puniſhing Powers fall under any commandment of God, or if there be any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of ſubmiſſion to cleanly ſuffering; it is this mans mind, ſo long as there is any power of violent and forcible reſiſting, a man is guilty of ſelf-murther, who will not (in this caſe as well as in the former, and the former as well as this) endeavour the preſervation of his own life, by fighting and reſiſting, and re-offending, and all that is required is,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99891:28"/>
(when he is overpowered) then to uſe Chriſtian patience in bearing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. But we aſſert, that a private perſon, though wrongfully af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by the lawful Magiſtrate, proceeding according to Law (let it be ſo that it is <hi>Lex male poſita,</hi> or an evil Law) is bound not only to Chriſtian patience in ſuffering (to this he is obliged in ſuffering from any private wicked hand, or from the hand of a manifeſt Uſurper or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truder in Magiſtracy, whoſe violence he may repell by violence, ſo long as he can) but unto a ſubmiſſion without repelling of violence by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and that in conſcientious reſpect to the Ordinance of God, wherewith the lawful Magiſtrate is inveſted (although abuſing it in this particular) and with a tender regard to the prevention of ſeditions and confuſions in humane Societies, which are unavoidable; if every one, as he thinks himſelf wrong'd, ſhall be allowed to uſe force upon the lawful Magiſtrat's proceeding by Law, the greateſt Malefactors being ready to juſtifie themſelves, and to violate the juſteſt Magiſtrates in their juſt proceedings; if once this repelling the Magiſtrat's force be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed as a duty. And, no tender-hearted Chriſtian is there, who will not rather ſubmit without reſiſtance to his own private ſuffering, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending his ſoul and cauſe to God, then by ſuch evil and ſcandalous doctrines, open a wide gap for all wicked ſeditious perſons to work con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion in the Common-wealth, and to overthrow the beſt and juſteſt Magiſtrates. Mr. <hi>Burroughs,</hi> an Independent, writing on the 1. of <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> hath ſaid well to this purpoſe: <hi>When</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>things are brought into a Law, ſuppoſe the Authority be abuſed, and there be an evil Law made; then I confeſs, if the Law be in force, we muſt either quite our ſelves of the Countrey, or elſe ſubmit and ſuffer; when it comes to be a Power or a Law, it is Authority, though abuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and we muſt yeeld obedience to it, either actively or paſſively.</hi> This is ſound and Orthodox; and it were well, others would homologate this Doctrine, to prevent the ſcandals of ſedition and rebellion, which this tender-hearted Libeller ſpeaks of very ſlightingly, ſtriving to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce Libertiniſme, and to aboliſh the ſenſe of theſe ſins: <hi>For</hi> (ſayes he) Napth.

So that of neceſſity, by Power is meant Power in the Concrete, or the perſon inveſted with the Power, who is not to be violently reſiſted, by private perſons under him, (when he is acting according to Law, ſuppoſe the Law be judged by private men, not juſt) which is the preſent caſe of private perſons reſiſtance to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. The perſon of the King, becauſe inveſted with power, official power, (though in a particular act abuſed) is not to be violated, nor violence offered to it by private men; a ſubjection, excluding violent reſiſtance is commanded, and no ſuch exception is put in, that if he abuſe his power, or if we be ſtrong enough for him, we are looſed from that ſubjection, and are at liberty for reſiſting him, and no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is required under his abuſe of his power, ſo long, as we can violently act againſt him. It is ſaid, by thoſe of the other judgement, that even by this ſame text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. ſubjection, or ſubmiſſion to unjuſt ſuffering by theſe inveſted with power, is not commanded, nor reſiſtance in that caſe forbidden; for, all the ſubjection commanded to be given to perſons in power, is onely, ſo far as they manage their power lawfully, according to Gods Ordinance, and as the Miniſters of God, for our good, who are for the praiſe of well-doers, and the terror of evil-doers: And all the reſiſtance forbidden, is onely, that they be not reſiſted while they do their duties; but, when they do not their duties, or do contrary to duty, in afflicting the innocent; they are not powers ordained of God, <hi>pro tanto,</hi> nor his Miniſters for good to people; nor, is reſiſtance to them in ſuch acts unlawful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to the ordinance of God, nor to them as the Miniſters God; but, onely reſiſtance to them is ſinful men, ſerving their own luſts and

Sathan; their evil-doing, is no ordinance of God, but of Sathan. So that in effect, they think ſubjection here commanded and reſiſtance for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, doth only relate to Magiſtrates, <hi>quatenus &amp; quamdiu bene ſe geſſerint,</hi> when and ſo far as they carry themſelves rightly in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but that from this Text no ſubmiſſion is due to them, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to them is forbidden in their inflicting unjuſt puniſhments; but that for any thing ſaid here, Subjects may make inſurrections againſt them whenever they think they do wrong, even any part of private Subjects againſt all Magiſtrates of all degrees, the Supreme as well as the Subordinate: So <hi>Naphtali</hi> teacheth, and borrows this out of his poiſoned Fountain, <hi>Lex Rex.</hi>

The formal reaſon of the ſubjection and non-reſiſtance preſſed, is not the right uſe of the power, but becauſe it is a power ordained of God (however perverted in the uſe by man.) And although the ſpirit of God, in deſcribing the Magiſtrate, ſaith, <hi>He is the miniſter of God for thy good, A praiſer of the good, and a terror to the evil</hi>; it is not meant, that that is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal reaſon of ſubjection to him (in the full latitude of ſubjection) nor that the Magiſtrates then exiſting and in beeing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to whom the people are commanded to be ſubject, and forbidden to reſiſt them, were ſuch <hi>de facto</hi> in all their actings (or that all others, in reference to whom the direction may be after extended, ſhould in time coming be ſuch in all their actings) but only it is told, what the Magiſtrate is <hi>ex officio,</hi>

So here, the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the power, or perſon inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with power, calling him <hi>the miniſter of God for thy good; no terror to good works, but evil; A praiſer of the good,</hi> &amp;c. ſhews only what a Magiſtrate ſhould be <hi>ex officio,</hi> and what he is <hi>de jure</hi>; but layes not this as the ground of ſubjection and non-reſiſtance to him, but this, that he is a Superior Power ordained of God: If he abuſe his place, he is to anſwer to God for it; but the abuſe of the power in a particular, doth not nullifie the power, or make it no power; if he do evil, he doth it not as inveſted with authority from God, yet he abides inveſted with authority: it cannot be ſaid he hath no authority, when he abuſes authority; ſubjection of one ſort or another is due to him, becauſe he is <hi>in officio,</hi> not becauſe he abuſeth his Office. To this purpoſe, amongſt many things wrong, <hi>Lex Rex</hi> hath that true word, Page 325. <hi>We are</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to ſuffer evil of puniſhment of Tyrants, ſome other way and in ſome other notion, then we are to ſuffer evil of equals: for, we are to ſuffer evil of equals, not for any paternal authority they have over us, as certainly we are to ſuffer evil of Superiors:</hi> Thus he. And this is all we require, to ſuffer evil of the Magiſtrate or Superior, without violating his perſon upon the account of his paternal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which (though in a particular abuſed <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi>) remains the Ordinance of God: And in a reſpective reverence to that Ordinance wherewith they are inveſted, we are humbly to ſuffer wrong from them (if we cannot by petitions move their forbearance) neither ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying in our conſciences the wrong which they do to us, nor judging them to have a commiſſion from God, as to this wrong doing, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding both Gods Providence and Gods Ordinance in their perſons, which ceaſeth not to be his, although abuſed in a particular act to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward us.</p>

The ancient Chriſtians, who lived neareſt the light of the Apoſtolick times, and had hearts fuller of zeal
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99891:30"/>
(through the recent warmth of the ſhed blood of Chriſt, and of his glorious extraordinary Ambaſſadors) then we in this frozen age have, knew not, owned not, any ſuch Doctrines of violent reſiſtance to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, as the new ſort of Chriſtians have made a main Article of their Faith. In <hi>Tertullians</hi> time, they wanted not abundant power and might to raiſe armes, and manage war againſt their perſecuting enemies, as he very plainly ſhews, <hi>Apolog. cap.</hi> 37. and, <hi>ch.</hi> 1. <hi>ch.</hi> 33. They were certainly in a probable capacity to have combined in armes againſt their perſecuting Emperors; and to have carried their will by force, and taken order with theſe who were over them and did oppreſs them, (as this Libeller allows all perſons of the moſt private place, if they be ſtrong enough to deal with the powers above them) yet they would never entertain a thought of any ſuch matter, let be to attempt it; they were never (although defamed as enemies to <hi>Severus,</hi> Emperor at that time) found amongſt the ſeditious, <hi>Nunquam tamen Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niani, vel Nigriani, vel Caſſiani</hi>; never were they followers of ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Leaders, <hi>Apol. c.</hi> 33. Although they had filled all their Cities, their Camps, their Courts, and the Empire every where full of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; yet, they made conſcience of making inſurrection, they knew not ſuch a thing that the Word of God, and laws of Humanity and Chriſtian Charity, oblieged them (as now it is pleaded) to take arms againſt their Emperors, and to combine againſt them for mutual defence againſt their perſecutions, and for violent taking order with them. Were the antient Chriſtians ſo utterly ignorant, or ſo void of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and of Chriſtian love and zeal, that having more then probable capacity, they would ſuffer their Brethren be put to ſuffer, and not offer violence to the Magiſtrate in ſuch courſes, and reſcue the oppreſſed out of their hands? (either they were not knowing and loving Chriſtians, or elſe we have catched an error in our heads that is not Chriſtian, and a fire in our hearts that is not from above.) If we look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to <hi>Cyprians</hi> time (long after <hi>Tertullian,</hi> though in that ſame age) he is free to tell us, in <hi>Epiſtola ad Demetrianum,</hi> when Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were grown very numerous, beyond what <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaw them to have been; <hi>Nemo noſtrum,</hi> &amp;c. not one of us offers to reſiſt your violence (ſpeaking of, and to, Pagans) or to revenge it, <hi>Etiam ſi ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius &amp; copioſus ſit populus noſter.</hi>

               <p>Yea, after that the great <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had owned Chriſtian Religion, and by his Authority (ſo far as it could reach) legally eſtabliſh'd it; ſo that now Religion became to be a legal right by Caeſarean Edicts and Laws, and multitudes embracing it, (as uſeth to be when examples

Yet, when the Arian Emperors <hi>Conſtantius, Valent. &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate perſecuted them for Religion, they never attempted ſuch a thing, as to make head againſt them, and to combine for a reſiſtance, albeit they wanted neither the legal right of humane Imperial Law for it, nor phyſical Power ſufficient againſt the Apoſtate and Arian Emperors, <hi>nec d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet, rather then they would offer violence to the wicked Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror or his Officers, they did lay aſide their weapons, and ſuffer'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for Chriſts ſake, to be ſlain by the executors of the Commands of that cruel Tyrant. And it is known by the Hiſtory, that the plurality of the Army under <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate were Chriſtians, (as appeared by their joynt Proclamation and Declaration, at the entry of <hi>Jovinian</hi> his Succeſſor (<hi>Nos Chriſtiani ſumus</hi>) yet never did they make head againſt the Apoſtate, nor violent him in his courſes againſt Religion, and their Brethren the Profeſſors thereof. Oh ſilly, fooliſh and femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine Chriſtians then! who neither knew to uſe the priviledge of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defence againſt Magiſtrates for themſelves, nor how to combine for the aid of others, and were ſo deſtitute of reaſon for themſelves, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and religious charity toward others; that neither the Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme, Apoſtaſie, Arianiſme of the Emperors, nor Perſecution of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren by them, could move them to ſuch ways of violent and bloody reſiſtance of Powers (though they did indeed reſiſt to blood, ſtriving againſt ſin, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.4.) But, O! how illuminated maſculous and martial are the ſpirits of Chriſtians now a dayes, and how full of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity one to another, as well as of zeal to God, that any number of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons are allowed (if they can carry on the buſineſs without a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99891:31"/>
ſeen miſchief to themſelves) to take the Sword againſt all Magiſtrates whom they account oppreſſors of them (though falſly) to combine in bands againſt them, to pull them out of their ſeats, to revenge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them the injuries done to themſelves or their Brethren, and to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them condignly; yea, it is counted high impiety againſt God, and want of Chriſtian charity, to omit this. This is the clear doctrine of this Libeller and his Complices (as hath in part, and will further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.) And what ſhall we ſay to it? (I will ſay, <hi>anima mea ſit cum animabus veterum Chriſtianorum</hi>) ſhall we think, that they were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſo ignorant, ſenſeleſs and ſtupid, that they knew not what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to their duty toward God, themſelves or their Brethren? Wanted they the light to know their duty, the zeal to Gods glory, the Chriſtian love to brethren, which we have ſo abundantly, that moves us to reſiſting of Powers, and did not them? <hi>Credat Judaeus Apella, non ego.</hi> But the truth is this, as in the fear of God they refuſed to give active obedience to any evil command of Powers above them, ſo when they could neither mitigate the fury of perſecuting powers by Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor in Gods Providence find a way of eſcaping out of their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and flying (which is no reſiſtance, albeit the pair of Pſeudomar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs have brought forth this Monſter of a ſtoical Paradox, that flying from the Magiſtrate, is reſiſtance to him, whereas it is only a with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from under his Dominion, and putting ones ſelf under an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Dominion, where his Power reaches not: and ſo by flight and withdrawing from the Kingdoms, the man ceaſeth to be a Subject to him, whoſe Subject he was, and comes to be under other Lords and Laws.) But, I ſay, when Chriſtians could neither by Petitions nor Apologies allay the fury of Perſecutors, nor eſcape from them, in the fear of God commanding ſubmiſſion to his Ordinance (although in the uſe perverted as to them) they (having light enough to know their duty, great zeal for Chriſt, great love to their brethren, ſufficient power to have overpowered their enemies) did notwithſtanding, without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent reſiſtance or combinations to that end againſt Powers, meekly lay down their lives for Chriſt; and chooſed rather to ſuffer then reſiſt. Herein their practice is a better Commentary of <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. and, 1 of <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. then all ſeditious gloſſes: And, is preferable for imitation to all the contrary actings of men, in theſe dregs of time.</p>
               <p>Some go about to queſtion the truth of <hi>Tertullians</hi> narration, concerning the number and power of Chriſtians in his time; aſſerting, that onely their weakneſs excuſed them from the ſin of non-reſiſtance to their Magiſtrates. But, it is ſtrange to think, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> in an
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99891:32"/>
Apology made to the Gentiles for Chriſtians, ſhould aſſert ſo groſs an untruth in matter of fact, concerning theſe of his Religion, whereof his enemies (if they could) would no doubt take advantage. And as ſtrange it is, that any now living, ſhould after thirteen or fourteen hundred years, take on them to know the number and power of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in <hi>Tertullians</hi> time, better then he did; alſo to ſay, that in <hi>Julians</hi> Army, the Chriſtians were not the prevailing and greater part, is contrary to the truth of the ſtory, as appears by their cry, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of <hi>Jovinian</hi> (whereof before) yet it is well ſaid (<hi>Lex Rex.</hi> pag. 372.) that they had ſcruples of Conſcience, and doubts of the lawfulneſs of reſiſting the Emperour, being ſworn to him, which may make it the more ſtrange, that there is ſo little doubting now, when our engagement to Magiſtrates over us, is no leſs. True it is, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi> did make War upon <hi>Licinius,</hi> whom he had aſſumed to be an aſſiſtant in governing the Empire, for his breach of Faith and of Truſt given him in that ſociety of the Empire, and for firſt denouncing War againſt him; (the help of the diſtreſſed Chriſtians, cruelly perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by him, concurring alſo as a motive) <hi>Euſeb. lib.</hi> 9. <hi>Hiſt.

                  </gap>dent in the ſtory, that remaining in the Countrey of that King, they made no inſurrection againſt him, albeit the perſecution was very cruel; they did flee and with-draw from that Kingdom, to the bounds of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: And the <hi>Romans</hi> refuſing, upon demand of that King, to ſend back theſe who had run away, was one ground of the war, that aroſe between them and the <hi>Perſian</hi>: Again, it is onely ſaid, the Chriſtians fleeing to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> ſought their help; which will not neceſſarily import, that they ſtirred them up, to invade their King in their behalf; but, that having come to them, they might have the help and benefit of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and not be delivered up to the fury of the Tyrant, upon his demand. And further, the Perſian Kings had once ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Roman Emperors, as their Lords; two or three of their Kings being given them, at the appointment of the Senate and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Rome: Auguſtus,</hi> getting both King and Kingdom, ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99891:32"/>
to him in his time; and although after that time, there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny changes and revolutions in that Kingdom, the Romans did never quit their claim thereto, but keeped cloſe to their right, and to the poſſeſſion they had of moſt of it, till <hi>Conſtantin's</hi> time, and even long alſo after the time of <hi>Theodoſius.</hi> Now, if the Chriſtians preſuming upon the Roman right to that Kingdom, as being held of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, implored this help againſt a perſecutor, whom they thought he had legal power to chaſtiſe, what makes this for private ſubjects (without concurrence of any Magiſtrate) riſing in violence againſt their own Soveraigns, who have none ſuperior to them but God?</p>
               <p>But, not to inſiſt too much on this, we onely add, that excellent <hi>Calvin, in the laſt chap. of the</hi> 4. <hi>book of his Inſtitutions,</hi> hath (like a primitive Chriſtian and Divine) written ſo fully and learnedly againſt private perſons reſiſting the Magiſtrates by violence, (though they abuſe their power) that whoever will read the ſame, (as it is moſt worthy to be read throughout) will find a ſtrong confutation of all ſeditious Doctrines, ſtirring up private perſons to do violence to the Magiſtrate in any caſe; and his ſpirit, will be ſeen to be another, then theirs is, who teach ſuch things.</p>
               <p>We come now to conſider, how far contrary to the light of ſound reaſon this poſition, giving liberty to any private perſons, (when they are able, and when they think themſelves wronged) to uſe violence upon all Magiſtrates, is: Surely, that doctrine cannot be of God, which to the eye of ſound reaſon doth remedileſly and unavoidably, (if it be admitted and reduced into practice) overthrow Gods Order, for ſettling Humane Societies, and which opens a wide gap to perpetual ſeditions, againſt all Magiſtrates; not leaving any (even the beſt of them and moſt juſtly governing) in any ſecurity from violence. For, in the way of this Libeller, every private perſon, is not only made judge of his own actings, and what he is to do, or not to do, in obedience to the Magiſtrate; but, he is made judge of his own ſufferings, he muſt ſuffer no more from the Magiſtrate, then he thinks meet, (if he can help himſelf by force.) And it is held forth as a ſin (equal at leaſt to the obeying unlawful commands) to ſuffer unjuſt puniſhments, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by Powers, if men be in capacity to do violence to the Powers, or if they can conſpire and combine with others for this end. This is a Doctrine, that will pleaſe all wicked malefactors, wonderous well; and, is a fair proclamation to them, whenever they are attached, or arraigned, or condemned, or puniſhed, to beſtir themſelves to make a party, to do violence to the Magiſtrate; for, they will never want the colour of this
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99891:33"/>
plea of ſelf-defence: And, how few of them will not (if they may be their own judges) ſay they are innocent and deſerve no puniſhment, or not ſo great? The judge ſaith, he is guilty, and that he muſt be ſo and ſo puniſhed; make the man his own judge, he will ſay, the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is unjuſt, he is not bound to ſubmit to it: And therefore, if he be in probale capacity, he will think it his duty to fall upon the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, pull the Sword out of his hand, call in to his aſſiſtance whom he may, raiſe violent ſeditions againſt the Magiſtrate; and, what may he not do for his own deliverance? Thus, under this colour, all evil-doers are encouraged, to uſe violence againſt the Magiſtrate; and, let this Libeller conſider, how he will ſtop the gap which he hath opened to confuſion; the matter (according to his mind) being referred to each particular perſon, to judge of the juſtice of his own ſuffering; and his diſcretive judgement anent this, muſt determine him to reſiſt, (as he is able) when he thinks himſelf wronged; ſhall not this be a ſource of continual ſeditions, and violent inſurrections againſt the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, even when he proceeds moſt juſtly?</p>
               <p>Again, how can Magiſtrates, in doing their duty, be ſecured from violence (according to this mans way) or from continual inſurrections of perſons pretending their innocency? It is in vain to ſay, Let Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates rule rightly and not oppreſs, and then Subjects will do their duty: for, albeit be true, faithful and juſt Magiſtrates may in the way of their duty expect from God, that he will incline the hearts of their Subjects to repay duty to them; yet, in the holy permiſſive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, it comes often to paſs, that the beſt Princes are not beſt uſed by their Subjects, (God thus teaching good Princes to rule in his fear and righteouſneſs, with an eye to his will, and with reſpect to that crown of Life, whatever hard meaſure they have from ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious people.) How often is it found, that Subjects are unruly and ſeditious even againſt good Magiſtrates? Some croſſing of the will of a froward and furious party, may move them to fancy their Prince a Tyrant, and as one that is an injurious and intolerable Oppreſſour: whereupon they account themſelves free to offer violence to him, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cloak of ſelf-defence) and goes on from reſiſtance to revenge, if they can have the upper-hand over him, and will not ceaſe (the fury of evil conſciences inſtigating them) till they ruine the Prince whom they have greatly provoked, in order to ſelf-preſervation from what they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hiſtories be looked into, it will be found, that hardly did ever people reſiſt a Prince with violence, but in end the matter came to revenge, (if they had power) neither could they reſt but in his ruine. And alſo it will be found, that oft-times the beſt Princes have been worſt uſed, or at leaſt as evil as the naughtieſt Princes. Look to the Roman Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors while they were Pagans, how many amongſt them who were good, (as Heathens might be) came under the ſame, or worſe fate, by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt violence of their Subjects, with theſe who were the worſt Princes? Look to Chriſtian Emperors and Kings, how many of them who were truly good, were oppreſſed and deſtroyed by their Subjects; ſometimes inflammed with ſuperſtition (which they called Religion) and ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reſpect to the Roman See, (the Sentences whereof were accounted as Oracles in theſe dark times) and ſometimes wrought upon by ſeditious Ring-leaders, buzzing into their ears great abuſes done to them in the matter of their Liberties? Yea, amongſt our own Kings, ſome of the beſt have been as evil uſed by prevailing parties amongſt the people, as ſome of the worſt. When once that gap is opened, and people taught, that any party of them (ſtrong enough) may get up againſt the King and all Magiſtrates, when they judge them to deal wrongouſly and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly with them, the reverence of Soveraignty is loſt, the evil wit of a ſeditious Party can ſoon paint the beſt King, as a black and ugly Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and under that form, waken up others to conſpire to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; which ſhould make all the fearers of God, rather to endure ſome acts of real Tyranny, then by their Doctrines or Practices of reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, open a door to the deſtruction of good Kings, (by a party not of their ſpirit, but lurking under their pretences) and to the continual diſſolution, concuſſion and deſolation of humane Societies. It is good for us to hold cloſe to that neceſſary diſtinction which all ſound Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines have held, of obedience or ſubjection active and ſubjection paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, where the former cannot be given for fear of ſinning againſt God, (the Magiſtrat's ſuperior, and who ſhould be obeyed rather than any man in the world) the latter, (if we ſtay within his Dominions, and with-draw not from under his Soveraignty, putting our ſelves under the protection of another ſoveraign Power) is neceſſary. And ſo the Apology, p. 376, 377. acknowledged this to be neceſſary when active obedience could not be given: but <hi>Naphtali,</hi> Pag. 28. repents of this moderation, and contradicts the Apology, calling this ſubmiſſion brutal (though it be upon rational grounds, and the fierce violence againſt Magiſtrates is rather brutal) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Good God! To what times are we reſerved, to ſee ſo certain truths, that may be reckoned among the immovables of Religion, and the ancient land-marks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by an up-ſtart furious Crue, who by their new Principles (as falſe as new) ſeek to confound both Church and State? The lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of private mens counter-acting, and violent reſiſtance to a whole Church and a whole State, is a main Article of their new Faith; and to do ſo, is one of their new Commandments, added to God's.</p>
               <p>But the Libeller is all alongs much in preſſing violent reſiſtance to all powers, from the higheſt to the loweſt, and of the whole body of the people by any party thereof (though the far minor and leſſer part) in the cauſe of Religion, (his Religion, in the hypotheſis debated in the times, is the external form of Church-government, about which, he ſayes, <hi>all the zeal of the godly ſhould be concentred,</hi> a low zeal, God knoweth, that hath no higher objects.) And laying down grounds (ſome true, ſome falſe) concerning Religion, he labours to animate any party that think themſelves able to violent all Magiſtrates, and the body of the people about this, and to ſtrengthen themſelves by combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, threatning Gods judgements againſt them who do not combine for violent reſiſtance of all above them, (which he calls <hi>Self-defence</hi>) and abuſing ſome Scriptures to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>As for Religion, that it is the chief intereſt that Men and Chriſtians ſhould look after, ſhall not be doubted; and where it becomes a legal right, and the Magiſtrate who bears the Sword leads the way, no doubt private perſons may follow in the violent defence of it, againſt all oppoſing the Magiſtrate, the Law and themſelves in owning it. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it enter into a Chriſtian heart, that it is to be ſurrendred unto the arbitrement or pleaſure of any power in the world, nor of any Magiſtrate over us, as this man wickedly ſuggeſts is done. All the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is (in relation to theſe Times) anent private mens falling upon the Magiſtrates over them by violence and force of armes, when they are (by Laws agreed to by the Commu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

not fear to be defiled with hereſie or idolatry, or falſe worſhip, or any thing contrary to Chriſts Ordinance; whatever may be ſaid concerning private mens reſiſting the powers that urge them to ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry or falſe worſhip, or invading their lives if they will not ſo do, comes not home to the preſent caſe. Yet, <hi>Lactantius</hi> word, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. is to be well remembred by all private perſons; <hi>Defendenda eſt Religio à privatis omnibus non occidendo ſed moriendo,</hi> &amp;c. But, we ſhall come off from this matter with a few notes; 1. That the Libeller ſeems to diſallow all violenting of men in the matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; <hi>To be violented in Religion, is the moſt wicked and inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable of all injuries,</hi> (ſaith he) Page 15. It is true, to uſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence upon any in their perſons or goods, to bring them to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal falſe Religion or Worſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>p, or to drive them from the true, (otherwiſe Religion cannot be violented) is the greateſt of injuries.</p>
               <p>But, ſhould not ſuch a word be guarded well, leaſt all co-active power of the Magiſtrate in matters of Religion, might ſeem to be diſowned, and a fair plea put in their mouths, who are for abſolute toleration? It will not ſuffice to ſay, that it is only violences done to perſons, to avert them from true Religion, and bring them to a falſe, that are counted injurious and condemned; for, albeit upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is certain, there is difference between true and falſe Religion; yet, what Sectary is there in the World, but will pretend he is violented by the Magiſtrate for true Religion, when he is put to trouble for his way; for, every one of them thinks, and will avow, that in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience his way is right, and according to the Word of God; (be it ſo or not) and therefore, if he he be put to trouble for his way, will account himſelf violented in the matter of Religion, and highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured; it is this mans principle, that every man in his diſcretive judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is judge of the juſtice or injuſtice of his own ſufferings, and accordingly, muſt determine anent his reſiſtance to the violence. If every errant be admitted judge of the juſtice of his own ſuffering, accounting his own Religion beſt; he cannot but think, the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting him in it, is a ſufficient injury, to engage him in violent reſiſtance to the Magiſtrate. And then, what a world of ſedition and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion ſhall we have, or elſe the Magiſtrate muſt ſurceaſe the uſe of his co-active power in theſe matters? Again, does not this man, plainly profeſs to ſtir up all, with whom he can prevail, to violent others, (Magiſtrates, Church-men, People and all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the matter of their profeſſion? For even private men are ſtirred by bloody exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to be revenged on and puniſh all Magiſtrates and others, whoſe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:99891:35"/>
blood they thirſt for; becauſe of their not being of their way, which they call Religion: Nor avails it them to ſay, their way is the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the way of others in points of Church-government, it is falſe; and therefore, though they being private men, may violent and puniſh others, even Magiſtrates and all Rulers; yet, other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates or any other, may not violent them. But, whether truth lies on their ſide or not, is the queſtion; and, if they will not admit pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Powers and Authorities to be Judges in that matter; far leſſe have theſe reaſon, to admit of private perſons to be their Judges: But ſo ſelfie are ſuch men, that they think they have a right to violent all men, in that they call Religion, to force them to it; but, that no man hath right to violent them in their way: Shall their private judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment capacitate them ſufficiently, if they have Power to violent others; and yet, no publick Power can violent them, or turn them off, from their perſwaded way; which, upon tryal, will not be found the ſafe way? 2. The Libeller appears all along, very cautious of the probable capacity that private perſons muſt have, before they attempt reſiſtance to powers; <hi>And thinks, that this, together with the intolerable injury in matter of Religion or Liberty, gives</hi> (without need of further) <hi>ſufficient call; and that ſuch as are injured, and in capacity probable to through their work, ſin, if they obey not that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to riſe; and nothing can excuſe from not riſing, but want of this capacity.</hi> This brings to mind Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin's</hi> excuſe he hath, why the ancient Chriſtians took not Arms againſt <hi>Nero, Julian, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens, &amp;c.</hi> becauſe they wanted temporal ſtrength, (wherein he is ſoundly refuted by our Divines) and brings to mind alſo what <hi>Creſwel</hi> the <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> hath againſt the Edict of the Queen of <hi>England Elizabeth,</hi> that Subjects having ſufficient power, not onely lawfully may, but ought, by vertue of divine Precept, and as they would avoid the damnation, or extream peril of their ſouls, to depoſe and throw down heretical Kings: This Libeller fully conſents, with the Jeſuites, not only as to the matter of violent reſiſtance to Princes, but even as to the depoſing and throwing down of them, and all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and puniſhing them, by private hands; and is more injurious to Princes, then they are, as ſhall be cleared in the following Chapter. But, in this matter, he hath borrowed the caution from the Jeſuites; that, any private perſons (<hi>ſi modo vires ad id idoneas habeant,</hi> as the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> ſpeak) are bound to reſiſt Powers, and to be revenged on them, and puniſh them. 3. The Libeller, would bind the neceſſity of combinations, (as he calls them) or conſpiracies againſt Princes,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99891:35"/>
and ſeditious inſurrections (<hi>Naphtali,</hi> Page 17.) upon all private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, not only upon the grounds of humanity, but upon the ground of religious love and fraternal affection; whereby we are bound to relieve the diſtreſſed, eſpecially for Religion, and upon the ground of Religious reſpect to the concernments of Gods glory, to which the intereſts of all Powers and Common-wealths muſt cede. As to this latter of Gods glory, and its concernments; there is no doubt, that is above all humane intereſts, and they ought to cede to the ſame. All the queſtion is, whether ſuch violent courſes againſt Magiſtrates, (though miſcarrying in ſome part of their duty) be for Gods glory? God is not glorified by mens ſins, but when his own Will is done; it is an ordinary thing, that men in their deep deceitfulneſs, pretend God's glory, when they are diſhonouring him, by diſobeying his W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But for the former, anent Chriſtian love, and the obligation thereof, to relieve the diſtreſſed, that is ſurely a duty to love, and relieve the diſtreſſed Brethren; but that love, in the external acts of it, muſt be regulated by ſound reaſon, and by the Word of God: Chriſtian charity binds me, not to relieve and aſſiſt a diſtreſſed brother, in every manner of aſſiſtance; but in that which is within the bounds of my calling, and that which is agreeable to juſtice. A man is not bound to forſake his own ſtation, or run beyond the limits of his calling, to relieve a diſtreſſed bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; No man is bound to ſteal, that he may give almes; or to defraud others of what he is indebted to them, to exerciſe his charity to the indigent.</p>
               <p>And doth not this man himſelf confeſſe, that prudence ſhould mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and regulate the exerciſe of love, in aſſiſting a diſtreſſed brother, and that no man ſhould put his own life in certain peril of loſing, in ſaving the life of another; nor attempt for that end to uſe force, where there is no probable capacity to carry the matter through. If brethren be diſtreſſed by the Magiſtrate, (ſuppoſe unjuſtly) we are bound to aſſiſt them in love, by our Prayers to God for them, by conſolatory words, if we may have acceſſe to them, by giving coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to them, ſupplying their need as far as we may; yea, by intreaties and humble petitions to the Magiſtrate, (as we have opportunity) with all dutiful reſpects to them: But, if nothing can avail for their relief, private perſons have diſcharged their duty, in the point of the exerciſe of Chriſtian love, and are not oblieged, to offer violence to the Publick Magiſtrate, or violently to reſiſt him, in aſſiſting others;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99891:36"/>
but, in the caſe of their brethrens unjuſt ſuffering, commit the matter to him who judgeth righteouſly, poſſeſſing their Souls in patience, as they ought alſo to do, in the caſe of their own wrongful ſuffering. But, it opens a gap to all confuſion, to allow private perſons (if they think they have power enough) to uſe violence upon the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, for relieving their brethren, whom they think op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: Such pretences, will not be wanting to the worſt of men; and the beſt Magiſtrate, proceeding moſt Legally, ſhall never have ſecurity from ſeditious parties, (unleſſe they have viſible power to cruſh them) but they ſhall be reſiſted, when any party thinks meet; and from reſiſtance, there ſhall be a proceeding to revenge, (if might and power be ſufficient) as ſeldome, or never is it ſeen, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Magiſtrate and revenge upon him, (when a party can have the upper-hand) are ſeparated in exerciſe and practice, (whatever be mens notions of the ſeparableneſs of the ſame) And the Principles of this man lead to both, as hath appeared, and will yet more. 4. The Libeller holds out from Scripture, one ground which he thinks ſhould engage all to combine to relieve him and his party, when they count themſelves oppreſſed, and that is, <hi>Becauſe of the ommiſſion of this duty of relieving the oppreſſed, or violation of it;</hi>
                  <note rend="inter">Naph. pag. 17, 18, 19.</note> 
                  <hi>whole Kingdoms and Cities have been involved in the guilt of the oppreſſion, committed by one or few, and fearful judgements have therefore overtaken them, to their utter ruine and ſubverſion.</hi> And, pag. 18. he aſſerts, <hi>That for ſimple connivance and tolerance, (without active compliance with tranſgreſſors) God avengeth the ſins of Rulers onely, or People onely, or of any part of the People onely, upon the whole body of Rulers and People</hi>; and he cites, Jer. 25.15. Deut. 13.12.13, 14, 15. Joſh. 22.17, 18, 19. and <hi>Achans</hi> caſe, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. building alſo his tenet upon the Covenants expreſſe or implicit, betwixt God and the whole People, Rulers and Subjects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And, ſo is confident, that if the violation of duty, in not relieving the oppreſſed, (eſpecially for Religion) involve all failers in it, in ſin and deſtruction; all and every private perſon, is obliged to this duty, to relieve and recover, by violence, oppreſſed ones out of the hand of the Magiſtrate; as they would keep themſelves pure from ſin, and hold off Wrath from themſelves, and from the place they live in.</p>
               <p>Hence a queſtion conſiderable comes to be reſolved, whether God imputes the ſin of one man to another, whereunto he is no way ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cceſſory; but that he tolerates what he cannot amend by any
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99891:36"/>
means<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> within the bounds of his calling? or, whether he executes judgement upon any for the ſins of others, which they are not acceſſory to, and cannot amend, abiding in the bounds of their calling? And particularly, whether God imputes the ſins of Rulers to People, and puniſhes them for the ſame? or, imputes the ſins of any part of a People, to the whole, or of the major part, to the leſſer, and puniſhes them therefore, when they cannot (abiding within the bounds of their calling) amend the ſame, but are no otherwiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſory? Not to dip into that queſtion, in the full latitude of it, we do onely now enquire, if in Divine juſtice, a Prince is any time puniſhed for the ſins of the People, (at which he doth not connive, and whereto he is not acceſſory in any degree) or, if a body of a People be puniſhed for one mans ſin, whereunto they are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſory; or, if private perſons be puniſhed for the ſins of Rulers, or of the body of the People, whereunto they are not acceſſory; but only with grief tolerates what they cannot amend, abiding within the bounds of their calling; this laſt, is the point we muſt fix upon: And herein againſt this Author, it is aſſerted; that, firſt, no man is involved in Divine judgements and puniſhments for the ſins of others, (as the deſerving cauſe of his puniſhment) if he be no way acceſſory to theſe ſins of others. 2. That no private ſubject is acceſſory to the ſins of Rulers, nor involved in the puniſhments of the ſame, meerly upon the account of his tolerating the ſins, or not violent reſiſting the Magiſtrate in his ſinful courſes. A certain thing it is, that (ſetting aſide the ſatisfactory ſuffering of Chriſt, when he put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under the ſtroke of Divine juſtice for the ſins of others, having no ſin of his own) God doth not properly puniſh any man, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to his own perſonal ſin, (as the deſerving cauſe of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) albeit he may, and often doth take occaſion, in his Wiſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, to puniſh men for their own ſins, from the ſins of others, (and in that only ſenſe, they may be ſaid to be puniſhed for the ſins of others) But every Soul ſuffers for his own ſin, Divine juſtice finding deſerving cauſes of puniſhment in every one that is puniſhed, either their perſonal acceſſion to the ſins of others, (which is their own ſin) or elſe ſome other ſins; for which, he may in juſtice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the puniſhment upon them, albeit the impulſive cauſe or occaſion rather for puniſhing in ſuch a manner or time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be from the ſins of others. Every man ſhall bear his own burthen: As no man goes to hell, for the ſin of another, without his own deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo, no man is afflicted by God on earth, but muſt ſay, there are
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99891:37"/>
deſerving cauſes of that in himſelf; howbeit, the lord may have other and higher deſigns in the affliction, then puniſhment of ſin.</p>
               <p>It is alſo no leſs certain to us, that if the Magiſtrate do not connive at ſins of Subjects, nor neglect to curb and puniſh them, the ſins of the people ſhall no way be imputed to him (he not being thereunto acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory in any way) nor ſhall he be puniſhed for their ſins, which in his place and calling he is wreſtling againſt, and uſing his power againſt them. Alſo, it is alike certain, that private perſons ſhall not have the ſins of Magiſtrates, or of the body of the people, imputed to them; nor be puniſhed for the ſame, if ſo be they honeſtly indeavour to do all things againſt theſe ſins, which in their private calling they are bound to do: If they keep themſelves pure without any degree of acting theſe ſins, or any way of acceſſion to them; if they mourn and ſigh for evils that are done; if they be earneſt in prayer, that God may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert others from their evil way; if they (as they can have opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) faithfully admoniſh, and ſtudy to reclaim, theſe who are out of the way, and do ſuch like Chriſtian duties, God will never enter in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with them, for not doing violence to the Authorities that are above them, or for not wakening up confuſions in the Societies they live in, to the deſtruction of many. That God's people of old were puniſhed, upon occaſion of ſins of their Magiſtrates, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 15.4. and the like places, was, becauſe they were ſharers in the guiltineſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, (not by not violent reſiſting, which they were never exhorted to) but by direct or indirect acceſſion, otherwayes, <hi>Ephraim</hi> (ſayes <hi>Hoſea,</hi> ch. 5 11.) <hi>is oppreſſed and broken in judgement; becauſe he willingly walked after the commandment.</hi> And, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 5.31. when the corruption of Rulers is ſpoken of, it is added, <hi>My people love to have it ſo.</hi> It was not the ſin of the Rulers that involved the people in guiltineſs, or rendred them obnoxious unto judgement, but their own acceſſions to the Rulers ſin by conſent or otherwiſe. Let Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> be read upon <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.4. he ſpeaks moſt judiciouſly, diſcourſing of the ſins of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> that brought on judgement: <hi>Non ſolus Rex fuit author hujus ſaevitiae, ſed conſenſu populi veri Dei cultores tracti fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt ad necem: hinc patet fuiſſe commune totius populi ſcelus; ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And that ſame excellent Divine, writing on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third Verſe of <hi>Jerem.</hi> 22. (a place abuſed by <hi>Lex Rex</hi> and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99891:37"/>
others, to ſtir up the people to take the ſword in their hand to relieve the oppreſſed, and execute judgement againſt Magiſtrates) ſpeaks moſt judiciouſly; <hi>Hoc maxime ad Regem &amp; Judices ac praefectos ſpectat, nam ſcimus privatos homines non eſſe armatos ad defenſionem bono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi> And upon the end of the third Verſe, <hi>Haec proprie ad Judices ſpectant, ejus doctrina non niſi ad Regem &amp; Judices publicos dirigitur, neque enim pertinet ad vulgus ipſum aut privatos homines.</hi> And he adds, that the reaſon why that word, <hi>execute judgement,</hi> &amp;c. is uttered in the hearing of the people, is not that the executing thereof belonged to them, but that, when they heard the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> which was <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſancta,</hi> cited before Gods Tribunal, and threatned for omiſſion of theſe things, (the Kings being <hi>quodammodo Legibus ſoluti,</hi> as he ſpeaks) people might be moved to examine their own lives, and to repent of their private injuſtices in their places. And it is to be noted, that the prophetical preachings (reproving the not relieving the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and not executing judgement, and exhorting to theſe duties omitted) uttered to the body of Rulers and People, are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as reproving what was amiſs in every one in their reſpective callings, and as injoining ſuch duties as might be done by every one: <hi>Salva juſtitia, ſalvo ordine &amp; pro modulo vocationis</hi>; people are warned againſt private oppreſſions, Rulers againſt publick, and every one in their ſtation exhorted to deal righteouſly. But to ſay, that whenever the Prophets, in their Sermons, reproved poſitive oppreſſion, or commanded executing of righteouſneſs, they minded to condemn in the people, the grand ſin of non-reſiſtance to the oppreſſing Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, or to cry out againſt it, or to incite private perſons or people to pull the Sword out of the Magiſtrates hand, and relieve the oppreſſed, and execute judgement on the oppreſſors, even Magiſtrates, (as <hi>Lex Rex</hi> doth ſay, <hi>P.</hi> 367.) is not only a moſt fearful perverting of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, to make it a cloak wherewith to cover ſeditious Practices, but a Doctrine that tends directly to horrid confuſion and utter ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of humane Societies. And verily, let this Principle be once admitted, that the ſins of Rulers and Governors involves the people in ſin, and makes them obnoxious to judgement (albeit they be not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſory thereunto, directly nor indirectly, only they tolerate what they cannot amend, abiding within the bounds of their calling.) Neither can the conſciences of people, nor the State of the Common-wealth, have any true peace or quietneſs: For, 1. once grant this, then what a continual puzzle ſhould tender-hearted Chriſtians be in, anent the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Rulers and Magiſtrates, and they behoved to meddle with,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:99891:38"/>
and examine all their proceedings, leſt they ſhould involve them in ſin and judgement, (and to do ſo, were indeed work enough, and above, to private Chriſtians) and they might be put into this fear to be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or involved in judgement for matters of Government, not probably or morally poſſible for them to know: What a ground of great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs ſhould this be? 2. Would not this be a perpetual Seminary of unavoidable ſedition in the Common-wealth, and of expoſing the Magiſtrate to violence, no leſs when he is acting juſtly, then when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly? Such is the ignorance and corruption of moſt of people, who will never want this ready pretence, If we ſuffer the Magiſtrates to do ſuch a thing, and not oppoſe them by force, we ſhall with them be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in ſin and judgement. But, as to the Scriptures he abuſes, to prove that people are involved in guiltineſs, or made obnoxious to the judgements of God, by the ſins of their Rulers, (albeit they have no acceſſion thereunto, but only not violent reſiſting them) and that one part of people may be ſo involved in ſin and wrath, by the ſins of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other part: and that therefore they ought to uſe violent reſiſtance againſt the ſinning Rulers or People: The firſt place is, <hi>Jer.</hi> 26.15. where the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> 8. <hi>ver.</hi> is apprehended by the Prieſts, the Prophets and all the people, for his faithful preaching, 9. <hi>ver. All the people were gathered together in the houſe of the Lord againſt him, and ſaid, thou ſhalt ſurely die:</hi> whereupon the Princes come and ſit in the entry of the new gate of the Lords houſe, and the Prieſts accuſe him before them, <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11. The Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> delivered his meſſage to them all, avows his commiſſion to the Princes and to all the people, cloſing his ſpeech ſubmiſſively, 14, 15. <hi>Behold, I am in your hand, do unto me as ſeemeth good and meet unto you. But know ye for certain, if ye put me to death, ye ſhall ſurely bring innocent blood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your ſelves, and upon this City, and upon the inhabitants thereof.</hi> Where two things are to be marked; 1. That <hi>Jeremiah</hi> is ſpeaking to the Princes and all the people, or the great confluence of the body of the people at that time, warning them not to meddle with his blood, the Princes that they ſhould not unjuſtly condemn him, the people that they ſhould not conſent to, nor co-operate with, an unjuſt ſentence, as to the execution thereof, (as the manner of execution was amongſt that people, ſtoning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) And, 2. he certifies both, that if they conſented and co-operated to his death, they ſhould bring innocent blood upon themſelves, and upon the city and inhabitants thereof: he doth not at all incite the people to riſe up and reſcue him by violence out of the hands of Rulers, if they ſhould give ſentence of death
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99891:38"/>
againſt him, (neither did ever any of the holy Prophets inſtigate people to uſe violent reſiſtance againſt their perverſe Magiſtrates, nor did they ever reprove, directly or indirectly, that ſin of non-violent reſiſtance to Magiſtrates, as ſome exceſſively bold do averr) But only warns Princes and people both, that they be not by conſent or concurrence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſory to his death, leſt it ſhould bring vengeance upon them all, becauſe of their conſent and concurrence; a deep acceſſion to the ſame. It will perhaps be ſaid, that the Prophet not only intimates, that they who heard him, Princes and people, ſhould be guilty of his innocent blood, and obnoxious to judgement; but even the reſt of the people, who (although the confluence then was great) could not be all preſent; yea, Children and Infants, and all the dwellers in the City, and the City it ſelf, ſhould be involved in the ſin and wrath following it.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that none could be defiled with the ſin, but ſuch as one way, or another, made themſelves guilty by acceſſion to it; either in action, or in omiſſion of that, which they were in their calling and ſtation, capacitated to do for hindering it; (ſuch as violent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of Magiſtrates, by private perſons, was not) neither doth the Prophet mean, that all the abſents, all the infants, of that great City, (who knew nothing of the matter) ſhould be guilty of the ſhedding his innocent blood, (if it were ſhed) or ſhould properly upon that account, deſerve the wrath of God; onely he means, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentors, actors, and ſuch as were omitting their duty, publick or private, in reference to the preventing of that ſin, ſhould be involved in the guiltineſs of it, and incur the wrath of God for it: But as for other Inhabitants of the City, abſents, Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though for that ſin, (they not knowing of it) they could not be judged properly guilty of it, or deſerving wrath for it; yet, he intimates, that the Lord by occaſion of it, (ſhould it be committed) would bring wrath even upon theſe, (although for other ſins, as the meritorious cauſe upon their part) And the judgement and wrath, that for the ſin of ſhedding innocent blood, ſhould come upon all the people and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of that City, might be indeed properly a puniſhment to the Rulers, for that particular ſin, and to the people acceſſory thereto in any way; but could not be a puniſhment, (for that ſin parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly) upon them who were no way acceſſory to it, but onely a puniſhment for their own demerits; albeit the execution, <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> occaſioned by the ſin of others. This is a ſure truth, that God may juſtly puniſh the Princes or Fathers, in the puniſhment of ſubjects or children, <hi>Caſtigantur parentes in ſiliis, tanquam in ſua carne cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſima,

Zanch.</hi> 4. <hi>pr.</hi> (they being as it were, parts of themſelves) may, (I ſay) puniſh them, with temporal judgements at leaſt; this is agreeable to his juſtice, who viſits the ſins of the fathers upon the children, 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                  <hi>Command</hi>: But yet, when he is puniſhing Princes or Parents, in their children or ſubjects, there is alſo in theſe who are puniſhed an internal demeriting cauſe of the ſtrokes laid on, that they ſhall have no reaſon to quarrel with God, or to ſay, <hi>The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have eaten ſowre Grapes, and the Childrens teeth are ſet on edge, Ezek.</hi> 18.2. Sometimes perſons may be puniſhed in the affliction or puniſhment that falls on other perſons neer to them, but yet the affliction of theſe other perſons, is alwayes deſerved by their own ſins; albeit, God in his wiſe providence, makes theſe very ſame afflictions to be puniſhments alſo of the ſins of others, to whom they they are neerly related. But as to this place, it is not the Prophets mind to intimate, (as this man ſaith) that for violation of this duty, of not offering violence to the Magiſtrate, proceeding unjuſtly, wrath ſhould come on them all of that City, there is not the leaſt evidence of any ſuch intention he had, to ſtir up the people to do ſuch a thing; only, he gives faithful warning to all ranks, not to conſent or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate to ſuch a wickedneſs, which might bring wrath upon them, as <hi>Diodat</hi> hath it; <hi>ye will make your ſelves guilty before God of this fact, and burthen your ſelves with it.</hi>

                  <hi>who cover violence with his garment</hi>) this man and his complices (men of blood and violence) are ſingularly experienced. 2. This is a ſure rule, That no expoſition of a Text can ſubſiſt, that is either contrary to other Texts of Scripture, or to found reaſon: but ſo it is, that the expoſition given by this man of this Text, as if it favoured his poſition for meer private perſons, or any part of a peoples taking not only the defenſive Sword in hand, but the vindicative and puniſhing Sword againſt all Magiſtrates, higher and lower, and againſt the body of the Society, whereof they are Members, and the leſſer part alſo, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary both to plain Scripture and to reaſon. The Scripture commits the vindicative and puniſhing Sword only to the Magiſtrate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. He only is Gods Sword-bearer that way. And amongſt Magiſtrates there is a ſupreme power, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. on whom all others have depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as to their call and the exerciſe thereof. And it is a Doctrine point-blank contrary to reaſon, remedileſly tending to diſſolve humane Societies, and all Kingdoms and Common-wealths, and opening a door to all ſeditious confuſions; to teach, that any meer private perſons, or any part of a people (who think themſelves ſtrong enough) ſhould take on them to ſit and act as puniſhing Judges over all Magiſtrates, ſupreme and ſubordinate, conſtituted by the body of a people; yea, and upon the major part of the people themſelves. Oh, horrid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, to be deteſted by all rational and Chriſtian hearts! that the minor meer private part of a people, ſhould ſet themſelves down as Judges upon the whole body of a people, and the generality of the Magiſtrates; and upon their own fanſies, led with their own luſts, draw the magiſtratical Sword, which God never committed to them, and ſtrike both the Magiſtrates of all ſorts and degrees, and their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours therewith. This ſure is not the work of God, (however it be faced or varniſhed) but of Sathan. 3. The man fanſies an adverſary to himſelf, while he brings-in ſome, ſaying, <hi>That in the caſe of equal diviſion of Cities, faithful and unfaithful, matters ſhould come to accommodation anent ſerving or not ſerving other gods,</hi> (the caſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.) <hi>or that if the major part went wrong, the minor ſhould reſt in a ſinful acquieſcence, and be thereto oblieged by the major part.</hi> Who ever ſaid ſo? or, (if there be any ſpark of Gods fear in the heart) will ſay ſo? There is no coming to accommodation in ſuch matters, whither the true God, or other gods, ſhould be ſerved and followed, (and yet this man would be very ſevere, if no Nation in the world might (having before been embodied in a Kingdom or State) continue and abide in their peaceable communion in civil intereſts, upon ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:99891:40"/>
of ſuch an equal diviſion ariſing amongſt them.) As for the obligation that the major part of a people might put upon the minor, to a ſinful acquieſcence, who will allow that? There ſhould be no ſinful acquieſcence, nor any acquieſcence at all to any party, were they never ſo many, who run away from God after other gods or idols. But (ſuppoſing a Government democratick) though the leſſer part is not to acquleſce in the way of the greater, running into rebellion againſt God; but by all means competent to them, bear witneſs againſt that way, and ſtudy to keep themſelves pure, when they cannot prevail to have matters rectified, as to the whole body: yet, cannot people keep their conſcience and practice undefiled, unleſs they overthrow by violence (which is the thing all alongs aimed at by this man) Gods order in the Societies whereof they are members, and inſtate themſelves in the power God hath not given them? 4.

Upon the contrary we affirm, that from <hi>Moſes</hi> time (who is called King in <hi>Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run, Deut.</hi> 33.5.) the Lord never appointed, nor allowed, a demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical Government amongſt his people, (although the principles of this man and his conſorts do lead to the worſt ſort of Democracy, as the only lawful Government; yea, to an Oligarchick Democracy (if ſo we may ſpeak) wherein the leſſer part of meer private perſons may tread down the greater, and all Magiſtrates alſo from the higheſt to the loweſt, if they can have ſtrength enough.) The Government of that people until <hi>Sauls</hi> time, was properly Theocratical, <hi>The Lord was their King,</hi> 1 Sam. 12.12. in another way and more ſpecial, then he is King over all the earth. From him they had their judicial Laws particularly ſet down to them; He appointed in his Word their high Senate or San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrim, (wherein the high Prieſt was a chief Member, and other Prieſts Members alſo, not eligible by the people, as neither were the heads of the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi>) to rule them under himſelf: He did now and then ſend out his extraordinary Vice-royes (the Judges) till <hi>Samuels</hi> time, who not only were Saviours to deliver them from their enemies, but Judges to rule them in times of peace, for many years together: and when theſe were not ſent, they had their ſetled Sanhedrim or Senate of Gods appointment, to govern them. Again, that command, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. did reach all times of that <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> eſtate, even when they came to be under Kings and viſible Monarchs, who unqueſtionably had the ſupreme power of the Sword: nor was it free for private perſons,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:99891:40"/>
upon any pretence, to take hold of it, for revenging or puniſhing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, (as this man would have private perſons now to do.) And further, though the word, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.12. be ſpoken to the people, <hi>If thou ſhalt hear ſay,</hi> &amp;c. yet, it is alwayes to be underſtood, that the peoples concurrence in the puniſhing of an apoſtate City, was to be within the bounds of their calling, and under the conduct of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtratical power ſet over them. As when inticers to idolatry are in the former part of the Chapter injoined to be taken order with (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever nearly they were related to people) and to be ſtoned; it is not to be ſuppoſed, that the charge is given to every private perſon <hi>brevi manu</hi> to do this, but judgement was to be execute on them after judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial conviction and ſentence given by the Magiſtrate, as <hi>Diodat</hi> notes well, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>Procure</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>vengeance on him, in way of juſtice accuſing him to the Magiſtrate by information or ſufficient proof.</hi> So alſo, in the caſe of apoſtaſie of a City, a judicial proceſs is required, 14. <hi>ver. Thou ſhalt enquire and make ſearch, and ask diligently and behold if it be truth, and the thing certain,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pelargus</hi> notes on the place, <hi>Ne indicta cauſa quiſpiam temere à nimium fervidis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnetur, actio à Magiſtratu eſt inſtituenda poſt famam publicam, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſio reo eſt concedenda.</hi> But this man will have meer private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, without any judicial proceeding by the Magiſtrate, to execute vengeance againſt all apoſtate Magiſtrates, and Miniſters, and People. This he furiouſly inſtigates people to do, and by him and his party, all are held Apoſtates who differ in a point of external Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from them albeit they hold faſt the true Proteſtant Religion (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods Word and our good Laws) in the integrity of their ſouls.</p>
               <p>The other place abuſed by him, is <hi>Joſh.</hi> 22.17, 18, 19. (<hi>Naph. p.</hi> 19) which he thinks gives warrand for private perſons to uſe the revenging Sword upon Apoſtates, for turning away Gods wrath. But, how ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly abuſeth he the holy Scripture? It is moſt clear, they were no private perſons that tranſacted that buſineſs with the children of <hi>Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben, Gad</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> nor the minor part of that people of God. The Congregation of the Judges and Princes of the people, conveened under the conduct of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> their Judge then living. <hi>Phineas,</hi> the high Prieſts ſon, with the reſt of the Princes of the Tribes, are ſent to treat with the Reubenites, anent the altar they had ſet up, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn a ſatisfying anſwer. Now, let any judge what makes all this for the encroachment of meer private perſons upon the uſe of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates avenging Sword on Apoſtates. Beſides the body of the peoples
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:99891:41"/>
concurring, we have the Magiſtrates, ſupreme and ſubordinate, acting their parts in their ſtation, who, had they not uſed their Authority (had that ſuppoſed defection been indeed real) had been truly guilty of ſinful connivance.</p>
               <p>As to the third place cited, <hi>Judg.</hi> 22. in the caſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin,</hi> that time was indeed the time thrice ſpoken of, <hi>Judges,</hi> 17.6.18.1.21.25. <hi>When there was no King in Iſrael, every man did what is right in his own eyes</hi>; (if this be aimed at by this man, his heart and wayes can tell.) It is hard to ſhow what the Government about that time was. <hi>Martyr,</hi> on 18. of the <hi>Judges,</hi> tells us, the People of God in theſe times were under the power of the <hi>Philiſtines, Collapſa erant omnia</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>quod Rege ac Magiſtratu Reſpublica deſtitue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur.</hi> Yet ſhall we not think it likely, but they retained ſomewhat of their Sanhedrim appointed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. which in ſuch a horrid caſe might draw together in an extraordinary meeting: but let it be ſo, that the Government was democratick then (which cannot be proven) yet ſeing it is the body or major part of the People that uſes the Sword againſt the leſſer, it makes nothing for this Libeller, who will have the minor part to uſe the Sword, to puniſh Magiſtrates of all degrees, and the major part of the people alſo (if they have ſtrength enough.)</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Achans</hi> caſe, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 7. There is nothing in it to juſtifie private perſons riſing againſt the Magiſtrates, and plurality of the people to avert the judgements of God, nor for uſing violence upon them, in caſe of their ſinning againſt God, (which is the Libellers poſition) what was done to <hi>Achan</hi> was done by the Supreme Magiſtrate <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> and not by meer private perſons uſurping his power. <hi>Achans</hi> ſin being ſo ſecret and unknown, could not involve the whole multitude into ſin, and render them obnoxious to divine wrath (they not knowing it, far leſs being acceſſory to it.) And albeit it be ſaid, <hi>Iſrael hath ſinned,</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> yet as <hi>Diodate</hi> and others ſay well, the meaning is, one of <hi>Iſrael hath ſinned,</hi> not the whole collective body: and although by occaſion of that ſin of one member of the body, other members are ſmitten; yet in the juſtice of God, theſe ſmitten members had their own guiltineſs drawing on ſtrokes upon them, the out-letting whereof was in divine wiſdom or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered upon occaſion of <hi>Achans</hi> ſin. Theſe two things we are peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory in. 1. That God in his holy juſtice doth not puniſh any part of a people for the ſins of another part, to which they are no wayes acceſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, only they tollerate what they cannot amend, keeping within com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of their calling, albeit in his holy Providence and Wiſdom, he may, and doth often, take occaſion of puniſhing one part of a People for their
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:99891:41"/>
own ſins, from the ſinning of another part of that ſame Body and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration. Every man that is puniſhed, hath in himſelf the meritorious cauſe of the puniſhment; albeit the riſe of the execution of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> be occaſion'd by the ſins of neighbours, or members of that ſame body. 2. In this we are peremptory, that whatever op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, the Lord in his holy Wiſdom doth take of puniſhing one part of a people, upon the breaking out of the ſins of another part of a people, yet private perſons have no warrand thereupon to uſurp the Magiſtrates Sword, nor to uſe it againſt himſelf, if he be the offender, or againſt other offenders; and the pretence of turning away Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from our ſelves, will not juſtifie ſuch diſorder and intruſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the lines of our Calling. This is the <gap reason="foreign">

He thinks, he and his complices may force all by the Sword to their way, but muſt not be forced by any.

If he (or his conſorts) can produce either Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Command or allowed Example, warranding any party of meer private perſons, to take and uſe not only the defenſive Sword, but the avenging and puniſhing Sword, againſt Magiſtrates of all degrees, and againſt the Body of a people, upon pretence of Religion or any other, we ſhall kiſs his hands, and humbly yeeld to Gods truth (accounting this our greateſt victory) otherwiſe we muſt ſay, he is a very word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And though he pleads for private perſons falling upon Magiſtrates, and others of the Common-wealth for their ſins, that Gods wrath may be turned away in their puniſhment, it hath no weight with us: for, albeit the Lord may, in his holy wiſe Providence, take the riſe of the out-letting of his judgements on ſome from the ſins of others related to them, yet hath he not made his Providence the Rule of our actions to warrand us (being private Perſons) to puniſh them; but we muſt go to the Law and Teſtimony to ſeek the Rules of our actions. And whatever action is not according to this, there is no light in it, it is but a work of darkneſs, for all the fair colours men can ſet upon it: albeit God viſit the ſins of Parents upon Children; yet that gives no warrand to Children to offer violence to their Parents for their ſins.</p>

                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:99891:42"/>But yet the Libeller cannot ſo leave the matter, but after many ranting and rambling words (which it were a pain to ripe up, nor is it our purpoſe, minding onely to notice his abuſes of Scripture, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent reaſonings) he comes at length to his great reſerve, <hi>pag.</hi> 30. and ſayes, If all theſe things do not ſatisfy (as indeed they are ſoon pleaſed, who will be ſatisfied by him) he hath yet, four or five par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars that will make all ſure for his poſition, which he hath been labouring to underprop, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That any private perſons, may againſt all Magiſtrates, and the great body of the Common-wealth, take and uſe not only the ſelf defending, but vindicative, puniſhing and reforming Sword.) And, 1. he ſaith, <hi>That the reaſon of delivering the Kingdom to the People, and not to the King, with the Law it ſelf, (Deut.</hi> 17.14. <hi>no way contradicted or repealed, by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Kingdom, and in effect of Tyranny fore told, by way of diſſwaſive,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.10.) <hi>doth make much for his poſition.</hi> But, 1. the man utters here, a groſs untruth; For, God doth not in the Text, deliver the Kingdom to the People, and not to the King, (as he ſaith) he doth only before hand, inſtruct the People anent the right way of ſetting of a King over them, (when it ſhould come to paſs, that they ſhould do ſo) and leaves in his Word, inſtructions for the King that ſhou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thou ſhalt in any wiſe ſet him King over thee, whom the Lord thy God ſhall chooſe,</hi> neither ever did they chooſe a King, but onely accepted of the Kings, choſen and given them by God, and deſigned to them by his extraordinary Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours; as is clear, firſt in <hi>Saul,</hi> and after in <hi>David</hi> and his Family, the choſen Royal Family. Neither were the People to look on their Kings, as their ſervants or vaſſals, or creatures, (as ſuch men uſe to write) but as ſet over them, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſet him over thee,</hi> (not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thee) <hi>whom the Lord thy God ſhall chooſe</hi>) neither had they power over the King, but the King by Gods Ordinance had Power over them. 2. Were it ſo, that the Kingdom or the Power of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging it, were delivered to the People, (which is moſt falſe) yet this makes nothing to this Libellers poſition; giving Power to any party of private Perſons amongſt People, to puniſh all Magiſtrates,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:99891:42"/>
and the major part of the people too, (if they be ſtrong enough) what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was granted to the People here, was granted to the body; not to this, or that party of private perſons. 3. It is very true, the place, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.10. (and not, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.10. as he miſ-cites both this and the former Scripture) neither contradicts, nor repeales that Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.14. but agrees notably with it. But it is falſe, that onely the Tyranny of a King is there ſpoken of, by way of meerly diſſwaſive: <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> do very well agree together, the one ſhews what a King ſhould do <hi>ex officio</hi> and <hi>de jure,</hi> the other what a King may do, by the power he hath, and yet not be obnoxious to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from Subjects; The one ſhews what a good King ſhould do, the other, what a People ſhould ſuffer of an evil King, without at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of violence upon him: The one ſets forth Gods approbative Law, and inſtructs Kings in their kingly duties; the other ſets down the permiſſive Law of the King, ſhewing the reach of his Power, (if he ſhould abuſe it) without puniſhment from man. The doing of ſuch things, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.10. was in effect tyrannical, not approven by God; but if the King came to abuſe his Power ſo far, he had a permiſſive Law for him, that it was not free to his Subjects to puniſh him: As, albeit the Lord approveth not Divorce, or a mans putting away of his wife, yet by a permiſſive Law, husbands amongſt Gods People, had liberty, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.1. to put away their wives, without being obnoxious to humane puniſhment for that cauſe; (albeit God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the puniſhment of the hard-hearted husbands to himſelf) So, the Lord gives no approbation to over-imperious or tyrannical facts of Princes; yet, if they abuſe their Power, he will reſerve them unto dreadful puniſhments by his own hand, but will not have the hands of their Subjects to be upon, or againſt them. As parents do evil in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting their children, for their pleaſure, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.9, 10. and have no moral approven power from God ſo to do; yet, it is a ſort of right of parents, that if they ſo do, their children may not uſe violence upon them, or riſe to deſtroy them, but be in a reverent ſubjection to them.</p>
               <p>But this great Theologue tells us, <hi>That it is only the manner of Tyranny, that is here ſet down by Samuel; And that meerly by way of diſſwaſive, to diſſwade them from ſeeking a King. Anſ.</hi> 1. It is true, the fact is the manner of Tyranny, but the permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive power without puniſhment from Subjects, is the juſt right of all Lawful Kings, of whom, as it may be ſaid, <hi>Nil paenas metuunt, nulla quia lege tenentur</hi>: So to them (if they deboard and abuſe their power) it may be ſaid, <hi>Si genus humanum &amp; mortalia temnitis

Let it be ſo, that <hi>Samuel</hi> in ſetting forth the manner or Law of the King, intended to diſſwade the people, from inſiſting in their petition for a King; yet, that was not his only, nor his main intention: his main intention is, to ſhew the People their duty, under a Kings oppreſſion, (though it was not his duty to oppreſſe them) to ſhew them, (I ſay) what they behoved to ſuffer under a King, beyond meaſure imperious, without reſiſtance, (for he is not now teaching the King his duty.) This is clear, for otherwiſe, to what purpoſe ſhould he have written the manner of the King in a Book, and laid it up before the Lord, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the King is ſet over them? 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.25. when there was no place for repentance, no remedy, no uſe of terrifying or diſſwading them; the only uſe of recording it, was, to teach the people their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour towards the King, and patience under him, and that it ſhould not be free for them, to ſhake off the yoke of his Government, or to offer violence to him, albeit he ſhould over-ſtretch his Power too far. This that he recorded, was not the Law of the King, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. that was already keeped in the Ark with the reſt of the Law, and needed not to be written again in a Book, to lay it up before the Lord. Nor is there any ground for their fancy, who think, <hi>that Samuel did write certain fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, to withſtand the abuſe of abſolute Power, and to temper Monarchy, with a liberty befitting the People</hi>: This is but a gueſs without ground; had there been any ſuch ſpecial fundamental Lawes, the ten Tribes had a fair ground of pleading upon the ſame, before their revolt; but no ſuch thing is heard of, and it is as eaſie to deny it,, as it is to affirm, that there was any ſuch thing as theſe imagined fundamental Laws. Beſides, that the People claim no vote in ſuch fundamental Laws or Pactions; and had there been any ſuch thing, it was their intereſt to be conſulted with in the matter; and had they thought of any ſuch Covenants or Laws funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, wherein liberty might be left them to reſiſt their Kings, or take order with them, how eaſily could they have ſhewed the weakneſs of <hi>Samuels</hi> diſſwaſion, and ſaid, If the King become evil, we will reſiſt him, and be revenged upon him; for, we take him to reign, but only on ſuch termes, that he reign well; But no ſuch thoughts had they.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The next thing the Libeller addes in his reſerve, to ſatisfie mens judgements anent his ſeditious poſition of private mens uſing the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Sword againſt all Magiſtrates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is, <hi>the contract and covenant betwixt King and people, &amp;c.</hi> Better occaſion ſhall be given to ſpeak of this in the next Chap. Only now we ſay, it is impertinently alledged to the ſatisfying of men anent his foreſaid poſition: for, whatever intereſt the body of a people have to oppoſe powers above them by that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed <hi>contract</hi> and <hi>covenant,</hi> will not juſtifie meer private perſons, and the far fewer and leſſer part, in their inſurrections againſt all Magiſtrates and the Body of the community; for, it is not with them, as ſeparate from the Body, that ſuch a contract (if any be) is made; but it is between the King and the People, nor can it enſtate them in a Power of puniſhing all Magiſtrates over them and all their neighbours, (being the Plurality) which this man aims at. But he proceeds to ſeek further protection for ſedition in ſacred Scripture, out of which he would produce three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: Firſt, <hi>the peoples oppoſing Saul in the caſe of Jonathan,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.45. To which we ſay, though <hi>Saul</hi> had made a raſh oath, and had raſhly and ſinfully adjured the people, that they ſhould eat no food till the evening, <hi>v.</hi> 24. (which <hi>L. R.</hi> untruly calls a ſtanding Law, which the People had agreed to, <hi>P.</hi> 349.) yet the people uſe no violence againſt <hi>Saul,</hi> when he goes about to put to death innocent <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi> (who taſted of the honey, not having heard of the adjuration) But in the heat of a ſouldierly boldneſs, (after ſo great a victory ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd ſpecially by <hi>Jonathans</hi> valour, who in that day of Battel wrought with God, and wrought great ſalvation in <hi>Jſrael</hi>) do ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually interpoſe with <hi>Saul,</hi> and mediate for the life of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> moving <hi>Saul</hi> to wave reſpect to his raſh oath, and to regard what was juſt and right. The people (as <hi>Junius</hi> ſaith) <hi>adjurat</hi> Saulem <hi>&amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellat ipſius conſcientiam coram vivente Deo, ut poſthabita jura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti ratione, juris habeat rationem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>&amp; ſe interponentes,</hi> Saulem
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:99891:44"/>
                  <hi>impediverunt, ne eum morti traderet.</hi> They interpoſed by mediation for ſo worthy a perſon, and their mediation was willingly welcomed, and not a word is there more of that matter, <hi>Saul</hi> not counting himſelf croſſed in ſuch mediation for ſo noble and dear a Son, whom he in his raſhneſs had devoted to death. Neither do the people oppoſe an oath againſt <hi>Sauls</hi> oath, for ſaving <hi>Jonathan: Junius</hi> expoſition may paſſe well, that they ſpeak not by way of ſwearing, but by way of reaſoning, abhorring the deſtruction of ſuch a perſon. <hi>Ab ſit, ut vivit Jehova, an cadere debet ullus ex capillis capitis ejus, quandoquidem,</hi> &amp;c. As the Lord liveth, ſhould any hair of <hi>Jonathans</hi> head fall to the ground, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is a wonder to ſee underſtanding men argue from this place, for violent and forcible reſiſtance to Kings, eſpecially when act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to Laws conſented to by private perſons; here the King is not acting according to Law, but proſecuting the obſervation of a fooliſh and raſh oath; Here, the oppoſition made to the King, is by way of interceſſion and earneſt reaſoning, that he ought to regard what was right, more then his raſh oath; here, the oppoſition made by way of interceſſion, was acceptable and welcome, acquieſced in, and yeelded to; Here, the oppoſition made, is not only by one part of the people, but the Princes of the Land and Captains of thouſands, as <hi>L. R.</hi> ſaith, <hi>p,</hi> 348. Now what makes all this for a party of meer private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons making inſurrection, and uſing force and violence upon all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, acting according to eſtabliſhed Laws, and affronting, grieving, diſhonouring them, yes, profeſſedly aiming at their deſtruction? Let <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> be looked upon this place, and he ſpeaks notably well, his own words will diſcover, how notourly he is falſified by <hi>L. R. p.</hi> 349. But yet again, the Libeller produceth the example <hi>of the ten tribes rejecting Rehoboam,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12. as a laudable example to juſtifie his poſition. Be-like now the matter goes farther on, then pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate mens innocent ſelf-defence againſt violence, for the defection of the ten tribes is held forth as imitable (we ſee what is the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of this mans Principles.) But no ſound man will think, the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain and furious Rebellion of the ten tribes from <hi>Davids</hi> houſe, upon the raſh and furious anſwer of a young King, was juſtifiable, (although the Lord in his Providence ordered it ſo.) And upon the revelation hereof, it was acquieſced in, and arms were not uſed againſt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding party; and it would be conſider'd alſo, that they who made the ſeceſſion, were the major part of the body of the people. But, what is all this to juſtifie the inſurrections of any leſſer party of private people, againſt the Magiſtrate, and all Magiſtrates ſupreme and ſubordinate, as
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:99891:44"/>
this man would have them to do? Every example recorded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not imitable.</p>
               <p>As to the revolt of <hi>Libnah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.10. this is reported in Scripture as a fact, but is not juſtified and approven, although it be ſaid, <hi>they revolted, becauſe</hi> Jehoram <hi>had forſaken the Lord God of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> This imports not the impulſive cauſe of the revolt, or motive which they had before their eyes, (for, in that ſame verſe and period, it is ſaid, <hi>The</hi> Edomites <hi>alſo revolted from him, becauſe he had forſaken the Lord God of his fathers:</hi> and the <hi>Edomites</hi> loved not the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion) But the meritorious cauſe on <hi>Jehorams</hi> part of that piece of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment coming on him, is pointed at; as oft-times God puniſheth mens ſins by the ſinful actions of other men againſt them; the inſtruments are ſinful, but his juſtice is holy. But let the Libeller tell us in good earneſt, if he thinks that the laying aſide of the Presbyterian frame, is the forſaking of the Lord God of our fathers, and a ſufficient cauſe for any one Town in the Kingdom to revolt from the King, (though he do not perſecute them nor force them to his way, as there is no evidence that <hi>Libnah</hi> was thus uſed) ſhall a Kings ſwerving in that one point, or if there be greater infidelity, be ſufficient ground of defection from him? <hi>Cave dixeris. Libnah</hi> was a City of the Prieſts, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10. (perhaps much of the temper of this ſort of men) but their revolt was ſinful, becauſe with the ſeceſſion from the Common-wealth, they fell off from the Church of God, from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Temple, and publick Worſhip and place of it, which was (as yet) owned by God, notwithſtanding many corruptions: the revolt is only recorded as done, not as well done. As to what he adds, of the Practices, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies, and manner of the late bleſſed Reformations, and the Right and Conſtitution of this Kingdom, afterward it ſhall be conſidered. But it is a wonder, that upon this point of reſiſtance and taking arms againſt Kings, he hath omitted <hi>Davids</hi> taking <hi>Goliaths</hi> Sword, and gathering bands of men for his own defence againſt <hi>Sauls</hi> violence; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he medleth not with, neither ſhall we, further then to note what <hi>Beza</hi> in his anſwer to <hi>Caſtellio,</hi> P. 20. ſayes, <hi>Davidis unctio ita eum à privatis diſtinguebat, ut jure poſſet armis vim injuſtam repellere.</hi> And it were to be wiſhed, that this Libeller, who mocks at the exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Kings from puniſhment by Subjects (as we will hear) may let <hi>Davids</hi> word ſink in his heart, <hi>Who ſhall ſtretch forth his hand againſt the Lords anointed, and be innocent</hi>?</p>
               <p>Now to draw to a cloſe of this matter, let theſe few things be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, 1. That whatever may be ſaid of the lawfulneſs of defenſive
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:99891:45"/>
arms, againſt the illegal violences and extreme oppreſſion of a Prince, who is not <hi>integrae Majeſtatis,</hi> by other Magiſtrates to whom with him the protection of Laws and Liberties is jointly committed, by certain pactions and conditions expreſſed; that will ſay nothing to warrand the inſurrection of any party of private perſons againſt all their Magiſtrates, acting according to Laws agreed upon by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of all degrees, and the body of the Community.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the late riſing againſt, and reſiſting the King and all Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities in the Land, was utterly unwarrantable, not only upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their being meer private perſons who did take arms, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was neither ſufficient ground for that deed, (had it in its nature been lawful) nor did they abide within due limits of an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent defence. The Author of <hi>L. R.</hi> tells us, <hi>P.</hi> 329. <hi>When there is no actual invaſion made by a man ſeeking our life, we are not to uſe violent re-offending.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, he ſaith, P. 327, 328. <hi>Private men muſt not preſently uſe violence to the Kings ſervants, till they ſupplicate; nor may uſe re-offending, if flight may ſave; and muſt not uſe violent re-offending againſt the ſervants of the King, but in the exigence of laſt and moſt inexorable neceſſity.</hi> And, P. 321. <hi>Any mean not uſed for prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing death, muſt be an act of revenge, not of ſelf-defence.</hi> And adds there, <hi>That in paying tribute, or ſuffering a buffet of a rough Maſter, we are not to uſe any act of re-offending,</hi> &amp;c. Now the world knows, the life or blood of theſe people was not ſought upon any termes, there was no forcing them to idolatry, to falſe worſhip, nor frighting them to any thing of that kind upon pain of their lives; only for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the outward Ordinances of God, purely adminiſtred in an Orthodox Church, they were put to pay ſuch moderate fines, as the publick Laws had appointed; without any actual invaſion of them or their perſons, they were the firſt aggreſſors and invaders, wounding and murthering the Kings Servants and Miniſters, and ſeiſing on his chief Officer. <hi>Napht. p.</hi> 137. confeſſeth they ſhed <hi>the firſt blood,</hi> and firſt murthered <hi>the Kings Servants.</hi> They had never before that eſſayed ſupplicating theſe in power, for mitigation of their fines (which was not forbidden them to do, if ſo be they would have done it without tumults and combinations) but being inflamed by furious Agitators, they would flee to the Sword, and provoke others to combinations with them: And ſo, (ſpoiling loyal perſons who would not concur with them, and their hearts being full of much more miſchief) they marched on to mock Authority with armed Petitions, as they had mocked God
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:99891:45"/>
by ſinful prayers to proſper their evil courſe, (as if he had been alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſuch a one as themſelves) But not only have others, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alſo, cauſe to praiſe God that they had no ſucceſs in ſin, which might have been a ſnare and a ſtumbling block to them and others alſo. It is Gods great mercy not to thrive in an evil way.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All the people of God are to advert carefully, to the dangerous principle of this Libeller, and his adherents, which is this, (all alongs his Book) <hi>That it is as (or more) irrational and unlawful, to ſuffer unjuſtly from the Magiſtrate, (ſo long as there is ſtrength enough to act againſt him) as it is to obey actively, his unlawful commandments</hi>: This doctrine cannot but be a ſource and ſpring of perpetual ſeditions, under every kind of Government, Civil and Eccleſiaſtical: For thus, every man is made judge of his own ſuffering and paſſion, as well as of his own practice, and no man muſt ſuffer, more then he thinks he deſerveth; (but counteract all Authority, if he be ſtrong enough to do it.) And no man is to ſubmit to unjuſt ſufferings, by abuſed Authority, but <hi>ad redimendam majorem vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem,</hi> and when he cannot otherwiſe mend himſelf by the uſe of violence againſt the Magiſtrate: Thus no malefactor ought to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to puniſhment if he think it unjuſtly inflicted by the Magiſtrate, but do violence to him if he can; and, no Miniſter is to forbear preaching, if he judge himſelf unjuſtly depoſed; and no Chriſtian forbear intruding himſelf on the Communion, if he judge himſelf unjuſtly dealt with by Church-Judicatories: This is a ſubverſion of all order in humane and Chriſtian Societies, for all is made dependent upon the fancies and thoughts of private ſufferers; who are like enough, to be very favourable judges to themſelves, in prejudice of publick Order, which (notwithſtanding) any tender-hearted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian will regard more then his own private will or well-being; however, <hi>Naphtali</hi> mocks at Gods order, <hi>pag.</hi> 152. aſſerting, <hi>the obſervance thereof, to be but a diſpenſable formality, when he and his party takes it in their heads, that it is conducible to break the obſervance of Gods order, for Gods glory</hi>: What woful confuſion ſhall we be reduced to, if ſuch fanſies poſſeſſe the heads of heady people? Theſe great teachers, would aſſure us, it is an act of Grace and Vertue to reſiſt the Magiſtrate, unjuſtly afflicting us: And that it is both well conſiſtent with the honour due to the Magiſtrate, by the fifth Commandment, to knock him down by violent force of Armes, when we think he wrongs us; and alſo, a neceſſary commanded duty, (by vertue of the ſixth Command) ſo to do, when he offers violence
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:99891:46"/>
to our life, (although he proceed by Law, which we count an unjuſt Law.) This is the doctrine of <hi>L. R.</hi> and of his fellow witneſſes, whom <hi>Napht.</hi> calls Martyrs: It is true, <hi>L. R. pag.</hi> 322. ſtrives to allay and mollifie the matter, (wherein he is not ſo far wrong as <hi>Naphtali</hi>) aſſerting, <hi>That in leſſer injuries, (beneath mutilation, or loſſe of life) as bearing tributes, or loſſes in eſtate,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>a man hath given him of God a greater comparative dominion, then over his life: And that he may as to theſe matters, ſuffer unjuſtly from the Magiſtrate, without reſiſtance, and ought to do ſo</hi>; (and this was the only caſe of the weſtern Sufferers, if they may at all be looked on, as unjuſtly ſuffering) <hi>although he ought not to ſuffer death unjuſtly, if he can help himſelf, becauſe God hath not made this eligible by any man.</hi> But certainly, his writing involves groſſe contradictions, for the ground of reſiſting the Magiſtrate purſuing a mans life unjuſtly, which he doth lay down, (<hi>viz.</hi> That there is no more obligation lying on us, to ſuffer unjuſtly from an abuſed power, (if we can violently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him) then to do unjuſtly upon the unlawful command of the Power) doth reach not only to the caſe of taking away the life, but taking away the goods unjuſtly; for if it be true, (as he ſayes) that by vertue of the ſixth Command, we are oblieged to reſiſt the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, when we think he takes our life unjuſtly; certainly by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the eight Command, we are oblieged to reſiſt him, when he takes our goods unjuſtly, or layes on oppreſſive tributes; and by vertue of the ninth Command, are oblieged to reſiſt him violently, if reproach or infamy be rubbed on our name and reputation, (which to men, uſes to be dearer then life or ſtate) by him. And ſeing this Witneſs and his fellows, do ſpeak of ſubmiſſion to ſentences of Judges, which they reckon unjuſt, as a matter at leaſt of equal guiltineſs, (where there is Power to reſiſt violently) unto the guiltineſſe of active obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence given to unlawful Commands; no degree of ſuch unjuſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is eligible, more then any degree of wicked obedience, to unjuſt commands: God hath not given to us a comparative dominion over our actions, that we ſhould do a leſſe ſin rather then a greater; (ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all ſin is to be abhorred) So, if by divine precept, we be bound to reſiſt Powers, inflicting on us greater puniſhments unjuſtly; we are alſo oblieged to reſiſt them, in inflicting the leſſer puniſhments, (if they do unjuſtly.) And non-defenſe, even againſt leſſer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, (being ſin) it is not eligible, and if non-defenſe againſt greater injuries be ſin, againſt the leſſer it muſt be ſin alſo. So by this doctrine, nothing at all is to be ſuffered at the hand of the Magiſtrate,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:99891:46"/>
(if we think, he deals unjuſtly with us, and if we have power enough to maſter him) but a continual repugnancy there muſt be in all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects againſt all Magiſtrates (when they apprehend wrong is done to them) and violence upon violence muſt be offered them, where there is force and ſtrength enough in the perſons accuſed as guilty: yea, no man is to ſuffer any thing from Powers above them, without a phyſical neceſſity of force upon him; nor muſt in ſubmiſſion do any thing that may be diſpoſitive or preparatory to his own ſuffering. No man, if he think himſelf injured, (though ſentenced to baniſhment) is to go on his own feet, till he be by force ejected; no man, fined in pecuniary Mulcts, is to pay them till he be under force, and his money plucked from him; no man is to go the place of execution (when ſentenced by the Judge) till he be trailed by force, if he think himſelf innocent; nor lay down his head on a block, till he be violented: For, albeit he be not in probable capacity to deliver himſelf from death, or from theſe other puniſhments; yet, every man is in capacity probable enough to command his own loco-motive faculty not to ſtir toward the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the execution of the unjuſt ſentence, till there be a force upon him. And it is <hi>Naphtali</hi>'s Principle, that ſo far as probable ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity is to reſiſt violently, there ſhould be no ſubmiſſion; and then there muſt be patience per-force. Can ſuch Doctrines, or the tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies thereof, relliſh to the people of God, or to any rational people?</p>

For this man, again and again, jeers at the Soveraign Powers priviledge and Impunity of divine exemption; (See <hi>Napht.</hi> Pag. 28, 29.) and (reflecting not obſcurely upon the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid murther of our late Soveraign, inſinuated as the <hi>memorable inſtance of the times whereof he now ſpeaks,</hi> no other inſtance being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible

And, P. 151. he allows <hi>any private perſons to ſtep forward, and remove them who abuſe their Authority and occupy their places, and aſſert the intereſts which theſe wicked perſons (Magiſtrates) have ſo traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly forfeited and deſerted.</hi> And when they do ſo, (though but private perſons) he avows, <hi>they are acting in their places and callings, according to the Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moſt of the venome this man hath againſt the Powers ordained of God, he hath ſucked out of the breaſts of <hi>Lex Rex.</hi> It were not right to dig up all the peſtilent untruths of that Piece, ſet forth in moſt impertinent and ſophiſtical reaſonings, mixt with infinite inhumane bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs againſt the late King: only, as it were to be wiſhed, that ſuch errors might be buried in eternal oblivion; So it is to be regrated, that too too many of the Miniſtery and others in <hi>Scotland,</hi> have been poiſoned with ſuch Principles; and the ſame not being very like to be ſuddenly extirpate, the more need have the Powers above us to be watchful.</p>
               <p>To come to the matter then. 1. It would be obſerved, that in all political Societies, there is according to Gods Ordinance, a ſupreme Subject of Majeſty; in all theſe Societies, the chief Power is either ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected in one perſon, or in moe perſons in an united way. The God of order hath, in all humane political Societies, appointed under himſelf a ſupreme Power, whither ſubjected in a ſingle perſon, or in a complex company, which is as one by political union. This ſupreme Power (or they who are veſted with it) orders the whole body, and hath nothing before or above it, in the nature and order of civil Power and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And this firſt and ſupreme Power governs all in the Society, and is governed by none therein. In all order, there is a neceſſity to arrive at ſomething that is firſt, before which, or above which, there is nothing in that order; <hi>In ordine, impoſſibile eſt abire in infinitum.</hi> To ſay that in civil Societies, a perſon is firſt and chief, and hath the Majeſty of the Society reſident in him, and withall, that that ſame perſon hath a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior or equal, is to ſpeak contradictions; for then the Power, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon endowed with power ſhould be both Supreme and not Supreme, in the ſame kind of civil order. Wiſe men have ſaid, that the multitude of gods is the nullity of gods; a multitude of infinites ſo called, makes none of them infinite. The Gentiles, who had many gods, were indeed
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:99891:47"/>
Atheiſts and without God in the World. So a multitude of Supreme Powers in one humane civil Society, deſtroyes the divine order ſet by God himſelf, and allowed by the light of reaſon in humane Societies; a chimaera of idle diſtinctions is whelped by the late maſters of confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>of co-ordinate and collateral Soveraignes in one Kingdom, the fountality of Royalty in the people</hi> (reſumable at their pleaſure) <hi>is talked of, alſo Kings and People, their being mutual Magiſtrates to puniſh one another.</hi> And beſides, <hi>ordinary Courts of Juſtice</hi> (where the Magiſtrate, Gods Sword-bearer bears ſway) <hi>Courts of neceſſity and Tribunals of Nature, where People are Judges, Accuſers, and all,</hi> are bigly talked of, but theſe are only cloaks of fig-leaves to cover horrid Rebellion and Diſorder.</p>
               <p>It is certain ſupreme Power is indiviſible and incommunicable to diſtinct Subjects in any one political Society. There is no political Society, but the Soveraign Power muſt reſt either in one ſingle perſon, who hath no Peer, let be Superior, or in the plurality either of the beſt or chiefeſt, or of the moſt and greateſt number, and which are in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner one by aggregation. And there is no part of the Society or perſons equal to, or above theſe in whom the Supremacy is. In a democratick conſtitution, the ſupreme Majeſty is in the body or plurality of the People, So we often hear in <hi>Tullie</hi> of <hi>majeſtas populi Romani</hi>; In an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtocratick conſtitution, the Majeſty and right of Majeſty is in the body or plurality of the Nobles, or Lords, or <hi>Patritii,</hi> or however they be named in ſeveral ſuch ſtates. And in a Monarchy, the Soveraign Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty is indiviſibly and incommunicably reſident in the perſon of the King, who hath none co-ordinate with him in the politick body, nor ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to him, he is <hi>ſolo Deo minor,</hi> which was the loyal faith of the primitive Chriſtians concerning their Emperors, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells us, and was the antient Language of our Parliaments concerning the King, (as may be ſeen in <hi>regiam majeſt. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 1.) the loyal ſimplicity of the antient Chriſtians, and of our antient forebeers in this Land, would have accounted the diſtinctions of the needle-headed ſeditious which we hear for levelling Royalty, very monſters.</p>
               <p>But why ſhould we doubt, that where there is a King, (one truly ſo) his Soveraignty is matchleſſe on earth, when the Scriptures calls him Supreme? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. Is there any equal to the Supreme in order of civil Government, by whom he is judgeable or puniſhable? if there be any, he is not Supreme, nor the Government Royal, <hi>Monogamy</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitts no Rival, ſo neither doth Monarchy, truly and properly ſo called.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is certain, no man can be judged or puniſhed but by his own
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:99891:48"/>
Judge who is above him, and hath Authority over him by lawful commiſſion from God, or from men authorized by God, to give ſuch commiſſion: Now, who ſhall be judge to the perſon or perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with Soveraign Majeſty, <hi>ſeing every Soul under them, is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be ſubject to them,</hi> Rom. 13.1. <hi>and ſeing the ſupreme Power of the Sword, is committed unto them, and not to others, but by deputation and in dependence upon them</hi>? In an ariſtocratical conſtitution of Government, (as is at <hi>Venice</hi>) who ſhall be judges to the <hi>Patritii</hi> or Senators, if they, or the major part deviate or do wrong? In a democracy, (ſuch as ſometimes was at <hi>Rome, Athens,</hi> and other places) where the people are the ſupreme receptacle of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, or the pluralitie of them, who ſhall judge, them, wen they do wrong, either to particular perſons, or to conſiderable parts of the people; as at <hi>Athens, Socrates</hi> was put to death, for avowing the only true and one God; juſt <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> was billetted into baniſhment, for no cauſe; valiant <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> had that ſame lot, and many moe? and how often in ſuch a conſtitution, hath the corrupt majority or plurality, extreamly wronged conſiderable parts of the people? yet, who had power to puniſh them? who could be Judges between the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſufferers of the wrong? Is there not in both theſe Governments, a neceſſity of impunity and exemption, for theſe inveſted with the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraginty, (as to their ſubjects) unleſſe a door be opened to moſt horrid confuſions and diſſolutions of States? So alſo, in a true Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy, there muſt be an exemption and impunity (as to ſubjects) of the perſon inveſted with Soveraignity and Majeſty: Gods law, natures light and ſound reaſon, are all for this, that the perſon (or perſons) inveſted with ſoveraign Majeſty, having the Legiſlative-power, the Juriſdictional-power, the Coerecive and Punitive-power originally in himſelf; muſt enjoy exemption and impunity, (as to ſubjects actings againſt them.) The contrary tenet overthrows the order of God and nature, and precipitates humane Societies in a gulf of endleſſe confuſions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This hath been the conſtant ſenſe of the generation of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and the antient Chriſtians, and great lights of Gods Church, whom none will call flatterers of Princes, but ſuch as have loſt their fore-heads: <hi>Tertul. apol. contra gentes, imperatores ſunt, in ſolius Dei poteſtate, a quo ſunt ſecundi, poſt quem primi, ante omnes Deos, &amp; ſuper omnes homines</hi>: And a little after, <hi>Majeſtatem Caeſaris ſoli Deo ſubjicio:</hi> So, <hi>ad</hi> Scapulam, <hi>Imperator omnibus major eſt, dum ſolo deo eſt minor</hi>: So, <hi>Optat. contra Parmenian, ſuper imperatorem,

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> (the occaſion of that <hi>Pſalm</hi>) and of the ſcandal he had given to Gods people, in which ſenſe, he might be well ſaid to ſin againſt both: But in this word, <hi>againſt thee, thee only have I ſinned</hi>; As he minds to acknowledge, that God onely was conſcious to his ſin in committing it: So alſo, he ſhews, that this above all touched his conſcience, that he had vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Gods Law; and ſhews, that he is touched with his terrors, as his only Judge, though (as <hi>Diodat</hi> on the place ſayes well) <hi>as he was a King, he was exempted from the puniſhment of man, and not obnoxious to humane Tribunals</hi>: And excellent Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> in that 20. Ch. of the 4. Book of his inſtitut. <hi>S.</hi> 2 7. <hi>Aſſumptum in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giam Majeſtatem, violare nefas eſt, nunquam nobis ſeditioſae iſtae cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationes in mentem veniant, tractandum eſſe pro meritis Regem.</hi> S. 29, <hi>Perſonam ſuſtinent voluntate Domini, cui inviolabilem Majeſtatem ipſe impreſſit &amp; inſculpſit.</hi> And if Princes be tyrannous, <hi>noſtrum non eſt hujuſmodi malis mederi,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo, S. 31. fully to our purpoſe, it is a wonder how many who pretend reſpect to <hi>Calvin,</hi> (as he is indeed moſt worthy of reſpect) ſhould dare to violate the Sacroſanct Maieſty of Kings, if they will but read over that Chapter, wherein he ſpeaks moſt notably againſt the ſeditious Doctrines of our times, as if he had been living in them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is not denyed, that the King is bound before God, to rule his people according to the Law of God, of reaſon and nature; yea, and to take his direction in Government, from the rational Laws of the Kingdom, (which are deductions from, or determinations of, the Law of God, reaſon and nature, to particular circumſtances) agreed to, by the conſent and with the good liking of his people. It is too groſſe a ſaying, <hi>Regi quicquid libet, licet</hi>; a good King will turn the word, and ſay, <hi>Regi quod licet</hi> (ſuppoſing it expedient) <hi>libet,</hi> he will make uſe of good Laws, as his inſtruments, in governing the people, and account it his honour and a thing greatly becoming his Majeſty, to do
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99891:49"/>
nothing contrary to Law, in the ordinary courſe of his Government, and not at all ſtray there-from, but when great reaſon urges an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table interpretation of the Law, and reſpect to the end and aim of it, when preciſe cleaving to the rigidity of the letter thereof, might make <hi>ſummum jus, ſumma injuria</hi>: It is a royal thing for a King, to live by the ſame good Laws which are given by him to the people; and it is of efficicious influence upon them, to move them to walk in their duties orderly; <hi>Rex tenetur ſervare Leges, ſi non ut Leges, tamen ut rationes.</hi> But, if the ſupreme Power ſhould deviat, we maintain that as a ſure truth, which this man proudly and traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly jeers at; That impunity (as from Subjects) neceſſarily attends Soveraignity and ſupreme Majeſty; which hath this inſeparable pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of exemption from violence by Subjects, by the Law of God, Reaſon and Nature, whatever ſort the Government be, Monarchical or Polyarchical: For, no man can be judged or puniſhed, but by a Judge above him, and the Supreme hath none ſuch, otherwiſe he were not Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme. To teach contrary to this, is but to confound Gods Order, and diſſipate humane Societies, by continual rebellions.</p>
               <p>Yet, this inviolableneſs of the ſacred perſons of Kings, and ſupreme <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ſixth Chapter of the Book of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> (though it be Apocrypha) is well worthy to be read by Kings and Potentates, and to be trembled at; for the matter is very agreeable to Gods Word. The heavieſt vengeances that are recorded in Hiſtory, ſacred and profane, have come upon flagitious and tyrannous Kings: their exemption from mens hands reſerves them to fall into the hands of the living God, which is a fearful thing; who (beſides the wrath that is to come) ſometimes calls for forreign ſcourges upon them; ſometimes ſuffers an evil ſpirit of rebellion to go out amongſt their own Subjects, who though they do wickedly, in ſtretching forth their hands againſt the ſacred head of the Lords Anointed, yet it is ordinary for the great God, to do the work of his holy Juſtice by wicked hands, and when men are ſerving their own luſts, and croſſing his revealed will, (for which vengeance attends them) yet they may be in theſe actions ſerving his Providence, and his Juſtice againſt wicked Powers,

               <p>But, the Libeller will have the memorable inſtance of the times, whereof he now ſpeaks, (<hi>Naph.</hi> P. 30.) <hi>of caſting away the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes, and breaking the Scepters of Kings,</hi> to be remembred; and ſayes, <hi>ſuch a thing had the approbation of divine Providence, of his Word, and of his People animated thereto by himſelf.</hi> Albeit his ſpeech be ſubdolous and double-faced, leaving it doubtful of what times he ſpeaks, wherein this memorable inſtance of murthering Kings and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throning them is to be found, (at the time of Reformation, whereat he ſeems to hint, no ſuch thing was there) yet, it is too palpable he points at the horrid inſtance of the murther committed upon the ſacred Perſon of our late King, by the vile and deſperate Sectaries, (<hi>the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of the times we now ſpeak of, is worthily recorded</hi>) another inſtance, in the times of firſt Reformation, of ſuch murther, we know not. But, it is moſt falſly and wickedly ſaid, (whether that particular be meant or not) that Gods Providence or Gods Word ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves the murthering or depoſing of Princes; or that he thereunto animates his people. Gods Word never warranded any Subjects to take the Sword to deſtroy their Soveraigns, or to adjudge them to death under any pretence, (they not being their Judges above them, but under them) and what Gods Word approves not, his Providence doth not approve, (although he may, and doth in his holy Providence, permit many things to be, which he approves not in his Word, which is our rule, and not his Providence.) And to ſay, God animates his people to ſuch horrid actions, is blaſphemy, making God the author of ſin: he animates none to any thing that is againſt his Word (the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary rule of our walking) albeit extraordinarily he may ſtir up the ſpirits of ſome to actions, not according to the ordinary rule (as in the times of the Judges) but they were ſure of their warrand from him, the like whereof none have ground to wait for now. But, God ſave the King from ſuch people ſo animated, (as this man would have them) he may call them the people of God, that carry ſuch murthering-hearts towards Princes; but it is to be feared, God will ſay to them, <hi>Depart from me, I know you not.</hi>

               <p>One of <hi>Naphtali</hi>'s commended Pſeudomartyrs, the <hi>Apology,</hi> labours to produce many inſtances of the Parliaments of <hi>Scotland,</hi> puniſhing Princes for their enormities; all which he ſets forth as laudable and imitable preſidents and examples: Yet, the moſt that all of them

amounts to, is nothing but the inſurrection of Nobles (<hi>Proceres,</hi> as <hi>Buchannan</hi> calls them) againſt the Kings, and violent oppreſſions of ſuch of them as have been flagitious and tyrannous, (ſuch were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of them, as it happens every where, and was ſo in <hi>Judah,</hi> where were more evil Kings then good, by far.) But neither <hi>Buchannan</hi> nor this <hi>Apolog.</hi> can produce any one inſtance of our lawful Parliaments or Peoples taking on them, in a judicial way, in cold blood, and under forms of proceſs, to puniſh or deſtroy their Kings, howſoever evil. Whatever inſurrections have been wherein Kings have periſhed, and not a few people alſo, (as oft-times the cure of Tyranny is worſe to the people, then Tyranny it ſelf, <hi>Minori cum periculo tyrannus tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur quam ejicitur</hi>) yet God hath, ſince the foundation of our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to this day, preſerved our Parliaments and People from ſuch a way againſt their Kings, even when they were under Paganiſme (for ſome ages) even when Popery did over-grow the Land, choaking and darken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the light of the Goſpel, after it was come amongſt us; and when the Land was in many ages under much barbarity, it never came in the hearts of Parliaments or People, to ſit as Judges on their Soveraigns in cold blood, and adviſedly with forms of Proceſs, to attempt their deſtruction, (however evil they were.) The more ſhame do they caſt upon theſe, who in the fair day-light of the Goſpel, endeavour to poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſouls with ſuch a Doctrine of devils; or who inſtigate to, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of ſuch wayes againſt the Powers ordained by God.</p>

What ſhould he mean to make it conducible to the Peace of the Common-wealth, that the King be free of the coaction of Law, and yet not ſo, if it be made a matter of Conſcience? Is the preſervation of the Peace of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, no matter of Conſcience to him? or, Is not the conſtitution, freeing the King from coaction of Law (for that end) warrandable? 2. It is good that this Metaphyſical Statiſt, was no chief Prieſt or Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite, or ſuch a member of the Sanhedrim in <hi>Davids</hi> time, for he would certainly have afforded a corrupt expoſition of the Law, in reference to the King, that he might be cut off; What ſots, or cold-rife ſenſeleſſe men were the Prieſts and the Prophets of that time, who did not inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the Sanhedrim, to execute the moral Law on <hi>David,</hi> that wrath might be turned away from the Land? this man could (in his ſublime ſpeculations) have inſtructed the Sanhedrim better in their duty, and could have told them, that albeit <hi>David</hi> was not bound to draw his Sword againſt himſelf, yet the Judges under him ſhould not accept his perſon, becauſe he was a great man; he could have told them the Sanhedrim is above the King, to puniſh him as well as another man for his ſin, and in point of Conſcience, and by Gods Law, they were bound to do it. 3.

The ſubject is, (<hi>he that ſheds mans blood</hi>) which is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of every one that ſheds mans blood, but only of ſuch as have no authority, and do it out of private revenge (for we muſt not own the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99891:51"/>
fancies of Photinians and Anabaptiſts, that condemn lawful wars, or capital puniſhments by the hand or Authority of Magiſtrates, albeit they argue from this place.) Again, the attribute, or that which is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed or commanded, concerning the ſhedder of mans blood (<hi>by man ſhall his blood be ſhed</hi>) is to be conſider'd. Certainly, taking the words as a Precept, it is not meant, that it is the duty of every man, or any man indifferently, to ſhed the blood of the perſon, who ſheds innocent blood; but the man who is to ſhed the Blood of that perſon, is the Magiſtrate, who is his Judge above him. All interpreters are agreed, that here is (if not the inſtitution, yet) the approbation of the office of the civil Magiſtrate, and his capital puniſhing of murtherers. <hi>Pareus</hi> ſaith, <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur hic lex civilis, ut homicidae plectantur capitaliter per hominem, non quemvis, ſed gladio divinitus armatum</hi>; h. e. <hi>per Magiſtratum.</hi> Peter Martyr, <hi>loci com. p.</hi> 634. <hi>non temere nec per quemvis eſt effun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

R.</hi> p. 389. when he hath given all power to the Parliament over the King, he objects to himſelf, <hi>who ſhall puniſh and coerce the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in caſe of exorbitance</hi>? he anſwers, <hi>poſterior Parliaments, and p.</hi> 211. he ſayeth, <hi>by the people and conſcience of the people, are they to be judged,</hi> (let all our Nobles and Parliaments hearken to this.) Now, who ever heard of this, that one Parliament poſterior, ſhould puniſh the prior? Their acts they may retract indeed, but to puniſh them for their acts, it is moſt abſurd; becauſe, the prior Parliament, in the capacity of that Judicatory, had as much power as the poſterior; States-men will wonder at ſuch Doctrine, that members of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be puniſhed for their free votes, by a ſucceeding Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and far more at the ſubjecting them to the conſcience of the people, (as he ſpeakes.) But then another objection he makes, <hi>poſterior Parliaments, and people both may erre</hi>; he anſwers, <hi>all that is true, God only muſt remeed that</hi>: Well then, if Parliament or people, deſtroy and murther perſons innocently, God only muſt remeed that, there is no Power on earth to call them to an account.

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:99891:52"/>
that at laſt this Author is driven to acknowledge a Power (which if it deviate) cannot be judged by any on earth, and there is no remedy but in God, againſt its unjuſt violence? although he will not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this Power to be in the King; yet, in the people, as contradiſtinct from Parliaments, he acknowledges it; whereby alſo, it may be ſeen, that his Principles lead him to own a meer democracy, (which is the worſt of Governments) as the only lawful Government; he placeth and fixeth the unpun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the great ſtreſſe of the buſineſs, is ſtill laid upon theſe Covenants, tacite and virtual, or expreſſe; and, it is pleaded, the people or any part of the people, have by that Covenant, a joynt obligation with the King and all Magiſtrates, lying upon them, to uſe a vindicative and reforming Power, in caſe of defection in Religion; yea, even againſt all back-ſlidden Rulers and the plurality of an apoſtate Nation.</p>
               <p>There is a two-fold Covenant they talk of, as the foundation of all humane Societies, 1. the religious joynt Covenant between the King or Soveraign and people with God. 2. The civil Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the King and the people. Concerning the former, it is <hi>Naph.</hi> mind, p. 18. <hi>That albeit the care of Religion toward God, in a vindicative and puniſhing way, and reforming it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>lyeth upon the King or Magiſtrates mainly,</hi> (he ſhould have ſaid <hi>onely,</hi> for none can produce a commiſſion, but the Powers ordained of God, for uſing the vindicative, punitive and reforming Sword, about which the queſtion is now but only the Magiſtrate) <hi>Yet, there is a joynt obligation lying upon the people, and every party thereof, to vindicate and reform Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in a publick punitive way, even againſt all Magiſtrates and Nobles, (if they be the principal perverters and patrons of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, and againſt the plurality of the people; for,</hi> ſayes he, 18. p. <hi>Idolatry, perjury,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ought by all meanes</hi> (n. b.) <hi>to be ſuppreſſed, reſtrained and ſeverly puniſhed</hi>: So that if any part of the people, do think the Magiſtrates, (all of them) or the plurality of the people, Patrons of abominations, (as in the preſent caſe he challenges them to be) any private party that think they have power enough, may ſlee to the vindicative, puniſhing and reforming Sword; and fall upon all Rulers and others, whom they think to be in a defection, and will boldly ſay, that in truth they are ſo.</p>
               <p>This is the mans fine Doctrine: he conceals not his own intentions and his parties, upon the account of the Apoſtaſie which they now fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, to fall with bloody cruelty on all Magiſtrates and people too, who ſtand in their way: he ſhews his bloody teeth, but God will knock out the teeth of this ſanguinary Faction, as he hath done. Yea, <hi>Naph.</hi>

                  </gap>gion and Gods Worſhip, as the main ends, <hi>P.</hi> 16. he aſſerts, <hi>The ceſſation of the obligation to the Government, when there is a perverſion in that great deſign of it, and a returning of people to their primaeve liberty</hi> (as he often ſpeaks) <hi>to erect Governments to their mind, and to combine with whom they will,</hi> (as before we heard.)</p>
               <p>Concerning theſe things, we ſay, 1. That albeit it be Gods holy will, that in erections of Civil Government, his Truth, ſincere Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Glory in theſe, ſhould be mainly minded and intended by men, and it is mens duty ſo to do: yet, it is clear, that in many places <hi>de facto</hi> it is not ſo; although men profeſs in the general, aiming at Truth and right Worſhip, yet there are aberrations in the particular. 2. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit there be, in the point of Truth and the Worſhip of God, (which <hi>de jure</hi> ſhould be principally cared for in Government) a notable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and ſwerving; that doth not at all invalidate the Authority or Government, nor break the obligation thereunto, although it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to favourers of Truth and right Worſhip: For, God ſo far regards the keeping of humane Societies in tolerable order, that albeit the great duties of advancement of his Truth and Worſhip be not minded by Rulers; yet, he will not have the Common-wealths, where juſtice between man and man is maintained for his Glory, (although Religion not minded as it ought to be) caſten looſe; nor will have men think themſelves looſed from obligation to the Government, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit there be perverſion in the managing thereof, as to Religion: for, neither muſt they be heard, who hold, That civil Dominion is grounded on Grace; nor they who ſay, That infidel, heretical or excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Magiſtrates fall from their power, or that the Subjects obligation to them ceaſeth. 3. It ſhall be eaſily granted, that the people, and every one of the people, ought to reform themſelves from all real corruptions in the Worſhip of God, and keep themſelves pure from abominable things, every one is bound to amend one, and ſo all will be more eaſily amended: yea, no man ſhould ſay, <hi>Am I my Brothers keeper,</hi> but by faithful inſtruction, warning, reproof, ſtrive to ſave others from the evils of the times and places wherein they live. But, 4. That there lyes upon the people, with the Magiſtrate, a joynt obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of publick reforming, and uſing the avenging or punitive Sword in amending things amiſs againſt the will of all Magiſtrates, or even turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Sword in a violent way againſt him; or that ſuch obligation lyes upon one part of the people, againſt all Magiſtrates and their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Subjects, as to violent them in matters of Religion (or which they
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:99891:53"/>
account Religion) it is utterly denyed, acting in a publick co-active way, or by the uſe of the vindicative and punitive Sword. For, Reformation in a co-active way is ſo fully and only the Magiſtrates duty, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will intrude into it (being perſons of meer private capacity) they ſtain Religion, and brings ſcandal on it by their Rebellion. Though the reſult of the work be good, the manner is evil; God needs no mans ſin to help him in his work; nor will he ever impute it as ſin to private perſons, that they did tolerate (with grief) what they could not amend, nor that they did forbear violent forcing the Magiſtrate to their mind (ſuppoſing them in the right.) If in a way God hath ſet me in, I cannot without manifeſt ſchiſme and ſedition, and leaping beyond the limits of my calling, do a good work, I am to leave it to God to do it in his own cleanly way; it is well if I keep my ſelf pure, mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for abominations done, and praying to God againſt them, and uſing all charitable and fraternal means becoming a private Chriſtian; and thus my tolerating of what I cannot amend, ſhall not be my ſin, albeit it is ſin in them who have a publick Power, and do not reform, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive at abuſes. As no part of a people or private perſons, have power to uſurp the Office of a Miniſter, to preach, miniſter Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So, no private perſons can lawfully, under whatſoever pretence of good intentions, meddle with the Magiſtrates work, or intrude in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick actings only competent to his place who is the Miniſter of God, inveſted with Authority by him. Far leſs can they, in caſe of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency or oppoſition, uſe the vindicative or puniſhing Sword againſt him, for not being of their Religion (ſuppoſing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t to be true) nor againſt their fellow-ſubjects: but all this is according to this mans mind.</p>
               <p>The great miſtake in all this matter, is, that the Magiſtrate and People are, as to Covenant with God, or engagements to him for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing his Truth, looked upon as two debitors bound in a Band, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctly and ſeverally, for one ſum; ſo that in the deficiency of the one, the other muſt pay all, and hath power to ſtreſſe the deficient: So they think, there is a joynt and equal obligation betwixt Princes and People, as touching the publick promoting of Religion. If the Magiſtrate be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, they muſt do it, yea and fall on him for his deficiency. But there is no ſuch joynt obligation: it is true, the Magiſtrate in his place is bound in a publick way to advance Religion; the people are alſo bound in their private capacities and callings, to advance Religion, and to ſerve the Magiſtrate therein, as he employes and calls them. But there is no ſuch joynt obligation of King and People unto God, that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:99891:54"/>
either of them ſhould be ſo bound for the other, that if the one be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, the other party contracting becomes therefore obliged to the duty to which the deficient party is obliged, or becomes guilty, if he intrude not in the part of their duty. Nor is there a mutual tye on both to force one another to their duty. <hi>Qui diverſimode obligantur ad diverſa non ſunt correi in promittendo.</hi> The caſe betwixt the King and People in the religious Covenant with God, is like the caſe of two men binding in one band for their ſeveral moieties of a ſum; if the one be deficient, the other is not ſtreſſed for it, nor is the payer bound to force the deficient by vertue of the band. If the People reform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and keep themſelves pure from abominations, the Magiſtrates deficiency (which they tolerate with grief) ſhall not be imputed to them, becauſe God gives them not a calling to intrude into the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates office, or to uſe the reforming Sword, or vindicative and puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acts of it (which only are committed to the Magiſtrate.) The King indeed is bound, both as a Chriſtian, to own Religion for his own ſouls good, and as a King, to uſe his magiſtratical Power to force his Subjects to the uſe of external means of Religion (which is all he can do) and if he do this, and meet with the inſuperable ſtubborneſſe of an evil people, the guiltineſſe lyes not on him, but on them. But upon the people, there lyes no obligation to force the King, or their fellow ſubjects to external means of Worſhip and Religion, becauſe that is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the verge of their calling, only they are to keep themſelves pure, and to uſe all moral means uſable by perſons in their ſtation, to move others to embrace true Religion. And having done this, they diſcharge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſufficiently, and may commit the reſt to God. The late Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant it ſelf doth only bind <hi>private perſons in their places and callings</hi> (which certainly are private, and to be managed by private means) to endeavour reformation, and doth not bind any number of meer pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons, to pull the Sword out of the Magiſtrates hands, when they think he uſeth it otherwiſe then he ſhould, and then they would have him uſe it. It is not, can never be the place and calling of meer pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons, and the minor or far minor part of the People, to uſe the vindicative, puniſhing and reforming Sword againſt all Magiſtrates (reckoned by them as Apoſtates) and againſt all the body of the Land. If the Covenant be paſſive of ſuch Commentaries as this man puts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, that whatever any private party accounts Reformation, they may uſe the vindictive puniſhing Sword againſt all of all degrees that ſtand in their way to advance the ſame, we have little reaſon to be in love with it; and juſt cauſe to caſt it by, till it be cleared of ſuch cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt gloſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Yea, <hi>Naph.</hi> will have it to be a ſufficient ground, not only for the Proceres or Body of the people, to proceed vindicatively againſt the King, but (in application to the Rebellion, he intends to juſtifie) for any private perſons whatſoever, if they be in probable capacity to do miſchief, without drawing miſchief upon themſelves; and ſo out-ſtripes his maſter, (who gives not much to any private perſons upon this account, but to the States of the Land and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Magiſtrates with the Body of the people.)</p>
               <p>But as to the Covenant betwixt King and People, both <hi>L. R.</hi> and <hi>Naph.</hi> urge it as the ground for not only reſiſting, but puniſhing Kings and all Magiſtrates, (when they account them Tyrants.) and will have a tacite virtual Covenant as valid for their ends, as where it is expreſs; avowing it to be eſſentially fundamental in the conſtitution of all poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Societies. This brings to mind the folly of the man, that would have all to be tyed in a Band that he had made, aſwell theſe who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed not, as theſe who ſubſcribed it. But to be ſerious, as to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:99891:55"/>
we ſay, 1. it is eaſily conceded, that there is a mutual obligation betwixt Magiſtrates and Subjects to mutual duties, which is indeed eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to the conſtitution of the politick Body; but this obligation ariſes not from any tacite or expreſs Covenant betwixt them, but from the Ordinance and Will of God, enjoining them theſe duties in ſuch relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in that Society wherein they are combined. 2. That obligation, though it be mutual in the relations they are in; yet, it is not conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: there is a mutual obligation to mutual duties betwixt Parents and Children, but it is not conditional; nor is there ſuch a Contract or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that if Parents be undutiful, Children ſhould be looſed from their duty, or upon the contrary: but Children are bound to be ſubject to their Parents, without any condition or p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So alſo, peoples obedience to Kings (properly and truly ſo called) is not conditional, (<hi>ſi meruerint</hi>) nor is the duty of the King to them conditional, (<hi>ſi meruerint</hi>) but each of them is abſolutely bound to do duty in their own relations, wherein they are one to another, the obligation is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, (<hi>ſalva Deo obedientia.</hi>) Reverend Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpeaks home to this purpoſe, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>inſt. cap.</hi> 20.

The fancy of a tacite, virtual, natural Covenant, betwixt King and People, (as they uſe to call it) equivalent to all ends that an explicite and expreſs Covenant can have;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:99891:55"/>
overthrows the diſtinction that all ſound Proteſtant Divines and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lititians make, betwixt <hi>a limited or pactional Prince,</hi> and <hi>an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Prince,</hi> or one who is <hi>integrae Majeſtatis,</hi> who takes not his Kingdom upon conditions preſcribed to him, ſo as in caſe of failing he be ſubject to their cenſure or puniſhment; <hi>Eſt alius principatus abſolutus,</hi> ſaith <hi>Rivet.

But, as to an abſolute Prince, albeit this Statiſt ſayes, he is contrary to the word of God, it is moſt untrue. For, as our Laws (which this man cares not to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict) allows our Kings to be abſolute in expreſs termes, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. <hi>Par.</hi> 18. <hi>an<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

So the Scripture is not againſt an abſolute Prince, as our Laws and we underſtand him, (<hi>qui non ſumit aut ponit ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, arbitrio popularis aurae</hi>) no King is ſo abſolute to rule as he liſts, (we abhor <hi>quicquid libet licet</hi>) he is ſubordinate unto God and his Will; and he ought alſo to walk according to the particular good Laws he hath made with conſent of his people; <hi>Digna vox eſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtate regnantis ſe alligatum legibus principem fateri</hi>; and we doubt not our King doth, and will do ſo: but he is ſo abſolute, that if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate (which God avert) he is not under co-active power of Subjects, that they ſhould have Law-claim againſt him, and in their Courts of Nature and Neceſſity (as this man loves to ſpeak) pronounce judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon him to deſtroy him. A Crown was never given him, never accepted by him, on ſuch horrid termes; far leſs, that by virtue of this ſuppoſed tacite Covenant, any minor meer private party of the people might, without and againſt the great body, have liberty to pull, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the King, but all Magiſtrates out of their ſeat, puniſhing them, and

There are ſeveral wayes of conveighances of Kingdoms: Where there is freedom of election of the particular perſon to reign, there may poſſibly be expreſſe limiting conditions, allowing a reſerve of Power to ſome not meer ſubjects, to coerce and reduce in order diviating So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty: As in the Empire of <hi>Germany</hi> and Kingdom of <hi>Poland,</hi> (or if there be any like) whoſe Kings are not, <hi>veri nominis Reges,</hi> but perſonated Kings and Monarchs, (as a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inted man is not a man) there is ſome likeneſs to a Kingſhip and Monarchy, and ſome power over others, given for executing the Laws: But the Supreme Majeſty, doth not wholly reſide in theſe, more then in the mock Kings of <hi>Sparta,</hi> when they were under the tutory of the <hi>Ephori</hi>: But in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighances of many Kingdoms, and all (properly called Monarchies) there is neither tacit nor expreſſed Covenants, impowering others to be Judges over the King, which is the deſign theſe Covenants are plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for; how many Kingdoms are, and have been attained to by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt in a juſt War? (which is a ſufficient title, and no the right of robbers, as ſome call it) albeit there be direct oppoſition, ſo long as there is power, and a tacit diſſent, (when their power is gone) yet, the conqueſt coming by a lawful and well grounded War; the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and the authority, even over the unwilling and repining ſubjects is lawful, though it may be made ſurer, by their after conſent to ſubmit. And if this purchaſed power be hereditarily tranſmitted, the ſucceſſors receives power from their Parents, not from the people; nor is there any ſhaddow of tacit or expreſs Covenant in this matter; <hi>if ye Rule well, we ſhall obey you; otherwiſe, not.</hi> 5. If we look to our own Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> from the beginning, there will be found no ſuch Covenant, on which the conſtitution of the ſame is founded: There are four or five remarkable inſtances concerning this Kingdom, to clear the matter. 1. Look to the foundation thereof in <hi>Fergus</hi> the firſt, 330. yeares before Chriſts birth; <hi>Buchannan</hi> himſelf cannot ſay, that he is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted King upon conditions: the ſubjects indeed by their oath, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the Kingdom to him and his poſterity; but no oath was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him, nor of any of his ſucceſſors, till King <hi>James</hi> the ſixth his time, (of which we ſhall anon hear.) Of this <hi>Fergus,</hi> the black Book of <hi>Paſley</hi> (as I have heard from credible Reporters) ſaith, <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſius ſe Regem fecit.</hi> 2. <hi>Fergus</hi> the ſecond, the 40. King, the great reſtorer of our Nation, who began to Reign, <hi>Anno. Chr.</hi> 404. did by his valour, (under the conduct of divine Providence, and by the help
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99891:56"/>
of Strangers, <hi>Danes</hi> and others, with ſome ſmall remainder of Scots, recover the Kingdom, after that the whole Nation was baniſhed, and no Scotſ-man might abide in <hi>Scotland</hi> under pain of death; he was not beholden to the people for the Kingdom, nor had it by paction with them. 3. <hi>Kenneth</hi> the firſt, the 50. King, <hi>Anno Chr.</hi> 605. who deſtroyed the Picts, and enlarged his Kingdom, by the acceſſion of theirs, purchaſing more and better Lands then he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which he diſtributed to his ſubjects; he held not this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed Kingdom of them, by contract or paction to be ſubject to them, on whom, he beſtowed the Lands thereof. The 4. is <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> the 97. King, <hi>Anno Chr.</hi> 1036. Whom our Lawes of <hi>Regiam Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatem,</hi> &amp;c. calls, <hi>Conqueſtor magnus</hi>: he re-conquered the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, when it was almoſt wholly alienated and ſubdued by the Engliſh, and but little reſerved. The Engliſh held it for many years: And the Nobility of <hi>Scotland</hi> firſt at <hi>Barwick,</hi> then at <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> in plain Parliament, ſwore homage and obedience to the King of <hi>England</hi>; Yet, that Prince having a proſperous gale of divine Providence aſſiſting his Valour, recovered the Nation out of bondage: And who will aſſert, there were pactions between him and the people, to bring him under their coactive judicial Power? A fifth inſtance there is, right memorable in our own times; It is known, our Nation was totally ſubdued by the Engliſh, and continued ſo, for the ſpace of ten years: The repreſentatives of Shires and Cities and Towns, combined into a Common-wealth-government, and ſent their Commiſſioners to the meeting thereof at <hi>London,</hi> where the Kings intereſt was diſclaimed; yet in a wonderful way, God brought him in again, and finding us at his coming a fully conquered and ſubdued Nation, reſtored us to our freedom from the bondage of Forraigners. If any will ſay, that it was upon his account, the Nation was brought to the ſuffering of that bondage, and that there did ly bands upon him as our ſworn King, to free us when he ſhould be in capacity to do it; It may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, 1. It is known, that when the fatal ſtroke that ſunk us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bondage was given, there was an expreſs diſowning of his right, by publick Judicatories of the Land, in the quarrel with the Engliſh Sectaries before <hi>Dumbar.</hi> 2. Whatever engagements were upon him for the good of the Nation; Yet, if theſe mens principles were to be followed, they could had no force on him, to move him to labour our vindication into liberty; for, do not they teach, that in the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Contract and Covenant betwixt King and People, the People are looſed from their duty, if the King fail in his, <hi>frangenti fidem, fides
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:99891:57"/>
frangatur eidem</hi>; And why then is not the King looſed, if the people fail on their part? It is known, that (although the Nobles, and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the People were well enough affected to the King, and cordially loved him, when they were overpowered and could do nothing) yet by their repreſentatives he was diſowned (which in Law would be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their own deed.) And if a ſworn people, deſert and diſclaim their King by their repreſentatives, may not the King alſo have the benefite of the conditional Covenant, and leave them as he found them, in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to forreigners. But ſuch was his Majeſties Graciouſneſs and Wiſdom, as well as Conſcience of duty, that although the Nation had failed much to him, he would not walk after the counſels of theſe men. And we may, (all things conſider'd) aſſert, that the people of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> do rather owe their liberty to him, then he doth owe his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to them, or by vertue of any Covenant with them.</p>
               <p>But not to dwell too much on this, as to any expreſſe Covenant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtating the People, or any part thereof in a coactive judicial Power over our Princes, to puniſh them in caſe of aberrations in Government; from the foundation of our Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> there is no ſuch thing to be found: <hi>Buchannan</hi> himſelf can never ſhow, that before King <hi>James</hi> the ſixth his time, any of our Kings at their inſtalling did ſwear to, or covenant with the people, (albeit the people have ſworn homage to them) none of them all before that time did ſwear covenant-wiſe at their reception of the Crown, nor can it be evidenced, that Loyalty was engaged to the King, <hi>if they thought he ruled well and no otherwiſe.</hi> Some of our Hiſtorians cited by <hi>Blackwood,</hi> make mention of one of our Kings, <hi>Gregory the Great,</hi> who did reign <hi>Anno Chr.</hi> 876. who when he was crown'd, did (in his piety) ſwear to defend the liberties of Chriſtian Religion, of the Church, of all the Prieſts and Miniſters of Religion; and ordained, that all his Succeſſors, Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſhould ſwear that oath at their entry to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Yet this is not mentioned by <hi>Buchannan,</hi> leaſt perhaps our Kings might think, obligations do lye on them by that Law, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Popery, far advanced in <hi>Gregories</hi> time. But no other oath is mentioned, till <hi>James</hi> the ſixth his time; when he was in the craddle, his Regent <hi>Murray</hi> fram'd an oath to be ſworn by him, and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, recorded Parliament 1. King <hi>James</hi> the 6. but that oath never any did ſwear for him, (albeit at his Coronation in the moneth of <hi>July,</hi> before that Act, which was not made till the 15. of <hi>Decemb.</hi> after, <hi>Anno</hi> 1567. the Earles of <hi>Mortoun</hi> and <hi>Hume,</hi> did promiſe ſome ſuch thing for the King, as <hi>Buchannan</hi> ſayes) nor did he himſelf ever
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99891:57"/>
ſwear it, when he came to be Major and from under the Tutory of Regents. When he entred actually to reign, and accepted the Regiment in his own perſon, <hi>Anno</hi> 1577. being of the age of twelve years, no man durſt ever offer that oath to him, nor when he came to be of full and perfect age. Not, but that it is in it ſelf (and rightly underſtood) a good and godly oath, but in regard of the evil Principles, with which ſome Subjects were in that time poiſoned, as if ſuch an Oath and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant gave a coactive right and power to Subjects over their Prince, in all their apprehenſions of his failing (as now we are taught by men of the ſeditious ſtamp) it was thought fit to wave the putting ſuch an oath unto him at his entry to the actual Government (he not having taken it before) that the fancy of ſuch a coactive Covenant, which might breed evil humours in the Subjects, might be removed. Whither King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt did ſwear that ſame oath, recorded in the firſt Parliament of King <hi>James</hi> the ſixth, we cannot certainly ſay (there is nothing left upon publick record of that matter at his Coronation) but if he did ſo, he was the firſt King of this Nation, that received the Crown in way of Covenant with the people, or ſwearing to them yet had he reigned eight years over us before that time; and no man durſt, or in reaſon could ſay, as now is printed, that he was no King till he took the Coronation oath. How this came to paſſe we know not, but it is to be believed on good ground, could that King once have thought, that his taking of that oath (although it be in it ſelf godly and good) ſhould have been ſo far miſtaken by his Subjects, as that he ſhould have been thought thereby to have ſubmitted himſelf to their coactive and punitive power in every caſe, wherein they, or any party of them (being meer private perſons) might think him deficient, he would rather have endured any death, then ſo to caſt himſelf away, at the pleaſure of malecontented parties amongſt the people, taking advantage againſt him by that oath. But it ſhall be avowed, that that King of glorious memory, did never ſhrink from the obſervance of that godly oath, whatever the malice of his clamorous and embitter'd enemies repreſents to the contrary. Neither hath his Majeſty that now reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſwerved from the obſervation of that oath hitherto, and we are hopeful, Gods grace ſhall preſerve him hereafter from any ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>But the matter concerning this civil Covenant, is not yet at an end; for, the Author of <hi>L. R.</hi> bends his wit to wreſt the holy Scriptures to make this Covenant neceſſary, (yea, for ſuch ends as he deſigns, <hi>viz. the coaction and puniſhing of the Prince</hi>) and backs his wreſted Scriptures with ſome ſophiſtical reaſonings. Did we indeed find ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99891:58"/>
ground for ſuch a Covenant, or for ſuch ends in holy Scriptures, we ſhould ſtrike ſail, and no wait for ragged reaſonings to caſt duſt in our eyes. But when we look to Gods directions, about ſetting up of Kings amongſt his people, and upon the doing of the thing ſuitably to theſe directions: We profeſſe in ſincerity, that we find nothing, but that it was Gods mind, that both King and People ſhould do their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual duties (the one to the other) but that there is any ſuch Covenant impowering people to uſe force upon the King, to throw him down, puniſh or deſtroy him, when they or any particular party of meer pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons apprehend the ends of Government to be perverted. There is no mention of any ſuch Covenant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. where the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſetting a King over them is preſcribed; there is no ſuch thing done, when <hi>Samuel</hi> by Gods appointment, anoints and ſets a King over the people: nor is there any ſuch thing found at the entry of any of the Kings of Gods people to their Government: only there are two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances (upon ſpecial and extraordinary occaſions) of ſuch Covenants betwixt the King and People, the import of neither of which, is to ſtate the people in coactive judicial Power over theſe Kings, and which cannot by any Logick be drawn to be Patterns of neceſſary doing ſuch a thing in all Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>The firſt inſtance is of <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.3. 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 11.3. where (though he had reigned ſeven years and a half in <hi>Hebron,</hi> over the men of <hi>Judah,</hi> without any ſuch Covenant, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.4.) <hi>Iſrael</hi> and the reſt of the Tribes, having all that time reſiſted <hi>David</hi> and cleaved to <hi>Iſhboſheth, Saul</hi>'s Son, as their King, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.10. The King being killed, and <hi>Abner</hi> the General, they come to a ſubmiſſion to <hi>David</hi>; and he being willing to entertain them, enters in covenant with them, in a piece of holy policy meet for that time, to gather together the ſcattered people of God, who might be tempted otherwiſe to other courſes; they were now coming to be his Subjects, who were not ſo before, but were under another King; and fit it was to give them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, touching his good mind toward them, they having ſo long ſtood it out in arms againſt him. But the queſtion is, what was the nature, the matter and import of that Covenant: The Scripture ſayes not, it was ſuch a Covenant, (as theſe men would have) <hi>I ſhall rule you right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if you obey me dutifully, otherwiſe not, (upon the Kings part) And upon the peoples part, We ſhall obey you and be ſubject to you, if ye rule us rightly; otherwiſe, we will not, but uſe our co-active power upon you, to dethrone and deſtroy you and puniſh you.</hi> That there was any ſuch conditional Covenant expreſſed or meant, is far from the truth:
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:99891:58"/>
                  <hi>David</hi> neither minds to admit them to be his Subjects conditionally, or to ſubject himſelf to their co-active power; nor minde they to offer themſelves to be his Subjects in ſuch terms. On the contrary it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth clearly in the Text, that they recognoſce his right of reigning over them is from God, and that he was not ſubject to be removed by them; ſee 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.2. 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 11.2, 3. They ſay, <hi>The Lord ſaid to thee, thou ſhalt feed my people</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and ſhalt be Captain or Ruler over them.</hi> And it is added, <hi>Therefore they came,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and anointed him King over</hi> Iſrael, <hi>according to the Word of the Lord by</hi> Samuel. They humbly declare him King whom God had conſtituted, whom they could not lawfully reject: and it is impious to think, that they recognoſcing Gods conſtitution of him, yet ſhould fancy a Paction or Covenant, giving them co-active ſuperiority over him, to remove him when they thought meet, though God had ſet him on the Throne by a ſpecial ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. All the Covenant that can be ſuppoſed here, is upon the peoples part, an engagement to humble ſubjection and homage: And upon the Kings part, a Covenant of indempnity for former oppoſitions to him (wherein they had need to be comfortably ſecured) or at moſt, we ſhall not repugne, if it be called a Covenant both of protection and right ruling of them; yet ſo, as not ſubjecting himſelf to their cenſures or co-action, or that they ſhould be his Subjects only upon that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being otherwiſe free to fall upon him. The Covenant may be to mutual duties, and yet on neither ſide conditional, but abſolute; each party oblieging themſelves to their own duty abſolutely, but not on condition that the other party do their duty. As if a man bind him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by oath to give me one hundred pounds; and I bind my ſelf again by oath to him, to give him one hundred pounds, without conditional pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion that he pay me the money he promiſed me: Albeit he ſhould fail in his oath and not pay me, yet muſt not I fail in mine, but muſt pay him; becauſe my oath is ſeparate from his, and independent upon it, and hath a ſeparate obligation abſolute, which no failing of the other party to me can looſe. Indeed the caſe is otherwiſe, when there is a reciprocal contract of things to be done by one party, upon condition of ſome things to be done by the other, (as in Covenants of Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Nations) there the breach of condition by one party, looſes the promiſe of the other, which was only conditionally made. But, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is not engaged to Kings conditionally, but abſolutely, albeit obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God be reſerved, when any active obedience contrary to him is called for.</p>
               <p>Again, for the other inſtance of the Covenant, which <hi>Jehoiadah,</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:99891:59"/>
made between King <hi>Joaſh</hi> and the people, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 13.2, 3. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.17. this was alſo made upon an extraordinary occaſion, (for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, we never hear of any ſuch Covenants amongſt Gods people and their Kings; and extraordinaries cannot Found ordinary Rules.) <hi>Athaliah</hi> had murthered all the royal Seed, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 11. 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 23. except <hi>Joaſh,</hi> who was kept ſecret ſix years in the houſe of the Lord, while the uſurper poſſeſſed the Kingdom: Now when the godly Prieſt <hi>Jehoiadah,</hi> the Kings Tutor, ſaw a fit time, he ingaged the principal men in Covenant of fidelity to the King, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 11.4. and ſhewed them the Kings Son; This was a neceſſary piece of holy Policy, when the Uſurper and her faction, had ſo long ſtrengthned themſelves, to engage the chief men to ſpecial fidelity to him. <hi>And</hi> after that, 12.17. <hi>He brought forth the Kings Son, and put the Crown upon him, and gave him the Teſtimony, and they made him King and anointed him, and they clapt their hands and ſaid, God ſave the King; and</hi> Jehoiadah, <hi>made a Covenant betwixt the Lord and the King and the people, and that they ſhould be the Lords people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King alſo and the people. Joaſh</hi> was then but ſeven years old, and not in capacity to make a Covenant with the people; but, his godly Tutor did preſide in that buſineſs: But two things to our purpoſe are remarkable; 1. That he is Crowned and made King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Covenant is made, (as is clear in the Text) which croſſes our Antimonarchiſts, who aſſert, the King cannot be made King, untill he make the Covenant with the people, and that he gets the Crown and royal Authority, Covenant-wiſe and conditionally; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, here he is made King antecedently to any Covenant, as the Text clears it. 2. That albeit the matter of King and peoples Covenant with God be expreſſed, <hi>viz. That they ſhould be the Lords people</hi>; yet, it is not told us, what the tenor of the Covenant betwixt King and people was, nor what the King or <hi>Jehoiadah</hi> Covenanted in his name, the young King of ſeven years old, what could he ſay in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting? <hi>Jehoiadah</hi> was only Preſident in the matter. <hi>Diodat</hi> ſeems to ſay well, that in this place, Jehoiadah <hi>made the people ſwear al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgiance and fidelity to the King, (as before he had made the Rulers do,</hi> verſ. 4.) and no more, <hi>he took an oath of fidelity of them:</hi> But, how ſhall it be cleared, that it was conditional, and with a reſerve of coactive and punitive Power over him? (as theſe men will have it.) But paſſing from this, let it be ſo, (which cannot be aſſerted with warrand) that all the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> made ſuch conditional Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants with the people, (as is ſuppoſed) yet, will any judicious man
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:99891:59"/>
force the particular cuſtomes of that Nation on all Nations, that might be beſt for that Nation that was not ſimply beſt, their cuſtoms without a Law of God bearing a ſtanding reaſon, cannot be obligatory on others, leaſt we judaize too much. But the conſtant practice of all the Prophets and people of God in that Kingdom, when their Kings were very wicked, idolatrous and tyrannous, ſpeaks clearly, that they never had ſuch thoughts of a liberty by vertue of covenant, to fall with violence on their Kings: The Prophets of God, never taught them inſurrections againſt Kings, (as falſe Prophets do now) albeit they had as great cauſe as ever people had (under ſome of their Kings) and were in capacity probable enough to cruſh them, they never ſuggeſted to them that their obligations to ſubjection unto their Kings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but conditional, they were ſet free, when they became ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly wicked, idolatrous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor did ever Godly people, (although they ſtrived to keep themſelves pure, and to gain-ſtand in their private capacities the evils of the times) think themſelves free, to uſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence againſt Powers above them; had this been their duty, no doubt Gods Prophets would plainly and down-right have told them of it, without circumlocutions, but this they never did; either that was no du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or the Prophets were not faithful in not admoniſhing them of their duty: When at firſt, that people ſought a King from <hi>Samuel,</hi> they reſolved not to take him conditionally, <hi>ſi bene regnaverit,</hi> but with all the faults that might follow him; neither reſerved they Power to coerce him, (which had it been in their thoughts, would eaſily have anſwered and weakned <hi>Samuels</hi> terrifying diſſwaſive; for they could have ſaid, we take him only as King, on condition of his good behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; otherwiſe, we will take order with him) but would have one, as other Nations had Kings about them, (of whom <hi>Buchanan</hi> ſays, they were not <hi>legitimi Reges,</hi> but <hi>tyranni</hi> in his language, becauſe not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Law coaction) And ſo alſo, they behaved themſelves toward them, not uſing them as they deſerved; but forbearing violence againſt them, although they were very evil Princes many of them.</p>
               <p>But yet further it is preſſed, that ſuch an Oath and Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt King and People was in uſe then, becauſe, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.2. <hi>It is ſaid I counſel thee to keep the Kings commandment, and that in regard of the oath of God.</hi> Therefore, there was (ſay they) an Oath or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant betwixt King and People. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The moſt that can be made of this place, is (as <hi>Diodat</hi> in his note thereupon affirms) <hi>that the ſubjects ſwore the oath of Allegiance and Obedience to the King,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground whereof, they were to obey him; it was at moſt <hi>foedus
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:99891:60"/>
unilaterum</hi> (as they call it in the Schools) but it imports not mutual engagement of the King to them, or that he ſwore to them, much leſs that the Oath they made to him was conditional, with a reſerve of Power to puniſh him for his deviations (which in this ſame King that writes this were very great) albeit we grant all ſuch oaths to Kings to be underſtood, <hi>ſalvo jure Dei, &amp; ſalva Deo obedientia.</hi> 2. We do not ſee ground to aſſert, that ordinarily amongſt that people, there were oaths of fidelity and obedience given to their Kings (whatever was done in the extraordinary caſes above mentioned) far leſſe, that Kings engaged to them by oath ordinarily; both the King ruled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch an oath, and the people obeyed without ſuch an oath or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement. Neither is there in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. or <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. or any where elſe, ſuch a rule ſet in the inſtitution or conſtitution of the King, that any ſuch matter ſhould be done. Nor hear we in the Hiſtory of this ſame King <hi>Solomon,</hi> who writes this, that when he entred to the Throne, either he ſwore to the people, or they to him, unleſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 29.24. may import this as to <hi>Solomon. Junius</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of this Text (wherein he is followed by <hi>Cartwright</hi>) may well paſſe, <hi>praeſtitutum Regis obſerva, ſed pro ratione juramenti Dei,</hi> i. e. Keep the Kings Commandment ſo far as it may be keeped, retaining fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to God, to whom abſolute and illimited obedience is ſworn; So not the motive of obedience to the King (becauſe of the oath ſworn to him) is here imported, but only the meaſure and moderation of our obedience due to him, ſo as it may conſiſt with the duty ſworn to God: our obedience to the King is here cautionated (ſaith <hi>Cartwright) dummodo non pugnet cum juramento quo divino imperio obſtricti ſumus,</hi> we are to obey him. 3. We may hold cloſe to our own tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet not be neceſſitate to grant, ſo much to be ſpoken of here as an oath of the people to the King; let be a mutual Oath and Covenant betwixt King and People, (neither of which was in ordinary uſe amongſt that people, nor mentioned in ſacred Scripture as ordinary. For, they were all bound by oath to obey all Gods Commandments (this was the oath of God) and amongſt his Commandments, this was one, that they ſhould obey the King in the Lord, and obey all the Kings lawful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, in regard of their general oath and engagement to God, to obey all his commandments: they were bound to obey the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand under God, and in ſubordination to him, albeit they never took any particular oath to obey the King, and dealt not covenant-wiſe with him. And thus the ſenſe runs fairly, <hi>I counſell thee to keep the Kings commandment, and that in regard of,</hi> (or, propter) <hi>the oath of God</hi>:
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:99891:60"/>
becauſe thou haſt ſworn to obey God, obey the King in all lawful things, for this is the will of God. The motive of obedience is taken not from any particular oath made to the King, but from the general oath made to God, engaging in all things to obey him.</p>
               <p>But yet this buſineſs of the civil Covenant is not at an end; for, it is urged (<hi>L. R.</hi> P. 97.) <hi>that this Covenant tyes the King</hi> (be it tacite or expreſſe) <hi>not to God only, but to the people, and brings him by recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of bands, to be under a Law-obligation; to be ſubject to the peoples cenſure and puniſhment in caſe of failing, as well as they are ſubject to to him in caſe of failing; and that all covenants and contracts betwixt man and man, bring the covenanters under a law and claim before men, if the contract be broken. And that the King becoming bound to the people, he comes under action and claim by them if he fail, and is puniſhable as they are, if they fail. And that the King and they, have a mutual coactive power one over another, and are mutually Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates one to another; and the people, if the King fail, may judge him in their tribunal of neceſſity; and that there needs no judge on earth between them, more then between two Nations independent one upon another, when they warr together. And that in reformations of things amiſſe, (eſpecially in Religion) people may extraordinarily intrude in the Magiſtrates office, and not only reform themſelves</hi> actibus elicitis, <hi>but reform others</hi> actibus imperatis. <hi>And that people, by vertue of this ſuppoſed covenant, may (when they ſee cauſe) formally and effectively excerciſe upon their Kings that royalty which they have in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves virtually and fountally.</hi> Much of that ſort of ſtuffe is to be found, <hi>queſt.</hi> 14.40. and every where in that Book. And it is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable, that while they who labour to preſerve Gods order in the world, ſhould be branded as flatterers and Paraſits of Princes, ſuch flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers of People to their own confuſion and deſtruction, ſhould (with their writings) have ſuch entertainment and countenance. But yet it muſt be ſaid, that <hi>L. R.</hi> is far more tolerable then <hi>Naph.</hi> for, what he grants only to the body of the people or the inferior Rulers and Nobles with the people, in acting againſt the King, <hi>Napht.</hi> extends in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of any party of meer private perſons amongſt the people againſt all Magiſtrates, ſupreme and ſubordinate; and affirms, what the whole body with inferior Magiſtrates may do againſt a King (deviating from his duty) any ſmall part of meer private perſons (if they have ſtrength enough) may by vertue of the Covenant, do the ſame againſt all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates ſupreme and ſubordinate, not only as to reſiſtance, but as to revenge and puniſhing them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:99891:61"/>A few notes ſhall be ſufficient upon the former Doctrine, and then the matter ſhall be at an end. 1. Where a Covenant is made between a King and a People, (a King I ſay, that is truly ſuch a one) its grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Covenant on the Kings part binds him not only to God, in relation to the people, as the object of his duty, but doth bind him to the people formally, yet not ſo as if he be deficient in his duties, they are enſtated in a power above him, to ſit as his Judges, or that they are looſed from all duty to him, and free to do him violence. If a Father ſwear to do his fatherly duty to his Child, that makes not the Child his Superior to puniſh him if he fail; when a Miniſter is admitted to teach a people, he ſwears to them to be dutiful, but they are not therefore made his Superiors to puniſh him if he fail. It is a moſt falſe aſſertion that goes alongs that whole Book, <hi>that a right is given (by the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſworn) to the inferiors and ſubjects in the politick Society, to judge and puniſh their ſuperiors in caſe of failing.</hi> No man can lawfully be judged and puniſhed (whatever contract be) by another then his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Judge that is above him in that Society, whereof he is a part, <hi>L R.</hi> Pag. 100.101.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a very great difference between theſe who are in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent political Societies, when they break their Contracts or Covenants one with another; and betwixt the head and body, or members of one and that ſame civil Society. God having allowed lawful Wars, allows ſeeking of reparation or repelling of wrongs done by one Nation to another, by force of the Sword, when no rational means can bring the doers of the wrong to do right; and there being no other remedy, he himſelf, the Lord of hoſts and God of armies, ſits Judge and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator in that great buſineſs, and in the uſe of War is appealed to as Judge, there being no common Judge on earth to ſit on the cauſes of theſe independent Nations. But God, having ſet and eſtabliſhed in one particular and political Society or Nation, his own Ordinance of Magiſtracy, to which every ſoul muſt be ſubject, and all ſubject to the Supreme; he hath not put the puniſhing Sword in any hand, but in the hand of the Magiſtrate his Sword-bearer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. Nor hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed liberty to meer private perſons to manage it againſt the ſupreme Magiſtrate, no nor to inferior Magiſtrates (as to him) who in reſpect of the ſupreme Majeſty, are but private perſons, whatever they be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their inferiors. The Magiſtrates (chiefly the Supreme) are by their official power above the whole Nation; and as abſurd it is to ſay, they are above the powers which God hath ſet over them, (as <hi>L<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> R. p.</hi> 460. ſaith Thraſonically, <hi>he hath proved unanſwerably</hi>) as to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:99891:61"/>
ſay, that every Pariſh is above the Miniſter, in an Eccleſiaſtical way, though he have official power over them all; or that every Lord in <hi>Scotland</hi> have their Tennents and Vaſſals above them, a thing which the Nobles of <hi>Scotland</hi> had need to look to: For certainly, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which lead to ſubject Kings to people, lead clearly, and by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted conſequence, to ſubject them to their Vaſſals, and to all under them; yea, and all Maſters to Servants, and Parents to Children, and to confound and invert the order of all humane Societies. This truth we muſt cleave to, that in one and that ſame civil Society where God hath appointed Rulers and ruled, Subjects cannot without ſacrilegious intruſion and contempt of God, ſnatch the Sword out of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates hand to puniſh him with it, (though in ſome particulars he abuſe it) Neither can a War, intended for this end by meer private perſons, be lawful againſt their head or heads; nor can any forraign War be managed, without a lawful Authority on the Part of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is a very falſe aſſertion, <hi>That the people gave the Kingdom to</hi> David <hi>only conditionally,</hi> if he did ſuch and ſuch duties to them; and if not, reſerving power to dethrone him, <hi>L. R. p.</hi> 97. God having ſet <hi>David</hi> upon his holy hill as his King, and not only made him King by his Providence, but expreſs deſignment, ſpecial command and word, none on earth were left at liberty to undo what God would have done and appointed to be.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is very weakly reaſoned, (<hi>L. R. p.</hi> 97.) <hi>That becauſe Gods people may humbly plead with himſelf, upon the account of his own fidelity in promiſing, or</hi> (as this man ſayes) <hi>have action of Law and</hi> jus quoddam (a bold enough expreſſion) <hi>againſt God to plead with him; that therefore the Kings Covenant gives the people ground of civil action againſt him, to coerce or puniſh him.</hi> It had been better ſaid, that upon this ground they might humbly plead with him, ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat and reaſon with him as Gods Deputy, bearing the impreſs of his Majeſty and Soveraignty on earth. But, as God cannot otherwiſe be pleaded with, upon account of his promiſe, (wherein he is bound not ſo much to us, as to his own fidelity to evidence it, <hi>reddit ille debita nulli debens</hi>) and cannot be pleaded with by force or violence: So his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties on earth, on whom, under himſelf, he hath ſtamped inviolable Majeſty, whatever they be (as <hi>Calvin</hi> writes, in the place often cited) are not to be pleaded with by ſtrong hand and force (howſoever in ſomethings they miſcarry, a thing not competent to the Majeſty of God) For, he hath not in his Word given any commiſſion to any of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:99891:62"/>
their Subjects to riſe violently againſt them, or uſe the puniſhing Sword upon them. If this commiſſion can be produced, we have no more to ſay, but <hi>Good is the Word of the Lord:</hi> but till this be ſeen, we ſhall cleave to <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. that makes the Magiſtrate the only Sword-bearer of God to avenge or puniſh, however perhaps he hath his aberrations in uſing it. If this man can ſhew a Superior on earth to uſe the Sword upon the Soveraign Magiſtrate, people ſhall have fair liberty to plead their claim or law-ſuit as he calls it before him. But who will judge it more reaſon, that theſe who are Plaintifes ſhall be judges of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they complain of, more then the party (or Prince) Judge to them? Is not this a perverſion of all judgement that in one and the ſame body politick, the accuſer and Judge ſhall be coincident in the ſame perſons or perſon? And they ſhall uſe the puniſhing Sword over all Rulers, to whom God never committed it, <hi>the notions of original, fountaine, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual royalty in the people, which they may render formal, effectual and actual, when they ſee fit,</hi> are but high flown unregardable fancies of the maſters of confuſion. All magiſtratical Authority is originally and fountally in God alone, whoſe Miniſter the Magiſtrate is (and not the peoples, although for the peoples good) whatever intereſts people may have in inſtrumental application of the power to ſuch or ſuch perſons ſometimes; Government is not in the people virtually (though wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſometimes they uſurp it.) No man hath the Power of the Sword over his own life, nor over the life of his neighbours, (as he is a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man, not inveſted with magiſtratical Authority) and ſo cannot tranſmit that to another, which he hath not himſelf. None have this avenging Power of the Sword over mens lives, but the Magiſtrate alone, whom people by Gods law are bound to chooſe, if they want one in their Societies and Combinations, but whomever they deſigne they do not empower him; it is God by his Ordinance that doth this, the Power is from God, not from them, albeit the application of the perſon to the Power, or of it to him, be inſtrumentally and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively by the peoples act, where they have liberty for ſuch acts.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Though it be true, that all Covenants and Contracts amongſt men, embodied in a Society, brings each of the contracters under a Law-claim, in caſe of failing, (<hi>coram Judice proprio</hi>) before his own and competent Judge; yet, it is not true, that any Contracts betwixt man and man in one and the ſame Society, gives the party keeping contract, coactive Power over the party breaking; it is true, the Judge hath a coactive Power, to lay forth in behalf of the keeper againſt the breaker, but that is not the keeper his coactive Power, but the Judges
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:99891:62"/>
employed for his good; the one party is not Judge of the other, but the Magiſtrate is Judge over both: Now, there is no Judge over all Magiſtrates, nor the ſupreme Magiſtrate, before whom a complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people can plead wrong done to them: This complaint lyes before God only to take order with it. And it muſt needs be a ſtrange aſſertion to ſay, (as ſome do) that it leads Kings to Atheiſme, to tell them, <hi>They are countable to God only</hi>; whereas this leads them genuinly, to ſtand in awe of God, and the leſſe fear they have from men, to be in greater dreador of more terrible ſtrokes from God, if if they do wrong: ordinarily where there is much fear of mans puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, there is leſſe fear of Gods; but when it is told Princes, the more exemption they have from man, the more terribly will God handle them, if they do wrong, this may make the higheſt and ſtouteſt hearts, to tremble at the dreadful vengeance, by the hands of the living God, which will ſtrike a deeper ſtroke then creatures can.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To provoke people to go about the medling with the advancing Religion, <hi>actibus Imperatis,</hi> which is the Magiſtrates part; and not only <hi>actibus elicitis,</hi> is but a ruining of all order God hath ſet; the imperate acts for advancing Religion, are not to be done, but by theſe to whom God hath given the Empire: It is not his will, that people run out of their rank and calling to ſerve him; more then it was his will, that <hi>Saul</hi> or <hi>Vzziah</hi> offered ſacrifice or incenſe; the works were good in themſelves, but the workers were not warranded to do the ſame; extraordinary neceſſities, are more eaſily pleaded then juſtified, as ground ſufficient for actions, whereto there is no extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary call. If Magiſtrates be deficient, as to their imperat acts in advancing Religion; private perſons are ſufficiently diſcharged, if they keep themſelves pure, and do what poſſibly they can, for advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religion in their private capacities, and by their elicit acts: Nor ſhall they be involved in guiltineſs, for not intruding in the Magiſtrates office, or doing his duty, (wherein he hath failed) If a mans eyes be put out, his ears or other ſenſes, will go as far to ſupply that defect, for the good of the body as may be, yet, cannot help the body by elicit acts of ſeeing; So, whatever length private perſons may go, for the good of the body, they muſt not go to exerciſe and exert formally acts Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtratical, upon whatever pretence of extraordinary need, (which will never be wanting to a people, enflamed with a ſeditious ſpirit) <hi>Auguſt.

And the reſult of all is, <hi>to faſten the laſt inſurrection upon the holy ſpirit of God,</hi> to juſtifie their attempts againſt all Authorities in the Land; and to aſſert, they were no more to be condemned as Trait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, then <hi>Phineas</hi> ſhould be for his executing judgement, ſeing they were led with the ſame ſpirit, and had as good warrand as he. And the deſign further is, to inflame people again to the like courſes, under the like pretences, for juſtifying the ſame.</p>
               <p>When this mans diſcourſe concerning <hi>Phineas</hi> fact, and the exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plarineſs thereof, and concerning pretended extraordinary or heroick incitations he talkes of, was firſt looked upon; men of any judgement conſider'd, that as the former bloody inſurrections were endeavoured to be juſtified by him, ſo he was laying down grounds for ſome mercileſs maſſacre, or horrid aſſaſſinations on perſons in power, and others (if any people might be found ſo deſerted of God, as to be ſerviceable to him in that wickedneſs) for now no man can have ſecurity of his life, if any private perſons be allowed under <hi>Phineas</hi> cloak to come and cut the throats of all, whom this man will point forth as black Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtats, Such deeds muſt be fatherd upon the holy Spirit of God, and his excitations to zeal; which are held a ſufficient calling, though that ſo called zeal, will prove no other but a corrupt luſt, proceeding from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſpirit. And we muſt forſooth (when theſe men will have us ſo do) own theſe irregularities as being from God, and ſay, <hi>He is employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the weak things and fooliſh of the world to confound the mighty and wiſe, and muſt not condemn them as <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers, or Intruders (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be but meer private men) more then we would have done</hi> Phineas <hi>in his fact.</hi> Thus he.</p>

                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:99891:64"/>What great Villanies have been under ſuch pretences carried on in the world, by perſons taking their heroical motions and excitations of zeal, for a ſufficient calling to their irregular actions (which is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Doctrine of this man) the World knows well. How the <hi>Munſter madneſs</hi> was carried on under extraordinary ſhewes of zeal, is known, and how alſo God confounded that way. The murthers of the two Kings <hi>Henries</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> (the third and fourth) have been famous or infamous in this laſt age, by the cruel hands of two Zelots, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed by ſeditious Predicants and Jeſuits, they fell. The aſſaſſinates actions were cryed up by ſuch as ſet them on againſt theſe <hi>Neroes</hi> of the time (as theſe Kings were called by them) as actions moſt heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally zealous, moſt <hi>Phineas</hi> like, proceeding not from common vertue or grace, <hi>ſed à dono ſpeciali Spiritus Sancti, (proh nefas!)</hi> And they taught, that it was of God to excite theſe miſcreants to cut the Baſilick vein (as they ſpake) to prevent the State and Churches falling into a burning feaver. And to come neerer home, the remembrance of the Gun-powder Traitors, who attempted at one blow to deſtroy King <hi>James</hi> and all his Family and Parliament, is yet recent: a deed which wanted nothing of the high commendation of an heroical and <hi>Phineas</hi>-like fact (amongſt the Zelots of the antichriſtian party) but that it wanted ſucceſſe, which marred all. Further, in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>England, Anno</hi> 1591. Some male-contented Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, being taken in the head with the ſame fancy of Heroical mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of zeal, as a ſufficient calling to attempt ſomething beyond rule, in the deſolate and colapſed eſtate of the Church (as they call'd it) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan firſt to queſtion and propoſe it as a caſe of conſcience, <hi>If in ſuch a caſe, God might not give ſuch high meaſures of zeal, fortitude, courage and rare excitations of his Spirit to meer private perſons againſt oppreſſing powers, which might be a ſufficient call to attempt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what againſt Magiſtrates, not ſuiting ordinarily rules, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the event to God.</hi> The men were, <hi>Arthington, Coppinger,</hi> and <hi>Hacket</hi> the chief of the three, as they were all marvelous zealous for the diſcipline; So this third having debauched his eſtate, ſurpaſſed in zeal this way (perhaps looking for ſome reparation by it) and was, (as the Hiſtory tells us) a man of higheſt pretences of the internal uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſpirituality and of pure zeal, and one who could <hi>ex tempore</hi> pray to admiration. The godly Miniſters, who were of their perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in matters of diſcipline, for the moſt part diſliked, and diſſwaded them from their courſe (albeit ſome too furious entertained and encouraged them.) After this, they went to action; <hi>Hackets</hi> two complices went
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:99891:64"/>
to the moſt open and publick ſtreets of the City of <hi>London,</hi> declaring to them, that <hi>Hacket</hi> (who was to be found at his lodging, in one Mr. <hi>Walkers</hi> in <hi>Cripple-gate</hi>) was ſent of God, to repreſent Jeſus Chriſt on earth, with his fan in his hand, to ſeparate the pretious from the vile and to erect the holy diſcipline in all <hi>Europe</hi>; they having a great concourſe of people flocking about them, declared themſelves to be his extraordinary Prophets, the one to preach vengeance to them, who would not obey them; the other to preach mercy to all, who would obey them. And in the great concourſe of people, they ceaſed not to cry, repent, repent, O <hi>England</hi>! and embrace the Goſpel, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of Reformation. As for the Queen, they cried ſhe had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from her right to the Kingdom; And that moſt of her Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, were but betrayers of the Kingdom. And all their doctrines they ſet forth, with terrible imprecations againſt themſelves, if they ſpake not truth.</p>
               <p>The Queen being at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and hearing of the uproar at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> ſent two of her Councellors to ſee what the matter was; the deceivers all three were apprehended and arraigned, as ſtirring up ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the Queen, and deſigning to deſtroy her, to murther her Councellors and Biſhops, to bring in their new King, and trans-form all things in Church and State, to their own fancies. <hi>Hacket</hi> the King was executed, and dyed blaſpheming. <hi>Coppinger</hi> in a fury pining himſelf with hunger, at laſt beat his own brains againſt the wall and dyed. <hi>Arthington,</hi> upon his repentance, obtained mercy of the Queen.</p>
               <p>Such abominable courſes carried on, under pretext of Heroick mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and rare excitations of the Spirit, ſhould make the fearers of God, very cautelous againſt the Principles of this man, which lead this way; For he aſſerts, <hi>There needs no ſtanding upon an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal call, if men think they have this internal call, to uſe the Sword for vengeance againſt Apoſtate Magiſtrates</hi> (all and ſundry) <hi>ſuch as he reckons they are in this time,</hi> (Napht. p. 24.) Any party of private men, may (according to his mind) riſe up in a <hi>Phineas like fortitude againſt not only Princes, but all the</hi> Primores Regni, <hi>becoming Patrons of abominations, to execute Judgement upon them,</hi> (Napht. p. 22.) <hi>and to reform an Apoſtate Church, their zeal,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is a ſufficient call without further.</hi> If ſuch Doctrines paſſe for current and good coine, and if our people be ſo principled, it were better living under the great Turk, where no man is to loſſe his life but by Law, then in <hi>Scotland</hi>; where all Magiſtrates and others, ſhall be proclaimed lyable to the fury of any private perſons, who can pretend rare and Heroick

excitations of the Spirit, to zealous executing juſtice upon men, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they, thus animated, think there is cauſe: For, this man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims theſe inward excitations, as a ſufficient call, without any other external call.</p>
               <p>But this man, ſeing the miſchief of his evil Doctrine, (though he is loath to part with it) would gladly add ſome Salvo, if he could: for ſaith he, p. 24. <hi>We held not ſuch inſtances,</hi> (viz. as that of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas) <hi>as regular Precedents for all times and perſons univerſally.</hi> That is well ſaid, but where is the caution that is put in againſt any, that will pretend Heroical excitations by the Spirit, as a ſufficient call: He hath opened a door, but how will he cloſe it again. It is eaſie to raiſe the Devil, but not ſo eaſie to lay him again; the man would ſay ſomething to ſatisfaction, if he could ſet down certain rules, to bar a heady people, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pretence of <hi>Phineas</hi>-like motions and excitations, to ariſe upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occaſion to confound all: But, as he cannot do this, ſo doth he not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it; he cannot give any remedy againſt confuſion in all caſes, having proclaimed this libertiniſme to private perſons, upon pretence of Heroick excitations of zeal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to riſe up againſt all Powers above them; for they are made Judges (in their own private diſcretion) when it is fit to fall in hand with ſuch irregular practices: And when it is, that ſuch Heroick excitations are upon their Spirits; and when it is, that matters are ſo far out of order, that they cannot be amended, without their violent interpoſing and pulling down of Powers: all this, is referred to private perſons private diſcretion; and if this mans party were poſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Power, upon their principles, another party, perhaps of <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, Ranters,</hi> &amp;c. could eaſily ſtart up, and plead their impulſes from above, to rectifie the corrupted and collapſed eſtate of affairs, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and puniſh offenders; So, there ſhall be no end of confuſion, when theſe are got into the ſaddle, others ſhall met to them in that ſame meaſure, <hi>erranti nullus terminus,</hi> there ſhall be a progreſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion <hi>in infinitum.</hi> And never ſhall people, (when they mind changes) want the pretexts of corruption in Rulers, and in all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides themſelves, and will lay hold on any probable capacity, which qualifies them for exerciſe of Juſtice againſt all, not of their way. And although they be not in probable capacity, to take the fields, or leavy Armies; yet, they will go ſo far in executing juſtice upon all Magiſtrates, (<hi>Phineas</hi>-like) as upon <hi>patroniſers</hi> (p. 24.) <hi>of abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> (as he ſayes, all our Magiſtrates of all degrees are now) for he tells us (p. 18.) <hi>They ought without doubt, be ſuppreſſed by all meanes, (n. b.</hi> by all meanes) if there be no probable capacity for

Of this no more ſhall be ſaid; But we are to pray, that the life of our dread Soveraign may be bound up with the Lord his God in the bundle of Life; and alſo, that the ſame great and good God, may be a ſhield and buckler to his ſervants, (who deſire in honouring the King, to fear him, the King of Kings above all) againſt the generation of men of blood and violence, who bewray their ungodlineſs too much, in daring to ſeek patrociny for villanous aſſaſſinations from the holy Scriptures of God.</p>

break forth, and ſo much wrath from the Lord attending ſin, meet with <hi>Moſes</hi> the chief Magiſtrate, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.6. to lament the abominable idolatry and bodily filthineſs, committed at that time, and to conſult and adviſe, about the authoritative reſtraining of this wickedneſs: In the mean time, when the great Council are humbled before the Lord, for the common wickedneſs, and for the wrath that was upon them, <hi>Zimri,</hi> a Prince of <hi>Simeon,</hi> with his <hi>Midianitiſh</hi> woman, are in their very ſight going into the Prince of <hi>Iſraels</hi> tent; and <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us, that before <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Council he juſtified the fact, and pleaded frowardly to have and retain her.

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:99891:66"/>
their unaninimous ſentence againſt effronted villany: As at another time, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.27, 28. <hi>Moſes,</hi> as Gods Vice-gerent, ſet the Levits and others on work to execute judgment by the ſword upon an idolatrous people; in which caſe they were <hi>ſatellites Magiſtratus,</hi> and had his Commiſſion: and why might not <hi>Phineas</hi> have here the like warrand from <hi>Moſes</hi>? If any ſay, it is not written; it may be anſwered, <hi>In rebus facti à non ſcripto ad non factum non valet conſequentia</hi>; all things done are not written. We have heard famous Authors accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to have had warrand, whether as a Judge or Executor of the will of the great Council and of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who did well approve his deed. But, how abſurd is it to bring an argument from this inſtance, to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand any private man to do juſtice when he thinks there is need, not only without the Magiſtrates conſent, but even upon all Magiſtrates, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and ſubordinate? which is the ſcope this mans writing drives at.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The caſe wherein <hi>Phineas</hi> executed judgement, was when hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible idolatry and villanous whoredom was avowedly, and with an high hand, committed in the ſight of the Sun; and in way of open doing deſpite to God and to all Magiſtrates, and the ſupreme Council then aſſembled to mourn before God, and to take courſe for remedying by their Authority, the horrible looſeneſs broken forth at that time. But, dare this man ſay, that there is now ſuch horrid wickedneſs? although he is bold to call all the Magiſtrates, ſupreme and ſubordinate, <hi>Patrons of abominations,</hi> and <hi>men acting in the meer ſpirit of wickedneſs</hi>: while the true Proteſtant Religion, according to the Scriptures and the Laws at our firſt Reformation, and Confeſſion of Faith, recorded in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is ſincerely and conſtantly held. There is a change and regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the exterior form of Church-government, anent which godly men differ, and the change that is made will be maintained againſt this man, to contain nothing contrary to Gods Word. Yet, forſooth, this is the great abomination and ſo groſs, that it may licence every private perſon to riſe up againſt all Magiſtrates, ſupreme and ſubordinate, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them or cut their throats; and this muſt be called executing judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Lord, and a <hi>Phineas</hi>-like fact.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let it be ſo, that <hi>Phineas</hi> was a meer private man, and had no warrand from the ſupreme Magiſtrate to do what he did (which yet cannot be proved) his fact can be no warrand for private men to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the doing of ſuch acts; unleſs they can ſhew as good warrand and approbation from God, as he could.

He ſhould in order to this, labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have ſet ſome diſtinction betwixt heroical and extraordinary acts, but this he doth not, only labours to jumble the matter, and ſpeaks ſo confuſedly, that as others cannot underſtand him, ſo he gives evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he did not underſtand himſelf in this matter; only ſomething he would gladly ſay to encourage men to irregular actions, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Phineas</hi> fact. But the man, if he would, might have known the diſtinction betwixt extraordinary and heroical acts. Philoſophers and Divines too, diſtinguiſh betwixt heroical vertues with the acts ſuitably thereto, and common vertues and their acts, (3<hi rend="sup">•</hi>

                  </gap>) and aggree in this, that there is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween heroical vertues and <hi>virtutes communiter dictae, niſi ſecundum perfectiorem modum.</hi> A heroick act doth not deviate from the rule of a common vertue, but only proceeds from a more intenſe diſpoſition to a high pitch of vertue, and of the acts thereof, but yet keeps within the bounds of the ordinary rule of ſuch or ſuch a vertuous action. But, an extraordinary action goes beyond any ordinary rule of common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or divine Word; as, that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould kill <hi>Iſaac</hi> without any hatred of him, or cauſe in him, was an act of extraordinary obedience to a ſpecial mandate of God. Albeit the love that is due to God above all, and the reſpect due to his Sovereignty, ſhould incline to obey whatever he enjoyns: yet, the particular act of ſlaying his harmleſſe child, meerly
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:99891:68"/>
upon the declared will of God, was an extraordinary act of obedience, not compriſable within the liſts of common vertues, that direct our actings toward men under God. Extraordinary actions are ſuch as are done upon ſpecial mandate of God, and are not within the compaſſe of ordinary acts of obedience according to the rule that is ſet. Men may have heroick motions and actions within the bounds of an ordinary calling, as ſometimes, though they have extraordinary calling, they may want heroical motions. <hi>Luther</hi> had no immediate nor extraordinary calling to reform the Church; but within the bounds of ordinary cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, he had ſpecial excitations of Gods Spirit, and was elevated unto heroick actings for Gods glory, in an exceedingly corrupt and collapſed ſtate of the Church. <hi>Peter</hi> had an extraordinary calling and immediate, yet he wanted ſometimes heroical motions and actions, as when he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. <hi>Phineas</hi> had not only excitations of zeal and heroical motions, but (ſuppoſing him a meer private Perſon) he is to be looked upon, as having extraordinary calling from God, which is fully enough inſinuated, both by Gods approving and rewarding him, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. (and he rewards not our will-ſervice, nor approves it, but what he hath enjoyned himſelf) and alſo by <hi>Pſ.</hi> 106. where it is ſaid emphatically, <hi>it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs,</hi> though judging according to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary rules, it might be imputed to him for ſin (ſuppoſing him a meer private man.) Yet, having Gods warrand, whoſe will is the rule of righteouſneſs, the deed was imputed to him for righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Great gifts, ſecret impulſes, heroical motions, do not (as this man ſuggeſts) give men ſufficient call to go beyond the ordinary rules God hath ſet to men in their callings (though they diſpoſe them to act eminently in their callings) yet cannot give a new or another calling. Every calling a man hath to any work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God ſets him about, muſt be either mediate or immediate (there is no midſt betwixt theſe two, as there is not between contradictories.) If men be not called to a work by the intervention of men, and their allowance, they muſt plead an immediate calling from God. And we would gladly hear, if this man will allow the private perſons, whom he inſtigates to inſurrections againſt Magiſtrates, an immediate calling (by vertue of their ſecret impulſes and excitations) for we are ſure, they have no mediate ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary calling. If he will go on to ſay, that great gifts of zeal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> great excitations and impulſes, allows people to deſert their own cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ſtate, (like theſe ſpirits, <hi>Jude</hi> 6. <hi>that kept not their firſt eſtate, but left their own habitation</hi>) and to intrude upon the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates office alwayes, when they think there is cauſe, without an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal

vocation from men. Where will he reſt, till he confound all within Church and State? If ſuch gifts and impulſes be ſufficient call for intruding in the office of the Magiſtrate to execute juſtice, why is it not alſo ſufficient for the office of the Miniſtry, without call from men externally? And thus Anabaptiſts, Enthuſiaſts, Photinians and the like, denying the neceſſity of external call to the Miniſtry; avowing gifts and excitations to be a ſufficient call, ſhall gain the day; a man may take the honour of a Miniſtry to himſelf, without waiting mans call, as well as the honour of Magiſtracy: a ſelf-called-Magiſtrate, and a ſelf-called Miniſter, are very ſib together. And how ſhall the Libeller re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to admit women to baptize children in caſe of neceſſity? (the thing it ſelf being good and for a good end, and there being none other to do it, and the exigence great) or how will he hold back any private perſons from preaching and miniſtring all Sacraments, though they have no external call? It is eaſie to pretend as great need for this, as for intruding into the Magiſtrates office.</p>

               <p>The man falls out in wiſhing, <hi>that all Gods people were as</hi> Phineas, <hi>and had the ſame Spirit of holy Zeal; that by removal of the cauſe, his fierce anger againſt this poor Land might ceaſe:</hi> We ſhall eaſily concur with him, in wiſhing and praying that Gods people may be filled with zeal to his Glory, as <hi>Phineas</hi> was; but not that they ſhould have that ſame exerciſe of zeal that he had, nor follow his fact, unleſſe they could be certified of their warrand and calling to do ſo, as he was. The Apoſtles of Chriſt, are to us examples of zeal for God in their Miniſtery; but, who will ſay, that the acts which they zealouſly did, by vertue of their extraordinary calling, are for our imitation, albeit their zeal be? <hi>Peter</hi> in zeal to Gods honour, killed

But this Libeller inſiſts upon the matter of private mens uſurping the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates place, not only in the firſt part of his Book, ſpeaking in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to our firſt Reformation and Way of it, which he brings to juſtifie preſent inſurrections; but in the latter part, p. 151.152. he will have private men taking the puniſhing and reforming ſword in their hands againſt all Magiſtrates, and ſayes expreſly, <hi>people of inferior de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, may ſtep forward to occupy the places and aſſert the intereſts, which wicked Rulers have forfeited and deſerted; And this,</hi> he ſayes, <hi>is according to the Covenant, where they ſwear in their places and callings, to endeavour reformation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which clauſe,</hi> (he ſayes) <hi>is to be taken, not reſtrictively, but</hi> (as he ſpeaks) <hi>the clauſe is exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getick and ampliative, and that the ſenſe is, that if others in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective places, concur in advancing the work, every one ſhall confine himſelf to his own place and calling; but if theſe in higher employment fail in their oath, it is the place and calling of private perſons to reform or remove them, and ſtep in and occupy their places.</hi> Thus the profane Juglar, (if he will deſervedly take the ſtile, which he undeſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gives his oppoſites, p. 54) makes a Welch-mans hoſe of the words of the Covenant, to provoke people to intruſion in the Magiſtrates office. Who ever heard of ſuch a thing, that theſe words (<hi>in our places and callings</hi>) do not reſtrict private mens endeavours to wayes fit for their places and callings? What a ſtrange exigeſis or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, (as he calls it) is that of our endeavours in our places and callings to reform, <hi>i. e. That we ſhall go out of our places and callings, to reform? and being private men, ſhall occupy the Magiſtrates place and remove him and puniſh him; or, that private men only did ſwear conditionally to act in their places and callings, ſo long as they in eminency acted in their places and callings for Religion, with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, to run out of our places and callings, when they deſerted and abuſed theirs?</hi> What Jeſuitical jugling, in the matter of the Oath, is this?

               <p>O! But he builds much upon the practice of our firſt Reformers, and <hi>Phineas</hi> fact muſt juſtifie that, and that muſt juſtifie all modern inſurrections. As to the work of Reformation of Religion, at firſt in this Land, it is our deſire to ſpeak honourably of it, ſo far as we can with truth. Bleſſed be God for that great work of bringing in his Truth amongſt us, and delivering us from the dark and miſerable bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of antichriſtian Tyranny; and he who delivered us, keep us from returning to that houſe of Egyptian bondage: But we cannot (hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the truth) juſtifie all courſes that were uſed then for carrying on the work of Reformation; neither are we much concerned ſo to do. If ſome inſtruments thereof were guilty of ſedition or ſacriledge, or ſelf-ſeeking, (while the work of God was in hands) what is that to us, who own the reſult of the work as good, great and glorious, through the Lords marvelous operation? If ſinful courſes were then uſed by men, the mercy of God, in the reſult of the work, was to us the more marvelous, and the fuller of glorious Grace, that God did not, for the diſorders of inſtruments, diſappoint the work, and leave us deſtitute of the Goſpel-light. We may ſay, as the blind man in the Goſpel who had his eyes opened, ſaid, <hi>Whether he was a ſinner that opened his eyes or not, he knew not: but this he knew, that whereas he was blind, now he did ſee,</hi> Joh. 9.25. So, whither they who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental in our Reformation, ſinned in their way or not, we are not much concerned to enquire: But we know, that through Gods good guiding, a merciful work, in the reſult was wrought to them and to us, which work we own and cleave to, and will (through grace) do ſo to the end; it is an ordinary matter for the all-wiſe providence of God, to bring forth, out of mens dark and diſorderly actings, great works of light and order. The Saviour of the world was crucified by wicked hands; yet, the reſult was the redemption of the world. How many Miniſters go to hell, for their unſincere handling of Gods Word, and miſcarriages in their life; yet, God makes uſe of his own Ordinance in their hands, to bring Souls to Heaven, notwithſtanding of their corrupt manner of dealing in his holy things. A leprous hand
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:99891:70"/>
may ſow good ſeed, but he were a fool of the firſt magnitude, who would either make a panegyrick in praiſe of a leprous hand, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade all that ſow good ſeed to have ſuch hands. Heirs of glory may be gotten in baſtardy, or fornication and adultery; and yet theſe are not good, but evil. Let God be glorified, who in his wiſdom brings order out of confuſion, and light out of darkneſs. But, let us not ſtand ſuperſtitiouſly upon the juſtifying of all their deeds that went before us; nor indeavour to imitate and follow the ſame, further then they are according to Gods mind. <hi>Be ye not as your fathers,</hi> is a good rule when fathers fall off and deviate from the rule of God's will: we are not to live by examples, but by precepts; and if we will look to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, we want not theſe of the primitive Chriſtians to ſet before us, whoſe practices in bringing in Religion into the world, (wherein they never uſed any undutiful reſiſtance to, or violence upon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates) is more regardable by us, then any precedents in theſe dregs of time, and in the end of this corrupt world. Some have ſaid, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion would never have been reformed, if violence had not been uſed upon Magiſtrates: but, why ſhould men take on them to limite God? Hath he not ſhewed his power in ſeveral parts of the world, in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the hearts of ſupreme Magiſtrates, and cauſing them to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others in reformation of abuſes? and could he not ſo do alſo elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, without the aid of popular tumults, which are but evil exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to the poſterity? But men are too apt to be bold in ante-verting Gods way, and to follow their own carnal prudence and affections in that which they are ſet upon, and thereupon (when they proſper) to fancy a divine approbation of their way: ſo ſelf-loving are men or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily. But, let it be ſo, that much of the way of theſe who were at firſt inſtrumental in the Reformation in this Land, were juſtifiable upon the account of purging the Church from the horrid groſsneſs of idolatry, corruption of doctrine, tyranny and uſurpation over poor Souls, wherewith the man of ſin had for many ages, defiled and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened the poor Church; and upon the account of the open hoſtility to the Truth, wherein Magiſtrates then ſtood, together with the inbring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of forraign furious forces upon us, even to the heart of our Land. How unlike was the caſe then to what it is now? And how unable is the caſe now to bear the burthen of a concluſion for ſuch practices as then were uſed? Seing we can avow it, in the preſence of God, that we contend for that ſame Faith and Religion, that our Predeceſſors ſtood for againſt the powers of that time; and will maintain the ſame againſt all Novators, who upon account of a piece of Church-order,

allowed by our Reformers) now re-eſtabliſhed, inſtigate any private, perſons, who have power enough, to deſtroy all Magiſtracy and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Land, becauſe of the owning thereof; and to occupy their rooms, (as <hi>N.</hi> clearly doth) And then, forſooth, this man and his complies ſhall be in their places and callings, according to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, (as he expones it) when they get in to the Chair of Government, and all our Nobles and Magiſtrates driven into corners, or made to lacky theſe purely mortified States-men. In the <hi>Pictland-hill</hi> buſineſs, an Eſſay for this was made, but the party <hi>magnis excidit auſis.</hi> They had thoughts to repair their loſſes, and to make themſelves rich by a pure Reformation, getting all the intereſts of the Kingdom at one clap into their hands, (though perhaps they would have forced us to believe, that all their external gains had been but accidental conſequences of their heavenly deſigns.) But God rolled out of the way ſuch a ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ſnare to many, which might have ariſen from their ſucceſs; it was <hi>infoelix ſcelus,</hi> and ſo eſcaped the reputation of a Vertue, and of an heroical Exploit.</p>
