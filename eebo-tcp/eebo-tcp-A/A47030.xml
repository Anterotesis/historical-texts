            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>GALAT. II. 20.</bibl>
               <q>I am Crucified with Chriſt: Nevertheleſs I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: And the Life which I now live in the Fleſh, I live by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the ſixteenth Verſe of this Chapter, St. <hi>Paul</hi> lays down this comfortable Doctrine, <hi>All Men are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by the Faith of Chriſt, and not by the works of the Law.</hi> But ſome took occaſion from thence to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, That every Man might live as he liſt, and never mind good Works, becauſe he ſhould be certainly Saved by his Faith in Chriſt, though his Life were never ſo Bad. But St. <hi>Paul</hi> denies that any ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference could be juſtly made from that Doctrine. For then ſays he <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>Chriſt would be the Miniſter of Sin,</hi> by making us to renounce the Righteouſneſs of the Law, and leaving us to be a looſe and a lawleſs ſort of People. Yea, and I would make my ſelf a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor, by Preaching up ſuch a licentious way of living, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. Neither of which is true. For, neither is Chriſt the Miniſter, nor am I the Preacher, <hi>of Sin.</hi> For ſays he <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>I through the Law;</hi> that is, I underſtanding
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95066:3"/>
that the End of the Law is not to juſtifie, but to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Men of Sin, and to ſend them to Chriſt for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification: <hi>Am dead;</hi> that is, I am ſet at liberty and made free, as a Servant that is Dead is free from all the Bondage and Slavery that his Cruel Maſter was wont to put him to: <hi>Am dead to the Law;</hi> that is, I am freed from the rigour and hardſhip of the Law, which, like a ſevere Schoolmaſter, requir'd more of me than I was able to do: <hi>That I may live unto God;</hi> that is, though I am freed from the Law, and do not expect to be Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by it; yet, I do not intend to live a looſe and a lawleſs Life: but, to live unto God, to live a Life of Faith in Chriſt, to the Glory of God's free Grace.</p>
            <p>And when St. <hi>Paul</hi> had thus plainly and fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd this Objection, he preſently foreſaw another, which is this: If thou art juſtified by the Faith of Chriſt Crucified, then thou art Juſtified by his Death: And if thou art Juſtified by his Death, then thou art Crucified and Dead with him: And if thou art Crucified and Dead with him, how then comes it to paſs that thou art alive? To which he anſwers in theſe words, <hi>I am Crucified with Chriſt: nevertheleſs I live; yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when St. <hi>Paul</hi> had anſwer'd this Objection alſo, he preſently foreſaw another, which is this: <hi>We ſee that thou liveſt a natural Life, by Eating and Drinking, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as other Men do; and how then canſt thou ſay, that thou doſt not live, but that Chriſt liveth in thee?</hi> To which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95066:3"/>
he anſwers in theſe words, <hi>The Life which I now live in the Fleſh, I live by the Faith of the Son of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And leſt any Man ſhould be ſo ignorant, as not to know what this Faith of the Son of God is, he tells us expreſly, That it is not a Faith whereby a Man only believes the Love of Chriſt to Mankind in general; for ſuch a Faith, St. <hi>James</hi> tells us, the very Devils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have, <hi>who both believe and tremble:</hi> But it is a Faith, whereby a Man believes the Love of Chriſt to himſelf in particular. A Faith, whereby a Man can truly ſay of himſelf, I firmly believe that <hi>Chriſt loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I have ſhewn you what is the Connexion between the Text and the Verſes that are before it. And I now come to ſhew you what is the meaning of it. In order to which I am to acquaint you:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>I am Crucified with Chriſt,</hi> he does not ſay this of himſelf alone, as if it had been ſome extraordinary Privilege which he had above all other Chriſtians: but he ſays it in the Name of all true Believers, whoever and where-ever they are. He ſays it in thy name, and my name, and the name of every one here preſent, if we really and truly believe in Chriſt, and live up to our Belief. For what he here ſays in the ſingular number, <hi>I am Crucified with Chriſt,</hi> the ſame he ſays in the plural number, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4, 8. <hi>We are dead with Chriſt, and we are buried with Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I am to acquaint you, that there are two
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95066:4"/>
Selfs, or two Men in every ſingle Perſon that is a true Believer. The one Self is corrupted, and comes from <hi>Adam;</hi> the other Self is renew'd, and comes from Chriſt. The one is the New, and the other is the Old Man. And theſe two Selfs, or theſe two Men, do ſignifie two different Principles that are in one and the ſame Believer. The one Principle comes from corrupted Nature, and moves a Man to Sin; and the other Principle comes from renewed Nature, and moves him to Grace. And the truth of this is plain from the Text. For if St. <hi>Paul</hi> had not had theſe two Selfs, he could no more have ſaid, <hi>I am crucified, and yet I live,</hi> than one and the ſame Man can be ſaid to be dead and alive at one and the ſame time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I am to acquaint you, that when Chriſt was Crucified upon the Croſs, he did not endure that ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and curſed Death for his own, but for our ſake. What he did and ſuffer'd there, was not in a private, but a publick Capacity, as he was the Head, the Root, and the Repreſenter of all the Elect. And therefore, when Chriſt was Crucified, all true Believers were Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in and with him; as when <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, all men ſinned in him and with him; or as when <hi>Abraham</hi> paid Tythes to <hi>Melchiſedek, Levi,</hi> who was then in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Loins, and unborn, paid thoſe very Tythes in and with him,; or, to give you a more familiar Inſtance, as when a Member of Parliament gives his Voice there, the whole County or Corporation which he repreſents, is ſaid to give their Voice in and with him. And the Truth of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95066:4"/>
this alſo is plain from the Text. For it is almoſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen hundred Years ſince Chriſt was crucified, and neither St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who lived ſome few Years after his Crucifixion, nor we, who live ſo many Years after it, can ever be truly ſaid to be crucified with Chriſt, ſave only as he is our Head, and we are his Members, and he and we are one compleat and perfect Man, and all the Benefits of his Crucifixion are as really and truly ours, as if we our ſelves had all been actually Crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him in our own Perſons. And how hard and difficult ſoever this may ſeem to be; yet, let no Man in the leaſt doubt or queſtion the Truth of it. For, it is almoſt ſix thouſand Years ſince <hi>Adam</hi> Sinned: And we, who are at this vaſt diſtance of Time from him, are as really and truly guilty of his Sin, as if we our ſelves had all been alive when he lived, and had actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Sinned with him in our own Perſons. For ſays St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. v. 12, 19. <hi>All men have ſinned in Adam, and by Adam's diſobedience all men were made ſinners.</hi> And if the Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> who was only a meer Man, be really and truly our Sin, though we live ſo long a time after him: Then, ſhall not the Crucifixion of Chriſt, who was God as well as Man, be really and truly our Crucifixion, when it is but ſo ſhort a Time, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon to <hi>Adam's</hi> Sinning, ſince Chriſt was Crucified? For, is not Chriſt more able to ſave all the Elect, who are only a few, than <hi>Adam</hi> was to deſtroy all Mankind, who are ſo many? Yea verily. For, as the Apoſtle proves it at large, the miſchief we receive from
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95066:5"/>
               <hi>Adam's</hi> Tranſgreſſion, is not ſo great as the Benefit we receive from Chriſt's Crucifixion. For ſays St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. v. 15. <hi>The grace of Chriſt hath much more abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than the offence of Adam.</hi> And he gives the Reaſon for it, <hi>v.</hi> 16. For ſays he, <hi>the judgment was by one to condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; but, the free gift is of many offences unto juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> That is, the Offence of <hi>Adam</hi> only made Men guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of original Sin: But, the Grace of Chriſt, does not only pardon original Sin; but, it alſo pardons all the perſonal and actual Sins of all his People. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſince we have certainly Sinned with <hi>Adam</hi> in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe before we were born; let none of us, if we are true Chriſtians, make the leaſt doubt, but that we were alſo as certainly Crucified with Chriſt upon the Croſs, before we were Born.</p>
            <p>And now, having thus acquainted you with theſe three Things, the meaning of the Text, which could otherwiſe have never been underſtood, will be plain and eaſy to the moſt ignorant Man and Woman here preſent. For, when St. <hi>Paul</hi> here ſays, <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt,</hi> he tells us what he means by it, <hi>Rom.</hi> vi. 6. where he ſays, <hi>that our old Man is crucified with Chriſt;</hi> that is, the corrupted Self, or the corruption of Nature, which is commonly called Original Sin, is Crucified and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and put to Death in every Believer by the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion and Death of Chriſt. For, the condemning power of Original Sin has been long ſince wholly tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en away from us in our Juſtification, by which we were acquitted from it's Guilt and Puniſhment. The reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95066:5"/>
Power of Original Sin has been already in ſome meaſure, and is every Day more and more, taken away from us in our Sanctification, by which we conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and manfully fight againſt it, and weaken and leſſen it's Dominion. And the very being of Original Sin ſhall be wholly taken away from us in our Glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Heaven, where we ſhall all be one glorious Church, not having Spot or Wrinkle, but altogether Holy and without Blemiſh.</p>
            <p>And now you know what is meant by theſe Words, <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt,</hi> you will eaſily know the meaning of all the reſt. For, when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs I live,</hi> the meaning of it is this. Do not think, that I contradict my ſelf by ſaying, <hi>I am crucified, and yet I live:</hi> For, as I, according to my corrupted Self, am Crucified and dead unto Sin: So I, according to my renewed Self, am alive unto Righteouſneſs, and live unto God. My old Man is daily dying in me, and my new Man daily lives in me. My Sin grows weaker and weaker, and my Grace grows ſtronger and ſtronger.</p>
            <p>But, leſt this humble <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and great Extoller of God's free Grace, ſhould ſeem to have taken too much to himſelf, when he ſaid, <hi>Nevertheleſs I live,</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently do's as it were, correct himſelf, by ſaying in the next Words, <hi>yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me: And the life which I now live in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi> The meaning of which is this. It is true, that God never juſtifies a Man, and aquits him from the guilt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95066:6"/>
of his Sin, but he does alſo at the ſame time Sanctify him, and give him inherent Righteouſneſs, and put into him a new Principle of Action. But, this new Principle of Action is not ſo ſtrong and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as, of it's ſelf, to make a Believer do all his Duty without any further Aſſiſtance from Chriſt. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Righteouſneſs does not, cannot carry a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver through all, or indeed through any Chriſtian Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, unleſs Chriſt gives him both the Will and the Deed, unleſs he excites him to, inables him for, and makes him to perſevere in the Practice of every one of them. And therefore, notwithſtanding this new Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and this inherent Righteouſneſs, which every Believer has: Yet, there is not one Spiritual Action that any Believer does, or can do, but Chriſt does more in it, than the Believer himſelf does. Chriſt lives more in a Believer, than a Believer lives himſelf. For ſays St. <hi>Paul, I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me.</hi> For, Chriſt is the Life of every Believer, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> iii. 4. Yea, and he is alſo the very Bread of his Life; that is, the only means to preſerve it, <hi>John</hi> vi. 35. Chriſt gives us Life, when we are dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins; and Chriſt continues that Life to us, while we are alive; and without Chriſt we cannot have it one moment; no, not while I am ſpeaking this to you. For, what is ſaid of our Natural, is much more true of our Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, Life; In him we live, and move, and have our Being. We all live, <hi>yet not we, but Chriſt liveth in us.</hi>
            </p>

The ſum of what I have hitherto ſaid is this. We are juſtified by a lively Faith in Chriſt Crucified, and not by the Works of the Law. But, this our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Faith, does not make us to live a looſe and a lawleſs Life, neither does it hinder, but rather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote good Works. It makes us to live unto God, to live a Godly, a Righteous, and a ſober Life.</p>
            <p>And thus I have given you the true meaning of this moſt excellent and moſt comfortable Text of Scripture. And I now come to propoſe, to prove, and to apply the Doctrines that are contained in it.</p>
            <p>The firſt Doctrine is this. Every Believer is Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified with Chriſt. For ſays St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the Name of every Believer, <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt.</hi> And the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of it are ſuch as theſe. Chriſt is the Head of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Believer; and every Believer is a Member of Chriſt. And if the Head be Crucified, the Members cannot avoid Crucifixion. As when a Man's Head is cut off, not only his Head, but his Body, and all his Members die, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> i. 22, 23. compared with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 27. Chriſt is the Vine, and Believers are the Branches of that Vine. And if the Vine be cut down, and it's Root be plucked up, the Branches can no longer Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, but preſently Dry and Wither, <hi>John</hi> xv. 5, 6. Chriſt is the Repreſenter of all Believers. And when their Repreſenter is Crucified, they themſelves are Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified with him. For, <hi>Goliath</hi> was the Champion and the Repreſenter of all the <hi>Philiſtines.</hi> And when he was conquer'd by <hi>David,</hi> they alſo were conquer'd
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95066:7"/>
with him, and made Servants to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xvii. 9. Chriſt is the Surety of all Believers, and has paid off all the Debts which they owed to Almighty God, by fulfilling the Righteouſneſs of the Law in his Life, and by ſuffering the Curſe of the Law at his Death. And what a Man's Surety does, we all know, is the ſame in Law, as if the Man himſelf does it, <hi>Heb.</hi> vii. 22. And for theſe and the like Reaſons which we meet with in Scripture, we are not only Crucified with Chriſt, which ſeems very hard to a Natural Man: But, what ſeems to him much harder; we are alſo at this very Time riſen together with Chriſt from the Dead: Yea, and what ſeems to him much harder ſtill; we alſo at this very Time do ſit together with Chriſt in Heavenly Places on God's right Hand, by virtue of our Union and Communion with him, who is our Head, our Repreſenter, and our Surety, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> ii. 6. And indeed, whatever Chriſt is and has is all ours. His Incarnation, Paſſion, Reſurrection, Aſcention, and Interceſſion is all ours. His Wiſdom, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Sanctification, and Himſelf is all ours. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he had, did, and ſuffer'd was for our Sake and in our Stead. For, if it had been for himſelf: then, he had only paid his own, and not our Debt. As when a Man who is indebted himſelf, is alſo Surety for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Payment of his own perſonal Debt does not at all diſcharge his Suretiſhip. But, Chriſt had no perſonal Debt of his own to pay. For, he is God; and therefore, he is the Lord of the whole Law as well as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95066:7"/>
the Sabbath; and therefore, he is not a Debtour to the Law either in the whole or in part, ſave only as he freely made himſelf under the Law at his Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>To redeem them that were under the Law, that we might receive the Adoption of Sons, Mat.</hi> xii. 8. compared with <hi>Galat.</hi> iv. 4, 5. And that is the firſt Doctrine with it's Proof. The Application of it is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt of all.</hi> If Chriſt was Crucified for our Sake, and in our Stead, by the foreknowledge and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Council of God: Then, this ſhews us the miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Condition of every Man in the State of Nature. For, as that Debt muſt needs be extraordinary great, which nothing but the greateſt, nothing but an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Sum of Mony can diſcharge: So, the Miſery of Man in a Natural State muſt needs be extraordinary great, muſt needs be the greateſt that can be, when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the greateſt Ranſom, nothing but an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Price, nothing but the Blood of God, and the Crucifixion and Death of Chriſt, can recover a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Man from that otherwiſe irrecoverable Miſery. And now Chriſt is once Dead, he dieth no more, neither remaineth there any more Sacrifice for Sin, but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fearful looking for of Judgment and fiery Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſhall devour the Adverſaries, <hi>Rom.</hi> vi. 9. compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> x. 26, 27. And how then dareſt thou wilfully, habitually, and finally ſin againſt Chriſt, when there is no more <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and no more Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to be made or accepted for that Sin of thine, but thou muſt of neceſſity be undone, unavoidably undone for it for ever?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:95066:8"/>
               <hi>Again.</hi> This ſhews us, that we ſhould, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did, determine not to know any thing among you but Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>and him Crucified;</hi> that is, we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve in all our Preaching, to inſiſt chiefly, if not only, upon the Crucifixion of Jeſus Chriſt. For, if our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Miſery be ſo great, that before we have done any actual Fault, we are Born in Sin, and the Children of God's Wrath: And if nothing can redeem us from this our Natural Miſery, but only the Crucifixion of Jeſus Chriſt: Then certainly we ought to determine and to reſolve in all our Preaching, to ſet forth Jeſus Chriſt ſo evidently Crucified before the Eyes of all our Hearers, as if he were now hanging upon the <hi>Croſs</hi> here in all our Sight: That ſo, we may look upon him whom we have pierced, and mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only Son, and be in bitterneſs for him, as one that is in bitterneſs for his Firſt-born, <hi>Zechar.</hi> xii. 10. Oh my beloved Brethren, the Crucifixion of Jeſus Chriſt ought not to be Preached only upon Good-Friday: But, as we ought to die daily, ſo we ought to have the dying of Jeſus Chriſt daily before our Eyes. His Death and our own Death ſhould be our daily and our whole Study: And then we could ſcarce ever do amiſs. For, if a Miniſter could always look upon Jeſus Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified upon the <hi>Croſs,</hi> could he ever neglect to feed his Lambs, and to feed his Sheep, inſtructing the Young by Catechizing, and the Old by Preaching? Could he ever think it too much to Catechize and to Preach to that Pariſh, for which he ſees Chriſt is Crucified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95066:8"/>
his Eyes? Could he ever think it too much to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techize and to Preach to that Pariſh in his own Perſon, for which he ſees Chriſt is crucified in his own Perſon? For, who can ever think his own perſonal catechizing or preaching to be worth more than Chriſt's own perſonal Crucifixion and Death? I ſpeak to wiſe Men. Judg ye what I ſay. But, be ſure to judge righteous Judgment. Be ſure to judge, that ye your ſelves do not love Chriſt in Reality and in Truth, unleſs ye perſonally feed his Lambs by catechiſing the young, and perſonally feed his Sheep by preaching to the old, People committed to your Charge. <hi>John</hi> 21. 15, 16, 17. <hi>And if ye do not love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ye all know, <hi>that ye are curſed with a Curſe, ye are Anathema Maran-atha,</hi> 1 Cor. 16. 22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> This ſhews us the great Love of God and of Chriſt to poor miſerable Sinners. For, if God had had ten thouſand Sons, and he had only given us one of them to be crucified for us, this had been very great Love in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: But, when God had only one Son, only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and only beloved, was it not the Heighth of Love, to give him to be crucified for us Men, for us Sinners, for us Enemies, for us Rebels, in actual and open War againſt Heaven and him? And was it not the Heighth of Love for that Son of his to ſuffer himſelf to be crucified for us? Yea verily. For, <hi>greater Love hath no Man than this, that a Man lay down his Life for his Friends, Joh.</hi> 15. 13. And how then canſt thou find in thy Heart to ſin againſt Chriſt, who was crucified for thee? Canſt thou be ſo ungrateful as to cut his Throat, who ſaved thee from
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95066:9"/>
hanging? Doſt thou not call to mind how Chriſt ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and prayed, and bled, and died for thee? And canſt thou be unconcerned? Canſt thou laugh at all this? Doſt thou not remember what Chriſt ſays, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1. 12. Is it nothing to you all ye that paſs by? Behold and ſee, if there be any Sorrow like unto my Sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me, in the Day of his fierce Anger. And canſt thou be unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Canſt thou laugh at all this too? Is it not enough that Chriſt was once crucified for thee, but wilt thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo crucify him a-freſh, wilt thou crucify him every Day, wilt thou crucifie him every Moment of the Day, wilt thou crucify him on his own Day, and in his own Houſe; in the very Church it ſelf; in the preſence of God, Angels, and Men, by thy wilful and preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſinning againſt him? Oh how ill is Chriſt uſed by Ignorant and Atheiſtical Men, ſeeing you who are Learned Men, and Clergy-Men treat him thus barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly! Oh how abominably is Chriſt ridiculed in the Houſe of his Foes, ſeeing he is thus inhumanly entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Houſe of his Friends, thoſe who wait at his Altar, and diſpence the ſacred Symbols of his Body and Blood!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> This ſhews us the great Hatred of God againſt Sin: For, Chriſt had no Sin of his own. <hi>He never ſinned, neither was Guilt found in his Mouth,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 22. And yet, becauſe he became Surety to God for the Sins of other Men, God made him to be crucified for them. And how then dareſt thou adventure to live in any one known and wilful Sin? For, if God ſpared not his own Son, but
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95066:9"/>
made him to be crucified for the Sins of other Men that were only imputed to him: How much leſs will he ſpare thee, who art not his Son, but his Enemy; and haſt not only the imputed Sins of other Men to anſwer for, but art alſo accountable for thine own perſonal and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Tranſgreſſions? And if the Hatred of God againſt Sin be ſo great, ſo exceeding great; how then canſt thou reckon any Sin of thine to be a little Sin, or a venial Sin? For, is any Sin little or venial, that is committed againſt an infinite God? Is any Sin little or venial, that made Chriſt to be crucified? What Sins of thine canſt reckon to be leſs, or more venial, than thy idle Words, and thy idle Thoughts, and thoſe firſt ſinful Motions of thy Heart, which thou never gaveſt thy Conſent to, which are all forbid in the tenth Commandment? And yet, all theſe thy Sins, whatever thou thinkeſt of them, are ſo far from being little or venial in their own Nature, that they make Chriſt to be trucified, and will certainly make thee to be damned, if thou art not cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified with Chriſt. And if theſe Sins of thine, which thou takeſt to be ſo little and ſo venial, be yet ſo dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, as to make Chriſt to be crucified, and thee to be damned: Oh good God! what will become of thee for thoſe Sins of thine, which thou thy ſelf alloweſt to be great, groſs, and damnable, thy drinking, ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whoring, and ſabbath-breaking?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> This ſhews us the great Obligation that lies upon us Chriſtians to be like unto Chriſt in all his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, if ever he be pleaſed to call us to ſuffer for him
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95066:10"/>
or his. For, was Chriſt crucified for thee, and wilt not thou be crucified for him, if need be? But alas, alas! How like is it that thou wilt be crucified for Chriſt his Sake, when thou canſt not endure to be nick-named, or to be called a Fool, or a Puritan for his Sake? How like is it that thou wilt loſe thy Eſtate or thy Life for Chriſt his Sake, when thou wilt not leave off ſo much as one of thy Sins, or one of thy Luſts, or one of thy adulterous Looks, and laſcivious Glances, even in Church, for his Sake? But, what do I talk of thy being willing to be crucified for Chriſt and his Followers, when there is nothing in the whole World that thou art more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to perſecute and to crucify than Chriſt and a good Chriſtian? For, what is it that thou curſeſt and ſweareſt by, almoſt every Word thou ſpeakeſt, but the Blood and Wounds of the bleſſed Jeſus, by which alone thou art to be ſaved, if ever thou ſhalt be ſaved? And what is this but perſecuting and crucifying of Chriſt? And if any good Chriſtian, whoſe very Heart and Fleſh trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to hear thy Blaſphemies, comes by, and reproves thee for thy curſing and ſwearing, and threatens to have thee before a Magiſtrate, does not thine Anger preſently riſe up againſt him, and art not thou ready to perſecute and to crucify him, for endeavouring to ſave thee from ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ruin? Doſt not thou abuſe him where-ever thou goeſt, and doſt not thou call him a pragmatical Fellow, and a preciſe Fool, for meddling and making with other Mens Buſineſs? And does not this argue, that there is nothing in the whole World, that thou art more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95066:10"/>
to perſecute and to crucify, than Chriſt and a good Chriſtian? And how like then art thou to be willing to be crucified for him and his?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If every Believer be crucified with Chriſt: Then, this ſhews us how every Man may know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be a Believer or no. For, if a Man be crucified up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Croſs, or hanged upon a Gallows, for Robbing or Murder: Then he never robs nor murders any again. For <hi>he that hath ſuffered in the Fleſh and is dead, is freed from, and hath ceaſed to ſin, Rom.</hi> 6. 7. compared with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 1. And if thou art a true Believer, and crucified with Chriſt, thou wilt never commit thoſe Sins hereafter, which thou has been guilty of heretofore. For, ſays St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>How ſhall we, that are dead to Sin, live any longer therein?</hi> And therefore, as it is a true Sign, that a Man is not truly Dead, when he Eats, and Drinks, and does as he was wont to do: So it is a true Sign that a Man is not a true Believer, and crucified with Chriſt, when he follows thoſe wicked Courſes, and keeps that bad Company, and is always gadding abroad from Houſe to Houſe, and lives ſuch an idle Gentleman Life, as he was always wont to do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> If a Man be dead, threaten him as much as you will, and he never minds it, make him as many fair Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes as you will, and he never minds you; offer him Meat, and he'll not touch it; Drink, and he'll not taſte it; Preferment, and he'll not accept it; Beauty, and he'll not look upon it: Offer him all the Luſt of the Eye, the Luſt of the Fleſh, and the Pride of Life, and it is all one
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95066:11"/>
to him, as if you offer'd him juſt nothing; for he is dead to it all. And if thou art a true Believer, and crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Chriſt, it will be juſt thus with thee too. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes cannot intice, and Threatnings cannot affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en thee from thy Duty. Profit, Pleaſure, and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot ſhake thy unalterable Reſolutions, nor make thee think, ſpeak, or act againſt thy Conſcience. If any one ſays ill of thee, thou art dead, and doſt not hear it; and if any one does ill to thee, thou art dead, and doſt not feel it. And as a true Believer, who is crucified with Chriſt, is thus crucified and dead to the World; ſo is the World crucified and dead to him. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 14. It is dead to him; <hi>that is,</hi> it has no Life, no Reliſh, no Beauty, and no Pleaſure in it: But, it is as unſavoury and as unpleaſant to him, as a dead Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe that ſtinks and rots upon the Earth. Now take me a Man whoſe whole Delight is in Hunting and Horſe-Racing, and preſent him with the beſt dead Dog, or the beſt dead Horſe that ever was, full of Stench and Rottenneſs; and does he take any Delight in them? Or take me a Man, whoſe whole Delight is in Women, and preſent him with the beſt dead Woman that ever was, the greateſt Beauty, the greateſt Wit, and the greateſt Fortune; and does he take any Delight in her, or does not her Stench and Rottenneſs make him to loath her, and to have her buried under Ground out of his Sight and ſmelling? And if thou art a true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and crucified with Chriſt, it will be juſt thus with thee too. The whole World, and what is moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95066:11"/>
in it, will be crucified and dead to thee. Thy very Knowledge and Learning, which once made thee ſo great in thine own, and other Men's Eyes, will become dead to thee, and thou wilt reckon it all Ignorance and Nonſenſe, in Compariſon with the Wiſdom of Chriſt crucified. Yea, and thy very Goodneſs and Righteouſneſs, by which thou didſt once hope to be ſaved, will become dead to thee, and thou wilt reckon it all Droſs and Dung, and as filthy as a menſtruous Rag, in Compariſon with the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, <hi>Iſa.</hi> lxiv. 6. compared with <hi>Phil.</hi> iii. 8, 9.</p>
            <p>And now let every Man and Woman here preſent, lay their Hands to their Hearts, and conſider ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not after the Manner of Hypocrites and Diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers with God, whether they be thus crucified with Chriſt, yea or no; and whether they be thus crucified to the World, and the World be thus crucified to them, yea or no. I call Heaven and Earth to witneſs againſt you this Day; yea, and I appeal even to your own heardened and ſeared Conſciences, who thus pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly proclaim your Sins like <hi>Sodom,</hi> whether you be in this crucified Condition, yea or no. Oh how ſcandalous is your Behaviour, when you are out of Church, when it is thus notoriouſly wicked when you are in it? And how can any of your Hearers believe a word of what you Preach to them, or give the leaſt Attention to your Sermons, when you your ſelves do thus openly Laugh and Scoff at the moſt tremendous and the moſt fundamental Article of our Religion, the Crucifixion of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95066:12"/>
the bleſſed Jeſus? Was ever the Croſs of Chriſt eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a greater Stumbling-block or Folly than it is at this very moment? Oh how can you be ſo light and vain, when God is ſo Angry, as to put Chriſt to Death, the Death of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> for thoſe very Sins which you now make a mock of?</p>
            <p>Oh my beloved Brethren, I beg of you all for Chriſts ſake, that you would learn to be Serious, and in order to that, that you would do this one thing for me; and if the greateſt Enemy that I have among you all, ſhould deſire me to do ten Thouſand times as much for him, I would readily do it for him upon my Knees with all my Heart. I beg of you all for Chriſt his ſake, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you ſee a dead Corps, or hear a Paſſing-bell, or are at a Funeral, not to ſpend that precious Time of your Life in the Houſe of Mourning, about meer toys and trifles, in hearing and telling News, or ſome idle and impertinent Stories; but, ſpend it all in making ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and ſuch ſeaſonable Reflexions as theſe, upon your ſelves and thoſe that are with you. Every Believer is Crucified with Chriſt. And every one that is Crucified with Chriſt, muſt be like this Dead Corps here before us. He muſt be Crucified to the World, and the World muſt be Crucified to him. Am I thus? Or art thou thus? Or is any one of us thus? O Lord make us all thus, that are not thus already for Chriſt his ſake! And I do here tell you all in the Preſence of Almighty God, that if you ſeriouſly and conſtantly make theſe and the like wholeſom Reflexions upon your ſelves and thoſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95066:12"/>
that are with you at Funerals, you will gain more by them in a ſhort Time, than you loſe by the Death of your Friend, though your loſs of him be never ſo great. Try this Conſcienciouſly when you will, and I will be bound to be your Bond-Slave, if you do not find it to be true.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> If every Believer be Crucified with Chriſt: then, no Believer has any juſt Reaſon to complain of the Original Sin which he derives from <hi>Adam.</hi> For, if he Sinned with <hi>Adam</hi> before he was Born, he was alſo Crucified with Chriſt before he was Born. And, not only the Original Sin, which comes from <hi>Adam,</hi> is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by the Crucifixion of Chriſt; but, all the actual and perſonal Sins of a Believer are alſo pardoned by it. And, as the pardon, which a Believer has by Chriſt's Crucifixion, exceeds the Sin, which he has by <hi>Adam's</hi> Tranſgreſſion: So, the Righteouſneſs which he has by Chriſt, exceeds the Righteouſneſs which he loſt by <hi>Adam.</hi> For, <hi>Adam's</hi> Righteouſneſs was at beſt but the Righteouſneſs of a meer Man: But, the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is the Righteouſneſs of a more noble and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perſon. It is the Righteouſneſs of him that is God as well as Man. And therefore, it is expreſly called the Righteouſneſs of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 22. compared with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 21. And, pray mark it, is not the Mercy, that pardons all Sins, greater than the Curſe, that only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails one Sin upon us? And is not the Righteouſneſs of God greater and better than the Righteouſneſs of Man? And conſequently, what juſt Reaſon of Complaint has
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95066:13"/>
any Believer for what he loſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> ſeeing Chriſt has made him a gainer by his loſs?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly.</hi> If every Believer be Crucified with Chriſt: then, Chriſt is Crucified with every Believer in all the Loſſes, and Croſſes, and Troubles, which fall upon him in this World. For ſays Chriſt unto <hi>Saul,</hi> while he perſecutes the Believers, <hi>Act.</hi> ix. 4, 5. <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me? I am Jeſus whom thou perſecuteſt. It is hard for thee to kick againſt the Pricks.</hi> Where you ſee that though Chriſt was then in Heaven, and ſo could not poſſibly be Perſecuted in his own Perſon by ſinful Men upon Earth: Yet, he looked upon the Perſecution of Believers to be his own Perſecution. Chriſt is Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted when a Believer is Perſecuted. Chriſt is Crucified when a Believer is Crucified. And, as it happens with an Ox or an Aſs, that kicks againſt the Pricks, or againſt the Goad, he hurts himſelf but not the Goad: So it is with every one that Perſecutes a Believer, he kicks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Pricks, he kicks againſt the Goad, he kicks againſt Chriſt, and he hurts himſelf more than the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever. For, he damns his own Soul, while he hurts, or perhaps kills, the Believers Body. And therefore, a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is compared to a great and <hi>a burdenſom Stone,</hi> and to <hi>a hearth of fire among Wood,</hi> and to <hi>a torch of fire in a ſheaf of Corn,</hi> Zechar. xii. 3, 6. And, as a Man that ſtrikes a great heavy Stone with his Fiſt, is himſelf more hurt by ſtriking, than the Stone is by being ſtruck: And, as a Hearth, or a Torch of Fire burns up the Wood, or the Sheaf of Corn, that is thrown upon it,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95066:13"/>
to put it out: So, every Man that Perſecutes a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, is himſelf more hurt than the Believer is. For, whenever a Perſecution is raiſed againſt a Believer, Chriſt ſteps in between it and him, and he takes the greateſt part of it upon himſelf, and lets only a little of it to light upon him. And he that Perſecutes Chriſt muſt needs come by the worſt on't, you may be ſure; as he that ſtrikes againſt a Stone, a Hearth, or a Torch of Fire. And therefore, as Chriſt partakes with a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever in his Sufferings: So, a Suffering Believer has the Honour to be a partaker of the Sufferings of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and he fills up that which is behind of the Afflictions of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his Fleſh, for his Bodies ſake, which is the Church, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> iv. 13. compared with <hi>Coloſ.</hi> i. 24. And therefore, whenever thou calleſt a Believer a Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, becauſe his good Life reproaches by bad Life, thou doſt really call Chriſt a Hypocrite whenever thou calleſt a Believer a troubleſom balling Fellow, becauſe he always tells thee of, and reproves thee for thy Sin, thou doſt really call <hi>Chriſt</hi> a troubleſom balling Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Whenever thou laugheſt at a Believer in Church, at Home, in the Streets, or any where elſe, thou doſt really Laugh at Chriſt; and thy Laughter will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly end in Weeping, and Wailing, and gnaſhing of Teeth. And whenever thou preferreſt a Rich Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner before a Poor Believer, thou doſt really and truly prefer the Devil, who dwelleth and worketh in that Rich Sinner, before Chriſt, who dwelleth and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in that Poor Believer. And how ought this to

terrify and to keep all wicked Men from abuſing Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, becauſe they thereby abuſe Chriſt himſelf, and provoke him to take Vengeance on them? And how ought this to comfort and to cheriſh all Poor Believers under all the Abuſes which are put upon them by a baſe ungrateful World, becauſe Chriſt himſelf is at the ſame time abuſed with them, and crucified with them, and partakes of all their Afflictions, and helps them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, and inables them to bear them, and brings them out of them, and rewards them for them with unſpeakable Joy and Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly and Laſtly,</hi> If every Believer be crucified with Chriſt: Then let all here preſent, who love to have the Word of God plainly expounded, and applied home to their Hearts and Conſciences: Let all ſuch ſerious Perſons turn to the 2 <hi>Kings</hi> iv. 34, 35. and there you will find, that when the <hi>Shunamite</hi>'s Child was Dead, the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> went and lay upon him, and put his Mouth upon his Mouth, and his Eyes upon his Eyes, and his Hands upon his Hands, and he ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf upon him, and his Fleſh waxed warm, and he came to life. And juſt thus let every Believer here preſent do by Chriſt crucified. Let him by Faith ſtretch and ſpread himſelf upon the Croſs of Chriſt, and put his Mouth to Chriſt's Mouth, and his Eyes to Chriſt's Eyes, and his Hands to Chriſt's Hands, and his Heart to Chriſt's Heart, and thereby he will feel in himſelf the Death of Sin, and the Life of Grace, to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95066:14"/>
warm and inflame his dead Heart. If a Believer finds that he is apt to offend with his Mouth, let him by Faith put his Mouth upon the Mouth of Chriſt crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Chriſt will make one of the Seraphims to fly unto him, having a live Coal in his Hand, taken from the Altar, and he will lay it upon his Mouth, and ſay unto him, <hi>Lo, this hath touched thy Lips, and thine Iniquity is taken away, and thy Sin is purged, Iſa.</hi> vi. 6, 7. If a Believer finds that he is apt to offend with his Eyes, let him by Faith put his Eyes upon the Eyes of Chriſt crucified, and Chriſt will cauſe him to make a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with his Eyes, ſo that he ſhall not think upon a Maid, becauſe of the Deſtruction and the ſtrange Puniſhment, which God brings upon the Adulterer, above all other Sinners, <hi>Job</hi> xxxi. 1, 3. If a Believer finds that he is apt to offend with his Hands, let him by Faith put his Hands upon the Hands of Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, and Chriſt will take his Hands, and will thruſt them into his pierced Side, and will put his Fingers into the Print of the Nails, and will make him leave off ſmiting with the Fiſt of Wickedneſs, and as ready to relieve as he was before to oppreſs the Poor, <hi>Job.</hi> xx. 25, 27. If a Believer finds that he is apt to offend with his Heart, let him by Faith put his Heart upon the Heart of Chriſt crucified, and Chriſt will take his Heart, and purify it by Faith, <hi>Acts</hi> xv. 9. And ſo he may do with all the other Members of his Body, and the Faculties of his Soul, and he ſhall certainly have the ſame Succeſs with them all. For, if
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95066:15"/>
               <hi>Eliſha</hi> reſtored a natural Life to a Child that was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Dead, by applying the Parts of his Body to the Parts of that Child's Body; then, ſhall not the God of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> ſhall not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, reſtore a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Life to a Soul that is ſpiritually Dead, when it is applied and united to him by a lively Faith?</p>
            <p>And when a Believer does thus truly believe in Chriſt crucified, and does thus experimentally feel himſelf to be crucified with him; the Death of Chriſt mortifying his Body of Sin, and the Life of Chriſt quickning his dead Soul: Then, the Believer finds what it is indeed to be crucified with Chriſt: then, his Soul is raviſhed with Joy, and his Heart is filled with Comfort. And when he lies ſick upon his Death-Bed, and the Devil comes and tells him of the Law, which he has broken: He preſently tells the Devil again, that he is crucified with Chriſt, and Chriſt has long ſince blotted out the Law with all its Hand-writing, and nailed it to his Croſs; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Law can affect him no more, than a Bill or a Bond that has been long ſince paid and cancelled, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> ii. 14. And when the Devil comes and tells him far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he will drag him into Hell, to receive the due Wages of his Sin, eternal Death: He preſently tells the Devil again, that he is not only crucified with Chriſt, and dead with Chriſt, and buried with Chriſt; but, that he has alſo long ſince deſcended into Hell with Chriſt, and there ſpoiled all his Principalities and Powers, and made a Shew of them openly tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing

            <p>Oh! What will you give, ye Mockers and Scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, to have a true Intereſt in theſe two Texts of Scripture, and to be able to apply them truly to your own Souls, when you ſay the Creed in your Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and are ready to deſpair when ye come to die! But, when a Believer comes to die, who does believe with full Aſſurance of Faith, that he is freed from the Curſe of the Law, the Power of Sin, the Sting of Death, the Captivity of the Devil, and the Fear of Hell: How can ſuch a one, though never ſo much perſecuted and tried with cruel Mockings; How can he but ſtand with great Boldneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Face of thoſe that have afflicted him, and made no Account of his Labours, and bear his Teſtimony againſt them? How can he be afraid to die, though Death come upon him with all its Terror. Yea, how can he but even long to die, and deſire to be diſſolved, that as he has been crucified with Chriſt, he may be alſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with Chriſt, and find Death to be nothing elſe to him, but what Chriſt himſelf found it, a ſhort and a quick Paſſage to a Joyful and a Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reſurrection? Which God of his infinite Mercy, grant to every one of us here preſent, for Chriſt his Sake, who was crucified for our Offences, and was raiſed again for our Juſtification.</p>
