            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE MY VERY ESPE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall good Lord, Thomas Baron of Buckhurst, Lord high Treasurer of England, one of the LL. of her Maiesties most honorable Priuie Counsell, Knight of the honorable Order of the Garter, and Chauncellour of the Vniuersitie Of Oxford.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is now more then a whole yere, Right Honorable, since that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the slendernesse of that abilitie, which God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto me, I brought to an end these few Lectures vppon the Prophet Ionas. In all which time being doubtful, whether I should publish this small Treatise to the view of the world, or no; &amp; sometimes in mine owne mind resoluing for it, and sometimes against it, I haue at the last aduentured to let it see the Sunne, by an open imparting thereof vnto other. VVherein my assured hope and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is, that the same holy and gracious Spirite which first moued me to vndertake this worke, and by litle and litle hath enabled me to bring it to this passe, will also giue that blessing thereunto, that it shall not be vtterly vnprofitable to the Church, but that such as are indifferent Readers,
<pb facs="tcp:623:3"/>
may some in one kinde, and some in another, reape such frute, as that thereby they may be strengthened to continue on their iourney to euerlasting happinesse. For the better accomplishing whereof, according as the text hath yeelded me occasion, I haue laboured seuerally: sometimes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the ignorant, sometimes to comfort the weake, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to settle the doubtfull, some other times to encorage on to vertue, and oftentimes to beate downe vice and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, which in this later age euery where aboundeth. To which purposes as God did diuerse wayes make me know in the first vttering thereof, that it returned not altogether frutelesse, so I trust that it wil please the same guide of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth farther to blesse it, that in this course now intended by me, it may yet also be a meanes, to multiply and increase the Lords seruice in some persons more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully.</p>
            <p>But being now to commend it to the consideration and perusing of manie other, I do first present it to the good and fauourable acceptation of your Lordship, as hauing the principall and most speciall interest therein: for besides that it had his birth and growth in that Vniuersitie, vvhose sterne vnder our most gracious Soueraigne your Lordship doth with great wisedome rule, and therefore may cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge it for the places sake, as belonging in a generall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to your Lordships protection: The Authour thereof is in dutie so specially and particularly bounden to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, that in right he must acknowledge the continuance and progresse of his studies, for these manie yeares to haue rested and relyed solely on your Honourable fauour. In which respect he amongst manie others, hath great cause to giue praise and thankes to the Almightie for your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships high aduauncement in this State; in as much as he
<pb facs="tcp:623:3"/>
apparantly findeth, and by experience knoweth, that after a desire to do faithfull seruice to her sacred Maiestie, to administer iustice to the Subiect, and to be as a father in hearing the complaints of the poore, it is not the least care which your Lordship hath, to helpe and preferre in Church and Common-wealth, such as haue or do depend vpon your Honour. Amongst whom I should be verie forgetfull and vnthankfull, if I did not to my vttermost let all men vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, with how honourable regard your Lordship hath bene pleased now for diuerse yeares to looke vpon me, and of your Lordships owne disposition, at euery first occasion so to thinke on my preferment, as I had no reason in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit to looke for, or any way expect. But in this as in many other matters, your Lordship doth let the world see, that there is nothing more proper to personages truly honorable, then to do honorable deedes: and thereupon it is, that with this extraordinarie respect your Lordship hath both inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and affected not a litle for my good. An example for the matter verie rare, in this barren age wherein we now liue: but to the maner of the happie accomplishing thereof both my selfe and diuerse other are so priuie, that we must confesse it to be a singular consideration of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, so to begin and consummate the same, that all men might see the thankes, only to belong to your Lordship, and that no second person hath had anie finger, in that which hitherto I haue receiued.</p>
            <p>In gratefull representation of my remembrance herein, I bring this litle gift: and as thereby I conceale not from anie, how deepely vnder God and my Soueraigne I am obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to your Honor, so otherwise I shall euer be readie with all my power to do your Lordship seruice, thinking my selfe happie, when I may perfourme anie thing, which may te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
<pb facs="tcp:623:4"/>
my respectiue and dutifull affection.</p>
            <p>God Almightie long preserue her most gracious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, the onely fountaine vpon earth of all our felicitie. God Almightie blesse your Lordship, that the Common-wealth for many yeares may enioy such a Counseller, and this Vniuersitie so Honorable a Patrone.</p>

As, the horriblenesse of sin, which was able within fortie dayes to plucke downe an vtter desolation, on so famous a citie as Niniue was. Gods loue in forewarning them who dwelt in that place, that they might be spared: the Prophets foule fall, and his strange punishment for it: his of-wardnesse from God, and Gods fauourable inclination euermore to him: the regard which the King of Niniue and his people did beare to Gods iudgements when they were denounced: the free par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of the Lord, and his remitting of their sinne vpon their ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest repentance. The subordinate circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stances do yeeld as good doctrine as the maine storie it selfe, and from them both, this thing of note is collected, that our Sauiour Christ in two seueral
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:623:5"/>
matters, doth take occasion to draw his similitudes or compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons from this Prophecie; which is not obserued of farre greater bookes.<note place="margin">Luk. 11.32.</note> The one of them is in the 11. of Luke, <hi>The men of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuy shall rise in iudgement with this generation, &amp; shall condemne it, for they repented at the preaching of Ionas, and behold a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then Ionas is here.</hi> The other is in the twelfth of Mathew, <hi>As Ionas was three dayes and three nights in the whales belly,<note place="margin">Math. 12.40.</note> so shall the sonne of man be three dayes and three nights in the heart of the earth.</hi> Here our Prophet was a figure of the Redeemer of the world, and in that did liuely expresse him. And some thinke that another thing in him, did as liuely paint out a second matter in our Sauiour Christ, that as Ionas preaching long to the people of Israel, and doing litle good there, by reason of the stubburn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of that nation, was sent vnto Niniue a citie in Assyria, to men strangers from the couenant; so Christ by himselfe and by his Apostles, laying open to the Iewes the will of his father, and finding nothing but vnthankfulnesse to be the frute of his paines, should turne away his loue and affection from them, and bestow it on the Gentiles. Now as this may agree with the analogie of faith, &amp; may be deduced not vnfitly out of the text, so to thinke that all the prophecie may allegorically be applied vnto Christ, (wherein some of the old fathers were too too much credulous) were to straine the storie too farre, and indeed it may not be, as Hierome hath well noted on the third verse of this Chapter.<note place="margin">Hieron. in Ion. 1.3. <hi>Ionas propheta non absque pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riculo interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantis, totus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferri ad Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num poterit.</hi>
               </note> And therefore in that proceeding which God shall send vnto me in the opening of this Prophecie, my purpose is to follow the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the text, and to lay downe the doctrine of it with conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient application, but without allegories Origenicall or wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings at all.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The time wherein our Prophet did liue, should seeme to be soone after the death of Elizeus, in as much as he did prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of Ieroboam the later, the sonne of Ioas, that he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store, or recouer againe the coasts of Israel which were lost. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam restored the coast of Israel,</hi>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:623:5"/>

Nay those who were verie auncient, and verie learned withall, haue rehearsed it vncontrolled, as Epiphanius, and S. Hierome in his Preface to this Prophecie. Thus an opinion once begun, doth go from hand to hand, receiued without discussing, and from error in one man groweth error in another.</p>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed it, not naming any such matter in the Scripture, (where notwithstanding is oftentimes speech of Ionas) it were a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble argument against that their assertion. For when the maister is silent, why should the seruant speake? When God saith no such matter, why should any man affirme it? especially since to vtter it, had bene for a solemne remembrance of Gods glorie, and it might haue procured to Ionas, farre greater obseruance among the people, to whom he was to preach, that he should be knowne to be sonne to that woman, who was picked out by the Lord himselfe, to be a nurce to that reuerend man Elias, in the time of bitter famine, and that this preacher should be the selfe same person, who was raised from death to life. But in my iudgement the point is fully answered, when he is said to be of Gath Hepher, and not of Sareptha. For Gath Hepher, or as it is in the Hebrew,<note place="margin">In vulgata editione. Iosuah. 19.13.</note> Gittah Hepher, which to S. Hierome are both one, was a citie in the land of Israel, in the tribe of Zabulon, as we may read in Iosuah. But Sareptha was not in Israel, as Christ himselfe verie euidently doth signifie in S. Luke,<note place="margin">Luk. 4.25.27.</note> 
               <hi>Many widowes were in Israel in the dayes of Elias, but vnto none of them was E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias sent, saue into Sareptha</hi> a citie <hi>of Sidon, vnto a certaine wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. Also many leapers were in Israel in the time of Elizeus the Prophet, yet none of them was made cleane, sauing Naaman the

               <note place="margin">1. Reg. 17 9. Ioseph. Anti. lib. 8.9.</note> or a citie of Sidon. And Iosephus also telleth vs, in the 8. of his Antiquities, that <hi>Sareptha is a citie betweene Tyre and Sidon</hi>: where speaking of Elias, of the widow, and her son, he hath not a word of Ionas. And left it may be thought that Gath Hepher did stand neare to this city of Sareptha, and so that our Prophet for the nearenesse of the places, may be sayd to be of both, it was the tribe of Asser, and not the tribe of Zabulon which was nearest vnto Sidon.<note place="margin">Iosua. 19 28.</note> Then our Ionas being take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the tribe of Zabulon, and therefore being an Israelite, he was fit to preach to the Israelites, as to his owne countrimen. Which course the Lord did take commonly in sending of his owne to those which were his owne, as Iewes to the tribe of Iuda, and Israelites to the other ten tribes; which he had not here obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, if Ionas had bene sonne to the widow of Sareptha.</p>
            <p n="4">4 I haue opened this error, as principally occasioned by the person of our Prophet, with whom I am here to deale; so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly to shew the boldnesse of the Iewes, who dare on naked coniectures grounded on weake foundations, (as is this, that because his mother who was raised vp by Elias,<note place="margin">1.

Verie endlesse is their follie which they vse in this behalf, &amp; it is not to be wondred at by vs, who know their malice in denying of Christ Iesus to be the true Messias; in peruerting of such scriptures as in their owne bookes are written of him;<note place="margin">Epiphanius Haeresi. 29.</note> in cursing of the Christians daily in their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, vnder the name of Nazarites; in vilefying the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, but in magnifying their Talmud that irreligious booke, with such celestiall praises,<note place="margin">Lodou. Viues de Veritate fidei. lib. 3.</note> that as Viues writeth of it, they hold this for an opinion, <hi>that God himselfe bestoweth the first foure houres of euery day, in reading of that booke,</hi> like a scholer at his task. Nay more, <hi>that when the Temple at Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was destroyed by Titus the Romane, that then the Lord did sit reading vpon that booke within three or foure cubits of the place</hi>; belike so busie at

that, that he could not haue any leisure to thinke on the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the Temple, which you know was but a trifle. Let all men take heed of their errours; and let vs that be Preachers of the word, especially take heed, how we credulously reach any thing, that vnaduisedly commeth from them.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The widow of Sareptha was not Ionas his mother, but himselfe doth let vs know that Amittai was his father; where also another fable may iustly be reproued,<note place="margin">Lyra in Ion. 1.</note> which Lyra writing vpon this place, reporteth to be broched by the self same Iewes; to wit, that our Prophet was sonne vnto another Prophet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his fathers name is here mentioned, for so (say they) are all the Prophets, whose fathers are named in the Scripture. Marke their worthy reason for it.<note place="margin">Amos. 7.14.</note> Amos saith of himself, that <hi>he was no Prophet, nor the sonne of a Prophet,</hi> and if you will looke in his book, you shal see that his father is not me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned.

Amos was not the son of a Prophet, &amp; his father is not named, Ergò they whose fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are named,<note place="margin">Hosea. 1.1.

               <note place="margin">Zephan. 1.1.</note> 
               <hi>who was the son of Gedaliah, who was the son of Amariah, who was the son of Hizkiah.</hi> If this their reason were good, there should here the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be no lesse, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a whole generation of Prophets. But I rather approue of the reasons of Arias Montanus,<note place="margin">Arias Mont. in prolegom. in minores Prophetas. Luk. 2 36.</note> who saith that they are named, either because their fathers were men famous, &amp; wel knowne in their times; or else for distinctions sake, to make them differ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> some other of that name. The new Testament doth yeeld vs examples of both in other persons; as when aged Anna is sayd to be the daughter of Phanuel of the tribe of Aser, it may probably be imagined that Phanuel when he liued, was a man of reputation, well knowne to very many. But in the Epistle of Iude, the title which is there giuen vnto the Apostle, not from his father, but from his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Iudas the seruant of Christ,</hi>

Wherein Gods purpose was, to take away his word together with his Prophet, from those who long had it, &amp; brought forth no fruites accordingly, and to giue it vnto other who were aliens from the couenant, and strangers from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. And if that these Niniuites should haue that grace, as by hearing a message, to fructifie in great abundance, they might then exprobrate ingratitude and grieuous rebellion, to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Israel, because these being but once preached vnto, did apparantly repent, but the other hearing often, did still increase their sinne.

It is one thing to be sent, and for a man then to go; another thing to runne first, and not at all to be sent. <hi>Feede the flocke</hi> saith Peter,<note place="margin">1.

It were rather to be wished, that they did not come much nearer to the name of Apostataes, for reuolting from the approued rule of the Christian faith, while they vse that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession which is sacred in it selfe, but as pretenced pietie, to couer vnhappie shifting, yea sometimes an vngodly life. I do not speake of all: among bad may be some good: and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances oftentimes do make whole causes differ. But for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, I could wish that experience had not taught vs, to the slaunder of the Gospell, that such fond admiration as they procure in the pulpit, among the ignorat multitude (who are easily deceiued) is quitted with some infamy, which from town to towne doth follow them, and from countrey vnto countrey, or with some actuall cosinage, or with lustfull carnalitie, or one bad tricke or other.</p>

graunt that the burying of those talents in the ground, which he in his great loue hath giuen vnto vs, be not layd to our charge, in that dreadfull and terrible day. If ignorance, or idolatrie, or iniquitie did not rage, if the enemies of the Gospell to hold vp their Romish Antichrist were not busie to peruert, we might keepe our selues in our cloisters, but if all these do fret, and dayly consume like a canker, let vs sometimes looke about vs. Theodoret reporteth in his Ecclesiasticall storie,<note place="margin">Theodoret. Hist. Eccles. lib. 4.24.</note> that when Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens the Emperour with his Arrian opinions, had bee-postered much of the world, &amp; by that meanes the flocke of Christ stood in great danger, Aphraates a Monke, a holy man of that time, contrary to his order and vsuall profession, came foorth out of his Monasterie, to helpe to keepe vp the truth. And being asked by the Emperour who was offended at him, what he did out of his cell? I would (saith he) haue kept it, and did keepe it so long as Christes sheepe were in quiet; but now that tempestes do come on, and stormes bring them in danger, euery stone is to be turned, euery means is to be sought, to free them from this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill. He goeth on: If I were daughter to any man whatsoeuer, and according to my sexe as decency would require, were kept vp in a closet, or in some secret chamber, and inner part of the house, yet if my fathers dwelling were on fire, should I not be verie carelesse, if I wold not then come forth to helpe to quench the fire, or giue direction for it? So if now I should not helpe to teach true faith in Christ, by coming out of my Monastery, I should do much amisse. Let vs remember the like, in these most perillous times: so we shall discharge our consciences, we shall disburden our soules, and God himselfe will reward it, by one meanes or another, although men do not requite it: for do not looke for that: if you do, they will deceiue you.

By that which is written of it, it may be iudged, that Niniue was then the greatest Citie that was

He must crie against Niniue, not whisper in the eare as if it were to one; not speake softly as to a few: but cry as vnto all: this is a general proclamation.

In such cases men are not moued at all with low words, as the whistling of the winde is not perceiued at all, in the blowing of trumpets or the ringing of belles. Those things which are violent, must be driuen foorth with such other things as are violent. It is sayd of bloud that it cannot be satisfied but with bloud. It is knowne of loue, that it cannot be recompenced or requited but with loue. Euen so the crie of sinne cannot be stopped, but by crying out against sinne, and condemning it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly. But that sins do crie we reade oft in the Scripture. Abels bloud did crie,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.10. Chap. 18.20. Deut. 24.15. Iac. 5.4.</note> that is indeed, the murther of Cain did call to God for vengeance. The crie of Sodome and Gomorrha was great. The detaining of wages from the laborer &amp; hired seruant, doth yeeld foorth a crie. And here in this place the wickednesse of Niniue cometh vp before God: &amp; with what but with a cry? As if he shold say, that it was now grown so great, that the earth was no longer able to hold it, but both the aire and the heauen too, did ring of the same. Exceeding force of sin, which wil thus call for vengeance.<note place="margin">Gen. 19.13.</note> This was it which once plucked downe fire and brimstone from heauen vpon Sodome and Gomorrha.

            <p n="18">18 It is likely that such generall sinnes were in Niniue, as are sayd by Ezechiel to haue bene in Sodome,<note place="margin">Ezech. 16.49</note> that is, <hi>Pride and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of bread, and abundance of idlenesse, &amp; that she did not stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the hand of the poore and needy</hi>; but I thinke that in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar some falts may be picked out, which were great in that place.

but with a proclamation of weight from the eternall God. Here a naturall man would looke, that since Ionas is to write this sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of himselfe, (for no man I thinke maketh doubt thereof) he should speake for his owne credit; with what diligence and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacitie he performed this message; how he spared not the king of Niniue, but told him his owne; or if he had failed to do that which was enioined to him, or for want of wit or wil, had missed in his designement, a worldling would iudge, that for his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, he should haue concealed it: let others if they wold haue spoken their pleasure of him, but not he of himself: or if needs he must haue spoken, he would haue told the better part, and left out the worst. But if Ionas would be naught, and erre as fowly in penning, as he did before in practise, he hath here met with his maister, who well can keepe him from it, euen the mightie Spirit of God, which dealeth with him in this place as it did with Dauid in his one and fiftieth Psalme, that is, maketh him to confesse <hi>that against God,</hi>

And if that there should haue come any other after the Apostles, that should not haue sinned, it is very likely that our Sauiour in the midst of his wisedome, wherewith he gouerneth his Church, would haue appointed for them some other prayer, then the ordinary Lords prayer:<note place="margin">Matth. 6.12.</note> they should not haue sayd, <hi>forgiue vs our trespasses,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had none. This is a cooler both to the Pharisees and Nouatians, who were wont to despise sinners. If Ionas fall, and Iob, and Noe, and Lot, and Dauid, whom the scripture calleth iust and righteous persons, and after Gods owne heart, let other men take heed of presumption, and trusting in themselues. Yet this is a comfort to sinners in the weakenesse of their soules. If God forgaue Ionas repenting and beleeuing, he will forgiue vs also, if we beleeue and repent. Therfore let not despaire deuour our wounded consciences. Yet let not this be an incouragement
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:623:18"/>
to offend in any wilfulnesse. Many will fall with Dauid, but they will not arise with Dauid. Our Prophet at the length amendeth, but his fall was great the while. Let vs first see the reasons that moued him to his flight, and then the maner of it.</p>
            <p n="6">6 We need not to doubt, but Satan who is euer at hand to promote bad causes, could yeeld reasons enough for the hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of this worke. He had cause to feare, that by the meanes of Ionas many soules in Niniue might escape his net. Perhaps <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> therefore he would suggest and put this in his mind, that he was but a stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger there, acquainted with no man, &amp; so should be but ill welcome.<note place="margin">1.

But a meaner man then a Prophet, might here haue answered Satan, that <hi>the whole earth is the Lordes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 24.1. Gen. 12.10. Ruth. 1.1.</note> 
               <hi>and all that therein is, the compasse of the world and they that dwell therein.</hi> He who kept Abraham in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, where he was but a meere stranger, and Naomi in Moab, could keepe Ionas here also. It may be that the tempter would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> insinuate vnto him, that he was but one man. What? one man to a multitude? a single person to a whole kingdome? A ridiculous thing. Yea but Ionas might haue heard, that the day was, when those which were with Elizeus and his seruant,<note place="margin">2. Reg. 6.16.</note> were more in number then all the enemies which were against them. Where God is and his Angels, there man is not alone. He could not but know,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.5.

Therefore as no reason should stop the mouth of the Minister, or detaine him from his charge, so this should least of all other. They who neuer knew God, haue gone as farre as this: as Phocion among the Atheniens, of whom it is written,<note place="margin">Plut. in vita Phocionis.</note> that when Apollo by his Oracle at Delphos, had giuen an answer, that one man did disagree, although all the rest

The king of Niniue and his people, had bene as the taking of a whale, in comparison of Dionysius, although a king in Sicilia. But if it had bene worse, Ionas, that thou must haue lost thy life, woldst thou haue stucke thereat?

when he would? Could not he haue restored it in this world, if it had pleased him? or could he not make recompence in the kingdome of heauen? Thou couldst not but know, Ionas, that his Sonne afterward, should for thy sake lose his life. Was the seruant aboue the maister?

But by many wordes of the old Testament, that time could not yet be come, nor the generall calling of the Gentiles, till that Messias did appeare, who was farre inough from Ionas.

Rerum suo tempore ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starum.</note>7 Iouianus Pontanus in the fifth booke of the Actes of his time, hath a Narration to this purpose, but a iudgement to the contrarie. In that mightie quarrell betweene the kings of Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, and the house of Aniou in Fraunce for the kingdome of Naples, Ferdinandus king of Arragon did besiege Mont-dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon a towne and castle in old Campania, where because the towne stood high on the top of a rocke, and the season was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding dry, he hoped that ere lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, for want of water he should winne it to his pleasure. Now the inhabitants thereof being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most dead for thirst, being aduised therunto by certaine Priests,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:623:28"/>
most wicked and vngodly persons, did trie this conclusion, then the which there haue bene few more irreligious or impious. Stealing downe in the darke of the night, through the watch which was set by the enemie, they crept along the rockes euen to the sea side, and all the way drew with them a Crucifixe (the resemblance of Christ crucified, and hanging on the crosse) which first they cursed and banned, with manie inchanted spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but afterward with most execrable wordes they threw it into the sea, vsing imprecations against the heauen, and earth, and water, so to wring from them a tempest. In the meane time the Priests being as wicked men as liued, to satisfie the souldiers who set them on worke, brought an Asse to the church doore, and sung a Dirge to him as to a man now dying; then they put into his mouth, their Sacrament of the Altar, &amp; so with funerall hymnes, did burie the Asse aliue before the church doore. This vngodly solemnitie was scant ended, but the aire was full of clouds, the sea was stirred with the wind, the heauen did roare with thunder, the earth did flash with lightening, trees were plucked vp by the rootes, the stones did rent in peeces, &amp; there fell such abundance of raine, that from the top of the rock whole streames did runne of water. So the king missed of his purpose. The Author which writeth this, confessing the whole matter, and describing it as I haue done, doth thinke that their Magicke did not cause the raine, but that it came naturally, so much wet falling after so long a drowth. His reason is, that for such villany and blasphemie as was then vsed toward himselfe, God would not send a benefite vnto men to helpe them at their need, but would rather suffer them to fall into destruction.</p>
            <p n="8">8 But that reason is not sufficient: for God oftentimes doth suffer the reprobate to haue worldly things at their pleasure, to harden them the more, and that the delusions of Satan, may be so much the stronger in them, to their finall confusion. It is therefore most probable, that their wickednesse did so extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily stirre vp that raine. For when Satan hath libertie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord to do things, either to blind the reprobate, or to chastise the elect being fallen into sinne, or to trie the faith of the best, he imparteth his power with his ministers, speciall instruments of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:623:29"/>
his glorie, these necromancers &amp; coniurers, and other such like. The sorcerers who shewed such sights to Pharao in Egypt, do proue both these grounds to be true, first that Satan oftentimes yeeldeth his power vnto his seruaunts, and secondlie that God suffereth the wicked to haue their desire in many things, to their greater ouerthrow.

He who had leaue for the one, may somtimes haue leaue for the other.

And therefore we are not to thinke, that so oftentimes as men will report it, such tempests are caused by meanes of ill members in any common wealth, for then it should be verie often, (our common sort herein erre,

and are verie credulous, or light of beleefe) but sometimes this is done by them, both at sea &amp; at land, not vniuersally but in such special places, and causes too, as the Lord wil permit.

            <p n="10">10 Not Satan in this place, but God sendeth the storme on Ionas; &amp; the circumstances afterward, do make proofe to the ful, that it was a verie great one. It is termed <hi>a mighty tempest, the ship was almost broken: the mariners are afrayd: they cry euerie man to his God, they throw the wares into the sea,</hi> which I shall touch more largely anon. In the meane time the note here is, that Ionas is the sinner, but all the ship smarteth for it: the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners &amp; the maister, who were not at all accessarie to this foule deede of the Prophet, yet are pursued as well as he. What had these poore men sinned, who after the custome of their trade, did let him in for his money as a passenger, but medled not with his message: they vnderstood not of his prophecying; yea it may be that they had neuer so much as heard of Niniue. Shall many smart thus for one? the mariners for a straunger? Here is now another question. But learne here Gods hate to sin: learne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> here his deepe and endlesse wisedome. His wisedome shineth in this, that oftentimes with one man he striketh a many, for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which in themselues are very different, being euermore wel knowne to his Maiestie, but secret vnto vs. The partie prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall he doth punish; to the next he doth teach obedience;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:623:30"/>
the patience of the third he will haue to be tried, and so forward in the rest: in all he seeketh his glorie; his honor in the wicked, his true feare in the good. If all these be whipped at once, he doth no wrong to anie. He that hath not sinned with Ionas, yet hath sinned in somewhat else. For what man is he that drinketh not in iniquitie as the water, and is not found so to do, if he be once brought to his triall before God? All the difference then is this, that their faults haue seuerall places, but their punishment shall haue one. Theeues are brought out of diuerse quarters, &amp; at sundrie times they haue trespassed, and in causes ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I doubt not for these sea-men, but if all of them had bene drowned, they had sufficiently deserued it, although they had neuer heard of Ionas.

whose faults haue bin in diuerse places. His iustice goeth with his wisdome; for he neuer doth wrong to any, althogh our dul eyes do not see it. For the saying is verie true, that Gods iudgements, although many times they be secret, yet euermore they are iust.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 12 And here appeareth his hatred vnto a grieuous sinne. Sometimes for one mans fault who is harboured by another, or carelesly entertained without iust inquisition, without due exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, God calleth the sinnes of other to an apparant recke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to a sensible remembrance, which before he seemed to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get. Let Achan be the man who serueth here for an example. He alone was deprehended in the excommunicate thing:<note place="margin">Iosua. 7.1.21.</note> he alone did steale the gold: he alone had touched the siluer and Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonish garment. Yet for the wicked fact of Achan, there were sixe and thirtie of the Israelites slaine by the men of Ai. These did perish in their owne sinne, although they perished with his fault. His crime stirred vp a vengeance, which they had deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued before, but receiued now in his companie. Afterward his sonnes and daughters, his oxen and his asses, were burnt or sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to death. This is no example for the Magistrate to follow, to punish one for another: this was Gods owne immediate deed, who himself is perfect iustice, and therfore cannot erre. But ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue withall his hatred to iniquity, which is so farre off from spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the man grosly offending, that he destroyeth all that are neare him, because they will keepe companie with so stained a person.<note place="margin">Num. 16.26.</note> Many of the Israelites had felt this another time, if they had not fled from the tents of Dathan and Abiron. The compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Ionas were sure that they tasted of it. And it seemeth that either by the light of nature, or by some sea-obseruation, they thought that they had one or other, whose roome might be far better then his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany was vnto them, when they fell to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting lots,<note place="margin">Ionah. 1.7.</note> to see for whose sake it was, that all this came vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

            <p n="13">13 This matter is true at land, as well as it is at sea. Our God is Lord of both. Thereupon it is a good warning to all, that they looke with whom they sort. For as the pestilent person doth send forth infected poison to such as do come neare him, to the killing of their bodies, so doth a grieuous sinner bring wrath on his companions, to the ruine of their soules. A good lesson for yong gentlemen, that they flie a blasphemous swearer. A good lesson for all Christians, that they auoyd an infamous hereticke. When Cerinthus came into the bath, Iohn the Euangelist got him out,<note place="margin">Euseb. Hist.

Here let them looke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, who not onely without all care, do sort them selues with all comers, not fearing the faults of others, but when they do know their wickednesse, they are glad that they haue such companions,<note place="margin">Psal. 50.18.</note> and do assent to their euils, <hi>if they see a thiefe, they run vvith him, and are partakers with the adulterers.</hi> If anie man teach a tricke of fraud, they will learne that of him: if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie vse vncleane speech, that filthinesse is for them.

If companie do bring daunger, as you see it did by Ionas, how fearefull is consent? It is better to feare too much, then to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume but a litle.

The Prophet spareth no words, to describe the rod which now did beate him. <hi>The Lord sent foorth a wind,</hi> not a litle one,<note place="margin">Virgil.

But alas, what swinning was there in such a storme? The ship shaketh at euerie blast, as if it would into shiuers; euerie waue doth so affright them, as if still they were dying. It maketh them fall to praying, who in likelihood prayed not often. It maketh them thinke of their Gods, for there was no helpe now fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men: helpe heauen, for sea and winds, and waues, are all against vs. Yea more, because their hands should go as fast as their tongues, they will not lye still and crie, but <hi>the cariage of the ship shall out into the water; the wares are cast into the sea, to lighten the ship withall.</hi> Her burthen might make her sinke, and therefore ease her of it. In what a case were these poore men for harbouring such a guest? As the host who hath lodged a traitor, and because he seemed a man of faire conditions, hath vsed him very kindly, doth not know what he hath done, til the Sheriffe come &amp; seaze his guest, and himselfe to the Princes mercie, so was it here with these mariners. These men had money of Ionas, to let him come into their vessel,<note place="margin">Ionah. 1.3.</note> but by this time I think they could haue wished, that they had giuen him money to keepe him farther of.

            <p n="15">15 You see the words are not manie; three or foure lines at the most: but what more can be said of a tempest, then is here said in the text? The sea-men are afraid, a stiffer kind of men then other people are, and who do not regard a small thing: they had borne many brunts before, and of likelihood escaped many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: they were acquainted with the working of the sea, and the egernesse of the wind: An hote storme and away: after a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest cometh a calme. A man who were new come thither, and perhaps at first were sea-sicke, might be agast at a litle, his heart might be in his mouth, to feele but a litle rocking. But that this trembling feare should take these old beaten souldiers, it doth import a vehement daunger. The passengers must needs quake, when the mariners did so dread.

Parmenio and his Nobles, who for no cause of their owne, but for his sake and his honour, there aduentured their liues, were troubled aboue measure; they were in a sea of cares, and scant knew which way to turne them: onely he whom all concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and whose making or marring, depended on that dayes triall, and for whom and whose sole sake they endured all things which they were then to sustaine, as a man that knew not of it, or one that tooke no care which end went forward, lay in his bed soundly sleeping. The Prophet in this place, shall be no whit behind him, but rather much beyond him. He hath listes to enter with the verie wrath of God: his life doth lye vpon it, and his soule too, if his God should not deale kindly with him: the ayre is now disturbed, and yeeldeth a mightie tempest; the waues they froath and roare; the windes they beate and blow; the sea is moued exceedingly; the ship is almost broken; the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are afrayde; happie man that can pray fastest: the burthen of the ship, be it costly or be it necessarie, it must out into the water, and all for Ionahs sake; his cake it is that is baking; the euent concerneth him onely: and he alone as the man who of all other did know least, and was a straunger to the action, doth seeke a secret corner, the inner sides of the ship, where he may lye &amp; rest.

Saint Hierome doth intimate this to be the reason; but indeede because he so rebuketh Ionas, and ratleth him for his drowsinesse, I rather impute his going to the corners of the ship (for the Prophet lay in one of those places) to his diligence &amp; carefulnesse, to see the charge which was committed to him, that like a circumspect gouernour, his eyes might see those things, his eyes might see those persons, which were now vnder him.</p>

But where is a wilful winking in many things that are grosse, as it is but too too oft, that can not excuse it selfe, that beareth a heauie burthen with it.

For whereas his custome was, as often as he went into anie battell, euermore to beare in his bosome, a little image of gold representing that God, being on a time in daunger of an ouerthrow, he drew it out and kissed it, and vsed these wordes vnto it, How now Apollo Pythius, wilt thou who hast prospered and aduaunced that happie man Cornelius Silla, in so manie foughten battels, now destroy him and his fellow citisens, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the gates of Rome?

            <p n="19">19 But the Scripture is not so straight; <hi>the lot is cast into the lap, but the whole dispositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therof is of the Lord.</hi> And elsewhere it is commended. <hi>The lot causeth contentions to cease, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a partion among the mightie.</hi> So S.

And in another place, <hi>Those things vvhich are giuen by lot, are giuen vnto vs by God.</hi> And in his hundreth and eightith Epistle, disputing that question of the flying of a Minister in the time of persecution, and supposing that there be diuerse pastours in one congregation, whereof some are to depart for a time, and some to stay; if it cannot be agreed, saith he, who shall do the one, and who shall do the other,<note place="margin">Epistol. 119.</note> let it be decided by a lot.

There the abuse is in the manner of doing, not in the thing. But the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion which ariseth from this difference of iudgement, may easily be resolued, by considering the seuerall sortes of lots, which are found to be three.

would arise,<note place="margin">Prou. 18.18. Iosuah. 16.1.</note> as Salomon doth import in the place which I na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med before. In this kind did Iosuah part out the land of Canaan by lot, to the people of Israell.

But to diuine is vtterly vnlawfull, as if a man should take a white lot, and a blacke lot, and if I draw the white lot, then I may well go this day, if the blacke, I will not go: I shall haue an vnhappie iourney. That of Haman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore spoken of, doth come within this compasse. We hold this for a great abuse.</p>
            <p n="20">20 Here the lot is consultatorie. They tooke it a thing gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that one or other amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them had committed some wicked offence, and because they could not tell, who it was that had done the deede, they will put it to their Gods. This sheweth the mightie feare which did possesse their soules.

He was singular in comparison of them: he was as a white garment; and therefore a litle spot in him, would cause a great deformitie.

These mariners being followed with so strange a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest, as made them quake for daunger of their liues, and crie with importunitie to their heathen Gods, and disburden their ship of such wares as were in it, and cast lots for their liues, who should die for all his fellowes; may iustly be supposed to be in such a fright, that if anie thing extraordinarie should appeare vnto them, what might be the reason of their daunger, or how they were to be eased, and put away from their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus daunger affrighteth the wisest, and maketh the simpler sort oftentimes, to runne toung before the wit. In the sixteenth of Luke, the rich ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is brought in, making request to Abraham, that he would send Lazarus to his fathers house, to giue warning to his fiue brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they by the wickednesse &amp; retchlesnesse of their liues, came not into those torments, which he then with much paine endured.

Ionas comming from vnder the hatches, (where he slept but a little before) like Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus from his graue, is beset among these mariners, with a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of such questions. What is the cause that this storme is in this sort vpon vs? felow, whence doest thou come? what coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyman art thou sirra? what is thine occupation?</p>
            <p n="4">4 Thus the place must be vnderstood, if we respect the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gernesse of men in such perplexitie, or the hast which daunger breedeth, or the manners of common mariners. But in verie deede I see more in it. Here may be noted to vs a proceeding much more sober, and iudgement with discretion. That which goeth before will well beare it, that which foloweth, will more enforce it. The fearefulnesse whereunto they were growne, by hazard of a shipwracke, was of force to allay their heate: it made them amated with it: their deuotion to their Gods, did put them
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:623:47"/>
from their choler: the maister is supposed to be a man wise and careful, as not long since you haue heard: the casting of their lots doth intend a slaking stay: their milde intreating of Ionas, when the crime appeared to them: their referring of all to him: the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire which they had to saue him: the griefe which they had to drowne him, are presumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of much sobrietie. These circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces import a iust kind of inquirie, which was vsed vpon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, so to wring out by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iectures, or by plaine declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what was this grieuous crime, which plucked such a tempest downe from heauen, how Gods wrath was to be satisfied, what punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should be taken, if punishment must be taken. It were much to be suspected, that if this case which is here among these Gentiles, should come to triall among many Christians, the man should find hard iustice. For now vpon how light occasions, are many inflamed to wrath? what bitternesse? what reuiling? what blasphemie euen to God, with swearing and with tearing, if for anothers sake mens liues should be indaungered? if they should be inforced, as these were here, to throw their wealth and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce, with their owne hands into the sea? Call to minde, that if any negligence haue raised a fire in a towne, and harme be done to their building, how little it is remembed, that it is a crosse from God, sent on them for their sinnes, or to teach them patience, or to make trial of their faith; but the next imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate cause, that presently is looked too, seethe villanie of this boy, see the cursednesse of this wenche; see the diuellishnesse of this felow, that should haue taken care of this fire, if he had his desert, how oft should he dye for it?</p>
            <p n="5">5 But if it were a straunger, an outlandish man as Ionas was, who brought this scathe vpon them, how many <hi>Crucifiges</hi> should he haue tumbling on him?

people, in one Citie of our land, haue bene oftentimes intended against outlandish folkes: &amp; the disposition of men in this point, will well appeare. Those which are wise and godly, make vse of those aliaunts as of brethren, considering their distresses, with a liuely felow-feeling, holding it an vnspeakable blessednesse, that this little Iland of ours should not onely be a te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, to serue God in for our selues, but an harbour for the weather-beaten, a san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie to the straunger, wherein he may honour the true Lord: remembring the precise charge which God gaue to the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, to deale well with all straungers,<note place="margin">Leuit. 19.33.</note> because the time once was, when themselues were straungers in that cruell land of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt: not forgetting that other nations to their immortall praise, were a refuge to the English, in their last bloudie persecution in Queene Maries dayes: and in briefe recounting, that by a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall vicissitude of Gods chastisements, their case may be our case: which day the Lord long keepe from vs. These mariners with that humanitie which beseemeth all men of reason, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch it not to the Prophet, that he an outlandish aliaunt, should bring such trouble on them, should put them to such losse, or thrust them into such daunger, but in verie good course of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, they desire to be informed, and take notice of his cause. The presentnesse of the perill, or the hast which they had to be satisfied, could not stay them from doing iustice: they will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his aunswere.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Such persons as through whose hands the liues of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers passe, be they Iudges or be they iusticers, yea be they but common Iurours, may hearken to these heathen, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their proceeding, and learne so much; as that they shall not dare, rashly to destroy, or take away the life of their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian brother.

            <p n="22">22 To that position of those who oppugne this doctrine, of the creating and continuing of all by God, by saying that it is Nature, who produceth euery thing, I might answere that there is no such matter as Nature, taking it in that sense which they foolishly do imagine: but onely it is a course, proportioned out by the will of God, to runne and hold on, in the creatures.

His sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is inuisible; his nature is insensible, because he is a spirite. And yet we see him and feele him, &amp; know him by his effects. If we looke on the heauen aboue vs, or behold the earth below vs, the standing fast of the one, the running round of the other, the concord of things in discord, their orderly interruption, &amp; inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted order, euery creature doth cry &amp; proclaime that there is a God.<note place="margin">Athanas. ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione contra idola.</note> That worthy ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Athanasius doth very well vrge this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: <hi>As if thou shouldst see a citie consisting of many &amp; seuerall men, great &amp; small, &amp; rich &amp; poore, &amp; old &amp; young, &amp; male and female, to be gouerned with good order &amp; straight discipline, and those who liue there, although they be differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g theselues, yet

to agree in minde, so that neither the richer do bend against the poore, nor the great against the small: nor the yong against the old, but all of them do maintaine peace with an equality of right: If we should see these things it cannot be but we must imagine that by the presence of the Prince there, this concord is cherished, although he do not come abroad to be seene, because disorderlinesse is a signe that the common vvealth is vvithout an head, but order on the other side doth shew the care and gouernement of the Prince.

For first I would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> demaund, what reason can be assigned, that vpon so weake a foundation, as it seemeth to flesh and bloud, Christianitie is so growne, that all the coastes of the earth, haue heard the fame of that doctrine?

Secondly what reason is there,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that Luther no great man, helped onely with the bare counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Saxon, should in the time of deepe ignoraunce, be able by preaching alone and writing, to reuiue againe the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, in despite of Priestes and Princes, and so to set it on foote, as that all Christendome now ringeth of it. Thirdly I would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> demaunde, what naturall reason there is, that our most graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Queene, whom God euermore preserue, a woman, in a small countrey, at her first comming to the crowne, should dare

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He aunswere of the Prophet to those manifold questions, which were proposed by the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, doth include a confession of errour, and wilfull disobedience in himselfe, whereof if there should be made a doubt by any man, it is put out of controuersie, by that which now follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that <hi>the men knew he fled from the presence of the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause himselfe had told them.</hi> This telling was confessing: this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming to them, was informing against himselfe. These wordes although they be not so placed, yet by order of the narration, are the first wordes of my text, that being set before by an <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steron Proteron,</hi> which should follow after, and that comming
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:623:60"/>
after,<note place="margin">Vers. 9.</note> which should be before. He said that he was <hi>an Hebrew, and feared the God of heauen,</hi> as it is in the ninth verse, but yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> notwithstanding that <hi>he was fled from his presence,</hi> as it is in this tenth verse, <hi>which when the men had knowne, because himselfe told them, they were exceedingly afrayd, and asked him, why didst thou so?</hi> And this I propose, as the order of connexion in these wordes. To shew that he did confesse, were now a needlesse labour. The violence of the tempest, the discouerie by a lot, the examination of the mariners, did wring it out from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. I haue opened that already. And to tell what he did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, may in as few wordes be ended, that <hi>he fled away from Gods presence,</hi> that is, did neglect his seruice, of going to preach at Niniue. I haue also handled that, in the third verse of this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The mariners they giue credit, to the tale which they had heard, and accordingly do proceed. And so also must I.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Some things, are verie slightly attended by men: some things hardly beleeued:<note place="margin">Esay. 28.10.</note> therefore precept vpon precept, and line after line, here a little and there a little, must be doubled and ingeminated, to an obstinate people, that as drop after drop doth pierce the hardest stone, so teaching after teaching may sound the hardest heart, euen of the most flintie nature. <hi>To some men</hi> saith Seneca <hi>remedies are onely to be shewed,</hi>

               </note> it is inough to point them out, <hi>to some other they are to be inculcated,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times repeated. The ignorant do yeeld apparant proofe of this, when they can verie hardly, be reclaimed from their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes: no perswasions can remoue them. So, although not euer, yet oftentimes the children of such who liue in Popish darkenesse do confirme this doctrine to vs, who heare and will not heare, who giue no kinde of credit, to oft repeated truthes, out of the booke of God. Besides, a supine carelesnesse is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall in all men, so that many things wisely vttered, do breed but small effect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because they are little regarded. But here is such a seale set, vpon the companie of Ionas, as which taketh such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, that it needeth not to be oft doubled. The wind which blew aboue, the sea which wrought below, did put them past peraduenture, that some thing was amisse: that some great sinne waamsong them. The lot shewed Ionas to be the man, whom
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:623:60"/>
iudgement did pursue, and vengeance did so follow. It needed not to be told them oft, that this party had offended.</p>
            <p n="3">3 But when the words of the Prophet, had passed against himselfe, and aboue all other signes which might affoord conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, his confession was come foorth, to accuse and condemne himselfe, then his hearers had great reason, to know what the matter was. For in such cases as are doubtfull, if any one do speake for himselfe, and vrge his owne condemnation; wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and sound aduise, biddeth the auditour make a pause, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that lightly he do beleeue it. For who is he, whom nature hath not taught that lesson, to say the best for himselfe? Againe, in cases of complaint, if another man should accuse, iustice and Christian charity biddeth the hearer make a stay, and not giue credit hastily. For if euery thing should be true, which euery one reporteth, what man should not be a diuell? shall not Christ himselfe be a Beelzebub?<note place="margin">Matth. 10.25.</note> But when presumptions great and many shall go before, and withall, the offending person shall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen himselfe, then sence and reason do teach, that of likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood he is guilty.<note place="margin">Iudic. 17.1.</note> When Micah brought the siluer, which was stolen away from his mother, and sayd plainly that he had taken it, his mother had great reason to thinke that he was the man. When Rechab and Baanah,<note place="margin">2.

Vpon a firme perswasion of the truth of all his tale, they fall into great feare, they grow to farther counsell. So that

Perhaps the Iudge, hee shaketh them, and ratleth them vp in austeritie: it may be that penaunce is done, and the wicked triumph vpon them.

how could they tell, least by sufferance and impunitie toward Ionas, they should incurre the displeasure of the Almightie? And on the other side, how could they tell, least in punishing and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away his life, the reward which belonged to murtherers, might be layd vpon them? Ionas for his refusing to go to preach at Niniue, was chased with wrath from heauen. Then what ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance might befall them, in a greater fault, as in crueltie, and in shedding of his bloud, who neuer had offended them? Thus they feare to spill his life, although they see shew of very fit oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion. They aske aduise of him. The maine note from this place, is the care which men should haue, to destroy the life of none, that they should be auerse from bloud, which because it is the full subiect of those verses,<note place="margin">Vers. 13. &amp; 14</note> which follow next after my text, I do deferre it thither.

            <p n="15">15 It seemeth that the Prophet, is now as farre in his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as possibly he can go. He knew that he had sinned, and Gods wrath must be satisfied with some temporall punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore he yeeldeth himselfe with patience, to the very death. Better drowne then dye eternally, better loose his life here, then loose his life elsewhere. He is therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, to sustaine the vttermost extremitie. He knew that God was glorifyed, in the execution of iustice, as well as in mercie. A lesson which Iosuah did once teach Achan,<note place="margin">Iosuah. 7.19.</note> when he willed him to confesse, and giue God the glorie: and by a consequent, endure his death with patience. An instruction which we can neuer too much teach to prisoners, and such as are to suffer, by iugdement of law, that they should beare with mildnesse, and quietnesse of behauiour, that which they wilfully haue deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. The conscience of their sinne, the astonishment at their iudgement, the feare of violent death, the shame of such a suffering, is inough to amaze their thoughtes, and ouerwhelme resolution. Whereas on the other side, the putting of them in remembrance, that at one time or another, they must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to dy, and the vrging that God doth lay such temporall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments vpon malefactors, for the sauing of their soules, &amp; the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:623:66"/>
recounting of that benefite, which ariseth from Christs passion, to wit, a pleading before his father, to get pardon for all that be repentaunt, doth settle the disquieted and affrighted mind right well. I would to God that our English were as backeward to transgresse, as in this case they are forward, to satisfie euen with their liues, the extremitie of the lawe, and that in a peaceable &amp; resolued sort. I impute it to nothing, but to the ordinarie passage of the word of God among vs, which is euerie way able to qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et and settle the penitent sinners heart. Other nations do ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire it in our men, as the Italians most of all, and the French, as we may see it obserued,<note place="margin">He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ricus Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan. in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologia pro Herodoto Gallicè edita Luc. 23.43.</note> in the defence of Henry Stephanus for Herodotus. It sheweth a right firme constancie, and sure hope in Christ Iesus. And as those two brought the theefe, which dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Christ into Paradise, so no doubt but that many with vs, go by execution into heauen, who if they were not recalled by violence and by lawe, would prooue firebrands of hell.</p>
            <p n="16">16 I remember the patience of our countrey-men, by the quietnesse of Ionas here, who alone desireth to dye, because he alone had offended in the sinne which now is in question. He would not that other innocent men, should perish by his means. This is the course of Gods children, to haue remorse vpon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not to intangle them in their plagues. <hi>It is I</hi> saith Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 24.17</note> 
               <hi>that haue offended, not these sheepe, alas what haue they done?</hi> But contrariwise the reprobate, if destruction must befall them, would haue all other to take part in that their iudgement, that themselues might not be singular. They would haue company to hell. If they needes must from hence, they care not if all the world come to ruine, together with their fall. They earnestly desire, that other men should be partakers of their smart. The name of Herode the great, is very odious in this respect, who layd a plot,<note place="margin">Ioseph Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit. 17.8.</note> that when he dyed, many other might dye with him. And gaue expresse commaundement, that one of euery noble family in his kingdome, should be slaine, that by that meanes, his death might of necessitie be lamented, if not for loue of him, which the tyrant had no reason to expect, yet for the losse of others. Such are the vnnaturall passions, of cruell and bloudie miscreants. But the blessed sons of God, be of another spirit:
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:623:66"/>
they would rather purchase peace to others, by their losses, then hurt others by their errours. Ionas would dye alone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he alone had offended.</p>
            <p n="17">17 Here now is it worth the discoursing, why the Prophet in this manner should vrge, and hasten himselfe to death. Was it, as Arias Montanus thinketh,<note place="margin">Arias Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentar. in hunc locum.</note> because yet he is so obstinate, that in no case he will to Niniue, but rather dye in a frowardnesse, then teach them, who afterward should worke harme to his people? No: his confession before handled, doth keepe me from that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. I hold him now very carefull to commit no farther sinne. He feeleth the weight of the former, inough &amp; too much on him. Is it then for a fretting indignation, which he beareth vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or for hatred of his life, because his conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce did now pricke him, as the conscience of the wicked vseth to do, when some vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanie is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, as Iudas was pricked in his heart, after his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son practised on our Sauiour, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he went out male-co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented, and hanged himselfe in despaire? No: I hold the reason of it to be another matter, as anon I shall shew vnto you. This had bene a sinne, more fearefull then any that went before. For murthering of himselfe, whereof he had bene guiltie (if for that intent he had spoken it) though other mens hands had done it, is a sin so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, that sca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t any is more hainous vnto the Lord. This sheweth a graund &amp; solemne possession, which Satan hath in a man, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust of all Gods loue, when a man groweth to the summitie of such malice against himselfe, as that naturall affection, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of all our deedes vpon the earth, is quite exiled out of memory. A doctrine which I take to be nothing besides the purpose, if largely it be discoursed of, in the iniquitie of these times, wherin wretchednesse hath so fearefully preuailed in some persons, and almost daily doth preuaile, that they dare to plunge themselues, into this pit of terrible destruction.</p>

This was to make men the more vigilant, that they did no such mischaunces, as we commonly do terme them. But if it were wilfull murther, the offender was to be taken, from the very hornes of the altar,<note place="margin">1. Reg. 2.29</note> and slaine, as Ioab was serued, a man of so noble birth, a man of such seruice before. These are the lawes which were made, concerning the murthering of other men. And doth not the law of God, and the explication of it by Iesus Christ his sonne, originally require of vs, that all fit things which we owe to other men, should be done by our selues to our selues?<note place="margin">Mat. 22.39.</note> Thou oughtest to loue thy neighbour, but as thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest thy selfe.

            <p n="19">19 God hath placed thee in this world, as in a watch or a standing, from whence thou must not stirre thy foote, till he bid thee to remooue. He hath imprinted a most passionate loue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene thy soule and thy body, that they grieue to leaue one another. The mind will haue many inuentions, the body will beare many stripes, before that either from other of them, do willingly depart and be dissolued. Wise men haue no greater reason of perswasion to induce, that the parting with any friend, or the loosing of the nearest and dearest, must be borne with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, then that a dearer couple, the nearest that this world hath, that is our soules and our bodies, must depart and flye a sunder.

the spirite may be willing in any man, yet surely the flesh is weake, in the laying downe of the life, for a good conscience, and the Gospell.

This is a Christian speech out of the mouth of a Iewe, which caryeth such matter with it, as is worthy to be reuolued.

And without Gods exceeding mercie, whereof no man can presume, nay great and mightie preiudice is to the contrary, it wil be most ill with them, who do aduenture vpon such deedes: they do rush themselues into torments.</p>

Thirdly he doth so handle the example of this Razias, that he maketh it to be no warrant, to attempt any such like deede. Heare his reasons.</p>
            <p n="24">24 First the Iewes do giue no credit vnto the bookes of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Machabees: they expugne them out of their Canon. Thus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten himselfe can say, who for want of the Hebrew toung, is sometimes more then an ordinarie friend to the Apocriphall Scripture. Secondly the authour there giueth such testimonie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to that deede, as is not sufficient to allow it for currant. <hi>He vvas a louer of the Citie, and a man of good report, and therefore was commonly called a father of the Ievves. But heathen men,</hi> saith Saint Austen, <hi>haue gone as farre as this. He offered to spend his bodie for the Religion of the Ievves. So vvould other,</hi> saith Saint Austen,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.1.</note> 
               <hi>who had a zeale as Saint Paule speaketh, but not according to knowledge. Such men as vvere earnest holders of the traditions of the Ievves, but did not accept the Messias. He desired that his bovvels might be restored in the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But that shall be common to the vvicked as vvell as to the iust.

He dyed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully sayth the authour, and I do not say,</hi> quoth Saint Austen, <hi>that he did dye vvomanly.</hi> Thus he scanneth all the wordes of that narration.

He should not haue thrust himselfe vpon death, but whatsoeuer had bene imposed by the persecuting tyrant, he should haue endured that vvith patience and humilitie. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore since he could not suffer his humbling amongst his enemies,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:623:70"/>
he shewed himselfe an example, not of wisedome but of folly, not to be imitated of Christs martyrs, but of Donatist circumcellions.</hi> This is the round and apparant christian iudgement, of that most learned Father.<note place="margin">Iudic. 16.30.</note> He doth aunswere the place of Samson, as anon I shall shew vnto you. For he also killed himselfe. In the meane time, I may with him lay downe this generall doctrine, that none should spill the bloud, or destroy the life of himselfe, for any cause whatsoeuer, because that is a deed most vnchristian, most damnable, and most wicked.</p>
            <p n="25">25 I cannot deny, but Gods mercie wherein he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly rich, doth sometimes shew it selfe, in the very pangs of death.<note place="margin">Inter ponte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; fontem.</note> That betweene the bridge and the water, betweene the knife and the dying, betweene the rocke and the ground, repentaunce may be suggested to the heart, in a moment or twinckling of an eye, but especially where poyson being taken, doth not kill vpon the sudden, or where death doth not follow presently, there may be some remembrance. Notwithstanding, who is he that dareth to presume vpon such mercy? God is lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, but he is iust: he is kind, but he is dreadfull: he liketh not to be tempted. It were folly to breake thy necke, to trie the skill of a bone-setter, to trie the wil of a surgeon. It is monstrous in Diuinity, to preasse vpon such iniquitie, with hope of that, wherein thou hast such threatnings to the contrary.

            <p n="26">26 I forget not my Ionas here, from whom as the originall, this question of doing violence to our selues did arise. Neither do I forget Samson, whome I reserued to this place, because there is some similitude betweene him and our Prophet. In that place which I named before,<note place="margin">August. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra secu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dam Gaudentij Epistolam.</note> Saint Austen briefly, but yet notably doth determine this deede of Samson. <hi>When he plucked downe the house on himselfe, he slue himselfe and his enemies. But the reason of it was, that since he could not escape, because they meant to slay him, he would destroy them also with him, euen the Princes of the Philistines. Neither did he this of himselfe,</hi> marke the words of the learned father, <hi>but by direction of Gods spirite, vvhich vsed him to do that which otherwise without the strength of that spirit, he could neuer haue bene able to do,</hi> that was plucke downe the house. <hi>The commaundement of that spirite, made this deede to be lawfull,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen 22.1.</note> 
               <hi>as the offering vp of Isaac, was a lawfull deede in Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. That vvhich had bene nothing else but madnesse, if God had not commaunded it, when God did bid it, was obedience.</hi> So he hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth this a particular deede, precisely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to him, which we may imitate by no meanes, because we haue no such war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.<note place="margin">Hieron. in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zech 46.</note> But Hierome in his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentarie, on the sixe and fortieth of Ezechiel, doth go a little farther, saying that Samson in that deede,<note place="margin">Iudic. 16.30.</note> was a figure of Iesus Christ. As Samson slue more at his death, then he did in all his life time, so Christ although while he liued, he gaue many a wound to Satan, by his miracles and his doctrine, yet it was his death and his suffering, that broke
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:623:71"/>
the backe of hell, and the verie heart of Satan. These matters may in good sort be applyed to our Prophet. He was assured by that knowledge which he yet retained, notwithstanding his fall, that this punishment was assigned to him by the Lord. This must be the satisfaction, for his great disobedience. Now againe his faith reuiueth, by which he had some foresight, of all Gods purpose ouer him. This was peculiar to our Ionas, by his Propheticall knowledge, and may not be followed by vs. It is not any protection for vs, to bid any other throw our selues into the sea.</p>
            <p n="27">27 Besides this, I do not doubt, but as Samson was a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the Sauiour of the world, so Ionas also was, although not in euerie matter, (as once before I haue noted) yet in this his drowning here.<note place="margin">Super. Ion. 1.1. Matth. 12.40.</note> Christ himselfe did expound the lying of the Prophet for three dayes in the whales bellye, to be a signe of his owne buriall, and lying in the earth. The death of the Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, was to him a meanes of his buriall: so here the casting out of Ionas, into the sea by the mariners, was the meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he lay three dayes and three nightes, in the bellye of the whale.<note place="margin">Iohn. 19.30.</note> Ionas is willingly drowned here: Christ also there dyeth willingly: he yeelded vp his Ghost; no man could take it from him. Ionas alone must suffer, to saue the rest of the ship: Christ alone did treade the wine-presse, and Christ doth dye alone, to stay his fathers wrath; to saue all his elect. You see that he is an excellent type of Iesus Christ the righteous. But as it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that comparisons should hold in all things, and there is none who in euery matter may be likened vnto Christ, because he had no fellowes; he cannot be tryed by his peeres; so there is this one difference, that Ionas when he suffered, was alone in all the fault, and Iesus in his suffering, was onely without all fault, because he was that immaculate lambe,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.22.</note> in whose mouth was found no guile. When I first looked into this text, which I haue now opened vnto you, I did thinke to haue said something farther, in or concerning the person of Christ, whom our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet doth represent, I meant to haue mentioned his readinesse to dye, that he might redeeme vs sinners, and so briefly out of the new Testament, to haue giuen some comfort amidst all
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:623:71"/>
these threates of Ionas. But in handling this last question, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath growne vpon me, and I loue not to be tedious. I will therefore deferre that, till I come to the fifteenth verse, where the like occasion is againe fitly offered vnto me. In the meane time, let vs meditate on the excellent loue of Christ, who would dye so willingly for vs, the iust for the vniust, to bring vs vnto his kingdome. To the attaining whereof he alwayes further vs, to whom in the perfection of the Trinitie, be glorie and prayse for euermore.</p>

Because he should not dy, they wold go back to land: and when they see that there must be no nay, but God would haue them to throw him into the sea, they cry forth with great vehemency, that in as much as it was the Lords owne doing, and not any desire of theirs, (they were but as his instruments, &amp; ministers of his iustice) the bloud of this dying passenger, might not be imputed to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

It cannot be auoided: necessity hath no law: they must do it or do worse. Then since God ruled the rost, and all was at his pleasure, they runne poore soules to him. It is sayd <hi>they cried vnto him,</hi> which noteth their

earnest vehemency in vttering of their prayers. They whisper not, but so loud as their best breath can reach, they cry vnto the Lord. They had seene the immediate power of the Israelites God vpon them: that maketh them pray vnto him, and that with doubled cries, <hi>We beseech thee, we beseech thee.</hi> So impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant is affliction, and sight of present danger, to stirre vp euen idolaters,<note place="margin">Exod. 10.17.</note> and wicked ones to deuotion.

This is an argument worth the handling, as be many other things in this verse: but because I haue still desired, to go forward without confusion, and if I be not deceiued, it is the distinctest teaching, to put euery thing in his proper place, giue me leaue to touch that here, which is not handled else-where, and which hath most affinity with that, which already I haue sayd: and to referre other matters vnto their peculiar places.<note place="margin">Suprà ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su 2.</note> Then what <hi>crying is,</hi> I handled, when I opened the second verse. And for that matter, that here they make choise of Iehoua, the true God of the world, as also to dispute, whether they were conuerted vnto the truth or no, iust occasion shall be offered, when I come to the sixteenth verse,<note place="margin">Infrà ver. 16.</note> where it is sayd that <hi>the men frared the Lord exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice vnto the Lord and made vowes.</hi> Moreouer what force affliction hath, to bring men vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to piety and deuotion, I declared in the fifth verse, where these mariners by the violence of the tempest,<note place="margin">Suprà vers. 5.</note> were vrged vnto their praiers.

            <p n="19">19 Then the matter which now remaineth for me, is the substance of their prayer: the scope at which they do aime: which is, that sith a necessity of drowning him lieth vpon them, which they held as well to be vnnaturall, as inhumane and impious, they would gladly be excused for it, that his death

and bloud which was innocent vnto them, might not be layd vpon them. They do professe themselues, to be but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of Gods good will, they had no quarrell to him. And they in plaine termes say, that his was <hi>innocent bloud,</hi> howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer otherwise, whereunto they were not priuy, yet in respect of them. In their company he had not any way deserued to dye: his bloud therefore to them was innocent, and not gulity. See the abundant store of wisedome, which is in the word of God: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> how many notes do hence arise. First that the Lord doth take vengeance, on innocent bloud which is shed, for this is that which they feared; and this may rightly be ioyned with that which goeth before, that is mans fearefulnesse in the one place, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and Gods iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in the other. Secondly, although they were inforced, yet they hold not that sufficient, to do a thing vnlawful, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> without Gods will expressely. Thirdly that Gods direction was their ful resolution. The multitude of these things shal not make me forget my selfe. I will touch them all very briefly.</p>
            <p n="20">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 20 It is very likely, that these men were afraid, that they might iustly perish, for spilling innocent bloud, for God hath threatned vengeance to that sinne, in some places that he will detect it and disclose it, and in some other, that he will seuerely recompence it.<note place="margin">Esay. 26.21.</note> By the Prophet Esay: <hi>Lo the Lord commeth out of his place, to visite the iniquity of the inhabitants of the earth vpon them: and the earth shall disclose her bloud, and shall no more hide her slaine.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Numer. 35.33.</note> By Moses: <hi>Bloud defileth the land, and the land cannot be cleansed, of the bloud that is shed therein, but by the bloud of him that shed it.</hi> The sentence which fell vpon Ioab was,<note place="margin">1. Reg 2.5.</note> that his head should not go downe into his graue in peace, because he had spilled the bloud of two iust men, of two innocents. It is a great comfort to all men, that their liues are so farre within the Lords protection, that if any shall offer to take them away, God will require them of him. But there is a woe to the murtherer. All the righteous bloud which was shed vpon the earth, from the bloud of righteous Abel,<note place="margin">Math 23.35.</note> to the bloud of Zacharias, the sonne of Barachias, who was slaine betweene the Temple and the Altar, shall come vpon the Iewes, who were killers of the Prophets. And if any
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:623:79"/>
one thing, it was bloud that brought them to destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For as when bloud touched bloud, the whole land was polluted, so if we will beleeue Iosephus, who liued in that time, the temple was razed downe, for the murthers which were committed in it. The strangling of young infants, begotten by fornication in our Abbeyes and Nunries, which since that time their bones haue discouered, in more places then one, may be very well sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, among many other sinnes, to haue ouerturned those great buildings. Let the houses of piuate men take heede by their example.</p>
            <p n="21">21 The descryings of this fault, which are both by fame, and by bookes remembred to vs, may be a good token, that in this behalfe vengeance doth not sleepe. As that the very birds of the ayre, and the very beastes of the field, haue helped to lay that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.<note place="margin">Vide Andre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Libauiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. De cruenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione cada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerum.</note> But among Gods secret workes, shewed for the repressing of that sinne, there is none more straunge, then the bleeding of the person slaine at the presence of the murtherer. Which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be not Scripture, yet that many times it falleth out, I feare not to beleeue, by reason of a good consent of nations, some later some more auncient, whom experience as it seemeth did teach that lesson. For besides a generall opinion in our own land, long deriued by descent from hand to hand, the low-countreymen do so hold it, as by Leuinus Lemnius in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of his Naturall secrets,<note place="margin">Leuinus Le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius de oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultis natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae miraculis 2.7.</note> is made plaine, and that by a colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the tryall of their magistrates: where accepting the thing, as vndoubtedly true, and without all kind of controuersie, he inquireth the reason of it. So doth Andreas Libauius another learned man, who hath also made a treatise vpon that argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. In Buchanans Scottish storie,<note place="margin">Buchanan. Hist. Scot. lib. 6.</note> we find an example of this. When by the procurement of one Donaldus, king Duffus had bene slaine, the worker of the mischiefe, caused those who had done it, in no case to come in sight, least the doers should be disclosed by the bloud of the corse. That is a testification also, that this is an ancient conceit among the Scottish people. Howsoeuer that be, much experience hath taught, that this cruelty is very strangely detected, &amp; many times reuenged too, by courses ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary. Sometimes where man forbeareth, there God doth
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:623:80"/>
shew his hand in a more immediate sort, as Procopius sayth that he did on Theodoricke king of the Gothes, who slue Boe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius and Symmachus,<note place="margin">Procopius de bello Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thico. 1.</note> two both noble and innocent persons. But afterward, the guilt of that sinne sticking fast in his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he grew to an imagination, that the head of a certaine fish that was set vpon his table, was the head of Symmachus, which gaped &amp; yawned vpon him. Vpon which conceit he trembling and quaking, fell into a sharpe sicknesse, and quickly thereof dyed. Some other times it is deferred, but yet the punishment neuer resting, commeth tumbling on at last, as Euagrius in the fifth of his Ecclesiasticall storie,<note place="margin">Euagrius Hist. Eccl. lib. 5.3.</note> doth tell of one Addaeus, which in his time was reputed one of the speciall friends of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Iustinian. This man when he had escaped the law for one murther, yet was afterward put to death, for a fact wherewith he was charged, but in truth had neuer done it. So the Lord did change the matter, and the Lord did change the time, but the punishment was not changed. He escaped for that which he did, and dyed for that which he did not. Sometime God doth punish the fathers sinne vpon the children, as he did Dauids murther v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Vriah, on his owne sonnes Absolon and Ammon. These mariners might heare of such examples among the Gentiles. For Gods finger is euery where: he is Lord ouer all the earth; and therefore they might well feare, least that themselues should pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, for the bloud of this dying Prophet.</p>
            <p n="22">22 The second thing which I note is, that although they were enforced against their will to destroy him, yet because the deed it self was in his own quality vnlawful, they cannot satisfie themselues, but still make scruple of it. Althogh there were a kind of commandement from God, that it should be done (for they had signes to that purpose) yet they doubt at it, &amp; grieue to do it. Oh how far doth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science of these weake ones, exceed the mindes of many now, who thinke that they may do vnlawfull things, if they be enforced to it, by any temporall reason, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing for their warrant a notice from God, as these men here had, but all piety cleane against them. Such are they, who wil not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to go to the seruice of an idoll, if their Prince shold co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand them. This was the great perswasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which was vsed by Magnus
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:623:80"/>
a noble man, toward diuerse Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s;<note place="margin">Theodoret. Hist. Eccl. 4.20.</note> that they shold embrace the faith, &amp; opinions of the Arrians, because Valens the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, had made lawes to that purpose. Suppose saith he to them, that your religion be very good, yet if you be enforced to turne vnto another your God will forgiue it to you. And much more of that matter. Such are they, who being vrged by nothing, but the concupiscence of their own affections, will do things most vngodly. Steale to maintaine their brauerie: they cannot else liue like men. Ly, for to match their enemie, they may reach him so in pollicie. In like sort, wrastle against their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, in oppugning of the righteous, in slaundering of the innocent, because he is not for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he standeth somtimes in their light, although they know that they do amisse, &amp; that they shall answer for it. This is a small necessity, my idlenesse or my wantonnesse, my engrocing of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie gaine, to make me do that, which mine owne hart knoweth, that Gods booke daily forbiddeth to me. Although they were deepely persuaded, that it was the Lords determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet what doubting is in these seamen, to do a thing vnlawfull? for so it is in it self, but Gods wil doth make it lawful. To this wil they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yeld</p>
            <p n="23">23 And this is the third point, which I obserued in them, <hi>thou hast done as it pleaseth thee.</hi> They do not accuse God here, and lay the fault on him, as men commonly vse to do. We all haue learned that of Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>The woman which thou gauest me, she gaue me of the tree, and I did eat.</hi>

Auste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>but the woman which thou didst giue me. For nothing is so famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar as for sinners to lay vpon God, that whereof they be accused.</hi> These do not so in this place, but assume that to be righteous, which God will haue to be done, &amp; because they see him will it, &amp; that he will take no nay, therfore they know it is iust, &amp; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly yeeld vnto it. This is a sound direction, for man to submit his will, to the will of his maker, that as we are taught to pray, O Lord <hi>thy vvill be done,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 6.10. cap. 26.39.</note> so we yeeld vnto it in mildnesse. He is wiser then wee be, and therefore let him leade. Not <hi>my vvill</hi> in my manhoode, but <hi>thy vvill</hi> in thy Godheade, <hi>be done</hi> saith Christ our Sauiour.<note place="margin">1. Sam. 3.18.</note> Let the Lord saith old Eli, doe as seemeth good in his owne eyes. Although therfore any thing be vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, &amp; seem vnto vs to be vnnaturall, yet if God do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand it, we
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:623:81"/>
ought not to resist. It was vnlawfull for Abraham to kill, but more vnnaturall to kill his onely sonne, and that with his owne hands, yet when the Lord commanded, he was ready to do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both. Let other learne this lesson thence, that if their friends or children, be as deare to them, as Isaac was vnto his father Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, yet if God take them hence, they say in all obedience, the will of the Lord be done, or with these shipmen here, <hi>thou hast done as it pleaseth thee.</hi> The like we shold say of sicknesse, banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, losse of goods, or whatsoeuer else in this world. Although it go as much against vs, as it did against these men, to drown the Prophet Ionas, yet if God do require it, let vs do as it pleaseth him. And so let vs pray vnto him, first that he will keepe vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies from bloud-guiltinesse, and from murther; and then that he will giue vs grace, to make conscience of such deedes, as are against his word; but that euermore we may learne, to submit our selues to his pleasure, that walking here as deare children, we may be brought along to the inheritance of his glorie. Vnto the which ô Father bring vs, for thine owne sonne Christ his sake, to whome with thee and the holy Spirite, be laud and praise for euer.</p>

These things partly arise by ignorance, &amp; want of iudgement in discerning causes aright: but the truest and most ordinary cause, is the lacke of zeale to God, and of charity toward man, and of dutifull regard to those who should not be wilfully grieued, but esteemed as such who waite for mens soules,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.17.</note> and must giue an account, which they would be glad to do with ioy. Hereunto may be ioyned, the pulling and renting away of the maintenance of the minister: that whereas Ethnicke people, yea and our forefathers too in the dayes of superstition, did thinke that they could neuer be too prodigall, in heaping much of their substance, on those who were no better then blind guides, now cleane contrarie he is held the most wise and prudent man, who either by cunning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise, can steale something secretly from the portion of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite, or with strong hand will maintaine, his open and grosse oppression.</p>

But the mercie of these men here, is enforced to turne to iustice. They are compelled to leaue him whome they willingly would keepe. Ionas goeth ouer shipboord, where behold appeareth a miracle, the sea ceasseth from her furie. That which roared so before, &amp; was so disquieted with winds, which wrought and was so troublous, which so becalmed them with a storm, that forward they might not get, &amp; backward they could not go, that ceasseth vpon the sudden. The disturbance was not naturall, nor the quieting is not naturall, because it commeth in a moment. It was not by degrees, not one step after another, as in tempests which are ordinarie, but in that very instant when he was throwne into the water. So miraculous is Gods power, to haue the mightiest creatures, to mooue and rest at his becke. If he commaund the world to be drowned with water,<note place="margin">Genes 7.11.</note> the Ocean shall breake foorth, the fresh springs shall gush out, the very floud-gates of heauen, shall be opened with a word,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:623:85"/>
and so all the earth shall perish. If he bid his seruant Moses but stretchfoorth his hand,<note place="margin">Exod. 14.16.</note> the red sea shall part in two, and stand vp as a wall on the right side, and as a wall on the left. This is a great comfort to the faithfull, that they serue such a maister, who so commaundeth all the frame of heauenly and earthly bodies, that he turneth them and windeth them, as with a hooke in their nostrels, and leadeth them so vp and downe, that nothing shall assault them without Gods speciall pleasure. It is he that made the sea here to cease from her raging, and boyling with such violence.</p>
            <p n="9">9 But the reason why it then stayed, was because it had ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the thing which it desired. The fugitiue being taken, the pursuer is now quiet. It is punishment inflicted on the sinner, which in temporall causes allayeth the Lords anger. When Achan had his hire,<note place="margin">Iosua. 7.25. &amp; 8.1. 2.

Saules crueltie to the Gibeonites, did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure three yeares of dearth, to be sent vpon the land, in the time of Dauid: but when once the posteritie of the offending sinner, was hanged vp by the wronged parties, Gods indignation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the land was appeased. Princes and Iudges haue here a pathway laid out readie to them, wherein they ought to walke. If God do awaken a land, with a rod of his displeasure, be it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, or be it pestilence, or be it the sword of the enemie, after a view taken of the actions, and ouersights of their people, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> purge their land from iniquitie, by cutting off malefactors, and breaking the backe of sinne, and wilfull transgression.

The dying of Ionas alone for all, doth signifie the same thing, as was taught out of the twelfth verse, of this present chapter which I now handle.<note place="margin">Ionah. 1.12.</note> But nothing in plainer sorte doth expresse vnto vs, the force of the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our Sauiour, then rhe ceassing of the storme, at the drowning of the Prophet: euen as Gods wrath was appeased, by the death of the vnspotted lambe. By the fall of our first parents, wee all were fallen from grace. Wee had chaunged not a Niniue for a Tharsus, but a Paradise for a torment, and a heauen for a hell. The coldnesse of our disobedience, was followed with heate of iustice; not windes and waues did make after vs, to take vengeance on our bodies, but a waight of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry furie, of purpose to destroy our soules. Not one shippe but a world was endaungered in this hazard. The Gentile and the Iewe, the ciuill man and Barbarian, were euerie moment readie to be drowned in desperation. In this state of extremitie, God pitieth forlorne man, and sendeth a better ghest then Ionas was, among those who are passengers thorough this vale of miserie. And although this ghest was clothed with humanity, like an ordinarie passenger, yet in this he differed from Ionas, that our Prophet alone had sinned, when all his fellowes were free, but Christ alone was innocent, when all his fellowes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded guiltie.</p>

Some thinke not at Hierusalem, the place then onely appointed for sacrifice to the true God: but wheresoeuer they first landed. Arias Montanus thinketh that they offered it at Hierusalem,<note place="margin">Ar. Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus in hunc locum. Act. 8.27.</note> which thing was sometimes done by the Gentiles, as by the Chamberlaine to Candace the Queene of Aethiopia. The Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee Paraphrase hath, that they said they would offer sacrifice. Hierome thinketh that what they did,<note place="margin">Hieron in hunc locum.</note> was at sea and not at land. They made such spirituall sacrifice, as the inner man could affoord: thankes giuing, and supplication, and repentance and such like.<note place="margin">Osee. 14.3. Psal. 51.17.</note> The Prophet Osee doth call these the <hi>calues of our lippes.</hi> And Dauid he speaketh of them saying, <hi>the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of God is a troubled spirite.</hi> Howsoeuer it is not much to the historie, whether it were the one or the other.

Ghost doth let vs know, that the motiue which they saw in this action, was so mightie, that it wrong from them a remorse, and so possessed them for the time, that compunction and deuotion was within them, and without them, &amp; as men throughly mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, they refused to do nothing, which was any way religious. They either fell to their praiers, which is a spirituall sacrifice, or offered something else, when they came to the land, or at least they professed that they would do it. But it is a case without controuersie, that they made vowes to the Lord. A thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among mariners, and passengers at the sea, when they feare any shipwracke. If they can ouer-stand that iourney, and escape well from that daunger, they will fast, or giue almes, or dedicate some great thing to the Lord. They spare not to speake in the fit, although they neuer meane it. Yea and it may be, that in the extremitie they resolue to perfourme their vow, but the daunger being once past and gone, if they should be vrged to accomplish it, they would thinke themselues as il vsed, as those two were by Caligula;<note place="margin">Dion. Hist. lib. 59.</note> of whome Dion reporteth, that when the said Caligula was sicke, they thinking to get much mony, as a reward for their great loue to the Emperour, vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that on condition he might liue, they themselues would dye to excuse him. When indeede he was recouered afterward, he tooke them at their word, and put them to death, least they should breake their vowe, and prooue periured persons. Of likelyhood, these thought themselues to be vsed but vnkindly, and so would these vowing shipmen, if they should be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to performance. But he that will see more of this, let him reade Erasmus his Dialogue, which he calleth by the title of <hi>Naufragium.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Erasmus in Colloquio.</note> What the Scripture thinketh of vowes, and what our Church maintaineth, which is a better argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be handled against our Popish Votaries, I may touch hereafter, when I come to the ninth verse of the second Chapter. For at this time my meaning is to discourse another matter.</p>
            <p n="17">17 It is a great controuersie, whether this exceeding feare, do intend a true conuersion from Gentilisme to the Lord, from idolatrie to true pietie; and in this also, the best Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors

do very much dissent. Some thinke them to be become ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Proselites,<note place="margin">Ar. Montan.</note> and men turned to the Iewish faith: that their feare was sincere from the heart, and perseuerant in them vnto the end, and that their sacrifices were accepted, and all this so much the rather, because the text doth say, that they feared the Lord Iehouah:<note place="margin">Caluinus.</note> not an idole, but the true God. Some other put a condition, that if the heart were iustified with a purifying faith, then their vowes and sacrifices, were acceptable and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to the Lord. If otherwise, then it was but a vizard, put on for a little time,<note place="margin">Danaeus.</note> and so throwne off afterward. A third sort are of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that their repentance was onely temporary, like the seed which is mentioned in the parable of Christ,<note place="margin">Matth. 13.5.</note> to be sowen on the stony ground, which tooke roote for a little time, and afterward did wither away. I do approue this last sentence, thinking that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they feared, and tooke vpon them some religion, yet this was not sufficient to apprehend true grace: for they had not heard by the Prophet, of the Messias Christ, in whom is all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission and washing away of sinne.<note place="margin">Act. 4.12.</note> Onely the wrath of God in punishing, is made knowne vnto them, which is inough to put the vnbeleeuer, into a trembling feare, as we know that Felix did quake,<note place="margin">Cap. 24.26.</note> to heare Saint Paule speake of righteousnesse, of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and of the iudgement to come: and yet Felix was an hypocrite. Neither is this opinion crossed by that, where it is said <hi>that they feared Iehouah,</hi> for the reprobates do quake at the true God, with a kind of seruility, as the diuels of hell do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. The awe wherein Pharao stood,<note place="margin">Iacob. 2.19. 1. Reg. 21.27.</note> when he let the people go, was to the God of Moses.

And yet it is not to be doubted, but these men were reprobates.</p>
            <p n="18">18 These sea-people in like sort, might well thinke of the Lord, and yet not leaue their idolatry. The people placed in Samaria,<note place="margin">2. Reg. 17.3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

but they worshipped their idols also, and so it had bene as good not at all,<note place="margin">Tertullian. in Apologet.</note> as to be neuer the neerer to him. The Romanes would haue had Christ, to be in the number of their Gods, placed in their Pantheon: but they cannot away to leaue their old Gods, whom they had before. Such halfe-seruice could not profit these mariners in this place. This was an insufficient comprehension of the Lord, without sound application in particular, by a true faith, which teacheth, that God alone is to be adored by his creatures, and that with a single heart, and an vnderstanding knowledge, and perseuerance vnto the ende. Which because the wicked do want, howsoeuer vpon occasions of afflictions, and strange wonders, they seeme humbled for the time, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward with the dogge they returne to their vomit,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2.22.</note> and with the sow which was washed, to their wallowing in the mire. And this recidiuation is more dangerous then the sicknesse: this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapse then the first fall. For those to whom this happeneth, are they whom Iude calleth trees twise dead and rotten,<note place="margin">Iud. 12.</note> and good for nothing else, but to be plucked vp by the rootes. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which such men haue, doth make against themselues: their thoughts against themselues: the motions of their owne mind, when they haue thought vpon goodnesse, shall witnesse hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against them.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 19 We do here-out learne two lessons. First that hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites and dissemblers (besides their internall motions, which they haue oft times to goodnesse) in outward and externall points of religion, can go as farre as the faithfull, or the best child of God: as these here can offer sacrifice, and make vowes to the Lord.<note place="margin">Act. 8.13. Matth. 26.25. Cap. 22.15. Luc. 18.12.</note> So Simon Magus will be baptised, and Iudas come to the supper, and heretikes can preach Christ, and Herodians heare his word, and Pharisees pay their tith, and Iesuites fast and pray, so that ceremonies and the shew which is outward, do not euer import verity of religion.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11 14. Matth. 7.15.21.23.</note> Sathan transformeth himselfe into an Angell of light. Wolues come forth in sheepes clothing: There be that cry Lord, Lord, and yet Christ doth not know them. Whereupon that speech is true, that we may more easily know who is an vngodly man, then who is truly godly. For hypocrisie may with a shadow, make a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:623:89"/>
shew of the one, but foule and wicked deeds will neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily discouer the other. Where an irreligious life is lead, and grosse sinnes are committed, it is an euident proofe, that the true feare of God, is not yet resident in that person. Therefore it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth vs to be wary, that we leane not on any one, but as he leaneth on Christ: for as we must take heed, that we iudge not other men, in particular without charity, so we must hold this in generall, that all is not gold that glistereth.</p>
            <p n="20">20 A second lesson is, that we all looke to our selues, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> we satisfie not our soules, with any externall action, neither that we apprehend grace, by fits or feags, as we are vrged by any present thing, that hangeth on vs: but that we labour euermore, to retaine the good which is offered to vs; that we quench not the Spirite of God, but stirre it vp in our selues. It is a thing violent to our nature, to haue a minde vnto holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, we saile as if it were against the streame. As then in a violent water, if the boate-men slacke a few strokes, in a moment he is caried more downeward, then in a good time before he hath gained by his labour; so we must know, that in loosing the hold which we haue of Gods Spirite, we may loose more in one yeare, nay perhaps more in one houre, then we haue gained in many. It is not inough to weepe, when we feele the rod vpon vs, to pray when we are in sicknesse: to cry when we are in danger: but in wel-fare and prosperity, God must be thought vpon,<note place="margin">Bernard. de 2. discipulis euntibus ad Emaus. <hi>Cuius oculi sunt sicut pis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinae Hesbon prae multitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne lachrymaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

               </note> as well as in aduersity. We must not hold our duty to be then discharged to the full, when in a moment of some great matter, we feare the Lord exceedingly, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and vowe, and do all that we can deuise, and straight way prooue like a feuer, haue a cold bowte for a heate and so fall away from grace, but we must follow that veine, and pursue it to the end.</p>
            <p n="21">21 Saint Bernard in his time, found men rebukeable for this errour. For writing of the two Disciples, which went vnto Emaus, he speaketh fitly to this purpose: <hi>You shall sometimes see a man verie deuout in his prayers, vvhose eyes vvill seeme to stand like the pooles of Hesbon, for the multitude of his teares,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:623:90"/>
and yet this man refuseth to beare the yoake of obedience. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waileth his pride, while he is at his prayers, but the houre of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction being once past and gone, he is as proud as before.</hi> I would that ourage were free from this vnstayed repentance. But I feare that it is otherwise. When we sit and heare a Sermon, a word or two well set on, doth bruise vs much for a mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> solemne dayes, as at our anniuersary thanksgiuing, for the loue of God, so farre extended to vs, in the enioying of her Maiesty, or vpon other the like occasions, our hearts and eyes and all, shall testifie our great feeling. So when we come to the Sacrament, we are very repentant persons; but is it not true of vs, that like vnto the bul rush we hang downe our heads for a day: that drinking with the serpent,<note place="margin">Isay. 58.5.</note> we resume againe our poyson of malice and peruersenesse. When we are in the Church, we intend to leaue our bribe-taking: but with the Church we forget it: when our night-thoughts haue well troubled vs, we vow to leaue our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitablenesse, and to plucke vp the roote of bitternesse; but ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing we returne vnto our ancient euill. In the fields we can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, against our owne oppression, our slandering and reuiling, but when we come home, we yeeld our selues vnto the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Angell. This is to dally with God, and to heape wrath on our selues. The most wicked men and idolaters, as Ionas his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes here, can thinke on goodnesse for a little, and feare the Lord exceedingly, and yet not be the better for it. Sincerity and simplicity, and perseuerance and performance, beseeme the child of God. I haue troubled you ouer long. Lord enrich vs so with thy spirit, that as we haue begun, so we may end in thee, that thy true feare still possessing vs, we may be brought to thy kingdome, there to raigne by the merite of thy Sonne, to whom with thee and thy Spirite be laud and praise for euer.</p>

The danger arising from these, both vnto men and beasts, would be perpetuall, but that God hath proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a remedy to slacke the fury of them; and that is in admirable maner. There are alwayes in that coast infinite swarmes of gnats, which gather much about those Lions, and to nothing in them so desirously as to their eyes, whom we know to be bright and shining members. But sitting fast on the eye-lids, they do so pricke and sting them, that the raging Lions are forced to scratch with their nailes, as if they would remooue the gnats; but indeede they claw out their owne eyes, so that many of them by this meanes growing blind, do drowne themselues in the great riuers, or otherwise become lesse terrible. This is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods wisedome, who delighteth in such variety of these inferiour bodies. And yet withall, it is an argument of his puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance, who by so weake a matter can ouerthrow such a great one: a Lion by a gnat: and hath those little ones so attendant, as that euery man may see that they are <hi>prepared</hi> by their maker, to ouer-rule the other; to chase them and pursue them, and vexe them vnto destruction.

The wicked on the one side may feare his hand, who can raise such meanes to perplexe them: and the faithfull on the other side may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his mercy, who hath such helpes at need: and both of them may stand amased, and wonder at his power, who hath his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments euermore so ready.</p>
            <p n="5">5 I know not whether in our Prophet, is more to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected, Gods punishment or his protection. If we thinke vpon his drowning, he doth fauour him, since he had at hand a great fish to receiue him, so that he did not perish. If we thinke of the time and place, where he lay, and how long, that is, in the dungeon of that fishes belly, for three dayes and three nights, it doth double and often multiply Gods angry wrath vpon him. The euent doth giue this testimony, that since Ionas (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer at the first he fell) was appointed, and predestinated to good and not to euill, his deliuerance was as readie, as his chastisement was for him: one hand to cast him downe, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to helpe him vp: when the ship might not any longer containe him, the fishes bellie was in steede of a sea-ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, to bring him on toward Niniue. But in the meane while his lying was such, in so many dreades and horrours, and anguishes for his life, nay for doubte of the life eternall,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:623:93"/>
(because wrath was vpon him, which endangered his best part, euen his inward man and his soule) that many deaths had bene easier then a languishing in that prison, where now he had his best repose. So sowre a thing is sinne, and disobedience to the Lord. It may be sweete in the mouth, but it is bitter in the belly, like a cup of deadly poyson. Certainely it is a daughter of those Locustes,<note place="margin">Apoc. 9.7.10.</note> which haue faces faire as men, but killing stings in their tailes. It is pleasure with too much paine: sweete meate with too sharpe sauce. And therefore it may well be likened to that herbe Sardonia in Sardinia,<note place="margin">Solinus cap. 10.</note> of the which Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus writeth, that it maketh the eaters thereof, to looke as if they laughed, but in their laughing they dye. Thus Ionas is preserued; but to testifie Gods displeasure, in the meanes of his preseruation he endureth full many sorowes. Let vs now see if you please, what that was, whereby God so wrought for him.</p>

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:623:94"/>
out of an Epistle, which was written to Polydore Virgil, and is auouched there as most true, that in the yeare of our Lord 1532, in the Northren coastes of our owne land, not farre from Tinmouth hauen, was a mighty whale cast on land, who was ninety foote in length, which ariseth to thirty English yeards. The very breadth of his mouth, was sixe yeards and a halfe, and the belly so vaste in compasse, that one standing on the fish, of purpose to cut a ribbe off from him, and slipping into his bellie, was very likely there to be drowned, with the moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture then remaining. The hollownesse of this paunch, might containe much more then Ionas; such a mouth might well receiue him, and such a throte might well swallow him. The stories and the Chronicles of our owne land let vs know, that quantities like to these, among fishes are not to be held for miracles. This question concerning our Prophet lying in the belly of the whale,<note place="margin">Augustin E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistola. 49.</note> was once proposed to Saint Austen. In aunswer whereunto, he maketh no doubt, but that a whale is great inough, to receiue a farre bigger matter into his belly. He appealeth vnto certaine ribbes, which at Carthage were hanged vp, for euery man to behold: and from the compasse of their hugenesse, which were taken from a whale, he bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them imagine, how mighty that mouth was, which was but as a dore or gate, to that caue or vile dungeon, intending the fishes belly. But he concludeth it to be neither impossible, nor yet vnlikely, that a whale might swallow Ionas. If any should be desirous, to heare or see more concerning this matter, let him reade in Iob,<note place="margin">Iob. 40. &amp;. 41.</note> Gods owne testimony of Leuiathan, which intendeth the great whale.</p>
            <p n="8">8 But there is another and that a greater difficulty, in that place proposed to Austen, by the meanes of a pagane person: how the Prophet could be able, for the space of three dayes and three nights, to endure the concocting vapor, &amp; strong heate of that belly, which digesteth and resolueth some substances of strong quality. The infidels of that time, did hold this to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ridiculous, and as fabulous a thing as might be: and he that wrote to Saint Austen, seemeth to make doubt of this matter,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:623:94"/>
although otherwise he were a Christian.<note place="margin">Epistol. 49.</note> The learned father making aunswere, doth not labour to satisfie the scoffes and scornes of any Paganes, because they do contemne the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and all grounds of Christianity, and do call into question not onely this, but many other matters. Yet he sayth, that they would haue beleeued this, which they iudge so straunge in our Prophet Ionas,<note place="margin">Vide Apu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leium de Asi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no aureo. Et Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat. de vita Apollon.</note> if it had bene reported by their owne fond A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puleius, or Apollonius Tyaneus, two notable Magicians. But he speaketh home, vnto those who professe the name of Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus. Why should they, who do beleeue other miracles of Gods booke, make scruple of this matter? It is not so that one part of the Scripture is true, and another otherwise; but all is of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted verity. Could the belly of the whale be hoter to the Prophet, then the fiery fornace was to the three children in Daniel?<note place="margin">Daniel. 3.25.</note> God saued them in the one, and he saued him in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Is it more to bring a liuing man, after three daies from a fish, then it was to raise a dead man, after foure dayes from his graue? Yet we beleeue that this was done to Lazarus.<note place="margin">Iohan. 11.44.</note> In like sort Christ Iesus being dead for so long time, as Ionas lay in this fish, did come aliue from his sepulcher, which miracle sayth Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten, <hi>vve should not beleeue, if the faith of the Christians, did feare the scornes and taunts of the Paganes.</hi> For we know that they do deride that. Thus Saint Austen doth resolue it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging it to be a miracle, wrought by the hand of the Almightie. Saint Hierome in his Commentary, which he wrote on the Prophet Ionas,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in Ionae. 1.</note> doth iumpe in the selfe same iudgement. Those who make question here, sayth he, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faithfull, or infidels, Christians or vnbeleeuers. If Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, then the truth of that word which is inspired by God, must preuaile here, as well as elsewhere, and this by faith must be embraced, as much as other things which are written. If infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, then no maruell, for they deny both the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament. Yet they would beleeue any fable in Ouids Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphosis,<note place="margin">Ouid Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphos. lib. 1.</note> as that Daphne was turned into a bay-tree, or some other thing of that forging.

For graunt him to be Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; lay that once downe for a ground, and euery thing will follow, which he shall be pleased to will. This is the faith of the Christians: this belongeth to all Gods children. But the Atheists of our age, who are risen out of the ashes of Libanius the great Sophister, or of that scorning Porphiry, or of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rider Lucian, or of Iulian the Apostata, do insult ouer this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, of the omnipotency of God, with impiety more then monstrous. They iest at the name of faith, as a toye made to delude men: and Reason onely must cary it. This may liuely be notified, by that one of their Axiomes, which I once did find written, in the beginning of a new Testament, <hi>Ratio suadet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">O vox impia.</note>

And who is he that by these shall be euer able to iustifie, first that a fish could liue for three dayes and three nights, with such a one in his bellye, with his clothes and apparell on (for that must be imagined) and this fish should neither be choaked with his cariage, nor killed with the moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and tumbling of him within; and secondly that for so long a time, a man liuing and not hurt, should be lodged in such a prison. For how could he endure the vapour of a sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make so hote-boyling? Where should he haue breath to feede him, and aire to liue vpon?</q>
Thus with an audacious fore-head, they call him to a reason, who doth things beyond reason, and will not tye himselfe to that sifting and that scanning, which the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:623:95"/>
thinnesse, and the basenesse of mans wit can affoord him. He sheweth this very plainly,<note place="margin">Isay. 7.14.</note> when he will haue a virgin to become a mother, a sonne without mans seede, mortall and yet immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, a creator and yet a creature, most infinite and yet finite, euer liuing and yet once dying.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Notwithstanding euen for this purpose, in his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome he doth not leaue himselfe without a witnesse: for as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible things as these, are done euery day amongst vs. This perhaps may seeme a paradoxe, and not to be beleeued: but I say it againe, as impossible things as this is, are done euery day amongst vs: but that our custome is to contemne, and passe by the strangest matter, if it once grow common among vs; yea when it is so straunge, that our vnderstanding is able to yeeld no reason of it. Such actions do mooue vs most, which are most rare, and fewest times do fall out. It is no maruell to see the Sunne, and the starres in their daily order, because day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we may do it, but to see a new starre appearing, as not long since there was one in the signe Cassiopaea,<note place="margin">Anno. 1572.</note> is a matter to mooue amazednesse: whereas any other starre might raise as much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, if we would but call to mind, that it had bene new in the creation, although in these dayes it be old.

I will take that <hi>pro concesso,</hi> that they were borne of their mothers, yea perhaps of vertuous mothers; who loue God with their

Yet this I may adde concerning them, that so farre they are like that Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, that if they had their demerites, no reformed place, or Citie, no Christian common-wealth, should beare them and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them, who are monsters and not men, being of impudent hearts and faces.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Let that then be agreed betweene vs (because it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied) that they were borne of their mothers, and after the course of common children.

When Mary came to Elizabeth, that child which was afterward Iohn the Baptist, is sayd to spring in her wombe. This example and common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience which cannot be denied, doth argue life to be in the little ones. Now then tell me thou wicked Atheist, how can this be maintained? If there be no breath, how a life? If breath, whence doth he draw it? Thou art taken in thine owne net: the scruples of this question, cannot be resolued by thee. Thou art proud in thine owne conceipt, and presumest much of thy wit; but yet in the knowledge of naturall effects, thou art much infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior vnto Dauid, as thou must needs confesse, if thou wilt reade his Psalmes aduisedly. But he can say for himselfe, in discoursing of his owne generation,<note place="margin">Psal. 139.14.</note> that <hi>fearefully and vvonderfully</hi> he was created by God, and that there were miracles in his making.

Pardon me thou proud dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puter, if I thinke that thy wit doth come much short of the Prophet. If then thou wilt not be wilfull, thou must aunswer for the infant, that it is done which hath bene spoken off, but the manner how thou knowest not. Confesse Gods finger there, and confesse Gods finger here; who can do that to a man, which he doth so oft to children, who can do that by sea, which

he doth so oft at land; who can do that in a fish, which he doth in euery mother; who can do that in one age, which he doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day.

            <p n="12">12 The precise accompt of which time, (being nothing else but a figure, of the lying of Christ Iesus, in the bowels of the earth, and being appointed for that cause, (as Gods owne Son doth witnesse) doth mooue me to suppose, that those daies &amp; nights, wherein our Prophet was shut vp in the whale, were not entirely completed thrise foure and twentie houres.<note place="margin">Matth. 12.40</note> For if it were otherwise in Christ who was the bodie, then very likely that it was otherwise in him who was but the shadow: that the signe and the thing signified, the figure and the truth, might haue a due proportion. But the lying of Christ in the graue, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the circumstance of three daies, was in some measure <hi>Tropicall,</hi> and not to be taken literally: for by the figure <hi>Synec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche,</hi> part of the day is reckened for the whole: and because the light and the darknesse, for foure and twentie houres, make but one naturall day, part of the day shall enclose the night which was gone before, so that a peece of the artificiall day, shall be accounted for a day naturall. To make this the more euident: the Iewes did account their day to begin at the Sunne setting, which is to be vnderstood, of one of their naturall dayes; but their day artificiall, was commonly reputed to beginne at sixe of the clocke in the morning, especially about the time of the <hi>Aequinoctium,</hi> when it is apparant that our Sauiour did suffer.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:623:97"/>
Christ then dyed at the ninth houre,<note place="margin">Matth. 27.46.</note> that is at three of the clock after noone, on a friday as we call it; and before that the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was in, on the day of the Preparation, which was that selfe same Friday his body was layd in graue. That little time before euening,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Synecdoches vna species est, cum pars pro toto capitur.</hi>
               </note> is by the figure <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> (which taketh a part for the whole) reputed for a whole day and a night, that is, the day and night before going. The night then which did follow the setting of the Sunne, and the day which was their Easter, (but by vs is called Saterday) is reckened for the second. And indeed this was complete, both for the day and the night. Then follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the next night,<note place="margin">Matth. 28.1. Marc. 16.1.</note> wherein Iesus arose very earely in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, at or before the dawning of the day, and the opening of the light, and this is to be numbred for the third both day and night, the part taken for the whole by the figure as before. This kind of computation, as with ease it may be gathered from the narration of the Euangelistes,<note place="margin">Augustin. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. 49. Beza in Ioh. 18.</note> so Saint Austen doth approoue it, and the late Diuines so accept it. And it should not seeme strange, since in other things we do vse it. The Phisitians call that feauer, a Tertian or third Ague, which skippeth but one day onely. The Termes of our Vniuersitie are reckened in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The last day of a Terme is reputed for a Terme, and the first day of another is taken for another Terme; so that according to our vse in some cases, one Terme and two daies are taken for three Termes. Thus was Christ in his graue, by the space of three daies and three nights, either in part or in whole; like to which it is very probable, that the staying of the Prophet in the whale, was abridged and abbreuiated, for some part of the time, that there might be a full resemblance betweene the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the seruant and the maister.

It must
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:623:97"/>
follow thereupon by a necessarie consequent: But as Ionas was then deliuered, so shall the Sonne of man then come forth, with a sensible resurrection. Christ foretold that he would do this, <hi>Do you destroy this temple,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 2.19.</note> intending thereby his body, <hi>and in three daies I will raise it,</hi> and set it vp againe. This was also fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by Dauid,<note place="margin">Psal. 16.11. Act. 2.31.</note> although in the person of our Sauiour: <hi>Thou wilt not leaue my soule in hell, nor suffer thy holy one to see corruption,</hi> which text Saint Peter citeth, to aduouch Christs resurrection. That he did rise againe, the Euangelists all do cry: the Apostles all do confirme it. How plentifull is Saint Paule in discoursing this argument,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.5.</note> that he did appeare oftentimes, one while but to a few, another while to the Twelue, but afterward to more then fiue hundred brethen at once? By the vertue of his Godhead, Christ had a soueraigne power to loose himselfe from death: it was a thing vnpossible that he should be holden of it.<note place="margin">Act. 2.24.</note> If his life had bene taken from him vnwillingly, and by violence, then ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry likely it is, that the selfe same violence might haue still detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him prisoner.<note place="margin">Ioh. 19.30.</note> But his dying was voluntarie: he yeelded vp the Ghost, and being contented to put himselfe amidst those an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes and horrours, he abode there at his pleasure, on the crosse and in the graue; and from death he returned with the selfe same pleasure, as hauing conquered all, and triumphing in great glorie. And then he who came from heauen, to disquiet himselfe on earth, so to purchase mans redemption, left death and graue and earth,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4.8.</note> and with captiuitie captiue, ascended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to heauen, where he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ate him downe in his maiestie on the right hand of his Father.</p>
            <p n="14">14 And by his resurrection our hope is to be saued: herein doth rest the anchor of our happinesse and true blessednesse. For in vaine had bene his debasing, and in vaine his incarnation, if he had not liued amongst vs. And in vaine had bene his life, and in vaine had bene his preaching, if his death had not followed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For his life was giuen for our raunsome: his bloud it was which did wash vs: his death it was which did quicken vs. But in vaine had bene his death also, if he had not shaken off morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie from him, and borne vp his graue before him, and thereby winning his prizes, had not maistered all which resisted. So that
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:623:98"/>
we apprehend his resurrection, as the stay and substance of our saluation; as the vp-shot of our blessednesse; from the which if we should fall, we do plunge into vtter ruine. Therefore in the Articles of our faith,<note place="margin">In Symbolo Apostoloru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> this is put for one, that dying, <hi>he rose againe the third day from the dead.</hi> Not that onely he died, for the Iewes beleeue so much, and the Gentiles beleeue so farre; but that he was quickened againe.<note place="margin">Augustin. contra Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeum. l. 16.</note> For, as Saint Austen hath obserued, <hi>the Paganes do admit this for a truth, that Christ did dye: but that he rose againe, is the proper faith of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> and imparted to no other. Now we hold Christ for the head, and our selues to be the members: what he hath done before, we trust that we shall do afterward. So that by his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing againe, is inferred the resurrection of other, and that of all, as well the iust as the vniust, and the vniust as the iust: the one sort to raigne with their Sauiour, on whome they haue belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, the other to suffer torments, because they haue contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.<note place="margin">2.

And if we did not expect this, the followers of Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus were most wretched men of all other,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.19</note> who for this hope sealed vnto them, do endure such strong vexations, such grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uances and perplexities. All the Martyrs were most foolish, who loose their liues in this world, for the maintenance of Christs glorie,<note place="margin">Chrysost. in Matth. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil. 5.</note> which were absurd stupiditie (as Chrysostome hath well noted) if they held not themselues assured, that he were come from the dead: neuer dye for him who liueth not: and againe if they beleeued not, that in recompence of their sufferings they should see a better life, and receiue a firme inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance in the day of last proceeding.</p>
            <p n="15">15 Their warrant is sealed vnto them, by him who cannot lye, both that their holy seruice shall be rewarded by him, who shall pronounce that comfort, <hi>Come you blessed of my Father, inherite eternall life</hi>;<note place="margin">Matth. 25.34</note> and that there shall be a day, wherein they shall heare that sentence, and that is in the resurrection. There were in former times many figures of that matter, euen before the light of the Gospell, as when Enoch and

In like sort, when there were shewed vnto the Prophet Ezechiel great heapes of scattered bones: which the Lord yet put together, and laid sinewes v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, and made flesh grow thereon, and then couered both with skinne, and afterward breathed life into them.

               <hi>I saw a great white throne, and one that sate on it, from whose face fled away both the earth and heauen, and their place vvas no more found.

            <p n="16">16 As there is in all the faithful an assenting to this doctrine, &amp; the like might be in very Ethnicks, sauing that their eies are clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, &amp; therfore they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not see, as a sound to a deaf eare is nothing,

And you may put them in this number, who in Saint Paules time did vse this by-word, <hi>Let vs eate and drinke, for to morrow we shall dye,</hi> as intending that in death should be a finall end, and we should be no more heard of. The persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Gentiles were plainely of this opinion, of some of whom in Fraunce Eusebius witnesseth, that they in scorne of the resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which the Christians do beleeue, did burne many of the Martyrs, and afterward threw their ashes into the riuer Rhoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, with this foolish exprobration, <hi>Let vs see now if their God be able to reuiue them.</hi> In a word, most of the Pagans in all ages of the world, and all Atheists among Christians, (a thing in our time too well knowne) do oppugne this truth beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. At whose liues I do not maruell, if they be like their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, that is, such (some few ciuill respects excepted) as are fit for those men, who feare neither God nor Diuell.

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:623:99"/>
that there might not be in Israel a man, who should once dare to blaspheme the name of the Lord. I remember it is recorded of the Atheniens, that in the respect which they caried to their false and fained Gods,<note place="margin">Diodor. Sic.

But herewith the other not contented, did put foorth a proclamation, that whosoeuer it were that would kill that Diagoras, should haue an honourable reward, that was, a talent of siluer for his labour.</p>
            <p n="17">17 But to leaue these lawes vnto the Christian magistrate, and to proceed as a Minister, the arguments of all these, and a thousand more of that sute, are but vanitie of all vanities, when they come once to be weighed in the balla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Sanctuary, and are counterpoised onely with the high Gods omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. For why should we tye his power vnto our foolish wit? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that there be dying vpon dying, and deuouring vpon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring; that a man be slaine, and his members consumed, some by birdes, some by beastes, some by fishes; and imagine that those creatures be taken, and eaten againe by men, and those men be then burnt, and their ashes throwne into the water, and if we can go farther, let there be as many mutations more, what is all this to plunge his abilitie, who can do euerie thing, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer himselfe shall please? He can do euery thing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore raise this man. If nature cannot conceiue it, learne to looke a little higher, to grace and faith beyond nature. Plato an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then man did much reprooue Anaxagoras,<note place="margin">Plutarch. de defectu ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culorum.</note> because tying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe too farre, to naturall causes and reasons, he omitted to thinke on the efficient cause of all things, which is surely God the first moouer. This is a monstrous errour of vs also. But will we allow that to God, the like wherof we do allow vnto men? If an image should be made of lead,<note place="margin">Lombard. Sentent. lib. 4. Dist. 44.</note> to the proportion of a man, and the workman which did make it remaining still aliue, should retaine the mould, or remember the fashion of it with his best obseruation; although this image were now broken into peeces, and some of the lead thereof did perchance in a wall, ioyne some stones vnto other, or iron to stones in windows, or if some were framed into bullets, or put to other vses, be they neuer so

               </note> But I rather will strengthen it, with that argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Tertullian who speaketh to this purpose. We were alreadie once made of nothing, when our matter went not before: and is it not as easie, that we should be againe made, when we haue bene before? If after our corruption our substance should be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, yea very nothing at all, yet can we thinke it lesse, then it was before our breeding? The authour of the first, can as well do the latter. This reason seemed strong vnto Gregory the great, where he speaketh in this sort, <hi>If a man who hath bene dead shold be raised vp, all men breake foorth into admiration, and yet daily is man borne who neuer was before, and no man wondreth at that: whereas without doubt it may appeare vnto all men, that it is a greater worke when that is made which neuer was, then when that shall be but repaired</hi> and new made <hi>which was before.</hi> To follow this a little farther, which of vs doth remember what we were, before that we were borne: where was our forme or our matter? Yet we are growne to this quantitie, and come vp to this fashion. If we will speake as Philosophers, the sonne is said to be in potentia of the father: so of the grandfather and great grandfather, although much more remooued. If we will speake as the Spirite of God doth speake,<note place="margin">Hebr. 7.20.</note> Leui the sonne of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, who was the sonne of Isaac, who was the heire of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, is said to be in the loines of Abraham his great grandfather. The line by this proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, may be reached a great deale higher. Now how many alterations, corruptions, dissolutions, in nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment

and in food, within men and without, of necessitie must there be, within ten generations, before that he be produced who is the tenth successor? Where shall we say was the seed, or what shall we thinke was the matter, from whence he was deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued? Yet God hath so disposed, that by order of propagation, it should be so and no otherwise: and a thousand alterations can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hinder the course thereof; and a million of corruptions shall not crosse his purpose afterward, but that from earth and sea, and stones, and rockes, and ashes, chaunged ouer and ouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, he can rowze vs and reuiue vs. The perpetuated order of his actions here among vs, doth shew that he can doe things, which are as farre vnlikely.

Herein indeed is the difference, that the graue doth hold vs lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the bed a lesser while. Thus hath the Lord euery way, put re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancers in our actions, &amp; daily obseruations, that certainly we shall dy, &amp; certainly rise againe, &amp; certainly be then iudged. The veritie of which matter, euen by the light of nature hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared vnto some, who neuer did know the Lord.

So did Plato aboue all other of the auncient Philosophers, who both saith that the soule liueth separated from the bodie,<note place="margin">Plato Epist. 7 Idem de Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibus 12.</note> and that it commeth to an account, and if it haue so deserued, suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth punishment and great torment: yea he mentioneth such a iudgement,<note place="margin">Dialog. 10. de republ.</note> as wherein the good are set on the right hand, and the euill on the left, as if he had perused the bookes of the sacred Bible. The French Prophets those Druides, as Pomponius Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la noteth,<note place="margin">Pomponius. Mela lib. 3.</note> did both beleeue, and teach the immortalitie of the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:623:101"/>
soule, which was a good inducement to inferre the resurrection. For when they held this vndoubtedly, that the better part doth not die, and by a consequent, that the soules of them which had done well, for their good life in this place, should come vnto fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie, they might haue easily bene perswaded, that by a good congruitie, the instrument and copartner and sister of the soule, I meane this flesh of ours, being ioyned in all actions, should in vprightnesse of iustice, be ioyned in the reward, whether it be good or euill.</p>
            <p n="20">20 How much to blame are the Atheists and Epicures of our time, who come not so farre as this; but as they depriue our bodies of all future reuiuing, so they teach that our soules, in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing are different from the beasts: but that in the dissolution, the spirit shall be dissolued, as well as the exteriour man: in which thoughts they shew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, to be worse then many Ethnicks. They little conceiue the dignity, and simplicity of that spirit, the single in compoundnesse of that self-moouing soule, for so I may well call it,<note place="margin">Chrysost. in Matth. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil. 35.</note> in comparison of the flesh. For as Chrysostome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his argument, If the soule can giue such life and beautie vnto the bodie, with what a life and fairenesse doth it liue in it selfe? And if it can hold together the bodie, which is so stinking and so deformed a carcasse, as appeareth euidently after death, how much more shall it conserue, and preserue it selfe in his owne being? So pregnant is this reason, that an infidell may conceiue it, and very well apprehend it: but we which are Christian men may remember a farther lesson. That our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour hath dyed for vs, and payed a price very great, his owne most precious bloud. For whom or what was this? for our body which liueth and dieth, and rotteth and neuer returneth againe? for our soule which is here this day, and too morrow spilt and corrupted? How vnworthy were this of him, to endure so much for so little? Shall we thinke him so vnwise, or repute him so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduised? No, he knew that this soule of ours must stand before his throne; and this rottennesse must come foorth, by a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full resurrection. And if this should not be so, if there should be no accompt, no recompence for ill deedes, no retribution for the good, to what end should men serue the Lord, or what
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:623:102"/>
difference should there be betweene the iust and the vniust, the holy and the profane? nay betweene man the best creature that mooueth vpon the ground, and the basest and vilest beast, which hath little sence and no reason? Because it were impiety to think this of our iust Lord, that so slenderly he disposeth things, let vs with an assured faith, conceiue our immortality, and the hope of a resurrection.</p>
            <p n="21">21 As this hath bene deduced from the example of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, by this or the like sort, Ionas was in the fishes belly, so was Christ in the graue: Ionas came forth from thence, so did Christ rise againe, his rising doth bring our rising, his resurrection, ours, because he was the first fruits of all those that do sleep.<note place="margin">1.

            <p n="22">22 The remembrance of this accompt, should be as a snaffle to vs, or as a bridle to keepe vs backward from profanenesse &amp; enormitie.

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen Ionas was in the sea, being cast out by the mariners, and was now of all likelyhood ready to be drowned, God had a fish prepared, (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you haue heard) to swallow vp the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. And in the belly thereof, he lay three daies and three nights, after such a manner, as was neuer heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but no doubt much tormented between hope and distrust; almost quite in dispaire, yet by faith againe comforted. This faith of his, when at length it had preuailed, he breaketh forth (euen there in prison) into good meditations, and after his deliuerie, when he wrote this prophecie, he digested them into a prayer, which is here set downe in a kind of Hebrew verse, not much vnlike to the Lyrikes of the Greek or Latin Poets. Those words
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:623:103"/>
which I haue read vnto you, are some part of this prayer, and that which followeth after, is another part, in both which if something sound, as from him being in danger, and some thing againe as from him being escaped, impute the one vnto the time wherein he did write it, and the other to those conflicts which he sustained while he lay in the belly of the whale, where his bitter meditations, and troubled thoughts, did answere vnto that which is here proposed vnto vs.</p>
            <p n="2">2 For the space of those three dayes, he did not lye asleepe, as a man in a traunce, or one vnsensible amated, (for right hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie he had bene, if that might haue be fallen him) but boiling in the extremitie of anguish, and great sorrow, as he that had on him a burthen so vnsupportable by his shoulders, that he knew not how to turne him, or to manage himselfe. He felt the wrath of God, perpetuated on him without intermission, which wrath was not contented to haue him ouer ship-boord, and so once to drowne him, but dying he must liue, and liuing he must dy in a torturous execution, so terribly and vncomfortably, that the like had bene neuer heard of. The horror of death still present, &amp; yet prolo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged stil, in the middle of the sea, in the belly of a whale, a prison and monstrous dungeon did vrge him oft to tremble: but the feeling of Gods displeasure vpon his soule for sinne, and the very great expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of eternall pains in hell, what thoughts did these now raise in him? Now the soure of his disobedience is fully tasted by him: he may tumble it and reuolue it, and chew it againe &amp; againe. Now if Niniue had bene distant, as farre as the Easterne Indies, or the South part of Aethiopia, &amp; there he had bene sure to be murthered and massacred, by the tyrannie of the gouernour, or ruler of that countrie, he could haue bene wel co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, to haue gone thither euen bare-footed, &amp; thanked God on his knees, who had brought him to such a bargaine. For it is better to trace ouer all the world, then once to go to hell: better to suffer many sorrowes in body, then in soule to die eternally. With which thoughts being so perplexed, as neuer was man before him, &amp; not knowing what else to do, with a faith tried in &amp; out, &amp; ouer &amp; ouer again, he falleth at length to prayer, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect wherof is in this second chapter, by it selfe laid downe vnto

vs. But because this prayer is so lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, as that at many seueral times it must be handled, for distinction and orders sake, I thinke good first to deuide it into a Preface and a Prayer. The Preface is in the first verse; the Prayer in that which followeth. And there, what subdiuisions are afterward to be made, it shall in his place appeare.

In respect whereof,<note place="margin">Iob. 7.1.</note> our life is by Iob well called a warfare, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are to fight, &amp; wrastle against great matters: to the which Saint Paule alluding,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.7. Ephes. 6.12.</note> saith that he had <hi>fought a good fight,</hi> being exercised all his time, against powers and principalities, against anguishes and great grieuances, much within &amp; more without. The onely stay of all which perplexities, in the very best of Gods children, is earnest and heartie prayer, to him who sitteth aboue, who plucketh downe and setteth vp, who ouerturneth and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, who striketh and then maketh whole,<note place="margin">Dan. 2.21.</note> who correcteth and then comforteth, who bringeth to the pit of euill, and then doth not cast in, who tempteth not aboue our strength, but in the midst of temptation, doth giue an issue, that we may be able to beare it. The sacrificing of our souls vnto this blessed Father, the be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of our knees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the bedeawing of our cheeks, the lifting vp of our hands, the beating of our brest, but withall and aboue all, the compunction of our hearts, and the earnestnesse of our spirites, are the altar that we must flye to, are the anchor that wee must trust to. This is that chaine, whereof one end is tyed to the eare of God, and the other end to our toung: if

            <p n="4">4 Then it is for our good, that so often in the booke of God, prayer is both commended, and commanded to vs, and not any way for his profit, who is to be sought too, but for ours who are to cry.<note place="margin">Matth. 7.7. Cap. 26.41. Colos 4.2. Iacob. 5.16.</note>

When it went hard with that people fighting against the Amalekites, what did Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses but pray for them, when he held vp his hands; from which when by wearinesse he did cease, they sped ill, but while he continued it, they did conquer? What are the Psalmes of Dauid, but recourses in his passions, vnto the highest God? Did not Ieremy in the pit and bottome of the dungeon,<note place="margin">Lament. 3.55</note> fall to calling vpon the Lord? And our Prophet in worse case then euer was any of these, had nothing else to comfort him, but to addresse himselfe to his prayers. When all other helpes do faile, yet this is neare at hand: we neede not runne farre to seeke it. And blessed is the reward which oftentimes doth follow these requests, either the hauing of that which we desire, or a conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentednesse to leaue it.</p>

abundance, to the amazing of the Emperour, but the safety of all his army.<note place="margin">De vita con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantini 2.4.</note> That noble and mighty Constantine, knowing that one in heauen is the true Lord of hostes, and all victory commeth of him; that the ioyning of a battell, is the loosing of a kingdome, vnlesse he do assist, would neuer enter fight, but that first himselfe and his forces, with knees bended vpon the ground, would desire the Lord to blesse them.

Being in a battell which was hardly fought on both parts, but at length his men being put to the worse, and now apparantly ready to flye, he throweth himselfe on the ground, and with all the powers of his soule, he desireth the Lord to pity him, and to prosper him in that daunger.

for if we will compare matters that be in secret, with such things as are open, and iudge the one by the other, how cold are all our prayers? If we looke into our Churches, we shall find many of our Pastours, to go through their common prayers, with very small deuotion, little mooued and little moouing. The people, that is not onely young ones, who are of-ward inough from God, and whose feeling is not so passionate, as the Lord in time may make it; but the elder sort very slowly do repaire vnto the tabernacle: euery light occasion doth keepe them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: halfe-seruice doth serue the turne: and for that which is, it were as good to be neuer a whit, as not to be the better: they sit there as in a giddinesse, neither minding God nor the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, but rather obseruing any thing, then that for which they come thither. If it be thus in publicke, what may be thought of those prayers, which in secret are powred forth, betweene God and our selues, in our closets or our studies, when we rise vp or lye downe? It is to be feared that they are few, and those which be, are very sleepy, rather perfunctory and customary, then war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with zeale of affection. And how shall God know what we say, when we our selues do not know? how shall he heare that prayer, which we our selues do not heare? Let vs, brethren, stirre vp our selues, and be feruent in this, if in any thing, and the tutour for his scholers, the parents for his children, the maister for his family, the Magistrate for his people, the Minister for his flocke, pray euery day that the Lord will blesse them, in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man and their outward, in their businesses and their stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, in their piety and their safety.<note place="margin">Iob. 1.5.</note> Remember how holy Iob did sacrifice for his children, least in vanity of their youth, they should forget the Lord.</p>

In like sort, the safety of Gods Church, which in England and in Ireland, yea in many parts else of Christendome, as Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Fraunce, and Flaunders, much dependeth vnder God, on the good estate of her Maiesty, the hand maide of Christ Iesus: whose life we see to be aimed at, by the cursed brood of Sathan, vnnaturall home-bred English.

So Saint Herome in his first Tome, and fiue and twentith Epistle, sayth that Blesilla the dead daughter, did pray for her mother Paula. So Chrysostome on the Psalmes, doth mention the intercession of Mary the mother of God, and of the other Saints. To these may be ioyned, the testimonie of Sozomen in his seuenth booke, where Sathan is reported to haue railed on Iohn the Baptist, as if by his meditation his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose were sometimes hindered. I know that much more of this nature may be brought to vphold this doctrine, and yet God knoweth, how sandie is all this weake foundation? how rotten are these supporters, which bend vnder such a burthen? I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you to iudge indifferently, when you heare what shall be aunswered.</p>
            <p n="11">11 To speake first to that in Sozomen, which is drawne from Satans testimony, suppose the storie true, which is there but a bare report, And is not this a proofe right substantiall, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan railed on Iohn the Baptist, because that by his intercession, his purpose sometimes was crossed, Ergo Saints are our media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours?

What if this were his pollicie, to make men turne their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, from God vnto his creatures? I doubt not but so it was. He saw that the auncient Oracles were fallen downe long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as it appeareth by Plutarkes testimony,<note place="margin">Plutarch. de defectu Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culorum.</note> who wrote a tract to that purpose) with the which in former times, he had posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:623:108"/>
mens soules, for a great space together. He saw that Christs faith did spread, and that by the force of no tyrant it could possibly be extinguished: he saw that the ten persecutions were ceassed, by the raigning of Christian Emperours, and there was now no good to do that way: therefore now he will turne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a new leafe, and will take another course, to breede flawes in the faith, and by opinion of religion, to supplant Gods true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, by superstition to ouerturne good deuotion. Then begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth he for to broach some of Antichrists mingled wine (for the Apostle sayd,<note place="margin">1. Iohan. 2.18</note> that in his time Antichrist had set in footing) and nothing fell out more fitly to his humour, then to spoile God of his honour, by turning to Saints in prayer. Thus is the roaring Lion now become a subtle foxe, and seeketh by errour in the shew of truth, to vndermine holy piety. Such another deuise was that, when Satan being asked in the time of Iulian the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stata,<note place="margin">Theodoret. Hist. Eccles. 3.9.</note> why the Oracle which was sometimes in Daphne, neare to Antioche, had ceased, and gaue no aunswer, he signified that he might not appeare any more in that Chappell, because the Reliques, and the body of the holy martyr Babylas, were entred in that place. Wherein his meaning was, by a secret insinuation, to inueigle men to the honouring of the reliques and the bones of martyrs and holy men, to the which indeede they afterward fell, with doting superstition. So crafty is this Serpent, to destroy mens soules by fraud. And that example of Iohn the Baptist, I hold to be of this nature.</p>
            <p n="12">12 Concerning the authority of the fathers, which are ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to prooue this doctrine, I say first, that many bookes are foisted into their workes, which sauour not of their spirit. The censures that be vpon them, by Papists as well as other, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the difference of the style, and many other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, do make that plaine inough. In the most of them this hath bene brought about, either by the ignorance of such as did transcribe, and copy them out, before that printing was inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; or else by the falshood of base authors, who would assume noble names,<note place="margin">Passio Cypri. per Pontium diaconum ejus.</note> to things which were most vnworthy. In Cyprian there is nothing, which maketh mention of Charles the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, which if we will interprete, of the first Charles called
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:623:108"/>
the Great, yet there is so great a difference, of the times wherein these liued, that the one was after the other more then fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares. Yet that is sayd to be written, by Pontius who was deacon to Cyprian himselfe. I ascribe this to the grosse ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the writer, or counterfeit authour. In Austens workes there are many things, which are fathered on his name, and that by wilfull falshood. I will name to you one for all, and that shall be his Sermons,<note place="margin">Augustin. ad fratres in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remo.</note> as they are intituled, <hi>Ad fratres in ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo.</hi> There in the name of Saint Austen, one maketh the whole tract, willing to do great credit, to the order of Austen Friers, as if the great Saint Austen had bene the founder of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But as the eares of the asse did shew what beast he was, although he had gotten on him the skin of a noble Lion, so albeit that honest man do vse words for his purpose, <hi>I Augustin Bishop of Hippon</hi> did this, and this, and many things, yet the Barbarismes and the Sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cismes which are in that worke, do make it plaine, that some worthy wight did hatch that Treatise vp to the world. In his fiue &amp; twentieth Sermon,<note place="margin">Serm. 25.</note> he doth let vs know the reason, why some holy-daies haue no fasting dayes, as Philip and Iacobs day, and Saint Bartholomew and Saint Thomas. A fit argument for Saint Austen, especially as he handleth it. But because he will passe himselfe, and shew of what house he commeth, in his thirtie and seuenth Sermon,<note place="margin">Serm. 37.</note> he sayth that himselfe did go into the South part of Afrike, as farre as Aethiopia to preach the Gospell of Christ, and that he saw there men and women without heads, hauing their eyes standing in their breasts. This tale had had little credit,<note place="margin">Act. 8.27.</note> but that himselfe did see it. The Chamberlaine of Canda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who was met with by Philip, did come out of this Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia, &amp; shall we be so wise as to thinke that his shape was of such a strange kind of making?

               </note> we shall find that they set it downe, so waueringly and doubtfully, that a sober man would be fearefull, to build his faith vpon it. In the eight Tome of Saint Hierome, are foure Homilies on the Canticles, supposed to be Origens, and translated by Saint Hierome. In the third of them I find this, <hi>All the Saints which are departed out of this life, hauing yet a loue toward those which are in this vvorld: if they should be sayd to take care of their safety</hi> or saluation, <hi>and to helpe them with their prayers and intercession to God, it shall not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenient.</hi> How cold a speech is this, <hi>It shall not be inconuenient.</hi> That great clerke Gregory Nazianzene, doth make a kind of prayer, both to the Virgin Mary, and vnto Athanasius: yet see whether in some other places, it be not as a scruple vnsatisfied in his mind, whether that the Saints did know, and take care of the affaires of their friends remaining on earth: when speaking of Basile lately dead, he vseth these words, <hi>But novv is Basile in heauen, &amp; there as I do thinke offreth sacrifices for vs, &amp; powreth prayers out for the people.</hi> He did not know it, but thought it. But speaking of Gorgonia, his owne sister departed, he expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his doubt more plainly. <hi>And if thou do take care of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring of vs, and if this reward be giuen by God vnto holy soules, that they shall perceiue these things, then receiue my prayer.</hi> If besides other mens opinions, he had bene resolued in it, what needed this <hi>If,</hi> and this doubting? But Saint Austen whom I honour aboue all the old, for his iudgement, when he canuas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth this question, disputing it of purpose, and not slightly, or by the way, <hi>whether the soules departed hence, do know what is done here,</hi> how vncertaine is he in it, and rather propendeth to the Negatiue? <hi>Let euery man,</hi> saith he, <hi>take as himselfe will, that which I shall say,</hi> so seeming to crosse the streame, of that which was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> receiued. Then he inferreth three reasons; The first was, that if the dead did know our deedes, he certainely was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that his mother Monica, who loued him so well while
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:623:110"/>
she liued, would sometimes haue appeared to him, and taught him something for his good. For God forbid, saith he, that she being now in a life of more felicity, should be growne cruell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But he found that neither by dreame, nor vision, nor any apparition, she had euer bene present with him, and therfore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> he much suspected, that she had no knowledge of him. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he citeth the place out of the Prophet Esay,<note place="margin">Isay. 63.16.</note> that Abraham is ignorant of vs, and Israel doth not know vs. And therefore not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men.<note place="margin">2.

So far off is this holie father, when he thinketh of the thing aduisedly, from pronouncing of any certaintie, which vnfallibly and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly will maintaine this suspected doctrine.</p>
            <p n="14">14 Next, to suppose that many of the Auncient, directly and conclusiuely did iumpe in the consent hereof (which cannot be found, as I haue shewed) yet were this a sure rule of truth?

But yet this may be sayd farther, that from diuerse of the writings of the Auncient, it may be shewed, that this was by some of them held vnlawfull. Among the workes of Saint Ambrose, is found a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Commentary on Paules Epistle to the Romanes,<note place="margin">Ambros. in Epist. ad Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manos. 1.</note> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is setdowne for an obiection, the reason of the Romish Church, that none dare to approch the perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of an earthly Prince for any sute, but by the intercession of some courtier, or other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him: therfore it should be so of our part toward God, vnto whose mighty Maiesty, we must vse the mediatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of some which are in his fauor.

               </note> making for my present purpose. Lactantius sayth that <hi>those Angels whose honour is in God, will haue no honour giuen to them.</hi> Yea Austen himselfe denieth that to Angels, to Martyrs and to Saints, which might as well be done, as to seeke to them in prayer. <hi>We build no Churches to Angels.</hi> And elsewhere sayth he, <hi>Who euer heard the Priest to say at the altar, I offer to thee a sacrifice, Peter or Paule or Cyprian?</hi> And is it more to build a materiall Church to them, then to offer to their seruice our bodies, which are the spirituall temple of the holy Ghost? Or to offer corporall sacrifice, then to offer spirituall sacrifice of prayer and inuocation? I wil end this whole matter with a saying of Chrysostome. <hi>Let vs still flye vnto God, who is both willing and able to ease our miseries. If we were to intreate men, we must first meete with the doore keepers, and perswade parasites and players, and oftentimes go a great way. But in God there is no such thing. Without a mediator he is to be intreated: without mony, without cost he yeeldeth to our prayers.</hi> Since then that men are so doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but God himselfe is so peremptory, that nothing but the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, is to be sought vnto by sacred inuocation, let the Church of Rome in this be distinguished from the Church of God, and let vs learne here of Ionas, when misery ouerwhelmeth vs, to pray only vnto the Lord. And thus farre of the Preface.</p>

            <p n="15">15 The prayer it selfe is long, and offereth much doctrine to vs, but in these two former verses three things may be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First that affliction is the meanes, to beate men vnto piety, <hi>I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> cried in mine affliction.</hi> Secondly, that the misery of the Prophet was very great, <hi>from the belly of hell I cried,</hi> and <hi>all thy waues did <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> go ouer me.</hi> And thirdly that when he cried, the Lord did heare his voice, <hi>Thou heardest my voice.</hi> To touch them briefly as they lye. He that was contented before, quite to renounce his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster: he that was so farre forgetfull, as that when he should haue gone, for his Lord to preach at Niniue, would take a course vnto Tarshus, about businesse of his owne: he that before was so har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, that he could sleepe most soundly, when he had more neede to awake: he that could giue leaue to the mariners, to pray to a God whom they knew not, but he himselfe was not so holy;
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:623:111"/>
being now in the fishes belly, so lashed &amp; whipped with iustice, thinketh it not inough to pray, but he crieth out with great vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency: in earnest &amp; harty maner, not coldly or at all aduentures, as the hypocrites, who somtimes do slubber vp a few praiers; but with the soule and the mind, and with all the powers of his spirit. Oh the true force of the crosse, of calamity, and of misery, which maketh vs remember that, whereof else we should neuer thinke. God saith by his prophet Osee,<note place="margin">Ose. 5 15. Isay. 17.7.</note> that his people <hi>in their affliction would seeke him diligently.</hi> So when by his seruant Esay, he had threatned the crosse before, <hi>At that day</hi> sayth he, <hi>shall a man looke to his maker, and his eyes shall looke to the holy one of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> So in the time of the Iudges:<note place="margin">Iudic. 6.6.</note> 
               <hi>Thus was Israel exceedingly impouerished by the Madianites, therefore the children of Israel cry vnto the Lord.</hi> The Scripture is very copious in examples of this kind, but yet hath none fitter then this of our Prophet. For he who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fauour could not mooue, to stand when he was vpright, the rod did force him to labour, to get vp againe when he was fallen. The prison could make him humble, whom liberty had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged. The darknesse in the whales belly, doth more bring him vnto light, euen the true and heauenly light, then the sight of Sunne or firmament. Thus restaint doth make him holy, to the great benefit of his soule, cleane contrary to that Prouerbe, <hi>Non vsquam belli carceres,</hi> Prisons are good in no place.</p>
            <p n="16">16 That, aduersity and the crosse, should be a dore to deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is without question a Paradoxe to repining flesh &amp; bloud, which doth euer loue to be in iolity; but yet vnto a Christian ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is a principle of a sound truth. For when we do luxuriate, and grow riotous in the gallantnesse of this world, and haue all things at our pleasure, we forget that God who made vs, who doth cause his Sun to shine on vs, and with the vntamed heyfer which is full fed, &amp; growne perfectly wanton, we kicke against the sole author of our happinesse &amp; beatitude; with the Magnificoes of the world, and great-mouthed Gloriosoes we do both co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne our brethren, and speake against the Highest. But affliction doth humble vs,<note place="margin">2. Chron. 33.12.</note> &amp; make vs know our selues, as it did Manasses the king of Iuda, who being in chaines, did thriue more for his soule, then he did in his royall pallaces. It maketh to vs say with Dauid,

               <hi>It is good for a man that he beare the yoke in his youth.</hi> When the soueraigne dispenser of all things, by his wisdom doth consider, that this is our case, by his sober and sage prouidence he somtimes sendeth prosperity, lest we should be discouraged, &amp; broken by calamity, but he often sendeth aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity to exercise vs here, lest we should be puffed vp by the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of his mercy. And while his hand is vpon vs, we which else are stiffe and stubburne,<note place="margin">Liuius lib. 1.</note> will in pliable maner bend. When Numa had broched in Rome, a set order of seruice vnto their heathen Gods, and had possessed the people with it, his successor Tullus Hostilius not only did neglect it, but contemned it, as accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that no one thing did lesse beseeme a king, then to yeeld himselfe to ceremonies, and sacrifices of religion. But when he dad proceeded long, and gone forward in this veine, a great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence grew in Rome, and himselfe lay afterward long langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of a sicknesse. This did so abate the spirits, &amp; plucke downe the hart of the king, that he who before despised al, did now yeeld himselfe, to all both great and small superstitions, and filled the peoples heads with a multitude of religions. Looke what effect these things had with him in his heathenish errours, the same in Christian obedience, doth tribulation bring to many of Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; this only thing excepted, that these flye superstition. Those who in their yonger dayes, and in the strength of their time, haue scorned the word and the ministery, and haue made no kind of conscience of theft or fornication, but haue sucked them in as water, being afterward pinched with pouerty, or banishment, or imprisonment, or especially with sicknesse (which giueth a man right good leysure, if it be long and sharpe on him, to bethinke himselfe of his follies) with contrition of the hart, and compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in great measure do flye vnto the Lord, and with many teares wash away the blacknesse of their iniquity.</p>
            <p n="17">17 Then they desire to be with God, and to leaue this vale of misery, which lately they embraced as their greatest treasure, and preferred it before their owne saluation; and the delight whereof they would yet haue followed after, but that misery and calamity did enforce them otherwise. Wherein we may well

obserue, that nothing so much as affliction doth make vs loue our end, by loathing the bitter potions which we daily do tast of. When Elias was chased by Iezabel, and was comfortlesse in the wildernesse,<note place="margin">1. Reg. 19.4.</note> he crieth: <hi>Now it is enough, Lord take away my soule, for I am no better then my fathers.</hi> But if this gall and wormewood were turned into sugred hony, we should not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten from this place; but yet we be not readie; stay a little, and a little.<note place="margin">Plutarch. in Pelopida.</note> Plutarke in his Pelopidas, telleth that Antigonus had a souldier, who being vexed with an ill disease, and so loathing to liue, was alwaies formost in his seruices, were it skirmish or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fight, and was so resolute, as no man in the army. The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall much liking this, cast such an affection to the valure of the man, that to his great expence, he caused him to be cured, who held himselfe lately incurable. But then looking that his souldier should be forward as before, he found him to do far otherwise, and now neuer offer to come in daunger. Asking the reason of this, his souldier maketh him answere, that now he had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to loose, that was a healthfull and sound bodie, with which he should grieue to part; but before when he was in miserie, he had thought his case should haue bene very happie, if he might haue bene dead and buried. The wisedome of the Almightie did foresee that in vs, which Antigonus found but afterward, that we who in anguish and persecution, do desire the company of the elect,<note place="margin">Philip. 1.23.</note> who are triumphant in heauen, and with Saint Paule do long to be dissolued, would lye groueling in prosperitie, as tyed and glued to the ground; and therefore in his loue he doth whip vs oftentimes, that we may seeke vnto him, that we may sue to be with him.</p>
            <p n="18">18 This is one great occasion, wherfore the Lord doth send his chastiseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vpon vs; &amp; yet in the meane while also he doth aime at this, that we tasting of that bitternesse, which other things yeeld vnto vs, may euermore fly to him by prayer &amp; meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; may be reposed on him, when other things do annoy vs, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things do affright vs.<note place="margin">Chlrysost in Psa. 114.</note> It is a good comparison, which Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sost. hath in this case, <hi>that mothers do vse with vizards &amp; bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beares, to fright their vnruly children, to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fly to their lap, not willing to hurt the infants, but to make them sit close by them.
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:623:113"/>
So God desiring to ioyne vs fast to himself, being a true louer of vs, doth permit that oftentimes we are brought to such necessitie, that perpetually we may intend to prayer and calling vpon him, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing all other things, be onely carefull of him.</hi> Such an attractiue violence, and violent attraction is in the crosse, to draw vs as wel as Ionas vnto the Lord. Happy men if we could see it, and make that benefite of it, which if we will not learne at first, he will come againe vnto vs, and double his rods vpon vs, if we belong to his election. In the meane time we must learne, with patience to suffer whatsoeuer commeth from the Lord: since besides all other vses, it bringeth that good vnto vs, as to driue vs to our duties, and obedience to our God. Our land hath long felt the sweetnesse of the Lords distilling grace, prosperitie, peace, and plentie, which maketh men forget the authour of their felicitie. They with the Oxe, haue tasted the fodder that lieth before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but they haue not thought of the giuer. Oh the blockishnesse of our nature, who returne to God little loue, for his great loue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs. Our neighbours of Fraunce and Flaunders, haue drunke of another cuppe, and haue taken another course. Some yeares now past, religion and true faith hath bene oppugned in France. Edicts haue bene made, that the Protestants or Huguenots, as they call them, should get them out of that countrie, within such a time or such a space, vnder perill of their liues. Thousands of them haue fled, and left their natiue countrie, but not the care of their countrie; for although they were elsewhere, wishing still good to Sion, they haue harkened after the aduentures of that Church and commonwealth, and haue found both to be in hazard. Many inuasions and great slaughters, and ciuill warres in that land, wherein those that haue bene the pillars of religion in that countrey, haue bene oftentimes shrewdly shaken. This hath caused them, as London doth well know, to assemble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues together in their Churches, with solemne fasts and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which of likelyhood they had not done, but that they saw themselues to be fallen into most perillous times. These assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies and these fasts, being many more then we haue had, did argue that more affliction was on them then on vs, which made them so to cry. I would that we might learne by their example
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:623:113"/>
to be wise, before that we be stricken. But if peace do lull vs asleepe, the rod it is which can awake vs. That we find by our Prophets case, in whome the next thing which I obserued is the greatnesse of his calamitie.</p>

But partly because I loue not to extrauagate from my text, (although occasion be here well offered by the nature of the word bearing so plaine a difference) but especially in a desire of vnitie in our Church, least some by contradiction should gainesay, whatsoeuer is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in this argument, (so apt are we to be iarring, which I wish were otherwise) I passe ouer that point in silence; onely obseruing vnto the weake, that we all do hold the Article of Christs descense into hell, but the disagreement is in the manner of his descending, and how that should be expounded. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets words here import, that he was in the fishes belly, as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might be in his graue, without light, without sight, in darknesse and discomfort, neuer hoping more to liue, then a man who was dead and buried. Or else that he felt in himselfe such anguish of his conscience, because Gods wrath did follow him, and because he knew that himselfe had deserued euerlasting torment, that now he was so tortured, (with an Hyperbole speaking of it) as if he had bin in hell. The Chaldee Paraphrase here hath a word, signifying <hi>a bottomelesse pit,</hi> which intendeth to vs, that the sea
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:623:114"/>
was very deepe, wherein he was, as if he had bene drowned. And this may be an argument, that the sea was very deep there, that the whale which deuoured him was there, whose greatnesse was such and so huge, that it would require much water. The whale swimmeth not in the shallowes, neither can remaine in the foords.</p>
            <p n="20">20 The greatnesse of this danger, so amplified by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in many parts of his song, first could not chuse but much dismay him, and fright him home for the present; for what could he thinke of himselfe? that drowned he was, and not drowned; eaten vp and not deuoured; and yet for euery moment, in case to come to his end, besides the pangs of his soulefearing eternall death. Secondly, when afterward he had by the mercie of God escaped from destruction, it might be a great remembrance and testimonie to him, of the fauour of the Lord. For the greater was his daunger, the greater was his deliuerance. Neither doth that man euer know, what it is to be freed from miserie, who was neuer like to feele it. To be brought to the pits brinke, and then and there to be stayed; nay to be in the midst of death, and there to be kept from dying, must needes vrge in the patient, a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of thankfulnesse. That consideration of Ammianus Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellinus in his storie,<note place="margin">Ammianus Marcellinus lib. 15. <hi>Illa qualitas vitae non tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum habet sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum.</hi>
               </note> is very good, that <hi>although it be a matter exceedingly to be wished for, that fortune would continue in flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing state vnto vs, yet that quality of life hath not that feeling with it, as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a desperate &amp; very hard estate, we are recalled to a better fortune.</hi> We better know what health is, when sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse hath much broken vs. We know what it is, to haue store of clothing and competent foode, if hunger and thirst and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, do for a time assaile vs. It is a prety reason (although the practise thereof were bad) which Herodotus saith,<note place="margin">Herodotus lib. 3.</note> that the Samian tyrant Polycrates did vse to make. He very much exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised piracie and robberie, as well by land as sea, and his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome was to spoile his friends as much as his enemies; whereof he assigned that cause, that when he shold vnderstand afterward, that his friend was robbed of any thing, he might gratifie that friend more, in restoring what he had lost, then if he had taken nothing from him.

Where also obserue his speech, that he referreth all his punishment to the hand of the Lord. He speaketh not of the mariners, by whose meanes it was done, much lesse doth he reuile them, as in our time wicked offending persons oft do to the magistrates, or Iudges, or other officers, who do but see that to be done, which iust law layeth vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and they wilfully haue deserued. But Ionas passing by the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and meanes whereby God wrought, seeketh vnto the fountaine and originall of the deede. He acknowledgeth that his maker was he who was offended; that his hand had corrected him; that his wrath must be satisfied; but by all other he passeth. That euill Ioram did not so,<note place="margin">2.

But then he, in stead of looking vpward to God, whom he should haue sought vnto by fasting and by prayer, turneth his anger on the Prophet, the minister of the Almightie, and vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himselfe to much euill, if innocent Elizaeus were not put to death that day. Blind man who could not looke higher, and see whose messenger the Prophet was. How much better was Iobs behauiour? for when newes was brought vnto him, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees and Chaldeans, by violence and strong hand, had taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Oxen, and robbed him of his Camels, he did not straight way curse those sinners, and wish much euill on them, but not so much as naming them, did fasten his thoughts on God, and imputed all vnto him,<note place="margin">Iob. 1.21.</note> saying most patiently, <hi>The Lord hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and the Lord hath taken it; blessed be the name of the Lord.</hi>

I would that men in our time, could carry his resolution. When ought amisse doth befall them, to haue recourse to the Highest, and to suppose that either he doth trie them, or doth punish the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for their sinnes, or hath some other good purpose. But we ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther run to any thing, then that which most doth vrge vs; oft surmising that which is not, and suspecting those that be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents. And if we can find the meanes, whereby all is brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, we double our force on that; this witch hath killed my beasts; this wicked man hath vndone me; this mightie man hath crossed me: I would he were in his graue, or some mischiefe else were on him. Indeed I do not deny, but that the euill are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes the rods of God, to chasten good men withall, but yet thinke thou euermore, that his hand is it which effecteth all, &amp; that his stroke is in the action, Fasten thy eyes on him, and with sighing and true repentance, seeke to appease his wrath; and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the meanes shall not touch thee, no wicked thing shall haue po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ouer thee.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 22 The third circumstance now remaining, is that God did heare his prayer. <hi>I cryed in mine affliction, and thou heardest me,</hi> and againe, <hi>O Lord thou heardst my voice.</hi> You see that his woe was exceeding, and after the common course of sorrow it droue him vnto his maker; it enforced him to pray.

               <p>GOOD Reader, the words of the text in the former Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, ministred me occasion to shew, who it is to whom our prayers are to be directed, that is God alone; and consequently, that we should not vse any inuocation of Saints. But in the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling of that question so largely, out of the Fathers of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church, my purpose was not onely to settle the ignorant for their beliefe concerning that point, but withall by example there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to let the simpler sort see, what is to be conceiued in other que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions disputed betweene vs and the Church of Rome. For the same may be said concerning the Primacie of Peter, the merite of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:623:116"/>
works, free will, prayer for the dead, Purgatorie, &amp; the most part of those controuersies which now a daies are handled. They take on them to maintaine many of their positions if not directly out of the Scriptures, yet from probable shewes out of some of the old Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who were great lights after the time of the Apostles. But first, many bookes pretended to belong to that reuerend age, are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> counterfeits, and start vp since the liues of those graue and godly writers; and from these are many of the allegations taken. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the very auncient Fathers receiued some things as true with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out discussing, whereinto when themselues vpon speciall occasions did iudiciously looke, they were either of a contrarie opinion to their former, or spake faintly and doubtfully. Thirdly, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> which some of them taught was contradicted by other, and so one part must needs erre. Fourthly, they were not so led by the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Spirit of God, as those Secretaries of the holy Ghost, who deliuered the canonicall Scriptures to the world: &amp; therfore they are no farther to be allowed, then where they consent with the most sacred written word; and that is their owne iudgement of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. Lastly, there are many places cited by Bellarmine, Staple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and other the aduersaries of the Gospell, which when they are diligently looked into, and weighed by all circumstances, do not purport that for the which they are produced. Of all which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruations it is easie to giue diuerse examples. This I thought good to note, lest weake brethren or credulous preiudicate persons shold be too much abused, with the misapplied name of the old and most renoumed Church.</p>
               <p>And whereas I haue shewed my opinion concerning the suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed strange shapes of men in many quarters of the world, if anie should vrge any authour of former or later age against that my assertion, in one word I account them all in that point to be fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and onely to haue receiued such rumours and vniustifiable traditions from hand to hand: although some of them, thinking thereby to procure to themselues the fame of men farre tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled, do aduouch that they haue seene such. In our dayes God hath giuen light, &amp; therfore let vs not still delight to be in blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Onely this one scruple is to be remooued away, that whereas co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stant report hath auerred this to be so, in some one part of <hi>Peru,</hi>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:623:117"/>
is the South portion of the West and lately found Indies; &amp; some men of good iudgement, whose aduentures for nauigation that way, haue nobilitated the discoueries performed or attempted by our English nation, haue with firme credence entertained that for a very truth; yet as I esteeme, they may easily satisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in that behalfe, by the full and sufficient report of <hi>Pedro de Cieca</hi> in his first part of the Chronicles of <hi>Peru,</hi> chapter <hi>26.</hi> who being a Spaniard borne, and now more then fiftie yeares agone hauing spent seuenteene yeares in his personall peregrination ouer that countrey, sheweth that not farre from the Line, yea in more places of <hi>Peru</hi> then one, there are people who being borne in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall shape as other men, yet do take their infants when they are but a few dayes old, and by certaine deuises which they haue, as with frames of wood and binding or swathing do make the head of such fashion as they would, as some to be very long, and some to be so crushed together that they haue no neckes, but their heads seeme to be immediate parts of the trunke of their bodies. And this contenteth me for the veritie of that matter, and I doubt not but so it will to all other, who desire in their minds to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of things as indeed they be, and not as sometimes they seeme.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Any are the instructions which this Prophecie hath yeelded in the hearing of most of you: aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements and warnings against sinne; disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against Atheisme; obseruations against Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisme; in the person of the mariners, comparisons of Gentiles with vs that be Christians; and doctrines of diuerse sorts, as Gods spirit from time to time hath assisted me. But for informing of the conscience of a languishing sinner, who gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vnder the burthen of heauinesse and casting downe; and is almost swallowed vp in the gulfe of desperation, by reason of the feare of Gods displeasure for sin that hangeth vpon him, (which things oftentimes befall some of the little ones of Christ Iesus) no one matter in this Prophecie is more apparantly fruitfull, or more worthie consideration, then that which I haue now read. For what can be more wholesome then Phisicke to the sicke, or remedie to him that is readie to perish? And who is more like
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:623:118"/>
to perish, then he who feeleth no rest either inwardly or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, in bodie or in mind, but as it were gasping for breath, doth daily long for comfort in the middest of great distresses; his case being this, that sinne egerly insulteth, Satan fiercely impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and his conscience beareth witnesse against his owne soule, that in right iustice should destroy it. To the reliefe of which tender ones, as I could wish that our speech were oftner directed, (for it is a needfull argument to be handled, and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed is that speech which bindeth vp the broken, and giueth life to the dying) so the example of my Ionas doth fitly remember me to speake to this purpose, because he is as a glasse for all such to looke in, and thereby to see themselues, and in his case to helpe themselues, with the good assistance of that Spirit who herein is all in all.</p>
            <p n="2">2 For in this man may be seene, a most vehement and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible conflict betweene faith and feare; betweene hope and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire, betweene sinne and grace: on this hand the flesh sinking with distrustfulnesse into the bottome of hell, being like to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it selfe a forlorne creature, a cast-away from God, a reprobate from the promises,<note place="margin">Genes. 4.13. Matth. 27.4.</note> as if it were some Cain or some Iudas: but on the other hand, the spirit foorthwith mounting into the bosome of the Sauiour, and there apprehending mercie by remission of all iniquities, and forgiuenesse of all transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. In the meane while, amidst the one raising vp, and the other hanging downe, is a combat of such bitternesse, as maketh the endurer of it, in the heate of the fishes stomacke oft times to quake for cold, and in the cold of the sea, oft times to sweate for heate. Manie feuers and agues cannot shake him, as his owne heart doth now shake him: his boiling is like the fire: his torture is like the hell. How many crownes and kingdomes? what thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of gold and siluer? what heapes of precious stones? how many lands and seas, and whole worlds would he giue, if they were now in his power, to be freed from such a torment, as forced him with extremitie to say as here he said, <hi>I am cast away from thy sight,</hi> I am but a damned reprobate. A very fearefull thought, &amp; yet recouered again by confidence in Gods mercie, which faileth not his at need; so that thereby he is encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:623:118"/>
to hope that he shall see Hierusalem, the sanctuarie of the Lord, and his temple once againe. Which recouerie of his shold make vs much admire Gods mercie; and yet withal teach vs, to worke out our saluation in great feare and great trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling. But because this text doth note vnto vs some doctrine besides this, and the illustration of that doth make a way for my purpose, I will first touch the other, obseruing in the generall words, these three things to be handled. First the deiection of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> our Prophet, <hi>I am cast out of thine eyes.</hi> Secondly his arising vp <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> from that motion, and new assurednesse of Gods fauour. <hi>Yet I will looke againe toward thy holy temple.</hi> And thirdly by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of the one of these with the other, the great conflict in his conscience.</p>
            <q>
               <l>I am cast away out of thy sight.</l>
            </q>
            <p n="3">3 The Antithesis put betweene the casting away from the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> sight of his God, and the beholding of his temple, is not to be taken coldly, as if it intended barely, that now he did not see the temple indeede, but he should see it againe: that now he had lost his countrey, but after his deliuerance the time should come, that he should returne thither, as if he had made this accompt and no more, that for a while he was depriued of some temporall fauours, or terrestriall benedictions, but should be restored: for this had bene little, and in comparison as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. But it signifieth a suspition, and mistrust of the losse of all Gods loue, a putting out of his protection, a reiecting or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting off to wrath and eternall damnation. For the eyes of God, being taken in good part in the Scripture, do still import his fauour, and in his fauour is life, and happinesse, and felicitie spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and celestiall.<note place="margin">Deut. 11.10.12.</note> Moses saith of the land of Canaan, that <hi>it was not as the land of Egypt from vvhence they came,</hi> that is a place hatefull to him, inhabited with idolaters, <hi>but the eyes of the Lord God are alwaies vpon this,</hi> that is to say, his gracious loue, <hi>from the beginning of the yeare, euen vnto the end of the yeare.</hi>

            <p n="4">4 The heauinesse of the hand of God, which had followed after him with that rigour: the multiplicitie of his punishment, by a tempest while he was in the ship, by drowning in the sea, and by imprisonment in the whale, the horrour of his transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and disobedience toward his God, the remembraunce of that grace before, from which he was now fallen, of a Prophet to become a runnagate, do so amate his heart, that when he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of himselfe, he resolueth as a despairing abiect, that he hath no fellowship in the inheritance of Gods Saints, but that as an outlaw, he was quite to be secluded from the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. So that now either he supposeth, that he belongeth not to Gods election, and that he had neuer bene booked, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister of those Saints, which were appointed vnto life, or that the Lord as a man doth varie and repent, and had altered his purpose concerning him. The first was against himselfe, to thinke himselfe to be a reprobate, appointed and predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before hand vnto euill. And how wofull a thought was that, to perswade his soule, that nothing belonged vnto him but damnation? The second was against the Highest, that his counsels should depend vpon our mutabilitie, as if his eternall purpose and decree, which is from euerlasting, were tyed to our well doing, and did not much rather dispose vs, and inable vs to do well, Whomsoeuer he ordaineth to the kingdome, he doth teach the way to that kingdome. Christ Iesus who is the life,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14.6.</note> is also the way: he that giueth the one, graunteth the other.

the instant, when he was in the pits mouth, ready to sinke eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally. This sheweth that in former time he had bene vsed to temptation: being practised in Gods seruice, he knew well what belonged to faith, when he did so soone apprehend it. He was not ignorant that he had offended, and offended a fearefull God; yet such a one as would haue compassion vpon a repenting sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.

This is the fruite of beleeuing the sweete mercy of our Sauiour, that in the day of sorest triall, it is able to keepe vs vpright, who else should fall downe groueling. As a ship without his ballace, is tilted &amp; tossed at sea, and cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the waue, so is that soule right vnstable, and euery houre apt to perish, which hath not faith in temptation. It is written of the Cranes, that when they do intend in stormy and troublesome times,<note place="margin">Solinus cap. 15.</note> to flye ouer the seas, fearing lest by the blasts of the wind, their bodies which be but light, should be beaten into the sea, or kept from the place whither they be desirous to go, they swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low some sand, and little stones into their bellies, whereby they are so moderately peized, that they are able to resist the wind. While we do crosse this troublesome world of sinne and great temptation, it is faith which must be our ballace, it is faith which must preserue vs equably vpright, or recouer vs when we are going.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 13 And what can be straunger to a man at first sight, then that he, who late before was the Prophet of the Highest, and therefore much in his grace, acquainted with his counsels, and purpose concerning Israel, where he had long preached, one neere about his God, should now with such a horrour, as a des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing person, be vp, and then downe; be at the first so distrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, although afterward resolued. But the remembrance of that fauour which he before enioyed, doth deiect him the more; that
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:623:124"/>
after so large measure of Gods bountifulnesse toward him, he shold be vnthankfull. For now his conscience cryeth out against him, that he was most vnworthie to haue any part in the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, who had turned from him so wilfully. Now he breatheth out displeasure and indignation against himselfe. So fearefull a thing is sinne: it doth so wound the soule. Hence great fights do oftentimes arise vnto the faithfull, where the flesh armed with desperation, layeth on loade euen to destruction; but faith hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth out a buckler, wherewith she wardeth the blowes. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding betweene the one and the other, there is a combat hardly fought out, much ebbing and much flowing, much ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and much falling, that the waues are not so various, as the thoughts of this sufferer are; disputing pro and con, acquiting and condemning. Whereunto at the last a victorie commeth, but it is with great difficultie in the meane while, the inward man and the outward, the spirit and the flesh most vehemently wrastling. Now as Saint Iames hath told vs:<note place="margin">Iacob 1.12.</note> 
               <hi>Blessed is the man that endureth temptation</hi>: he that striueth, and standeth, and in the end co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quereth, shall not loose his reward. But in the meane time it maketh the weake one, the tender and sickly conscience to droope and be discouraged, so that being heated violently, he thirsteth after comfort. In which case, since God himselfe is so farre from despising the broken and contrite heart,<note place="margin">Psal. 51.17</note> that in very truth, he doth loue it; and Christ for his part came for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, not to breake the brused reed,<note place="margin">Matth. 12.20</note> nor to quench the smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king flaxe, we are in exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both (the father &amp; the word) to bind vp the broken, &amp; to seeke out that which is perishing.</p>

And as it was with these, so it is in our dayes. The Ministers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell who are employed in their calling, and know any thing in the world, haue manifold experience of such cases of conscience, although they speake it not to euery man.</p>
            <p n="15">15 Some for one thing, and some for another are troubled euery day: for fancies and temptations do arise a thousand waies: especially in those who are weake in mind or body, by reading or by hearing, by being too much alone, by children and by friends, by prosperitie or aduersitie, by a word spoken at aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by any thing which the mind of the troubled partie doth apprehend. Where faith is not extinguished, or plucked vp by the root, but weakned for a time, as the Sunne vnder a cloud, is shadowed for a moment, or as fire vnder the ashes, is raked vp and not seene. And when it hath bene amated and discouraged for a time, then it breaketh foorth againe, and peraduenture it is then a second while dismayed,<note place="margin">Psal. 107.26.</note> as the ship vpon the sea, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is caried vp to the heauen, and then downe againe to the deepe: or as the winter water which freezeth in the night, and melteth in the day, and hath his intermissions, and therein many alterations. In this appeareth Gods prouidence, and his endlesse loue in protecting, that he so ballanceth discomfort, with an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall weight of comfort, that euill and distrust doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, but if the scale do tippe downe, it raiseth vp againe vpon the sudden. If the challenger be on the left hand readie to defie vs, the defendant is on the right hand as readie to maintaine vs. If the inuader be behind vs, the protectour is before vs: yea if a strong armed man haue set-footing in our house,<note place="margin">Luc. 11.21.</note> a stronger then himselfe commeth, and driueth him from the possession.

So we are made the fitter to receiue the crowne in heauen, which is for the lowly minded, &amp; is neuer giuen to any, but to those who do get a victorie. And how can there be a conquest, vnlesse there be a fight? how a fight without an enemie? Then this life is our stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing; the other is the reward which we receiue for our striuing. <hi>Here we wrastle</hi> saith Saint Ambrose, <hi>but we are crowned else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: here is the striuing,</hi>

temptation, he let his owne sonne take flesh vpon him, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a man clothed with mortalitie, that therein by humane practise, and not onely by diuine contemplation, he might be tempted and feele assaults, and so, as the authour of the Epistle to the Hebrewes speaketh,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.18.</note> 
               <hi>he might</hi> the better <hi>be able to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour those that are tempted.</hi> Now what needest thou at all to shake or quiuer, when his shield and his safegard do perpetually attend thee? The experience of things past, should encourage thee for hereafter. Remember how he hath kept thee, and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished thee in his bosome in former times, when thou wast in daunger. That did abode good vnto thee. He who loued thee then,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 17 34</note> will loue thee still. When Dauid had to do against Goliah, no impression wrought so forcibly with him, as recounting what he had done before. When I was a boy and kept my fathers sheepe, a Beare came and tooke a sheepe out of my flocke, and I killed that Beare: then a Lyon came and did as much, and I killed that Lyon also. Surely that Lord, which saued his seruant from the paw of the Lyon, and of the Beare, will deliuer me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so from this Philistine. Bethinke thy selfe in the like. Thy God hath euer fauoured thee euen from thy mothers wombe: when thou wast not, then he made thee, when thou wast lost he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed thee, when thou wentest astray, he reclaimed thee: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou wast naked, he clothed thee, when thou wast hungrie he fed thee: he hath nourished thee and maintained thee: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou wast ignorant he did teach thee, and hath giuen thee some good measure of knowledge, and will to serue him: he hath admitted thee by baptisme, into the fellowship of his Saints, he hath sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his affection toward thee, by the Sacrament of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and his bloud; in great griefes he hath stood by thee; in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes he hath blessed thee; the pit hath bene open for thee, but yet thou neuer didst fall in; Satan hath gaped and roared, but yet his fangs haue not touched thee; in conflicts thou hast bene safe, thou hast bene preserued in combats. How fully should these sound experiments confirme thee in thy faith? how should this liuely feeling, for the delightfulnes of the ioy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as it were melt thee in kindnes toward thy God? Why shol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thou not say with Dauid,<note place="margin">Psal. 116.12. Psal 18.1.</note> 
               <hi>what shall I render vnto the Lord,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:623:127"/>
for all his benefits toward me?</hi> Or <hi>I will loue thee dearely ô Lord my strength.</hi> I will honour thee, I will embrace thee, (I want words to expresse it) I will ioy in thee, I will deuote my selfe wholly vnto thy seruice. With thy fauour and louing counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance with thy hand and thy hart, thou hast helped me, kept me, saued me; thou hast strengthened me, raised me, blessed me, and I know that thou wilt neuer leaue me. For thou art the same God for euer, and continuest thy goodnesse daily ouer me.</p>
            <p n="18">18 He who hath learned these lessons, maketh true vse of the battels betweene hope and despaire, betweene the flesh and the spirit: and the farther he goeth forward, the more alwaies he doth conquer. He recounteth thus with his owne heart: God might haue suffered me to haue frozen in my dregs, to runne on to all filthines &amp; vncleannesse with the worldlings, to haue died before that I had vnderstood what belonged vnto his seruice, and so to haue dropped downe to hell, before that I knew what I did; but he hath dealt better by me, he hath afforded me more grace. Now he bringeth this fire of temptation, to warme me, and resolue me, but it is to good, and not to euill. I doubt not but I am his, I shall not perish finally. He slubbereth me to scoure me, he rubbeth me to make me brighter; he whetteth me to make me sharper. If I were not pressed and vrged, I should not know what he doth for me: but to releeue me when I neede, to helpe me when I am readie to drowne, to saue me when I am sinking, to quicken me when I am at deaths doore, is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of such fauour as he can better giue, then I can well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue. And since I haue these testimonies of his assured fauour, let the world allure and slily entice, let the flesh insult while it will, let Satan tempt and not spare, let doubts and thoughts &amp; distrusts, be eger and eger againe; in life and death, either day or night; I know who it is that bought me, and payed for me with his bloud, and I know that he will not leaue me. As Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten saith,<note place="margin">August. in 17. Sermon. 8. Tom. 10.</note> 
               <hi>A mightie man will not lose that which he hath bought for his monie, and will Christ loose that which he hath bought vvith his bloud</hi>? I doubt not but my Ionas in his troubled me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, did grow to these resolutions, and by thinking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, did shake off that his heauie passion, that he should be cast
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:623:127"/>
away from Gods sight. It was a liuely feeling of former mercies which made him to breake forth into so religious an insinuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as if he did bleed with tendernesse and softnesse,<note place="margin">Ionah. 2.6.</note> calling vpon God, <hi>ô Lord my God.</hi> Wherin he shewed so sound an hope, that although he should kill him (as Iob saith of himselfe) yet he would not leaue him,<note place="margin">Iob. 13.15.</note> but wold euermore trust in him: although his sin did more then abound,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.20.</note> yet Gods grace did superabound.</p>
            <p n="19">19 These words well vnderstood, and applied vnto the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, may serue for euery soule which languisheth with griefe taken for euill motions. But because euery tender spirit, is not growne so farre in Gods schoole, and where so hard a siege is laid by Satan, there cannot be too many helpes, therefore some other remedies may be added vnto this before named: for the describing whereof, I could wish more leisure to meditate vpon them, and more time to vtter them, but it shall now suffice to poynt at them. Then first, when any Christian shall feele him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> hardly laid at, let him haue recourse to Gods word, and the comfortable writings of other wise and learned men. There is better balme in the Scriptures, then euer was in Gilead; there is a refreshing riuer; the very well of life, which will giue strength to the fainting. And therein no booke more profitable then be the Psalmes of Dauid. Secondly, let him resort vnto the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> temple, where the word of God is taught. Ionas did thinke of this, before all other matters. Here, that is, in the house of God, Dauid did find wholesome instruction,<note place="margin">Psal. 73.1.17</note> when he was so affretted with the prosperitie of the wicked, that he had almost renounced the seruice of the Lord. How was he troubled with that conceit and could not be resolued, vntill he went into the Sanctuarie? God directeth the mouth of the preacher, that when himselfe scant thinketh of that particular fruite, he speaketh to the heart of some one man in this point, of some other in another. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let him pray to God, both in publike and in priuate. The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Lord loueth to be sought to by vs, and it pleaseth him to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vpon: and in the midst of our prayer, if it be with vehement intention of our spirits, he will distill downe a deaw, of the sweet influence of his grace, that we shall arise vp more setled. Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and earnest prayer, what cloudes doth it not pierce, what
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:623:128"/>
heauens doth it not enter? Fourthly let him not feare, to impart his griefe to his friend, but especially to the minister, who is lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and feareth God. They are made for such purposes, and such things are not straunge vnto them. Man is ordained for man, to helpe him and to comfort him, and more eyes do see better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fewer, and what a ioy to the mind, is a word spoken in season? But the faithfull minister, of all other things doth hold this for his charge, to hearken to such complaining, to raise vp such me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lamenting.<note place="margin">Iacob. 5.20.</note> He that conuerteth a sinner, doth saue a soule from death, and couereth a multitude of sinnes. If that precept of Iude do belong vnto any man,<note place="margin">Iud. 22.23.</note> it is vnto him, <hi>haue compassion of some in putting difference, and other saue with feare pulling them out of the fire.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 12.20</note> This is to imitate Christ, who <hi>will not breake a brused reede, nor quench the smoking flaxe.</hi> This is to seeke out the lost, and to bind vp that which is broken. Vnto these this may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that it shall not a little helpe to haue conference with such, who in former times haue bene exercised with the like tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that out of their experience being plentifully powred out; the distressed mind may be relieued. None can speake more suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, and vnto better purpose, then he that hath felt the same fire, wherein this grieued soule is now burned. And they who are in this cafe, are not a little reuiued, to know that any other hath bene troubled like themselues, which they will hardly beleeue, thinking that none did euer beare such a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> as is vpon their shoulders. Lastly, as they ought rather to remember their former deliuerances, then the griefe which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently is vpon them: so they are rather to beleeue the speeches of other men, I meane Gods children, who come to yeeld com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then their own troubled thoughts, which being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and disquieted with frightfull imaginations, can giue no setled iudgement. This matter were worthie a longer speech, but I am forced here to end. Lord comfort those which are comfortlesse, and strengthen thy weake children, that they may not be so cast downe, and plunged into perdition, but that in their greatest temptation, they may retaine thee still for their Sauiour, that liuing in thy feare, and dying in thy faith, they may come to eternall glorie.

A passion of little lesse then distrustfull despaire, did vexe him and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet him for the time. From the terrour and danger wherof, being recouered by the effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all apprehension of grace, by a liuely faith, he returneth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the perill of his body; which as it was great, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the sea, in the belly of the whale, which was irrecouerable in mans iudgement, so he seeketh to expresse it by multitude of words, repeating it, and reuoluing it with varietie of phrase, but all tending to one end; yet with such copiousnesse, especially being in so short a prayer, that a man would wonder at first,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:623:129"/>
how the Spirit of God which vseth to speake pressely and brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, so that no one word may fitly be spared, should so runne v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon one thing, with difference of speech, but in substance all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing.

            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 2 First, <hi>the waters did compasse me about vnto the soule</hi>; to the death, saith the Chaldee Paraphrase, as intending that he was now likely to be drowned, his life to depart from him, his soule to be seuered from her carnall habitation. Dauid also doth vse such vehemencie of words, <hi>Saue me ô God, for the waters are entred euen to my soule.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 69.1.</note> Neither is there any speech which more liuely discouereth the earnestnesse of that which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently in hand, be it prayer or perill, or desire or detestation, then the name of <hi>soule</hi> doth. <hi>As the Hart brayeth for the riuers of water, so panteth my soule after thee ô God. My soule thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth for God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 42.1.</note> This noteth an entire affection, and earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, wherewith Dauid was mooued. <hi>As the Lord liueth, and as thy soule liueth, I will not leaue thee,</hi> saith Elizaeus to Elias. A very passionate affirmation.<note place="margin">2.

               <hi>Into their secret let not my soule come.</hi> This argueth a perfect detestation. So the depth of danger is purported here, when he speaketh thus, <hi>the waters compassed me vnto the soule</hi>; the enemie of my life, the water which hath no mercie, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue me and below me and round about me, without me and within me, that my being was death, my hope was but destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, nothing possible vnto me but drowning, as farre as mans <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> wit might imagine. Secondly, <hi>the depth did close me round about.</hi> I was not in the shallow as a man in a lake, who lying downe may be stifled, but standing may be safe; but I was in the maine Ocean, which is called for the hugenesse of it, <hi>the gathering of waters,</hi> and elsewhere <hi>Tehom, a gulfe or bottomelesse pit,</hi> I was in that vastnesse,<note place="margin">Genes. 1.10.

               </note> which sometimes cannot be sounded by very long lines; I was in waters by multitudes, and there not diuing or floating vp and downe, but as closed and shut vp, as included in a sepulcher, or made fast in a prison: this deepe pit, this darke

pit, this vnco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable dungeon, had closed her mouth vpon me.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Thirdly, <hi>the weedes were wrapped about mine head.</hi> The sea doth beare weedes, as well as shallow water; yea somewhere very straungely, strangely I say, that in such places as where the depth seemeth to be of incredible greatnesse, weedes should be seene in abundance, in the vpper superficies, the very toppe of the water, and that so plentifully, that in nauigation the course of ships is stayed sometimes by them. Experience hath confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med this in the huge Atlantike sea,<note place="margin">Leuius in nauigat. ad Bresiliam. cap. 21.</note> as men saile to America, whereout doth grow a very strange Dilemma or Diuision, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause either they be there without any rootes at all, and that is very maruellous, or because the rootes do go downe exceeding deepe in the water, which is not otherwise affoorded by nature in thinne spindie bodies. But that weedes do grow in the sea, &amp; those of some price,<note place="margin">Solin. cap. 8.</note> Solinus letteth vs know, saying that shrubs and weedes in the Ligustike sea, are those from whence our Corall commeth. Such then being in the bottome, are about the head of our Prophet:<note place="margin">Tremel. in Ionae 2.</note> he is wreathed and tangled in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or as some do suppose, he was so fast in the water, as if he had beene tyed there; with as little hope of rising or comming vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. But the words here being positiue, that his head was wrapped in them, I imagine that when he sunke, &amp; went down to the bottome, he there strugled for life, as men do that are dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and by that meanes he was entangled in the weedes, as if some net had bespread him. And in my iudgement this cleareth that doubt, which ariseth vnto some, in the third verse of this chapter,<note place="margin">Ribera in Ionae. 1.</note> where because it is reported, that he was in the very bottome in the midst of the sea, and all the waues and surges did go ouer and ouer him, they suppose the meaning of it to be, that as soone as he was cast foorth ouer shipboord by the mariners, the whale forthwith deuoured him, on which because the waues passed, and he was in the whale, he saith they went ouer him: and because the fish went downe to the bottome of the sea, the Prophet in the fish is said to do the like. Whereas this place doth rather enforce, that betweene the time of his casting foorth, and the swallowing of the whale, there was some prety little space, which in this text is insinuated.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:623:130"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4 Fourthly he dilateth his sorrow, by adding that he went downe, <hi>to the bottome of the mountaines.</hi> It is very likely that it was some Cape or Promontorie, which did shoote foorth from the continent or firme-land, whereof there are very many in all the sea shore neare to Iapho; both Syria and Iudea being descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, to be hemmed in with mountaines. And this argueth all to be done, not very farre from the shore, because a tempest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the mariners at the first, soone after that they put fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> land. Or else he may meane the rockes, which being in the midst of the water, haue the hugenesse of prety mountaines; and this desolate man is now fallen into the clifts, or concauities, of one or other of these. He is then euery way a prisoner, fast fettered in the sedge, and closed vp in the hollownesse of the mountaine which was ouer him. Thus water, and weedes, and earth, haue all conspired to drowne him. If otherwise he might haue risen, yet now the hill is vpon him,<note place="margin">Virgil. Aenei. 3.</note> not fainedly as Aetna was said to be on Enceladus, but verily and indeed, not to crush him with the weight, but onely to keepe him there, and detaine him till he were drowned.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5 And this he maketh more plaine vnto vs, in the fifth cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance, when he saith <hi>the earth with her barres was about him, and that for euer.</hi> Barres are to make things strong, as in dores or otherwise. Then the strength of the earth had him within her keeping; euen that which Dauid doth call the pillars of the earth, <hi>I will establish the pillars of it.</hi> He was now as in a pit,<note place="margin">Psal 75.3.</note> fast bolted and surely kept, and as it seemed vnto him, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and for euer, neuer hoping to escape, and to be freed from that daunger. He held that the doome of fearefull death, was pronounced ouer him, the sentence of dissolution and destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; now he is in the midst of his dolorous execution. Thus he doth paint out vnto vs, the abundance of his miserie, propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing himself as a wretched spectacle for the time, enuironed with such woes, as he knoweth not how to describe them. The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that did compasse him, euen to the very soule; the depth did round beset him; the sedge was about his head; he was at the rootes of the mountaines; the great barres of the earth were clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and made fast vpon him. What more could a carnall man
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:623:130"/>
wish vpon his enemie, if he would wish to be neuer afterward troubled with him on earth? This is the full recounting in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, of those feares which were vpon this sinner. Now let vs see the vse of these words.</p>
            <p n="6">6 If I should be asked here, why I haue vsed this Paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall exposition, so much speech in a case so euident and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant, whereas doctrine and store of matter, is more fit and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to this auditorie, I must foorthwith shrowd my selfe vnder the Prophets shield. He thought good to write it, and I thinke not amisse to touch it: if any man shall say, vnfruitfully; he doth wrong to Gods Spirit, who throughout all the whole booke of the Scripture, hath put no one thing in vaine, although the dimme eyes of our weaknesse cannot hastily comprehend the mysterie of his meaning. The speaker then and the reader, are in this case to pray God, that he will descend and come downe vnto them, that he will touch the heart of the one with the key of knowledge, and that he will seare the lippes of the other,<note place="margin">Isay. 6.7.</note> with the coale of the Seraphim. And then this shall be gathered out of it. The vehement inculcation of so many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of miserie, doth the more magnifie Gods great mercie vnto our Ionas. The harder his necessitie was, the more wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come was Gods ayde. The more grieuous that his wound was, the greater was the cure. The more daungerous the sicknesse was, the more gracious was the healing. Beyond hope to saue, beyond thought to preserue, in a deplored state, and at a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate pinch to succour, is an eminent grace and fauour, neuer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough recorded, neuer enough reported. My daunger was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable, my perill was vndescribable: all hope was past and exiled; yet now in this wretched tenure, ô Lord my blessed God and euerlasting Father, thou hast brought vp my life from the pit. Now his obstinate hard affection beginneth to yeeld: this doth euen melt the heart of the Prophet in kindnesse, to see that from the bottome of millions of extremities, he was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by the free grace of his maker.</p>
            <p n="7">7 The remembrance of this benefit, doth so stir vp his mind, in his holyest meditations, and giueth such life to his motions, that he doth not satisfie himselfe, but the more expresse his
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:623:131"/>
miserie, the more to extoll Gods mercie. He thinketh himselfe the more deepely deuoted to such a Sauiour. The lower he was deiected, the greater was his deliuerance; and the more sound his deliuerance, the more sufficient should his thankfulnesse be to the Lord. Now he seeth his God to be a God of power and maiestie, able to free from any thing. Where his creatures do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, there he alone can lift vp. Although the wind rage, and the sea roare, and all the earth be disquieted, yet he doth beare sway ouer them. Then we neede not despaire in the waues of wo and extremitie: if our faith be not extinguished. It is Gods greatest glorie to rid from greatest euils. Where all mans helpe is wanting, there his finger is most conspicuous. It was a good speech of Philo the Iew,<note place="margin">Philo Iudae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us de lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione ad Caium.</note> which he vttered on this occasion: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that beast Caligula could be perswaded by no reason, nor by any mans intercession, but that his image must be set vp at Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, which would quickly haue inferred the adoration of it, and he was so earnest on it, that there was no way, but do it or dy, Philo turned him vnto his fellowes, and bad them not be discouraged, for <hi>where mans helpe doth cease, there Gods helpe doth begin.</hi> Then it prooued so with them; and so it doth with other oftentimes: but nothing could be more euident then this, to him who wrote my text. He ioyeth that in such a downefall, he did tast of Gods kindnesse: but the particular contemplation of his heauinesse, by recounting speciall circumstances, doth wring from him more gratefulnesse, more thanks giuing.</p>

               <note place="margin">Luc. 7.36.</note>8 When Christ being inuited came to the Pharisees house, he had some entertainment of him, but no way to be compared with that of the woman reputed the great sinner.

She could not content herselfe with many demonstrations of her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection toward him. The Sauiour Christ, who knew all things, did yeeld the reason of it, and that was <hi>shee loued much because much was forgiuen her.</hi> Then where much is receiued, there should be much returned.

our selues, that we may take knowledge of our infirmitie, and then giue him entire and complete praise, as vnto him belongeth. Adam was quickly fallen,<note place="margin">Genes. 36.15.</note> but he was not so hastily raised vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, by the actuall and present performance of the promised seede.

Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues de veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate fidei. l 2.</note> God suffered him to languish almost foure thousand yeares, and the longer he did lye, the deeper still he did sinke. This time of long staying, was first to make man without all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, who if he had bene restored immediatly, peraduenture would haue boasted in the pride of his heart, that it had bene a needlesse labour, for God to repaire him; for as in time he had fallen, so in time he would haue risen, without helpe of any. Now God tooke away this exception. Secondly it was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member man of his lamentable state, who had lyen vndeliuered so many yeares and ages, and thousands of times, and now at a desperate pinch, was set on foote againe by the free fauour of God. The opinion of which mysterie shall take deeper roote in vs, if therein we vse our selues as Ionas did here, that is, specially recount the euill then sustained, and seuerally remember the good things now receiued. If we will say as Zacharie the father of Iohn Baptist said,<note place="margin">Luc. 1.79.</note> that <hi>when we sate in darknesse and in the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death,</hi> a light was giuen vnto vs; and adde withall, that Adam had condemned vs, and Eue had vndone vs: our hands were polluted, our hearts were defiled, our deedes were depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, our toungs were profaned, our thoughts were corrupted, our knowledge was decayed, our vnderstanding darkened, all the powers of our mind euen to the death were wounded: the world triumphing without, the flesh insulting within, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan gaping for vs, as for a pray surely accompted of, yea hell &amp; damnation being in vs and on vs: yet the riches of the mercie of him, who redeemed vs by his owne precious bloud, did frustrate our enemies, did supply all our infirmities, did amend our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and set vs at libertie, that nothing should be layed to the charge of vs.</p>

What should I say of Dauid, when once he doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine then euery thing is too little, and where he doth giue thanks there nothing is too much.

But the truth is, it is farre otherwise. We are aliue and quicke in Gods businesse onely, while the sharpe spurre doth pricke vs. It is the rod which doth quicken vs, but not so much as it should.

So againe to draw each of vs to a speciall consideration, of that good or that euill, which hath or doth fall vpon vs. It is a very dull age, euen the dotage and last time of the world, wherein we do now liue: our memory is decayed, by reason of the heauinesse of our spirits, and the earthinesse of that corruptible carcasse, which hangeth so fast vpon vs. Then we had neede be wakened with often and loud remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that as drop after drop doth pierce the hardest stone, so thought after thought may make our dead heart to be plyable. This is the course of our Prophet, by manifold repetitions of the dangers wherein he was, to acknowledge the Lords ayde, to be so much the more ouer him; and himselfe the more behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the more bound and deuoted to such full mercies on him. Great loue requireth a great measure of returning retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if that possibly may be; if not that, yet of consideration, and earnest contemplation, and acknowledgement to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost. Take Ionas here for an example of behauiour in like daunger.

I shewed in the third verse of the first chapter, that among some other reasons, the feare of daunger might make him change his course. It might haue bene, that in Niniue he should haue bene much disgraced, it might haue bene quite despised, perhaps by the king impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, peraduenture put to death.<note place="margin">Terentius. <hi>Ego in portu nauigo.</hi>
               </note> It was best for him to escape all this; good sailing in the hauen; good sleeping in a whole skinne. The safest way were to make sure work, and not to come there at all. But what a chaunge did he make? He feared a little hurt, and now he hath a great deale. He suspected, that onely one thing might annoy him, and now he hath found another. Nay in truth for euery ten, he doth receiue a thousand. Before, he did distrust that his body might haue smarted; now body and soule pay for it. Before he might haue had some man perhaps his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, but God his friend assured: now not so much as any man is his friend, and God like to a furious enemie doth chase him, and make after him. In this sort, such who in the Lords causes will not depend vpon him, but in their imagination cast great perils to themselues, thinking to auoid those by declining from their dutie, in that their turning away, do plunge themselues into greater daungers. They thinke that they flye from a dogge, and they turne them vpon a cockatrice. They hope to escape a blow, and receiue a deadly wound.

               <hi>It is a point of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme madnesse, to stand in feare of those things which are not to be feared, but to laugh at such matters as in truth are dreadfull. In this</hi> saith he, <hi>men do differ from children, that these (as not hauing their vnderstanding perfect) do feare vizards, and men clothed with sackes, but thinke that it is nothing to reuile their father or their mother, and they leape into the fire or</hi> touch <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles which are burning, but they quake at some noyses which are not to be feared. But men do care for none of all these things.</hi> If we looke vpon our selues, and sift our hearts as we ought, we shall find our selues in the number of these babies and silly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, when we make much scruple of some trifles, but respect not an higher dutie, and so to escape the raine, we runne our selues into the riuer.</p>
            <p n="15">15 What is more common amongst vs, then when we are in hope of preferment, to feare this or that crosse? the anger of this mightie man, or of that noble woman? If their names be but vsed, or their letters be procured, although vpon wrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, yet if they be induced to mooue something incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, or scandalous, or amisse, (be it neuer so much against the will of the writer, for that he wanteth true notice) do we not more feare to faile their vniustly extorted motion, then wee dread the Lords displeasure, or the great account which one day we must yeeld for our selues, when no Prince of the earth shall be able to protect vs? Thus for mens sakes we leaue God, (for so it may be termed, when we decline from iustice, and that which should be done) and when we thinke that we haue dealt most subtilly and most wisely, Gods finger is vp against vs, and ouerturneth all our pollicies. Yea peraduenture he whom we haue serued, or she whom we haue feared, by the motion of the Spirit of the Lord, is made a rodde to whip vs, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that we haue dishonoured them, in making them the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of vnfit actions; or else that person for some worldy res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,

is drawne away from our purpose, and so the hope of our labour is frustrated and made nothing. And then this wound remaineth vpon our conscience, that we haue done this and this, which our heart did tell vs was vntoward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct, or at the least to be doubted. And what a griefe is it to vs, to haue such a worme within vs, fretting and gnawing on vs? The way to preuent all this, is euermore to looke on Gods feare, and his precise commandement, and not to swarue from that, and then he whome we sincerely serue, will either send vs the fruite of our desires, or patience in the contrarie. <hi>The kings heart is in the hand of the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prou. 21.1.</note> 
               <hi>as the riuers of waters: he turneth it vvhither so euer it pleaseth him</hi>: Then how much more the hearts of other inferiour persons? If he thinke that it be fit for vs, where-about we go, he will send it vs; but when he pleaseth: if not, his will be done. Onely this is our comfort, whether that come or not, the bird is safe in the bosome: sorrow shall not vpbraide vs, that wee haue feared men more then the eternall God: that we haue for the pleasure of any, made shippe-wracke of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, or very farre aduentured toward it. Take heede then by the Prophet, that in seeking to flye such harme as is but imaginarie, or little in comparison, we do not runne our selues by offending of the Lord, into daunger which is ineuitable.

               </note> Saint Austen in those eight questions which were proposed to him by Dulcitius, speaketh fitly to this matter. When the woman came to Christ from Syro Phaenicia, he said vnto her, <hi>the childrens bread is not to be throwne to dogges: but afterward, not O dogge great is thy faith, but O woman great is thy faith. He chaungeth his word because he saw her affection chaunged, and he vnderstood that the same reproofe of his was growne vp to good fruite.</hi> So it is with this patient: when his faith once breaketh foorth, he shall come from corruption.</p>
            <p n="17">17 But what may be the matter, that he so much reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, that he should liue againe. The words which go before from the beginning of the chapter, do shew a fast hold to be layed on Gods fauour by faith, (howsoeuer for some little time it was dismayed) a remission of sinnes, and a hope of life eternal, although he had very much transgressed. Then since his life was sealed vp against another world, why should he desire to be here againe? Why should he so reioyce that he should be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered? Very shame might haue enforced him to hate the light. The report of the mariners, who would freely speake whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they came, might spread the name of him, as of a most infamous person. He might be poynted at with the finger, by children and vile folkes, as he went in the streete. Howsoeuer, Gods children should thirst to be aboue, should long to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued, and be at home with their father. So did Saint Paule in the new Testament,<note place="margin">Philip. 1.23. 1. Reg. 19.4.</note> when <hi>he desired to be loosed</hi>: so did Elias in the old when he cryed, <hi>It is now enough, ô Lord take my soule, for I am no better then my fathers.</hi> And who would be in his pilgrimage, when he might be in his countrey? who
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:623:136"/>
would be in the sea, when he might be in the hauen? who would be warring, when a crowne might then be giuen him for his victorie? who would be in the way, when he might be at home in rest? It seemeth then at the first sight, that the Prophet doth take ioy in his losse, and desireth that for a benefite, which was a harme vnto him. But when all these things are scanned as they should bee, it will appeare farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
            <p n="18">18 Now it was no time to feare the shame of the world: he was rather to seeke to please one, and that was his old mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster; yea if he displeased all other by it. It was a good resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him, who did write the eigth of those Epistles, which be in the end of Saint Hieromes workes:<note place="margin">Hieron.

               <hi>Let euerie one say what himselfe will.

Now he who is setled in such an opinion, neede not feare to depart from this transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie habitation: nay he may well long to dye. But with Ionas it is otherwise: he standeth yet in a mammering, and knoweth not which way to turne him. Yet he is not quite exempted from that conflict of his, betweene hope and despaire: yet, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his faith be not extinguished) he is not assured, how the Lord will take his sinne at his hands. This maketh him wish for more time to testifie his obedience; to make a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence if it might be, for his sinfull rebellion; or at the least to wash away his iniquitie with many teares. And hauing this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in him, to aske pardon with sighes and sobbes, he ioyeth with all his heart, that time is permitted him, to performe the vowes of his soule, and to remooue away from the Church of God, that scandale which he had offered.</p>
            <p n="19">19 Moreouer if he had dyed in the sea, and the belly of the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:623:137"/>
fish, his departure had bene violent, and layed vpon him for his sinne, as a grieuous punishment for vngodlinesse: and such a kind of death, the faithfull seruants of the Lord haue no desire to dye. It may well be gathered out of the thirtieth Psalme, that the sicknesse of Dauid there insinuated (for that Psalme may best be vnderstoode of sickenesse) was layed vpon him for one fault or other:<note place="margin">Psal. 30.6.</note> perhaps for presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, he thought that he was too strong. But when for that cause, he felt the hand of the Lord sharpely chastising him; he beggeth that he might not in such a sort go downe to the graue. <hi>What profite is there in my bloud vvhen I goe downe to the pit? shall the dust giue thankes vnto thee? or shall it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare thy truth?</hi> For some one reason or other, which the Spirit of God hath concealed,<note place="margin">2 Reg. 20.3.</note> Hezechias was not readie, when the Prophet Esay came vnto him, and told him that he must dye. This did make him turne himselfe to the wall, and weepe, and pray to the Lord, that if it might stand with his good pleasure, that sentence might be reuersed. Then it is not our best safetie, at euery time, and in euerie case, to be remooued hence, but vpon some occasion we may ioye with Ionas, that longer time is affoorded vs to bethinke our selues. This is his exceeding comfort, that though the pangs of death were vpon him, yet that God once againe brought his life from corruption.</p>

God heareth the prayers of his seruants. 17. By vanity is signified euill. 19 as Adams fall may therein be comprehended, 20. or idolatry, 21. or curious crafts and studies, 22. or adultery and carnall sinne, 23. and ill gotten goods, 24. and ambition.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is euident vnto vs, by the whole processe of the Chapter before going, that the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Ionas, did seeme vnto the Lord a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous transgression: And his fall may seeme to vs, a very strange fault, that a Prophet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised before in Gods seruice, among the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, acquainted with secrets and reuelations from aboue, should so vary from the tenure of piety and obedience. But great sinnes require great punishments, straunge faults require
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:623:139"/>
straunge chastisements. Our Ionas as I thinke, may make his profession, that it hath bene so with him. A tempest did follow him, which would not giue him ouer: a lot did discouer him to be a malefactor: and when he could aunswer to the euidence, no one word but <hi>guilty,</hi> which imported his confession, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners will they, nill they, must cast him ouer ship-boord: where after sinking downe to the bottome of the water, after wrapping and intangling of his head within the weedes, he is caught vp by a fish, in whose belly he is lodged, for three dayes and three nights. Here how perplexed his state was, who cannot imagine? Without foode, without light, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out company and comfort: a man drowned, and not drowned; deuoured but not digested, aliue but yet as dead, in perpetuall expectation of the fearefull dissolution, of his soule from his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Nay the torment was greater, which he sustained in his heart, that horrour in his conscience, that conflict in his soule, as if God had forsaken him, and giuen sentence vpon him, as on a reprobate cast-away, a firebrand of hell, an inheritor of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Woful sinner, who for his fancies sake, and vpon the sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of flesh and bloud, would draw such a iudgement to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, as which a man well aduised would not haue sustained, but the space of one day, for any treasure on earth. For it is a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing, to grapple with the Highest, or to wrastle with our maker.</p>
            <p n="2">2 As this anguish hath bene largely before touched, so to make it vp complete, he addeth as the conclusion of his misery, although not of his prayer, that <hi>his soule fainted in him,</hi> it dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled it selfe together (as some men do translate it) as the knees of a man dying do double; it was as ouerwhelmed, fainting as in a swound, his life was at last cast, euen ready now to go out, as a consumed lampe: the gaspes and grones and pangs, of very death were vpon him. Yea throbs of desperation did oppugne him with such violence, that the hope of eternall life seemed for some moments, to be exiled from him; his forlorne soule was sinking in diffidence and distrust. So the best are deiected when God doth eclypse his presence and comfortable aspect. But that absence and forbearing, maketh a more tender feeling of
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:623:139"/>
succour when it returneth, a more aboundant thankfulnesse: for it deserueth gratefulnesse in great measure, to be brought from the depth of sorrow, to the height of ioy; to be saued from extremity. Ionas yet striketh this string, amplifying Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ouer him, from the circumstance of the time: when my ghost was giuing vp, when all hope was past and gone. Which argument because I fully handled in my last Lecture, I would now leaue it, and teach some other doctrine. These two verses note two persons; the former of them the Prophet, the latter some other men, who waite on lying vanities. The actions of the one of them, and the other, are here specified, and the fruite which both of them do reape. Then these two persons yeeld two parts, to be handled by Gods assistance. In the former which concerneth the Prophet, these circumstances are: what he did, and how he sped: what he did, in that he saith <hi>he remembred the Lord,</hi> how he sped, in that he addeth, that <hi>his prayer came vnto God in his holy Temple.</hi>

            <p n="3">3 The purpose of Gods election, in fore-appointing some vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> life eternall, is a matter so immutable, and vnchangeable in it selfe, that nothing can impeach it. The flesh with her frailty, the world with his suttlety, the multitudes and millions of infernall spirits, cannot alter that decree. There may be some shadowes, and seemings to the contrary, but the substance is kept inuio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable. The very gates of hell,<note place="margin">Matth. 16.18.</note> preuaile not against him whose the determination is; neither preuaile they against his. No creature can crosse the intent of the Creator. He can bring vs, he can force vs, from sin, vnto sorrow and heauinesse for sinne, from fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse vnto innocency, from transgression to repentance, from forsaking of goodnesse to embracing of grace. He it is who can regenerate vs, renew vs, and reforme vs, remould vs, and reframe vs, that naturall corruptions, and actuall deprauations, euen ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry with Naaman,<note place="margin">2.

Where he appointeth salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there euery thing in his time shall worke vnto saluation; but
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:623:140"/>
it must be in his time. He draweth the vnwilling to him, the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken he bindeth vp, the lost he seeketh out, he toucheth that with remorse, which was before as the Adama<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the hardest hart he doth mollifie. He that ordaineth glory to any, will giue him grace to attaine it. He who is the life is the way leading to that life:<note place="margin">Ioh. 14.6.</note> he who giueth the one, graunteth the other. Where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineth the end, there also he offereth the meanes to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that end. As before more at large.</p>
            <p n="4">4 But there is no meane more direct, to bring any to God, then to teach him to know God, who neuer knew him before: and such a man as did know him, and now is as if he were fallen away, to bring him to remember him; that he may once againe assume that confidence, and resolution to himselfe, that he who loued him before, will returne his affection toward his soule, if it do seeke vnto him. Which fauour, looke to whom God in his mercy graunteth, it is an assured argument that he is not such a lost child, as who finally shall perish. For with his sweete re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance (for so I may well terme it, when it commeth after bitter temptation, and a grieuous fall) doth go a faith of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that if it be once admitted to presence, it will neuer out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; no iustice can dismay it, no iudgement can affright it; but although it creepe on his knees, it will to the mercy seate; from which albeit rigour should offer to repell it &amp; remooue it, yet it clingeth &amp; clutcheth so fast, that it will not out any more. Then, the best men who haue falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the infirmity of their flesh, thinke their case very happy, if that may be graunted to them, to haue God in their mind, and to haue recourse to him: and they make much of that motion, retaining it and pursuing it, as the best way to their blessednesse: they account this in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test difficulties, as the first step to a conquest, as the first linke of a chaine, which being plucked will bring on much more with it.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <note place="margin">Psal. 42.6.</note>5 In the two and fortieth Psalme Dauid complaineth thus: <hi>My God, my soule is vexed within me,</hi> but yet he addeth for his comfort,<note place="margin">Psal. 77.2.1.</note> 
               <hi>therefore I will remember thee.</hi> In the seuentie and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth Psalme, <hi>In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord, my sore ranne and ceased not in the night: my soule refused comfort,</hi>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:623:140"/>
But <hi>I did thinke vpon God.</hi> What a ioy was it to Iob, when after losse of all, after his biles and botches, and scraping them with a pot-sheard, after his wiues temptation, after his friends repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching him that he was a sinfull hypocrite (else God would not haue so plagued him) he found that grace with his maker, as to grow to this resolution to say,<note place="margin">Iob. 13.15.</note> 
               <hi>Lo, though he slay me, yet will I trust in him.</hi> For it is the only rocke of contentment, the best and sole assurance, which languishing soules can haue, to runne vnto the Lord, all-sufficient for his power, and mercifull in his loue. Ionas was past the pikes, and now entring vpon a victory, when after his deiection, and discouragement in his suffering, he beginneth to remember God, whose amiable countenance he had seene so oft before, and whose fauour he had enioyed. And that is a great matter, vnto a wounded soule (whereby he may close againe with the Highest, and gather in with the Iudge) to haue had former experience of his loue, as of a father. This experience bringeth hope, and hope will neuer cease to begge,<note place="margin">Psal. 74.12.</note> and vrge for a pardon. <hi>God is my king of old,</hi> saith the Church of God in affliction, &amp; it resteth it selfe on that. When Habacuc had complained of those, who in his time did grieuously persecute the faithfull, his refuge is, the remembrance of the Lords foregoing fauour, which euermore had sustained him.<note place="margin">Habac. 1.12.</note> 
               <hi>Art not thou of old</hi> sayth he <hi>my Lord my God, my holy one? Therefore we shall not dye.</hi>

What blacknesse can be so filthy, as that Christs bloud cannot wash it? I cannot owe so much, but my God can forgiue it. I cannot want so much, but my Sauiour can supply it. If I looke vpon my selfe, behold wo and damnation; but if I looke vp to heauen, there I haue a strong redeemer. Now as for earthly matters, and these corruptible trifles, with which we haue to do, they are to the regenerate man, farre lighter then the other. If penury or pouerty come,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:623:141"/>

And all this may be soundly warranted to me, by those former experiments which I haue had. I haue liued so many yeares, and haue euer bene preserued: I haue slipped oft but neuer fallen; or fallen but risen againe. I haue bene much bruised, but neuer broken: in aduersity he hath helped me, in temptation he hath succoured me: he is the same God euer, most gracious and most kind; him will I serue in weale, him will I seeke too in wo.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Well fare this good remembrance, and flying to the Lord; vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the holy men of all ages haue had recourse, the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arks &amp; the Prophets, &amp; euery grieued soule. And whither could they better go, then to the spring of grace, then to the well of power? No fishing vnto the sea: no seruice to a king: where most is, most may be gotten. No seeking like to that which is to the king of kings, who is more then a sea of bounty. But in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring him, remember this withall, that it be with a liuely faith, with a confident apprehension of the sweetnesse of his loue. For in this, the elect do differ from the wicked: both of them are in distresse, and both reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber God: but the one of them with a hope, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a horror: the elect firmely beleeuing, that his God doth thinke vpon him: that although the beames of his countenance, for a time be shadowed from him, yet they will breake forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: that he smiteth but not to death, he striketh, but not to kill. Whereas on the other side, the vnbeleeuing sinner, be he hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite or idolater, doth thinke that his God or Gods, haue vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly forgotten him; or if they do remember him, it is but for to plague him, to vexe him or torment him: by which meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he breaketh into wrath &amp; most impatie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fury, somtimes raging with heat, somtimes despairing for feare, euermore quaking with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. So the one of these liueth, &amp; recouereth, &amp; daily approcheth more neare to the Lord; the other sinketh &amp; fainteth, as the mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting yce doth in the sun-shine; or else fretting he blasphemeth, not

            <p n="8">8 We find such in the Scripture.

What maruell then is it, if the wicked do fret and rage without comfort, since he hath no share in him, who is the God of comfort? What maruell is it, if he perish? Plutarch telleth that this is the quality of Tigres,<note place="margin">Plutarch. de supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione.</note> that if drums or tabours sound about them, they will grow madde, and then they teare their owne flesh, and rent themselues in peeces. If the vnbeleeuing reprobate do heare the noyse of affliction, he is ready to rent himselfe: but by cursing and by swearing, he will teare the body of Christ from top to toe in peeces. As Ionas did remember God; so the reprobate will not forget him; but it is not to pray vnto him; not to beleeue vpon him, for he harh not so much grace, but to ban him and blaspheme him I could wish that such prophanenesse as this, might neuer be heard off, in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest or in play, in the life or death of any man. We should thinke of him with a reuerence, we should mind him with a feare; in prosperity with a trembling, in aduersity with a hope. There should be no fretting against his prouidence, no grudging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his punishment. When my soule did faint within me, <hi>I remembred the Lord</hi> sayth Ionas, I remembred him to beseech him, I remembred him to intreate him, I remembred him to embrace him, to trust in him as a deliuerer, to beleeue in him as

            <p n="10">10 Saint Hierome doth giue this note vpon this place,<note place="margin">Hieron. in Ion. 2.</note> taking it out of the Septuagint. That because he thought vpon the Lord, when his soule did faint, and he was ready to dye, we by his example, should aboue all things mind our maker, when we are in the fits and pangs of death. A very needefull doctrine, if any thing may be needefull; that when we must dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodge, and be remooued hence, when our glasse is so farre runne, that immediatly a change must follow, and that not to a trifle, or toye, which is to bee contemned, but either to heauen or hell, either to perpetuall ioy, or to euerlasting torment; we haue him in our meditations, who is to see our iudge, who is to scanne our actions, and to peruse our conscience, and giue the last sentence on vs: that then with our best remembrance we thinke vpon his mercy, and contemplate on his great loue, in the redemption of his sonne, and desire him for his blouds sake, to take vs into his fauour. That this lesson might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be taught vnto vs, Iesus the sonne of God, and fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of our faith, when he was ready to yeeld vp his spirit, did commend his vnspotted soule,<note place="margin">Luc. 23.46,</note> to his most righteous father. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into thy hands I commend my spirit.</hi> Good Steuen the eldest martyr, did tread these steps right after him, when at the time of his death he cried,<note place="margin">Act. 7.59.</note>

It is a good thing to liue well; but because death is the vp-shot, which maketh or marreth the rest, it is the best thing to dye well.

But neither of themselues, nor by the instigation of the Minister (who is a remembrancer for the Lord) can they be any way vrged, to speake of celestiall things, to call on God for mercy, or to professe their faith, and confidence in their Sauiour. And this wordly imagination, first ministreth hope of life, they not dreaming that death will take them, till on the sudden both body and soule, do eternally dye together. Next if they do conceiue, that it must be so, and there is no way with them but the graue, then is their heart oppressed with sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and a huge waight of griefe, that there must be a separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from their beloued treasure. And lastly if their memory do serue, there must be an vnsetled and vnresolued disposing, with disquietnesse and much vexing, of that which hath bene ill got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, to this child or to that friend, and much stirre there must be about the pompe of a funerall: by which meanes all good motions are so stifled and choaked, that there is scant one word of him, who made all and must iudge all. See what it is, in our life time to thirst after this trash, to repose our full contentment and blessednesse in this drosse. When the heart should be lifted vp to celestiall contemplation, this hangeth so about it, that it cannot but lye groueling, vpon the the rotten ground.</p>

Let the carelesnesse of those Pastours, whom God hath blessed with skill, make open declaration, who do mind that field or barne, whence corne or wooll commeth to them, oftener in one moneth, then the pulpit in a yeare. They can enquire for a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, where one may be had best cheape, (not respecting whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be able to teach,) or what payments be to the Prince, or impositions to the state, but how the people shall be instructed, they do not regard at all. And on the other side, let the generall behauiour of men throughout the land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> speake whether those that be of the congregation, do vse these houses as sanctified things or no. Looke into their cold coming on the weeke daies, in such places where Lectures are continued, their talking and gazing about, when their soule should be instructed; their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoluing of their worldly businesse; their obseruing rather of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence in the minister or preacher, or in some, what may be carped at, then how their owne life may be bettered, or their conscience informed; their perfunctorie praying, and formall inuocation of him who requireth the heart. These matters shew that it is made vnholy by vs, which in it selfe is ordained to be holy.

It is he who neuer failed any of those who seeke to him. As in all other matters, so in this he hath a prerogatiue aboue all other: he can heare, and he will heare. Heathenish Gods are but delusions, and imaginarie toyes; he who prayeth to them prayeth to nothing.<note place="margin">1. Reg. 18.27</note> Baal may be iested at, as sleeping or being busie. Idols are but dead stockes; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not mooue themselues, and therefore not helpe themselues, much lesse those that pray to them. Yet a man exceedeth all these, if they were in number ten thousand: although oftentimes he debaseth himselfe, as a seruant vnto these. But how short of God doth this man come? This will not if he could: another could if he would: a third both could and would, but is absent, and therefore ignorant what it is that is begged of him. The power of all is so limited, that the greatest cannot graunt the tenth thing which is asked, and either themselues do confesse this, or vse base shifts to couer it. And how hardly do men part with that which is in their power?<note place="margin">Seneca de Beneficijs. lib. 2.17.</note> As Seneca writeth, on a time a Cynike Philosopher asked a talent of Antigonus, who would gladly haue bene reputed a bountifull Prince. His answer was, that a talent was too much for a Cynike to receiue. Then the other asked him a peny. That saith he is too little for a king as I am to giue. How oft soeuer such answers be giuen from men, they do neuer come from God. He giueth without reproching; he heareth without delaying. But we must aske that which is lawfull, and we must aske in faith, and we shall not haue a denyall.</p>
            <p n="16">16 It pleaseth him to yeeld so much vnto our prayer, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing that as the instrument whereby we do approch him.

If heauinesse do oppresse vs, and sorrow weigh vs downe, yet if our knees be bent vnto him, or our hands held vp on high, or our breasts be beaten before him, or our cheeks bedewed with teares, we shall be eased from all. Then this is the onely remedie, in agonies and in anguishes, for the afflicted soule to seeke to. It hasteneth to and fro, and neuer returneth emptie.

            <p n="17">17 These words do imply a kind of Antithesis, or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> successe, betweene him before mentioned, and those who do now follow: as if he should say, I scant looked for mercie, and yet I did find it; I prayed and was heard: but these might receiue mercie, and themselues do forsake it. These are such which <hi>obserue,</hi> or <hi>keepe,</hi> or <hi>wayte vpon lying vanitie</hi> in stead of truth, not ignorantly falling into it, but wilfully pursuing it. Such as set their whole labour on that which is but errour, and make a studie of it. Now those who with such egernesse do follow wrong paths, the farther they go on, the more they go astray. They bend indeede all their diligence to somewhat, but it is to lying vanitie: vnder which name, the Scripture doth compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all things, which are besides pietie, and the true seruice of God.<note place="margin">Psal. 31.6. Psal. 62.10.</note> 
               <hi>I haue hated them</hi> saith Dauid, <hi>who giue themselues to deceitfull vanities.</hi> And in another place: <hi>Trust not in oppression and robberie, be not vaine.</hi> Gods Spirit doth account euery thing to be but vaine, and lying, and deceitfull, which cannot endure the tryall, which faileth vs and falleth from vs, and when we most trust to it, is least able to do vs good. Such are all earthly things, without the grace of God being ioyned to them; as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which are so much desired, and honour which is so hotely

He may be said to haue turned from the Lord who is only truth, and to haue embraced falshood; to haue refused grace, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken his owne mercie. For where as God hath promised to be mercifull to all such, who serue him as he hath taught, by their neglecting of true deuotion, they also neglect that mercie, which was offered to them before. So they make themselues vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of remission and pardoning of their sinnes. And in this case, the end doth prooue heauie, like to that rule of Aristotle, where he saith that <hi>it must needes be in progresse of time,</hi>

The hereticall vnderstanding of Scripture is of this kind, being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but a lying vanitie: and so is the faining of that to be Scripture, which is not written by Gods Spirit, and the groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereupon of such positions, as touch pietie and saluation.

And what I pray you is this tree? if it be good, why may not I touch it? if it be bad what doth it in Paradise?</hi> There is no hurt in the tree; but God in his spitefull moode, is loath that you should be graced so far foorth as himselfe. You shall be Gods if you do it, and able to discerne good and euill. Thus was a lye inculcated in stead of a simple truth, and Adam was induced to hearken to the vanitie of the deceiuing serpent, whereby he lost that mercie, which the Lord had appointed ouer him, and pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked on himselfe and his posteritie after him, that miserie, that body and soule for euer had ioyntly perished by it, if our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in compassion had not made restitution.

If any thing be a vanitie, this is a lying vanitie, and a mis-spending of that time, which God hath giuen vnto vs, not to abuse, but to serue him; and he will require a reckening of it at our hands, when we do least thinke vpon it. There fall within this number, the auncient <hi>Aruspicia</hi> and <hi>Auguria</hi> of the Romanes, that is, the marking of the flights of birds, or of the entrails of beastes, or other things of that qualitie, all which are foolish vanitie; and yet much time was spent in them, and some made profession to be very skilfull about them. The wisest among the heathens, although they did not know God, yet held these things for cousinage. It is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed speech which is fathered vpon Cato,<note place="margin">Cicero de Diuinat. l. 2.</note> that he would say, that he wondred very much, how one of their Aruspices could forbeare to laugh, when he met with any of his fellowes, to see how they deceiued men, and made a great number of sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ones in the citie.

Diuinat.</note> In Tullies disputation concerning such arguments, when one to enforce the veritie of Diuination, had said that a victorie which fell to the Thebanes, was foreshewed by some extraordinarie crowing of Cockes, Tully could aunswere that with a smooth flowte, but very significant, that it was no mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle that Cockes should crow, but if fishes had done it, that had bene straunge indeed. Those Ethniks could see that these things were falshood, and exceeding lying vanities, worthy to be but laughed at; yet how did some of their greatest men attend and wait vpon them?<note place="margin">Act. 19.19.</note> I may call these foolish Arts, for I thinke that they come not so farre, as curious crafts extend, which are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the Acts of the Apostles. But to speake mine opinion, I imagine that figure-casting for such things as are lost, or to iudge of Natiuities, is fully within that kind, and is a lying vanity,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:623:148"/>
as that which is most lying. Yet although by the Prophets it be sharpely rebuked,<note place="margin">Isay. 47.13. Ierem. 10.2.</note> although condemned by Philosophers, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ill spoken of by Historians, although by good lawes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, in well gouerned common wealths, although no Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple therein haue approoued veritie, neither may there be any good argument or conclusion made for it, yet how do some waite vpon it, and in no sort will go from it? Of whom I may also say, as Cato said of the Aruspices, that I maruell when they meete one another, how they can forbeare to laugh to see how they get monie. From the number of these, I may not seclude superstitious obseruations of ominous or vnfortunate things, vpon which some men do so dote, that they beleeue such va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, as a man should beleeue the Gospell. All fearefull iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments sent from God, are to be regarded by vs, but friuolous su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions, and traditions from old tales, are rather to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned. <hi>He that obserueth the wind shall not sow,</hi>

               <hi>and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reape.</hi> Take heed of such lying va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities.</p>
            <p n="22">22 Fourthly, ordinarie transgressions may very well be taxed hence, and adulterie among other: wherein although Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan the more to inflame it, do buzze a tale into want on flesh, that great men haue sinned so; that God will not call such natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral faults as those be to reckening; that there is time inough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in old age; and it is best in the meane while to satisfie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence: yet when these things come to be weighed in the ballance of Gods iustice, they prooue both light and lying. For the wrath of the Lord is oftentimes kindled against such wilfull crimes; and he hath threatned, that whore mongers shall be shut out from the new Hierusalem.<note place="margin">Apoc. 22.15</note> They then do forsake their owne mercie, who pollute themselues in such sort, and withall are a cause for other to be filthie. Yet how some wait vpon this, it is lamentable to thinke, seeking to hurt themselues by euery kind of wantonnesse. Good Iob in his confession, held this for a grosse sinne,<note place="margin">Iob 31.9.</note> and disclaimed it from himselfe, <hi>If my heart haue bene deceiued</hi> saith he <hi>by a woman, or if I haue layed waite at the dore of my neighbour,</hi> obserue that adulterers do wayt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their sinne, <hi>let my wife grind vnto another man, and let other men bow

            <p n="23">23 Fiftly, they who in desire to enrich themselues or theirs,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> do set their heart vpon mony, and care not how they gaine it, by robberie or oppression by briberie or extortion, so that it come in vnto them, do wayt vpon lying vanitie. Which may easily be gathered from the very words of Dauid,<note place="margin">Psal. 62.10.</note> whom I cited before, <hi>trust not in oppression nor in robberie: be not vaine,</hi> or <hi>giue not your selues vnto vanitie, if riches encrease, set not your heart vpon them.</hi> If any, then this is a vaine conceit to thinke that a mans purse is the best friend which he hath, that riches can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue in the day of greatest trouble, that God accepteth mony, that ill gotten goods can long prosper. Oftentimes mony is kept to the hurt and death of the owner: and children are so farre off from being blessed with goods which are ill gotten, that fretting and consuming, and a curse is ioyned with them. Then what folly is it to force and straine our consciences, and so to aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on Gods displeasure, and the losse of his best mercie, for the gaining of that which is but a fugitiue seruant, and cannot helpe at neede? And yet it is straunge to see, how the world lyeth open to vnlawfull and filthie gaine, what wringing there is from all sortes, what griping of the poore, what thirsting after gifts and hunting after rewards. Are there not which wayt vpon this, and make a studie of it, as a man would studie heauen, deuising and contriuing by what fine sleight and skill, this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney may be soked out, and this cheate may be gotten, and that gift may be had? and then like to the hypocrite, whereof Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charie speaketh in his time,<note place="margin">Zach. 11.5.</note> they can crye <hi>blessed be God for I am rich</hi> and liue well, seeming to giue the Lord thankes for that, which they haue spoyled, and robbed from their brethren, whom as there the Prophet speaketh, they slay and sell for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. It is great thankes which we returne to God, for the wit and reason which he hath bestowed vpon vs, to employ it in that sort; as to offend his diuine Maiestie, to abuse those with whom we liue, to helpe our selues, (so farrefoorth as is in our owne power) to infamie in this life, with all such as be

vertuous, &amp; to destruction in another. Better it is to haue cleane hands here with a little, then much profite by false vanitie.</p>
            <p n="24">24 The same application may be made, concerning ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and other sinnes, in all which we may take this for a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; that our sight is so dimme, and our vnderstanding so darke, and such are the false shewes of many things in this life, that we may quickly pursue a lye, in steede of truth, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie for sound veritie, and so purchase Gods wrath, vnlesse with a single eye we looke on things aright, and euer take the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Scripture for our triall; and withall pray that our heart and intellectuall powers, may be lightned in that behalfe, that so hauing will and strength, by the mercie of the Lord, we may walke as we ought, and as it beseemeth our calling. And here I end. Holy Father we beseech thee to direct our steps in thy paths, that renouncing all lying vanities, we may acknowledge thee in our life time, to be the onely Lord; and when our soule fainteth within vs, and is departing hence, we may onely thinke on thee, that both our present prayers, and spirits afterward may ascend into thy celestiall temple, where thou raignest with thy most blessed Sonne, to whom with thee and thy holy Spirit be laud and praise for euer.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the words before going, the Prophet doth comfort himselfe exceedingly, that he serueth such a maister, as is best able to helpe him whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he most needeth, and in his Temple attended to his heartie prayer, when as his soule fainted within him; whereas all other things, be they idols or heathen Gods, or any deuised refuges, be nothing but lying vanitie, and therefore those who wait and depend vpon them, do forsake their owne mercie. Where, when he had found God so eminent, and incomparably great, in comparing him with those weake ones, he esteemeth it a speciall point of dutie, to yeeld to one so excellent, a high measure of praise; and most deserued thankes to him, who in extremitie had so raised him from the pit. And this is the drift of this present verse, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge himselfe so bound and deuoted to God, that all the powers of his mind, and faculties of his soule, should be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in his seruice. A conclusion well beseeming him who had receiued such fauour, that he would not as beastes, or as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefull persons do, onely take that which doth come, and make no more adoo; but with a respect vnto the giuer, who
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:623:150"/>
beyond all expectation had raised him and relieued him, would record it, and repeate it, and in his best meditation, againe and againe reuolue it, as not knowing how to returne enough, for Gods great mercie.</p>
            <p n="2">2 But in the meane while, the words which he vseth are various and significant. He doth mention <hi>thankesgiuing,</hi> which declareth his gratefull mind: and the better to expresse it, he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <hi>the voyce of thankesgiuing,</hi> as intending, that he would aduaunce the honour of him who saued him, not in secret onely, but with manifest declaration to others: and to both these he doth ad the act of offering <hi>sacrifice,</hi> applying that to his thankes, which was the most solemne seruice, vsed in old time to God. Neither doth he make his stand heere, but whereas he had vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed some things vnto the Lord, which he promised to performe, if euer he did escape, he saith <hi>he vvill pay those vowes:</hi> and at the last for a conclusion, he shutteth vp all with these words, <hi>saluation is of the Lord.</hi> Where because (as you see) the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances in the text are manifold, and all of them haue their vse, for better order of instruction, I thinke good to obserue two things. First the dutie returned by Ionas, and that consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in a double deede, one, the sacrifice of thankesgiuing, and the other, the paying of his vowes. Secondly, that good which commeth from God, not onely to the Prophet, but to all those who do serue him. <hi>Saluation is of the Lord.</hi> Among all which the word of sacrificing is first proposed vnto vs.</p>

               <hi>Thou shalt vvorship the Lord thy God, and him onely shalt thou serue.</hi> In this, because he hath made all, he doth require all, our selues and all ours, the bodie and the soule, the inward and the outward, the sensible and inuisible; although especially the heart and immateriall soule, yet ioyntly the hand, and action from without, yea and the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:623:150"/>
wealth also, that euery part may recommend a dutie to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour. And for these externall matters, he hath giuen vnto man not onely members, as in prayer his hands to be lifted vp, his breast to be beaten on, his knees to be bowed, his eyes to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed, that so compunction in the mind may the more be stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp; but also his other creatures, either dum or dead things, the fruites of the earth, the birds of the aire, the beasts of the field, the mettals of the ground, to be vsed to his glorie. And this in old time was done, in nothing more then in sacrifices, which was in some to consecrate and dedicate them vnto him, in some other to offer them in whole or in part consumed with fire, to testifie their obedience and seeking vnto him. Which manner of sacrificing was knowne vnto men from the first time of nature;<note place="margin">Genes. 4.3.</note> as good Abel and bad Cain, the first heires of the world, presented an oblation of such things as they had, to him who had sent them.<note place="margin">Cap. 8.21.</note> Noe after the floud offered a sweet smelling sauour, and Abraham by commaundement, intended to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice his onely sonne Isaac.<note place="margin">Cap. 22.1.</note> By all which it is euident, that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing was common, before that any order for Gods seruice was settled.</p>
            <p n="4">4 But when the people once were returned out of Egypt, and God by the hand of Moses had ordained a ciuill pollicie, for the gouernment of the laitie, and a Hierarchie Ecclesiasticall (for so I may well call it) for guiding of his Clergie, to the end that euery thing afterward might be practised with conformity, he appointed first for the Tabernacle, and after that for the Temple, a tribe of Priests &amp; Leuites, whose office was to attend to the offerings of the people. And himselfe did name the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and manner of euery sacrifice, what bird, or beast, daily, or on other occasion should be offered, as the whole body of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiticall law doth make knowne to vs. Thence grew the daily sacrifice, which neuer was omitted; the sinne-offerings, and free-will-offerings, and many sorts besides: and when extra-ordinarie cause was giuen, great store of beastes were slaine; as when Salomon to consecrate the Temple at Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, did offer in his magnificence, two and twentie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Oxen,<note place="margin">1. Reg. 8.63.</note> and one hundred and twentie thousand
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:623:151"/>
sheepe, such a sacrifice as I thinke the like was neuer seene. And that time onely excepted, when the Iewes were captiues in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, or when Antiochus did tyrannize at his pleasure, the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars were still going, till the very time of Christ, and diuerse yeares afterward, vntill that the citie and the Temple were brought to desolation by the Romanes vnder Titus: the Priests and people so precisely obseruing that, (when other sinnes, and dishonours to God did abound) that in the time of warre and close siege,<note place="margin">Ioseph. Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit. 143. &amp; 8.</note> when they might not issue foorth to haue cattell for their offerings, they would bargaine with the enemies, at high price and great rates, to serue the turne for their mony, as we may reade in Iosephus. In such manner was the succession of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing, for so many yeares together; God both approouing it and commaunding it.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Now these externall sacrifices, as when they were rightly brought with true faith and obedience, and vnderstanding knowledge, they had their vse very good, as to thanke God for his blessings, to acknowledge that all benefits were deriued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his goodnesse, to testifie their obedience in perfourming his commaundements; but aboue all to figure Iesus Christ, the true Lambe, who was one day to be offered on the altar of the crosse to redeeme the sinnes of the faithfull, whereof in the meane time, their offerings were a signe and seale vnto them; so if they were brought by any, as perfunctorie things, formally and for a fashion, as hypocrites and worldlings did come with them, the Lord was so farre off from accepting them as his seruice, that he hated them and detested them. In the first chapter of Esay, God speaketh to them by his Prophet:<note place="margin">Isay. 1.11.</note> 
               <hi>What haue I to do with the multitude of your sacrifices, sayth the Lord? I am full of the burnt offerings of Rammes, and of the fat of fed beastes, and I desire not the bloud of bullockes,</hi>

               <hi>nor of lambes nor of goates. Bring no more oblations in vain, incense is an abominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto me, I cannot suffer your new moones.</hi> Which agreed with that of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon: <hi>The sacrifice of the vvicked,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prou 15.8.</note> 
               <hi>is abomination to the Lord.</hi> God then required in them, that besides the materiall gift, there should be a true mind to serue him; humilitie and liuely faith, which should expresse and shew it selfe, with charitie
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:623:151"/>
and good life; and a killing of the euill affections which were in them.<note place="margin">Micah. 6.6</note> To which purpose the Prophet Micah most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently doth speake, <hi>Wherewithall should I come before the Lord, or bow my selfe before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt-offerings, and vvith calues of a yeare old?

               <note place="margin">7</note>

            </p>
            <p n="6">6 Then it was the spirituall sacrifice, at which God chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did aime; the laying downe of their soules on the altar of his will, the killing of euill thoughts, the mortifying of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, the consecrating of themselues wholly vnto his honour; which doctrine Paule vnto the Romanes doth plainely teach, where he <hi>beseecheth them by the mercies of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 12.1.</note> 
               <hi>to offer vp their bodies a liuing sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, that is their reasonable seruice of God.</hi> And this not onely vnder the Gospell, was seene by the faithfull, but was foreseene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so vnder the Law. Dauid can say in his fourth Psalme, <hi>Offer the sacrifices of righteousnesse</hi>:<note place="margin">Psal. 4.5. Psal. 51.17. Ose. 6.6.</note> and in the one and fiftieth Psalme, <hi>The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit.</hi> So Osee in his sixt Chapter, <hi>I desired mercie and not sacrifice, and the knovvledge of God rather then any burnt-offerings.</hi> It seemeth also by my text, that our Prophet vnderstood this, when he promiseth to sacrifice, but with <hi>the voyce of thankesgiuing,</hi> as knowing that to be it, which God indeed preferred before all things. And reason might well teach him, that it was that which the Lord meant, by the externall signe; for what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light could he take in the bloud of brutish creatures, a spirit in their bodies, the impassible in such sauours as did arise from their altars? What neede had he of an Oxe, or ten Rammes of a man, who is the owner and chiefe Lord of all the beastes of the field, of all the birdes of the ayre? If hee but speake, they be, if he but call, they come: he made them, and he
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:623:152"/>
knoweth them, and hath no want at all of them. Then he res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth the mind, and the life, and not the offering. The veritie of which doctrine, is of so assured a truth, that Gentiles by the light of nature, beleeued it and acknowledged it, as aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Menander the Poet in one of his Comedies, as Clemens Alexandrinus noteth in the fifth of his Stromata,<note place="margin">Clemens A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandrinus, Stromat. l. 5.</note> where he ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his wordes to this purpose: <hi>If any man offering sacrifice, a multitude of goates or bulles, or any thing wrought by art, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though of yuorie, gold, or pearle, do thinke that God vvill ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be mercifull vnto him, he is deceiued exceedingly: for the man vvhom God regardeth, must be good and honest, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowrer of vvomen, no adulterer, thiefe, or murtherer.</hi> And afrerward againe: <hi>The iust man doth euery day offer sacrifice to his God, but it is not with cleane clothes, but vvith a shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning heart.</hi>

            <p n="7">7 These are good lessons for vs, who professe a seruice to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the highest God, that first we make no spare of externall things, to honour the Lord withall, when cause shall be offered. Our cattell and our clothes, our houses and our money, yea our best and dearest friends, should be employed in good seruices, to the countenancing of the Minister, to the spredding of the Gospell, to the establishing of religion, to the succouring of the innocent, to the releeuing of the poore. These things should be to vs, as their substance was to the Iewes, to bring it in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to the Highest, but especially we should consecrate our bodies to his name, our feete to approch his Courts, our eares to heare his word, our toung to sound out his praises, our hands to fight his battels, if Antichrist should oppugne.

And when our soule shall be deuoted to him in that sort, he receiueth it, &amp; embraceth it most kindly as his own, more respecting the mind,<note place="margin">Mark. 12.41.</note> then any apparant thing. The two mites of the poore widow, came welcom into Gods treasurie, because

her heart was rich, though her purse were very empty. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of Aeschines, that when he saw his fellow scholers, giue great gifts to his maister Socrates,<note place="margin">Se nec de Beneficijs. lib. 1.</note> he being poore, and hauing nothing else to bestow, did giue himselfe to Socrates, as profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to be his in heart and good will, and wholly at his deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And the Philosopher tooke this most kindly, esteeming it aboue all other presents, and returned him loue accordingly. The gracious disposition of our eternall father, taketh in farre better part, then any man can take it, the laying downe of our soules, and prostrating of our selues to the fulfilling of his will.

It is a fault in our dayes, that parents are not carefull to instill into their children, the remembrance of such things as they haue read, or knowne to come obseruably from the Almighty.

They should discharge a good conscience, by acknowledging of their hope, &amp; peraduenture they might by the blessing of the Lord, draw on other which were backward before: for the hart of him who heareth, is not in the power of himselfe, but God doth rule &amp; guide it, &amp; the meanes whereby he worketh is the hearing of good things.

            <p n="12">12 The making of vowes, was a solemne custome among the children of Israel, that when any good thing was graunted vnto them, but especially if they earnestly desired to haue any thing, they would bind themselues by promise, or peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by an oath to be kept without violating, that this they would performe, or that they would abstaine from, as it might be,<note place="margin">Num. 6.2.</note> drinke no wine, or not cut their haire, as the vse of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarites was, or dedicate their children to an attendance in Gods tabernacle, or offer such and such offerings. Wherein the care of those who were faithfull, was first that they vowed nothing but that which was lawfull, and secondly that they performed the thing which they vowed.<note place="margin">Numer. 21.2.</note> So the Israelites did vow, that if the Lord would giue them victory, they would raze downe and destroy the cities of Canaan.

They knew that God did expect it, &amp; precisely had enioyned it by a speciall law. It is a peremptory place, in the three and twentieth of Deuteronomy,<note place="margin">Deuter. 23.21</note>

            <p n="13">
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:623:155"/>13 This made men vnder the law, to be very well aduised, what it was whereunto they tied themselues by vow, that what they vndertooke should still be to Gods glory: and withall their promise was for such things, as should be in their power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, if the Lord did continue his ordinary blessings ouer them: And these were rather praises &amp; thanksgiuings to the Almighty, (indeed perhaps in the open Temple, or great publike congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation) then any materiall gifts, although those also were not wanting.<note place="margin">Psal. 56.12. &amp; 57.7.8.</note> Dauids Psalmes do make that plaine; for wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he speaketh of vowes, there commonly he ioyneth praises to them: and in my text, thanksgiuing and vowes, are coupled together by Ionas, as noting that the one hath a reference to the other. And I doubt not but we may make such vowes in sobriety, in knowledge and in faith, to bind our selues to God, and seale it as with a couenant, that we will serue his Maiesty, while we liue here in this world; that we will giue among pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane persons, a good testification of his honour; that we will sing Psalmes vnto him; that we will teach our children religion and true faith: yea further in particular, that if God would giue vs leaue, we which be of the ministery, will looke carefully to our charge, and will be diligent in the word: if the Lord send no great let, will preach at least euery Sabaoth; or if we haue not that strength, once or twise in a moneth: which taske if we do inioyne our selues, and vse the ordinary meanes of reading and of study, and pray to God to assist vs, his Spirit will ayde vs more, then we euer did imagine. Then we do not vtterly deny vowes; but we willingly allow whatsoeuer is iustifiable by the prescript of the Law and the Gospell. But because many kinds of men make question in this matter, the Papists for their vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, other men for other causes, I thinke it not amisse to limit this whole doctrine, by some Aphorismes or Positions, which shall cleere the whole controuersie.</p>
            <p n="14">14 Then the first rule maybe this: We in no case may vow euill things, that is, such as are contrary to piety toward God, or charity toward men. For these are sinfull vowes, and ought not to be made; in as much as it beseemeth vs not, to bind two sinnes together: but an euill deed is the one, and swearing
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:623:156"/>
to performe it,<note place="margin">Act. 23.12.</note> is no lesse then another. Hence we condemne the act of them, who being angry with Paule, did bind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with an oath, that they would neither eate nor drinke, till they had murthered Paule. A most malicious, and vngodly, and vncharitable promise: and yet there were more then forty of them, who had combined themselues together in that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse. And as it is a sinne to make entrance into such an action, by speaking it or swearing it, so it is a greater sinne to performe it being sworne. Saint Bernard hath a good saying to this purpose:<note place="margin">Bernard. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistol. 219. <hi>Quamuis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo sapie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitet illicita iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramenta non esse tenenda.</hi> Matth. 14.7.</note> 
               <hi>Among the French men it is accompted a reproch to breake an oath, although it be sworne euidently amisse: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though no wise ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth doubt that vnlawfull oathes are not to be kept.</hi> Within this compasse such rash vowes do come, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre some euident euill, although when they were made, no such thing was intended. Of which nature that oath was, which He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode did take, when being delighted with the dauncing of the daughter of Herodias, he swore that he would giue her whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer she should aske, to the one halfe of his kingdom. A hastie &amp; fond promise, as appeared by the demaund made thereupon, for the head of Iohn the Baptist; which he would neuer haue graunted, if he had not purposed to go on in his iniquitie and tye two faults together. For as Origene saith disputing vpon that deede,<note place="margin">Origen. in Matth. 14. <hi>Quod peieran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum erat po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiùs quam ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uandum.</hi> Iudic. 11.30.</note> 
               <hi>The head of Iohn the Baptist vvas cut off for an oathes sake, vvhich vvas rather to be broken by forswearing then to be kept. For it vvas not so great a fault to haue made an oath hastily, as it vvas for a hastie oath to be the death of a Prophet.</hi> The vow which Iephthe made, to sacrifice whatsoeuer liuing thing he first met, at his returne from his victorie, is by this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition found to be made without iudgement: but his fault was the more grieuous, that he obserued it so precisely, as to destroy his daughter. Take heede of vowing euill things directly or by a consequent.</p>
            <p n="15">15 The second rule is this: that there be many good things, which all of vs ought to vow, and earnestly keepe, because they touch the glorie of God immediatly, by a duetie vnauoydable; as that we will serue him truly, and euermore accompt him that mightie one which is to be honoured. Such
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:623:156"/>
was that vow of Iacob,<note place="margin">Gens. 28.20.</note> of which Moses reporteth thus: <hi>Then Iacob vowed a vovv saying, If God vvill be vvith me, and vvill keepe me in this iourney vvhich I go, and vvill giue me bread to eate, and clothes to put on: so that I come againe vnto my fathers house in safety, then shall the Lord be my God.</hi> The couenant of the Israelites is also of this kind,<note place="margin">Iosuah. 24.25.</note> where by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of good Iosuah, they do promise solemnely to put away their idols, and to serue the true God onely. So is that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise also,<note place="margin">2. Chron. 15.14.</note> of the people of Iuda vnder king Asa, where both great and small, do enter an oath to serue Iehouah alone, the true God of all the world. Among vs who are Christians, the celebration of Baptisme doth include as much in it selfe, to which whosoeuer commeth (as all of vs should come) doth bind himselfe by a vow, to renounce the pompes and vanities of this spotted filthy world, and manfully to fight against the flesh and the diuell. How much do they forget this, whose whole delight is vanitie, and idlenesse, and security, aiming at nothing more, then at voluptuous pleasure? Now when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny goeth about to breake such a vow as this, he maketh a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration betweene God and his soule, and as farre as is in him, doth diuorce himselfe from the spouse and husband of all the faithfull. Do thou make these vowes aduisedly, and pray earnestly to God, that being made thou mayest keepe them.</p>
            <p n="16">16 The third rule may be this: some things there be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, neither in themselues good nor euill, which if a man do vse, they make him not the better, and if he do refuse them, yet is he not the worse. If occasion should be offered, in deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion toward God, or in charity towards men, to promise to do such, or to abstaine from the custome of them, I doubt not but we may vow. But in these we must put some limiting cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, as first that it be apparantly for good and not for euill: Secondly that we vndertake that action with great iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not rashly nor vnaduisedly, but vpon iust occasion: Thirdly that we put no kind of superstition therein, as ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that our deede should bee meritorious with God: Fourthly that we be assured that it is in our power to do it: in
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:623:157"/>
which respect that condition is also to be put, if God will, or if the Lord do not hinder vs. Within this kind I find the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of the Rechabites,<note place="margin">Ierem. 35.6.</note> who were bound by their fathers charge (and as it seemeth they assented thereunto) that they would neither drinke wine, nor sowe seede, nor plant vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeard, nor dwell in any house, but onely remaine in tents; that so they might the better remember themselues to be strangers in the land where they inhabited; and of likelihood moreouer, that they were but pilgrimes vpon the earth. And he who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth such vowes, vnder these fore-named conditions, is now bound to obserue them, For although at the first, and in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues they were things indifferent, yet now they are become otherwise, because an oath is passed vpon them. He who was free is made bound by a voluntary offering, and therefore hath lost his liberty. Then these three positions may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> thus in briefe. Euill things ought not to vowed at all: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> if they be rashly spoken, yet they should not be kept. Some good things we must vow, as especially those in Baptisme, and when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> we haue vowed, we must performe them. Other matters which are indifferent, may be vowed or not be vowed, as I haue she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed aboue by circumstances, but being once vndertaken, they are not to be broken.</p>
            <p n="17">17 Here the pretences of Popish votaries, may be in a word examined. Their common vowes are of such things, as be not absolutely euill; neither are they of such matters as being simply good, do lye vpon vs by a duty of necessity, but they may much rather be accounted indifferent, although by their vsage of them they make them to be otherwise; they make them to be wicked. A great part of their vowes, is the going to places farre distant, in pilgrimage as they call it, to Rome, or to Hierusalem, or Saint Iames of Compostella, or to the three kings of Coleyn: their keeping of the great Iubilees; their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining from all flesh, and feeding rather on fish, as their Carthusian Monkes do: their wearing of a haire-cloth or sack-cloth next their bodie, and other things of like stampe. All which as they do vse them, may well be accounted in the number of those wil-worships,<note place="margin">Colos. 2.23.</note> that <gap reason="foreign">

They do faile in diuerse circumstances, which should make their vowes to be lawfull, as first they cannot be warranted to them as as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly holy, by faith which is grounded vpon the word of God. Secondly they put a great deale of superstition in them, while they account them meritorious. Thirdly they tye them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues rather to the externall thing, then to a sound reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and bettering of the minde. It were better therefore, that such vowes were omitted then made by them. Their vow of wilfull pouertie, is a thing of their owne deuising.

               </gap>o serue the Lord in the abundance of their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and did not thinke, that religion onelie was in them who begged. And although our Sauiour Christ and other of his Apostles, had little of their owne, yet they left vs no such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, nay they rather did teach the contrary, saying <hi>that it is more blessed to giue then to receiue.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 20.35.</note> And it is sayd that a Bishop (of whom it is presumed that he should be a man of religion) should be hospitall,<note place="margin">Tit. 1.8.</note> that is an entertainer of strangers, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth a set kind of maintenance. When the Gospell was first preached, miraculous meanes were vsed to bring men to the faith; and this was one, that God could mightily prouide for those, who were the messengers of his will, and releeue them from day to day, although they had nothing of their owne. His purpose also was to shew his power, that by meanes most contemptible in the eye of the world, he could settle his kingdome: and withall he would leaue their wants as an example, to encourage his children in succeeding ages, that they should not be dismayed, if sometimes they were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to penurie and necessitie, since his deare seruants and his sonne were in that case before them. But these times now are past, and miracles are ceased, and such extraordinary feeding as the Apostles had, is not wilfully to be sought, lest we tempt God, and liue without a lawfull calling. The Church now hath an established gouernement, and therein the Ministers which are needefull, are to be prouided for. And the word
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:623:158"/>
hath inioyned this,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.11.</note> that where spirituall things are sowed, there temporall should be reaped: as knowing that in the end of the world mens charity would waxe cold, and they who liued of almes, oftentimes should haue hungrie bellies. The liuing then of their Friers in a voluntary beggery, is a worship of their owne, and he who voweth therunto, doth vow to that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his conscience can neuer haue good warrant.</p>
            <p n="18">18 They stand as much vpon chastity, that their religions men should vow a single life; wherein although I might shew by good proofe from the Scripture, and from the auncient Church, that Bishops and Priests did marry, yet omitting that, I will rather speake of the qualitie of their vow. Virginity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controuersie is an excellent gift, in him to whom the Lord doth giue it. Christ himselfe was borne of a virgin, and did leade a virgins life,<note place="margin">Matth. 19.12. 1. Cor. 7.32.</note> and both he and Saint Paule, haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended it vnto vs, that we ought to striue for it. But who is he that so farre hath power of his owne flesh, as that before hand he can sweare, to quench the lust of concupiscence, so that it shall not burne? I suppose that no man on earth, who is in his strong age, and in good health of his body can promise that to himselfe: then how much lesse their young ones, their Nouices or Nunnes of lesser age, who before the time that themselues come to experience, are put into the monasta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, by their parents or their friends, or are inueigled by others to take their rules vpon them: which hath bene a great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of much vile fornication, and the killing of many infants, besides the enduring of such vntamed affections, as haue boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in their bodies. It is a good lesson of Salomon, that we <hi>should not suffer our mouth to make our flesh to sinne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles. 55.3.</note> he meaneth in vowing that which is not in our power. He had commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded before, that we should pay our vowes, intending it in those things which we haue promised to the Lord: but lest thereby we should take occasion, to promise any thing whatsoeuer, he giueth a restraint downe with it, that we should be aduised, that we vow not that, which our flesh afterward cannot make good. For want of this wholesome caueat, they were put to much extremitie, who were votaries first in monasteries, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:623:158"/>
by the true light of the Gospell, did shake off the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie yoke of Antichrist, and became great setters out of Gods truth in this last age. They had entred a rash vow, in their minoritie and young yeares, which afterward they found themselues not able to performe, and therefore they did marry.<note place="margin">Campian. in Ratione. 3.2.</note> Against which although our Campian and his fellowes, do with open mouth most bitterly inueigh, yet they neuer can be able by sound truth to condemne them. Their choyse was hard, that either their vow must be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by them, or else they must beare about a dayly sinne in their bodies. They aduentured on the lesser fault, I doubt not but asking pardon, for the rash and vnaduised oath which they had taken. And God doth forgiue vs such things, when we call to him by repentance, as may very well be gathered from the fifth Chapter of Leuiticus,<note place="margin">Leuit. 5.4.6.</note> where was appointed an offering, as a kind of satisfaction, for him who had vowed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, which he afterward doth find out not to be in his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wor to accomplish. Charitie doth bid me thinke, that those fathers in the Gospell, and excellent men in the faith, did enter into wedlocke, with all labour to satisfie a good conscience towards God. And therein their owne hearts, might be the best witnesse and direction to themselues. Yet the person who hath so vowed, and in so doing hath not done well, let him feare to breake that vow causelesse, by a licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious libertie: and if God do giue the gift of chastitie, let him liue in continency if he can, as otherwise for the honour giuen to virginitie in the Scripture, so for his vowes sake also. And so much I thought good to teach concerning vowes, by occasion of the words of the Prophet Ionas; wherein if I haue bene ouer-long, let this excuse the matter, that this doctrine is few times handled, and now the text did minister opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.

Now if he should bring him to libertie, out of bondage and desolation, and should pardon his sinne and transgression, he had great reason to magnifie his mercie and goodnesse ouer him.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not without cause, that so oftentimes in the Scriptures, God is compared to a father, and called by that name, as <hi>Our father vvhich art in heauen</hi>;<note place="margin">Matth. 6.9.

               <hi>as a father hath compassion on his children, so hath the Lord compassion on them that feare him</hi>: for he bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a verie father-like and naturall affection, to all those who are chosen to be his. If they be led by weakenesse into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse temptations, or by infirmity of their flesh be stained with great transgressions, he looketh angrily for a time, and with a terrible countenance seuerely frowneth on them; but yet in the middle of his iustice, he remembreth mercy, and doth not vtterly reiect them, nor cast them away. It may be that he doth chastise them, with parent-like correction, according to the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:623:160"/>
measure and qualitie of their crime; yea he layeth smart blowes on them, not sparing to strike them, till he hath brought them, and depressed them to the pit of death, and entrance of the graue; but there he maketh a stay, in his kindnesse being satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with iudgement,<note place="margin">Ierem. 10.24.</note> not with furie, rather topping them and shredding them with some short aduersitie, then plucking them vp by the root.

            <p n="2">2 The righteous Lord of all, doth so looke here vpon our Prophet with a fauourable eye. He had deprehended him long since, as a runne-agate from his charge: he made his owne mouth giue sentence, that he had deserued to be drowned: he had throwne him into the water, where as if it had bene, with a death vpon a death, he had made a fish to deuoure him, and for three dayes space to keepe him close prisoner in his belly, in all the anguish and torment that his heart could imagine. He was as though he liued not, and yet he could not dye; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing time enough to meditate in what miserie he was, but not knowing with all the wit which was in his vnderstanding, how to ridde himselfe from that sorrow. But at the last, lifting vp his thoughts to his Almightie maker, he flyeth by faith and repentance, to the throne of grace, desiring God to pitie him, and shew compassion on him, that once more returning to land, he might by open obedience, make some little recompence for his former fault. And the Lord graciously respecting his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and heartie prayer, doth content himselfe with the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment past, and with a most free fauour restoreth him to liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. As a dead man from the graue, as one buried from the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher, so is this man brought foorth: his prison-doores shall be opened: his fetters shall be shaken off; he shall be ridde from the whale, and set on foote on the land: yea as he was a messenger before, so hee shall be a messenger still, a Prophet for the Highest, to goe and preach at Niniue.

And as he there vsed that fish for his instrument, so he might haue had obsequious to him any other thing in heauen, or in the earth, or in the sea: and as he might at that time, so might he at all times. That vnrestrained prerogatiue in God, is once more expressed to vs in the selfe same fish, whom after that he had caused to keepe his burthen in him, for so many dayes &amp; houres and moments of time, as himselfe had appointed, now he will haue him in a trice disburden his belly, and be eased of his cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.

Of all liklyhood this was a chosen shore, where the water was so deepe, as that it could beare the whale, who swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not in the shallow; and yet the banke withall so low, as that with putting vp his head, he might cast the prisoner to the land. When the Lord doth decree the substance of a matter, the circumstance shall not be wanting. He who made all the rest, will find a place for accomplishing of the deede. It is not much materiall, where or in what coast of the world the Prophet was cast on land,<note place="margin">Ioseph.

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:623:163"/>
it was that part of the Ocean, where he was put to shore. If it were so, then the whale did carie him a great way, from the sea towards Cilicia on the south side of Natolia, or Asia the lesser, through the Hellespont, and Propontis, &amp; all the straights neare to Thrasia, and so into that Pontus Euxinus, which was a long space of way, in so short a time to be passed. But if this were so done, then the fish was as a shippe, as the fleetest and swiftest shippe, to conuey him forward on the way; that whereas to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Niniue the place whither he should go, the coast was East, he was brought backe againe to the East, on the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of Natolia, so much being recouered by the fish, as he was caried by the ship before toward the West. But this is onely coniecturall, and therefore I do not follow it.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Thus farre the Spirit of God hath plainly said, that Ionas is gotten to the land: he is freed from the terrour and imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whale, and now he is so set at libertie, as if there had neuer bene any such matter. Which whether we will in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure apply to Christ, or by example to our selues, it is worthie consideration. Our Sauiour who is the best interpreter, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positor of the Prophets, in the twelfth of Saint Mathew, doth compare this lying of Ionas for three dayes in the whale,<note place="margin">Math. 12.40</note> to the burying of himselfe for three dayes in the graue. Then by the same Analogie or proportion, the restoring of Ionas from the belly of the fish, must represent Christs resurrection.

For when the stomake of any liuing thing, hath receiued that, which either for the weaknesse of it selfe, or by reason of the strength of the meat, it hath no power to digest, it doth cast it vp and vomite. The hardnesse for digestion, of that which is the ingredient, or the weaknesse of the part, receiuing more then it ought, doth cause that euacuation.

The Lord would not be satisfied, but with drowning and deuouring, in the belly of such a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, where the feare of death, and almost the paines of hell were vpon him. The passions of his heart had bene desperate and distrustfull, if faith had not come to the rescue. Yet we see that he did not perish, but when his woe was passed ouer him, he came to good againe.

            </q>
            <p n="11">11 Looke what hath bene spoken hitherto, may manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be gathered by the plaine words of my text, and therefore as you haue seene, I haue passed it very briefly. But pondering farther on this Scripture, and looking nearer into it, yea withall, comparing it with some things of the Gentiles, it seemeth vnto me to offer a farther doctrine. For thinking with my selfe, how strangely those mariners, who in the Chapter before threw him into the sea, and made account they had drowned him, would looke vpon him, if they met him any where after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, (as that was no impossible matter) maruelling how he should liue whom they left in the sea, and how he should be at land whom they cast into the water, and there relinquished him remedilesse and past hope; I called to mind the narration of Arion in Herodotus,<note place="margin">Herodot. l. 1.</note> who being said to be throwne into the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean by mariners, and supposed by them to be drowned, was afterward seene at Corinth, in the court of Periander, to the great amazement of them, who before had consented to his death. And I thought of this the rather, because Saint Austen in his first booke,<note place="margin">August. de ciuit. Dei. lib. 1.14.</note> 
               <hi>De ciuitate Dei,</hi> doth compare this storie of Ionas, vnto that of Arion, reproching the Gentiles, that whereas they would not beleeue this, which was written of our Prophet, yet they would giue credite to that, which their Poets and other writers reported of Arion. Whereupon conferring yet farther the likenesse of these two matters, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not in euery circumstance, yet in the mainest points, I could not but suspect, that the Greeke tale of the one, meant the Hebrew truth of the other. And therein I imagined, that the Musitian of the Gentiles, was the Israelite mentioned
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:623:165"/>
here, although the storie were peeced vp with another narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after the custome of the Heathens, in dealing with the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. And moreouer,<note place="margin">Danaeus in Ionam.</note> the note of a learned interpreter wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vpon this place, did further this opinion, who nameth our Ionas here <hi>Arion Christianus,</hi> the Arion of the Christians. I find also, that this report is very auncient among the Greekes, and therefore might well sort with the antiquitie of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. Now, as if we will allow this to be true, it doth yeeld vs fruitfull doctrine, fit to be handled in this place, before so lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and iudicious an auditorie; so being otherwise, that is, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true and false, it is also worthie of our consideration: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore giue me leaue to speake a little vnto it.

               </note> hath a narration to this purpose: that Arion a skilfull harper, going from Greece his owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey into Italy, there and in Sicilia, by the excellencie of his mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, had gained a great deale of money. Being now desirous with his wealth to returne againe to Corinth, to his old Prince Periander, he found a vessell at Tarentum, which belonged to certaine ship-men of Corinth, who were returning home: and with them he agreeth for his fare. When they had him at sea, being men of ill conditions, and desirous of his money, they intended to drowne him. He now in this perill, maketh request for his life: but when nothing would serue those hard-hearted persons, but that such must be his doome, he begged this fauour of them, that yet before he died, he might cloth himselfe with his best clothes: which being done, he taketh his harpe, and singing and playing to it a most melodious song, then threw himselfe into the sea. There a Dolphin a kind of fish, delighted as it seemeth with the musicke, doth vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take him, and ceassed not to beare him on her backe, till it lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him safe at Taenarus; whence he going to Periander the tyrant, then raigning at Corinth, so apparelled as he was when he came out of the water, informeth him of all the matter, who beleeued it not, till at length sending for the selfe same ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, who were arriued in his countrey, and shewing them Arion (who vpon the sight of him were exceedingly amazed,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:623:166"/>
as indeed they had great cause) he learned that all was so. This<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> saith Herodotus is reported at Lesbos, and at Corinth; and at Taenarus there is a very great image made of brasse, which is a man sitting on a Dolphin: and that image was set vp there by Arion.<note place="margin">Plin.

            <p n="13">13 If I shall giue my iudgement concerning this, I do not at all doubt, but that it is a fable. The diuersitie of the report which is among the auncient, doth argue the vncertaintie. For although the most record it to be one Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phines doing,<note place="margin">Plutarch. v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi suprà.</note> one that caried him all the while, yet Plutarke hath it otherwise, that they were diuerse Dolphines which caried him in the sea, meaning belike by turnes, or many at once supporting him. So they agree not in the manner. But whether it were one or many, why did not the mariners see it, that it was so straunge a thing vnto them, when they met him on the land? If he went aboue the water, they of likelyhood might haue spied him, and so made some shift to vnhorse him: if it were vnder the water, how came it about that he was not drowned in all that time? The auncient full well saw, that this was but a fained thing. That made Suidas in Arion,<note place="margin">Suidas in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rione.</note> to say nothing of the fish, nor his escape from drowning: although he haue other things of him. Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo in his thirteenth booke, saith plainely it is a fable. The late writers thinke no otherwise,<note place="margin">Strabo Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph. 13. Natal. Com. Mytholog. lib. 8.14.</note> and hold these tales of Plinie to be but fained matters: and they giue this reason for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the nature of Dolphines, and of all other fishes, as also of all other creatures, is the same in our dayes, which it was in ages long agone: but since those auncient times, we heare not of any Dolphine, which delighted in Musicke, or saued any man in the sea, or caried any ouer the water. Besides that, Rondeletius whose worke is many times ioyned with Gesners,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:623:166"/>
denieth that a Dolphine hath any such sinnes,<note place="margin">Rondelet. in Gesner. de Aquatil. cap. de Delphino Plin. 9.8.</note> as they in old time did describe him to haue, for that, saith he, there is onely one in his backe, and it is not all along him, which may be thought vnfit to beare a man. But imagine that it were true which Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie hath concerning them, yet his speech is, that they were brought to that custome by much practise, and feeding them with bread,<note place="margin">Petr.

But how could this acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with men, and feeding by hand, happen to this fish of Arion, who was found at al-aduenture, in the midst of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterrane sea?</p>
            <p n="14">14 Neither doth the report at Lesbos any whit confirme this tale. For who knoweth not that euery countrie, hath straunge reports of it selfe, which by the common sort are repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for great truths? If we looke on our owne land, how many things haue bene said of King Arthure, and of the Prophet Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, who although they may haue in them some ground of truth (which I will not stand to dispute) yet questionlesse much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie is mixed there withall.

So the song which is now extant, and said to be Arions, is as weake a proofe as any; for why might not another man, beleeuing the tale to be true, put it out in his name? Yea peraduenture if hee did not beleeue it, as in Poets we haue many speeches fayned on other mens persons. Then we may gather, that either the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is altogether fabulous, or if he were so throwne by any into the water, that another shippe intercepted him, the badge whereof was a Dolphin (as in the Actes of the Apostles,<note place="margin">Act. 28.11.</note> the badge of that shippe wherein Paule sayled, was Castor and Pollux.<note place="margin">Natal.

This is the fraude of him, who is the fountaine and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring, and chiefe Lord of all deceipt. And as on the one side, by his vndertaking of such actions, or semblances rather, his great vaine-glorie doth appeare, and that the meanes whereby he seeketh it, is the imitation of God: so, on the other side, it is a great argument for the truth, against all Epicures, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists, conuincing that in the bookes of the Bible, there is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and most vndoubted veritie. For as counterfeits do euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more presuppose, that there be some such indeed, as whom they take on them to resemble, (as he who made shew to be the sonne of Herod the Great,<note place="margin">Ioseph. Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit. 17.14.</note> did argue that there had bene such a one, who was in truth called Alexander: and in England in the dayes of King Henry the seuenth, Perkin Warbecke, who pretended to be the Prince Edward the fifth,<note place="margin">Holinshed in Henrico sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timo.</note> did manifestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that there had bene one of that name.) And as the coyners of false money, do imply by their attempt, that some of that
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:623:168"/>
stampe, is good and currant in one place or other. And as Alchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistes who do labour to make gold by proiection, do intend that there is naturall gold. Yea as painters howsoeuer they may somtimes make pictures of fained deuises, yet account their art to be a resemblance of that, which verily is, or hath bene: So the manifold and laborious affected imitation, of the sacred stories, and such things as were done in them, doth giue the wise and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly soule fully to vnderstand, that the patterne which is so follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, and curiously shadowed by so many inuentions, is a matter of truth, of iustifiable verity, and absolutely without exception. But I vrge not this any farther.</p>
            <p n="17">17 In the second place, if we will take the whole tale of Arion for an vntruth, which it much rather doth deserue, it doth remember vs of as fruitfull instruction another way. And that is the wonderfull suttlety of Satan, to discredit the writings of the Scriptures, as farre as lyeth in him. For when it should be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ouer any part of the world, that such or such a thing was done, which was true in our Prophet, if he might be able to bring another matter, like to it in resemblance, which yet in truth should be but fabulous, the first might be disgraced with the common sort of men,<note place="margin">Quintil. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. Instit. lib. 4.6.</note> in comparing it with the second. Quinti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian in his sixth booke of the Principles of Rhetoricke, going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to teach how one false thing, may be displaied and discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with another, bringeth this for an example: When one Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoriatus had sayd, that in Sicily he had bought a Lamprey, which was fiue foote long, another called Galba did make him answer, that it was no maruell, for in that countrey saith he, the breed of them is commonly so large, that fishermen do vse them for the lines of their angles. Here if any man had inferred, that the latter tale was certainly a lye, Galba by and by would haue replied, so also is the other. The old and crafty serpent, saw this to be a good way, to bring the Scripture in doubt, by fables like to the Scripture. And this doth Iustinus Martyr assigne to be the reason, why so many things in the old tales, are like to the truths of the word of God. He principally insisteth in the person of Christ Iesus himselfe.<note place="margin">Iustin. Mar. Apolog. 2.</note> 
               <hi>The diuels</hi> sayth he <hi>being taught by the Oracles of the Prophets, many things concerning Christ vvho

was to come, caused like things to be spread touching diuerse sonnes of Iupiter, hoping that those who heard those monstrous trifles, would beleeue no more of Christ, then they did of the other.</hi> For an example he citeth that of Aesculapius, who by the Heathen was reported, to be able to cure any defect, and was held to be the sonne of God: which was drawne from hence, because it was fore-prophecied of Iesus,<note place="margin">Isay. 42.7.</note> that his power should be such, as to giue sight to the blind, to restore limmes to the lame, to raise vp those which were dead. He reputeth this to be the worke of Satan, that men might no more beleeue the true reports of our Sauiour, then the fained things of the other.</p>

The deluge in Noahs time, is quitted among the Greekes with the deluge of Deucalion. If Noah did see things before and after the floud, they will haue Ianus for him, who shall be double-faced, and looke forward and backward, for the learned do suppose that Noah was meant by their Ianus.

Iustine Martyr who is auncient, sayth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly that all the tale of the Giants piling vp those hils, was in imitation of the story of the tower of Babel. If Lots wife for her fault be turned into a salt-stone, their Niobe for her fault, shall be turned to a stone likewise. If there be a Sampson of the Israelites exceeding for his strength, there is a Hercules among the Gentiles, who shall do as much as he. If there be hell for the damned, and heauen for those that be blessed, Virgil will haue

But if all of them should be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, as Virgil was for his labour, they would gaine little by the bargaine; for as he had hell from vs, so the Papists to be quit with him, haue Purgatory from him. And if in our Prophet here, there be any thing worth the looking on, both Satan and his Poets will not be behind hand with him. If he be in the whale for three dayes and three nights,<note place="margin">Natales Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes Mytho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiae. 8.3.</note> their Hercules shall be also for three dayes in a whale.

            <p n="19">19 This is the deadly fraud of the enemy of our soule,<note place="margin">Tertul. in Apolog. 22.</note> who in suggesting lyes for truth, by himselfe and his instruments, would defame the word of God. For he himselfe being a suttle spirit, and euery where at hand, knew the Scriptures well inough: where they lay he did reade them: where they were read, he could heare them: he knew them well inough, when he cited the text to Christ:<note place="margin">Matth. 4.6.</note> and he brought many of his agents and ministers in place, where they might heare what the Iewes receiued,<note place="margin">Exod. 1.1.</note> for the grounds of their religion. The Israelites were once in bondage vnder Pharao in Egypt, and afterward they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not farre from that countrey, Palestina being a neare bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, so that the Egyptians by a neighbourly conuersation with them, did well know the manners of the Israelites: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward by the intercession of king Ptolomee,<note place="margin">Ioseph. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquit. 1.1.</note> the bookes of their lawes, were by the Septuagint translated into Greeke, and by that meanes were well knowne in Egypt. And whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but into Egypt, did the great scholers of old time, trauell to increase their learning?<note place="margin">Diodor. Sic. Antiquit. 1.</note> I find in Diodorus Siculus, that the priests of the Egyptians had it in record, that Orpheus and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saeus, and Homer, and Lycurgus, and Plato, and Democritus were there,<note place="margin">Augustin. de doctr.

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:623:170"/>
that opinion. For indeede Plato was after Ieremy. As it was with the Egyptians,<note place="margin">Ierem. 52.7.</note> so it was with the Chaldeans. The Iewes in their Babylonish captiuity were in Chaldea, whereby they also of that nation, did heare of much in the Scripture. But the Chaldees as men studious of learning, did trauell often into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther countries,<note place="margin">Tullius de Diuinat. lib. 2.</note> yea it seemeth as farre as Rome, by Tullies second booke de Diuinatione, where he nameth their figure-casters, by no name so much as Chaldees.

Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that shall be reported, to be deriued from the Gentilels to the Iewes, which cleane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwise came from the Iewes to the Gentiles.<note place="margin">Plutarch.

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:623:170"/>
in truth the solemnities of Bacchus rather came from the other, being is no comparison so auncient, as those which were vnder Moses. Some other times, like must go for like; but a lye for a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> true story, shall be broched to the world, as this which I haue handled, Arion for our Ionas. Sathan thought that the story re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of him, was a very great miracle, and wrought the Lord much honour, and therefore he enuied it. And besides that, it had a reference to Christ who was afterward to come, and was to giue him a crush, and therefore he thought it a point which was very well worth his labour, to disgrace it if he could. If there had bene any foregoing prophecy of this matter, we should haue had a tricke before hand for our Ionas, as he made Iupiter ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sonnes and daughters too for failing,<note place="margin">Isay. 9.6.</note> vpon the words of Esay, that the Lord would send a child who should be the mighty God. But it was not spoke of before, vntill the deed were done; therefore he thought not of it; and therefore it must come after. And in the dayes of the Prophet, while himselfe liued, it had bene too grosse to speake it, therefore he will stay one age, or two ages at the most, before that he publish his fable. For Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas liued a good time before the captiuity of Babylon, either in, or sooner then the dayes of the latter Ieroboam:<note place="margin">2. Reg. 14.25.</note> and Arion as it seemeth, liued in the time of the captiuity: for as we reade in Herodotus,<note place="margin">Herodot. lib. 1.</note> he liued with Periander, who liued with Halyattes, who was father vnto Craesus, who was conquered by Cyrus, who gaue out the first proclamation,<note place="margin">Ezra. 1.1.</note> for restoring the Iewes from Babylon.</p>
            <p n="21">21 Thus not a misse as I suppose (especially in an audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of such learning and iudgement as this is) by comparing our Prophet here, with that fable of the Gentiles, I haue shewed the apish quality of Satan, in his imitation of the mightiest workes of God, and his craftinesse otherwise, in seeking by his tales, and inuented reports, to withdraw credit from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Whereunto I might first adde, that since we haue to do with an enemy of that quality, we had neede be very circumspect in regard of our selues, that we yeeld not assent, to any of the leud motions of himselfe, or other his Atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call agents, in going about to extenuate the credit of the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:623:171"/>
word, but pray to God still to guide vs in his vndoubted truth, both that we may beleeue, and practise that which he hath taught vs. Secondly I might shew the conueniency, or rather the necessity, that a Minister who should expound the Scriptures, should be furnished with liberall Arts and sciences, with histories and other humane learning, that when occasion directly serueth, such knots as this is, may be opened to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the true God. In which respect, I do professe my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be cleane contrary to the opinions of such men, who thinke that the vnderstanding and vse of these matters is friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and vaine for a Minister, and only for ostentation; and that it skilled not if there were no Vniuersities, or schooles where these things are studied. I repute them the great blessings of the Lord of heauen, affoorded to vs, for the apparant furtherance of his ministery, and the profession of Diuinity. How can the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation and the prophecy of Daniel be vnderstood without these? The like may be sayd of some other parts of Scripture. When with so many helpes of history, from the Greeke and from the Latine, the best and most laborious wits, cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the depth of many matters in them, how vnperfect and vncertaine, nay how amazed plainely should he be, that would looke into them, &amp; knoweth nothing of antiquitie? The positio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is most true, that arte and knowledge hath none so great an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as that person which is ignorant. Take away these, and bring in barbarisme. But I haue no time to handle this, and therefore I do leaue it, desiring God to perpetuate these arts &amp; skils among vs; that the meanes of our studies here, in this vngodly age be not taken away from vs, for our abusing of them; but that they may continue as handmaides to Diuinity, and seruants vnto the Scriptures, till Christ Iesus come to iudgement.

            <p n="2">2 Now there is proposed to me a larger field to walke in, then hitherto hath bene: for the sinne of one man alone, was offered before vnto me to be discoursed of, but now the sinne of a multitude. So heretofore I had occasion, to looke into the priuate repentance of one offending person, but now into the publike penance of a whole transgressing city; and that of the city Niniue the greatest in the East, which by her enormity, did minister God great matter of vengeance and wrath, but by her deploration and sorrow for iniquity, did mooue him vnto mercy.<note place="margin">Ionah. 1.2. Genes. 18.20.</note> Before, the cry of their ioyned transgressions did ascend into the eares of the Lord, as the cry of Sodome did; but now in a like manner, the out-cry of their ioyned praiers, of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting and contrition doth pierce through the very cloudes, and commeth before Gods seate, and obtaineth forgiuenesse of him. Which as it is afterward illustrated in this present Chapter, and therefore in his fit place will yeeld most fruitfull doctrine, so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the meanes also of moouing them to repentance, are here opened vnto vs, that is to say by the word of God, deliuered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the preaching of the Prophet, my purpose is to pursue
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:623:172"/>
it, with that naturall order which the text prescribeth vnto me, beginning with the Lords sending, and so proceeding to the Prophets going, and afterward to his preaching, and then to their demeanour in hearing and receiuing, and so forward to the rest. But this day in these two verses, especially I shall touch these two things: The imployment of Ionas againe, which the first verse yeeldeth in generall, <hi>And the vvord of the Lord came vnto Ionah the second time saying</hi>: Then se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly in what speciall words, this charge was deliuered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, <hi>Arise and go to Niniue.</hi> Such sub-diuided notes as do arise out of these, shall be touched in their order.</p>
            <q>
               <l>And the vvord of the Lord the second time, came vnto Ionah saying:</l>
            </q>
            <p n="3">3 The manner of men is, that if they intend any thing of the greatest importance, they are at first earnest and peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie for it, but afterward, time perhaps doth slaken their heate, and coole their resolution. But if there come an hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance or stop in the way, they sinke vnder their burthen, and desist from their enterprise, attempting little farther. Hence, common obseruation hath taken that vp for a speech, that in fights the first conflict is euer most daungerous, and if that be resisted, the rest will be but easie. Hence, such as by their guiltinesse haue prouoked the wrath of him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Primi con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressus sunt acorrimi.</hi>
               </note> who is like to deale with them in seuerity, do take what course they can to prolong, and put off their conuenting and arraignement, both conceiuing that the Iudge being asswaged with time, will abate of his rigour, and the pursuer sleeping on it, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of his furie. Great warres and great iourneyes, receiuing great crosses in the entrance vnto them, end before that they begin, and so the greatest preparations, oftentimes turne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nothing. Neither euer was there purpose hauing maine impediment, which was seconded by any and followed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh, but by him whose hate was strong, or his loue excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great to that which he did aime at,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.10.</note> which would not be rebuked or choked with a little.<note place="margin">Cap. 15.22.32.</note> Of this kind was Paules loue, as he specifieth of himselfe, who intending many times
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:623:173"/>
to visite the Saints at Rome, and being often stayed by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auoydable occasions, yet still burneth in desire of the personall seeing of them, and holdeth not himselfe satisfied, till it were done indeed. He speaketh of it, and he writeth of it, and he wisheth it and prayeth for it; he is so setled in it.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The greater was the loue of the maker of mankind, to this retchlesse city Niniue; to the which, meaning to send a message full of threatnings (but such a one as should in the end bring peace and quietnesse to them) although he were stayed for a while, and as a man may say put from his first ground to worke on, his seruant running from him, and causing him to follow him, and chastise him, when in the meane while much good might haue bene done, by preaching to that people: yet he is not quite stopped with it, or put from his first mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but secondly he will send, that they may haue some warning, to flye the rod hanging ouer them. If he had not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended their good and safety, with a purpose which he meant should not be controlled, he might right well haue suffered that doome to fall on them, which he threatneth by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Ezechiel,<note place="margin">Ezech. 3.17.18.</note> both to the Iewes and to him, that if he being set for a watchman, would not tell them of such plagues, as were to come vpon them, they should dye in their sinnes, but their bloud would he require at the hands of Ezechiel. So the Niniuites being not acquainted with that vengeance which was neare them, might haue perished in their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and bene damned for their iniquitie, but their bloud might haue bene required at the hands of our poore Ionas. But to make it manifest, that his purpose was inuariable in it selfe, and full of good to them, he doth but deferre his sending: some few dayes may be slipped, but it assuredly commeth at last. His intendments depend not on the ability, or want of any of his creatures: the stubburnenesse of the reprobate, or falling away of him who seemeth to be somewhat, or the apostasie of a great one, or the depraued errour of any of his owne seruants, do not hinder his designement. If this man will not serue, then there shall come another: or if yesterday will not do, yet it shall be too morrow. The Philistines shall
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:623:173"/>
be conquered:<note place="margin">1. Sam. 18.27. 1. Chron. 22.8.</note> if Saules sinnes will not suffer that he shall haue a victory, Dauid shall be the man. The Temple must be erected: if the father may not do it, because he hath shed much bloud, the sonne Salomon shall be peaceable, and he shall begin and ende it.</p>
            <p n="5">5 But when he hath once purposed good vpon a nation, that it shall be called home, and rectified in his wayes, be there neuer so manie difficulties, as they seeme in mans iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he cleereth them euery one. For to God nothing is difficult, but himselfe hath a finger in that which seemeth to hinder, as diuines commonly do shew in determining that question, that <hi>God is not the authour of sinne, and yet doth vvorke in all things.</hi> He resolued to make the Gentiles like the Iewes, to call those for a people who were no people before. There was in the time of Christ, a decree and barre against it,<note place="margin">Matth. 10.5.6. Act. 10.15.34.</note> 
               <hi>Go not into the vvay of the Gentiles, and into the cities of the Samaritanes enter yee not. But go rather to the lost sheepe of the house of Israel.</hi> Yet afterward Peter shall see the vncleane made cleane, and God will be no longer a respecter of any persons. He by his Apostle hath foretold, that the Iewes shall againe be called home to the adoption,<note place="margin">Roman. 11.26.</note> before the day of iudgement. Then Gods election being ouer them, and his words being truth and veritie, they shall come to the sheepefold, that all Israel may be saued: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the bloud of Christ be on their heads,<note place="margin">Matth. 27.25.</note> and on the heads of their children, although they yet to this day hate, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile the Sauiour of the world,<note place="margin">Hieron. in Isay. 5.</note> and vnder the name of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarites, do curse vs in their Synagogues. In this last age of the world, when the fulnesse of time was come, that by the breath of his mouth (the preaching of the Gospell) God would weaken and consume that wicked one,<note place="margin">2. Thes. 23.4.8.</note> that aduersary, the very sonne of perdition, and the light of the word should clearely shine againe, in a great part of the world; not all the cloudes of ignorance; nor the thicke mistes of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, could stay from vs his decreed mercie. When the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours had conspired, either not to preach at all to their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges (as Ionas would not at Niniue) or if they did bring any
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:623:174"/>
thing, it was poyson for meate, and venime in steed of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: when Antichrist with his pompe, and his followers with the brightnesse of earthly and carnall glorie, had dazeled the peoples eyes, that they could not see truth from errour: when the knowledge of the tongues, and almost all other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature, was raked vp vnder the ashes: when the decrees of Popes, and the Canons of Councels, and customes and traditions, were in place of the written word: when the schoolemen had conspurcated and abused true Diuinitie with their filthinesse: when a liuely faith and vnderstanding knowledge were not heard of: God did a second time send his seruants, to bring light to the world, and furnishing one with this talent, and another with that good thing, he brought life againe to the dead, and sun-shine in the middest of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. A great token of his gracious and bountifull inclination, to the age wherein we liue. It must be imputed to his loue: it must be ascribed to his mercy.</p>
            <p n="6">6 So must that, which we enioy so abundantly at this time. God hath sent twise to our nation, in a speciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as he did to Niniue. In the time of good King Edward, and in the dayes of our Queene. The difference is in this, that those which were sent to vs, did come indeede, and did not like Ionas: and besides it was not one, but many seruants of the Lord which shewed themselues. But herein is the likenesse, that as when the first serued not, he sent the next time to Niniue, so hauing here appointed, that so many should be sealed and marked in the forehead, as belonged to his election, so many thousands or millions, which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in those sixe yeares of king Edward was in no sort com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted (and God forbid, for our sake and our posterity, that it should haue bene) he stayed not at that stop, which was made in Queene Maries dayes, but went on with his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. The conspiring against the Gospell, the striking of the sheapheards, the burning of the professours, the yeelding of all to the Pope, the confederacie with the Spaniard, which were things of farre greater moment, then the turning backe of one Prophet, did not so restraine his affection, but
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:623:174"/>
that a second time we should heare from him more at large, to the building vp of his Church, and dilating of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but to the eternall blessednesse of vs both in soule and bodie. If any thing may deserue it, this deserueth at our hands a thankefulnesse, and gratefull consideration. I would that our liues, and our contempt of the world, could testifie, that so we do thinke of it. But we must im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute this to his loue, as also the other, that he would send a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to Niuiue.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Which Citie as I do now leaue, so I may not leaue that argument, of the kindnesse of the Lord; for the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger yet giueth farther occasion, to magnifie that. For he who had but lately runne away from his maister, and cast his word behind him; he who for some carnall reason, had despised his commaundement; he who had so transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that a punishment neuer heard off before, was infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for his labour, is once againe put in trust, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of the Highest, to go to a King, and a Citie, with threates which are so terrible. Why would not he who is Lord of all things, rather make choyse of some other, to bee vsed in this seruice, who was vntainted and vntouched, vnstayned and vnreprouable? This may seeme at the first blush, to bee more for the senders honour: and againe, hee that should bee sent, might reprooue the sinnes of other, with a freer conscience, when he knew himselfe to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. The Lawyers would haue sayd,<note place="margin">

Perhaps the Elders of the Church, or the grauer sort of men, might haue receiued him againe into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, vpon his testification of sorrow for his fault; but to honour him as a Prophet, or to esteeme him as in former time, that doth not stand with discipline, that were no safe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. The Gibeonites were suffered by Iosuah,<note place="margin">Iosuah. 9.21.</note> to come into the Tabernacle: but they came without preferment; nay it was with great disgrace; they serued but for wood-cutters, and drawers of water. Such as in the Primitiue Church, being Clergy men before, had notoriously fallen, were permitted
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:623:175"/>
vpon repentance to come to the Eucharist, but it was to the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Communion, not as Bishops or Priests, who might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate and minister to other, but as men of the congregation, who were to receiue at the hand of another. And thus Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius Bishop of Rome,<note place="margin">Euseb. Hist. Eccles. 6.35. Gellius. lib. 10.3.</note> serued a Prelate, who layd hands foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly vpon Nouatus, at his consecration. The Brutij were the first of all Italy, who reuolted from the Romanes to Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal. But for that tricke, the Romanes would neuer trust them afterward, although vpon their humble submission, they tooke them into their protection: yet they reckened them not as fellowes, neither mustered they any souldiers out of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, but appointed them to attend on such Deputies and Lieutenants, as they sent into their Prouinces. Thus would worldly and carnall wisedome haue dealt with this man: he may be held for an Israelite, but in no sort for a Prophet: no gracing, no aduancing, no honouring yet a while. Let him bite vpon the bridle, that knowing how he hath fallen, he may be wiser afterward. But the Lord who knew his heart, and saw it now quite broken, waiteth not for more experience, or for yeares of probation, but as fully satisfied with his sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and putting the greatnesse of his errour out of memory, he setteth him once againe in his old place, and old honour, without disgrace, or diminution. He doth not so much as vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brayd, or cast him in the teeth, as an vngracious seruant, that thus or thus he had serued him, but shutting vp all together, he employeth him as before. This is a lesson to the Ministers and pastours of the flocke, that by Gods owne example, they should not be too rigorous vpon such as haue gone astray, euen in the greatest crimes: but when conspicuous tokens of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance shall be giuen, to open the lap and bosome of the Church to receiue them. Not euery slight acknowledgement, but yet pregnant signes may be taken; and better it is that he be an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, then thou an hard hearted father.<note place="margin">Ezech. 33.11. Luc. 15.10. Luc. 15.20.</note> God will not the death of sinners, but that they should turne and liue. The very Angels reioyce for one repenting sinner. When the prodigall child came toward, his father did runne and meete him, and kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him and embraced him. Let not the seruant be hard vnto
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:623:175"/>
his fellow seruant, when the maister is so easie.</p>
            <p n="8">8 The more cruell in the meane while,<note place="margin">Euseb. Hist. Eccles. 6.35.</note> was the doctrine of Nouatus: who barred not for a time, but for euer from the Communion, and accesse into the Church, such as in the blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy persecution of Decius the Emperour, had by infirmitie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vnto idols; teaching that God if he would, might take them to mercy, but man might not deale with it, no not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they did implore it with sobbes and continued teares. He had forgotten that Peter denying Christ three times, yet continued an Apostle,<note place="margin">Matth. 26.69.</note> and was afterward martyred for Christ. That the spirit may be willing,<note place="margin">41.</note> and yet the flesh may be weake.

But as the scholers, do oftentimes say more then their maisters, so the Cathari, and Nouatians who were the Disciples of Nouatus,<note place="margin">Socrat Hist. Eccles. 7.25.</note> did giue a more bloudy sentence, then euer their teacher did. For they held, that not onely to deny Christ, was so haynous, but whosoeuer after Baptisme had done any mortall sinne (such as we find in the Scripture, that death is threatned to) was cut off from the Church, and hee might haue no portion in the Eucharist or Communion, howsoeuer afterward he did behaue himselfe.

Sinners which call for grace,<note place="margin">Genes. 9.21. cap. 19.32. 2. Petr. 2.8. Matth. 26.70</note> do belong to the adoption. Noe swarued, and yet he was a Patriarke, Lot fell, yet he is said by Saint Peter, to haue had a righteous soule. Peter himselfe had a guiltie conscience, and yet was a great Apostle. Ionas became a mightie trespasser, and yet still remained the Lords Prophet. It was Gods gracious boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whose fauour originally euer commeth for nothing, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once setled, it is not lost for a little. And thus haue you his loue both to Niniue, and to Ionas.</p>
            <p n="10">10 There is yet another matter, which in this former verse is worthie of consideration, that <hi>the word of the Lord</hi> is said here <hi>to come to Ionas.</hi> The Creatour of all things, might haue vsed many other wayes, to reclaime that offending citie. In old time he did call and warne men, by visions and by dreames, as it is in Iob:<note place="margin">Iob. 33 15.</note> or his benefits might haue allured; or if those had but choked, and pampered them vp with fatnesse, his rods might haue beat them to it; famine might breede remorse, or the sword of the enemie, or some deuouring pestilence. Or if he would saue all their liues, such iudgements might haue frighted them, as were shewed at Hierusalem,<note place="margin">Ioseph. de bello Iudai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co. 7.12.</note> at the last destruction of it.

ouer the citie, and troupes of armed men, were seene to fight in the aire. What terrour would this haue wrought? what heart would not this haue rented, and driuen it into mourning, and calling to God for pardon? But the great Lord who in his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath ordained another way, as the ordinarie course to winne men to himselfe, that is, by his most precious word, and his ministerie, doth here commend this his ordinance, for the instrument of their good. He hath made this word more sharpe, then is any two edged sword.<note place="margin">Hebr. 4.12.</note> This is it which doth pierce the marrow, and breake the bones in sunder, which entreth into the diuision of the soule and of the spirit, of the heart and of the reines, which wresteth sighs from the mind, and wringeth teares from the eyes, and maketh a whole man, as it were to melt, and dissolue into water. This is it, to which especially he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to giue a blessing,<note place="margin">Isay. 55.10.</note> that it shall not returne in vaine, <hi>but as the rayne commeth downe, and the snow from heauen, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it to bring foorth and bud, that it may giue seede to the sower, and bread to him that eateth, so shall the word be that goeth out of</hi> Gods <hi>mouth, it shall not returne voyd, but accomplish that which</hi> God <hi>will, and it shall prosper in the thing whereunto</hi> he <hi>sendeth it.</hi> It is the very power of saluation to all those that do beleeue, a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorne to our feete,<note place="margin">Psal. 119.105</note> and a light vnto our pathes; and therefore as at other times he vseth this to saue men, so he doth in this place, teaching the Niniuites by that word, which commeth from the mouth of the Prophets, by his preaching and crying; and to that purpose also sending his word to Ionas, as a warrant in what sort he should crie. The word must be the meanes, and he the man that must bring it.</p>
            <p n="11">11 This is a sure seale vnto him, of his calling and vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The mind of God in particular concerning this or that, is reuealed and made knowne to him; not after a common maner, as euery one in the Scripture is informed of his dutie, and what the Lords will is, but in a speciall sort, as to one singled out, as the Prophets were to choyse places. And to signifie that no man can of himselfe be a Prophet, but by Gods disposing of him vnto it, the word of the Lord commeth to him, he doth not go vnto

Yet to blind the eyes of the people, (as our Christians do write of him) when the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling sicknesse came on him, wherewith he was much troubled, he would say when he came againe to himselfe, that he was rapt into some reuelation, and in his soule had some conference with the Almightie maker.

But although a motion euen from the Spirit of God, and an inward calling be needfull for vs, whereby we may be assured, that we are seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred out, and ordained vnto this vocation, yet the word of God may not properly be said to come to vs, but it is rather our part to go to the word of God, and to haue recourse to the Scripture, and therein to see what the Lord doth teach vnto vs. And when we are furnished,<note place="margin">Matth. 13.52</note> and well stored with things both old and new, we ought as the good Scribe to bring them out of our treasurie. Which if all those did respect, who do enter into this function, we should not haue such base ones stand before the altar. If we had not men so good, as those holy inspired ones were, yet we should not haue them so bad, as euery where abound; men who neuer imagined, what an inward calling meaneth; they know not of any such matter; such as neither the word commeth to

It were the lesse, if they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made themselues to be guiltie, but they slay the souls of other. Their case is vnnaturall; against the rules of nature, that any should be teachers who neuer learned, or preachers who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not speake, or men to diuide the word, who know not how to diuide it.

            <p n="13">13 As hitherto you haue heard in a kind of generalitie, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the Prophet once againe, by Gods word so directing him, was to go and preach at Niniue, so now the charge which the Lord gaue vnto him,<note place="margin">Ion. 1.2.</note> is in precise termes plainly set downe vnto vs. <hi>Arise.</hi> In the beginning of this Prophecie, the very same word is vsed, and in both places intendeth, that Ionas was not readie, but as it were sitting or lying downe; so that he did need a spurre to quicken him, and reuiue him. In the second of Ezechiel, God speaketh thus vnto his seruant, <hi>Sonne of man stand vp vpon thy feete,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezech. 2.1.</note> 
               <hi>and I will speake vnto thee.</hi> It sheweth that he was not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and therefore he biddeth him stand vp. Our man when preaching at first to the people of Israel, he thought that he had done no good, but vtterly lost his labour; of likelyhood being discontented, did set him downe and vexe. Then did the Lord put life into him, and bid him arise and be stirring, he would send him elsewhere. But now it is rather to be supposed, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deiected in his spirit, for his greeuous disobedience, and troubled in his soule for his so great offence, he sate musing and pondering, as not hauing yet digested the sorrow, through which he did runne. And to say the truth, he had bene insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and without all kind of feeling, if he had so soone shaken off the remembrance of his sinne, and his punishment for the same. He that hath sustained bitternesse, and felt it to the full, shall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his deliuerance, in a melancholike pang, starkle and be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted, as if he were yet troubled, yea be perplexed in his dreames; as if there were yet a continuance of misery vpon him.

How much more might Ionas be yet quiuering and trembling, whose body was in the mouth, yea the belly of the graue, and whose soule did feele that anguish, which the feare of Gods dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, and his casting away from his presence, could possibly lay vpon him? Now to the end that he might not wast himselfe with sorrowing beyond measure, and so be swallowed vp with griefe, he is rowzed out of his passions, and busied otherwise yet more to his owne hearts ease, and his maisters better seruice.</p>
            <p n="14">14 It is a thing worthie obseruance, in very many men, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in some more, in some lesse, that in the greatest pensiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of mind which befalleth them, God by some new occasion doth set them vp and reuiue them. The Pastour hath his vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and grieuances at his heart. The vntowardnesse of his people doth make him fret like Moses:<note place="margin">Num. 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 11.</note> so the wilinesse of the serpent, in deuising new kinds of euill, or the stubburnnesse of Recusants, or the circumuentings of heretickes, or the deriding of enemies, may disquiet him and afflict him. The father and the housholder, may be grieued and disturbed, by the vnrulinesse of his children, and the infamie which is vpon them, as was v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the sonnes of Eli or Samuel;<note place="margin">1.

The faithfull man who is in any vocation,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 16.1. Exod. 1.10. Genes. 21.9. Ester. 3.6. 2. Sam. 16.5. 1.

The tender and troubled conscience may be frighted and molested, by recounting his iniquities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst so high a maiestie, and so seuere a iustice. There is no one of these, but being followed &amp; pursued as with waue after waue, must needes sinke &amp; grow faint, vnlesse there be some remedie. He that should onely feed vpon this in his thought, and as one who made much of the humour, should increase it and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it, might fret himselfe to peeces; and if his bones were iron, or if his sides were brasse, might consume them and dissolue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Therefore our respectiue father, knowing wherof we are made, remembring that we are but dust,<note place="margin">Psal 103.14.</note> doth take this order for vs, that as sometimes he intermingleth ioy with sorrow, like the

This dutie or that necessitie, or the comming in of a friend, or feare of euill to come, or hope and expectation, or watchfulnesse to preuent, or labouring to escape, or one thing or another, is set by God as a stay, that we shall not with Iob onely sit downe and mourne,<note place="margin">Iob. 2.8. Lament. 1.1.</note> or with Ieremie yeeld our selues wholly to lamentation. We shall haue some thing or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther say to vs as to Ionas, arise. I am assuredly perswaded, that this was the estate of Saint Paule aboue all other men,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 6.4.</note> who ranne through so many difficulties in watching and in fasting, in imprisonment and in beating, in preaching and in writing, in comforting the weake, in combating with the enemie, in taking care of all Churches. God did not affoord him time to greeue at his perplexities, but choked one with another, and gaue him grace for all. Euerie man may apply this to himselfe as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth. But to the end that our Prophet might not be steeped and quite dissolued with sorrow, the word of the Lord commeth to him, No more (Ionas) of this heauinesse, <hi>Arise and go to Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue that great citie.</hi>

I shall haue more occasion in the third verse, to speake of the hugenesse of this place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there it is said, that Niniue was a great and excellent ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, of no lesse then three dayes iourney.<note place="margin">Ion. 3.3.</note> It shall suffice for that purpose which I now intend to follow, out of these words of my text, that <hi>Niniue was a great citie,</hi> to contemplate with reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend admiration, the sound force and effectuall operation of the word of God and the ministerie: that one man and a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,

without pompe, without traine, without any one to grace him, should be sent to such a multitude, and being sent should preuaile. See whether some secret vertue, &amp; power which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expressed, be not in this liuely word, when it is taught. See whether the mightie finger of the Lord himselfe be not with it, that he should depute one mouth, to speake vnto a million, and to mooue them and perswade them, and sometimes to erect them, and sometimes to depresse them, with promises and with threatnings: to make so many hearts as would not feare an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of the old Greekes or Aegyptians, to quake, and with a quauering to tremble in all the bones. That he should appoint one Moses,<note place="margin">Exod. 12.37</note> to aduise and giue precepts, to sixe hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men, which were able to fight in battell, besides women and children.<note place="margin">Act. 2.41.</note> That Peter at one Sermon, shold not only speake to so many, but should winne three thousand soules. That in a great congregation, where hundreds or thousands be, a man of the selfe same qualitie, as those to whom he doth preach, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with many weaknesses, and bringing this most precious treasure but in an earthen vessell, should stand betweene the Lord and the consciences of the people, and with memorie &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stancie, shold speak boldly to the best, and rebuke them &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue them, and thunder out Gods iudgements. And that the toung of this man, a little peece of flesh, and nothing in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison, should talke of God and Angels, of the mysteries of the Trinitie, of the benefits of the Redeemer, of the power of the holy Ghost, of euerlasting ioy, and of the paines of hell, of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and damnation; and with this speech so vttered, should conquer &amp; preuaile, &amp; incite men vnto fasting &amp; weeping &amp; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting, yea to suffering of affliction, yea to martyrdome it selfe.</p>
            <p n="16">16 It sheweth that this word,<note place="margin">Mat. 13.31.</note> is truely likened to the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard seed, which being small in the sowing, groweth to great branches afterward.<note place="margin">33.</note> And to leauen, which being put in meale farre greater then it selfe, yet doth season and sauour it all.

These be demonstratiue proofes, that there is more in this word, then mans wit can imagine, that not by sword or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion, but onely by speaking and hearing, perhaps this day it creepeth, to morrow it flyeth aloft, and sheweth his head with the mightiest. That the Sunne in the heauen, cannot do more with the creatures, then this with the receiuers.

            <p n="17">17 Then it was no ouersight, but amply to Gods glorie, that the Lord did send onely one man, to a citie of that

quantitie. He had armed him before, and metalled him for the nonce. He came with matter in his mouth, to satisfie all the sort. He who sent him was that Lord, who made all, and could breake the hearts of all; then what is it to be respected how many they were? By calling he is a Prophet, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neede not feare a world full of gaine-sayers.<note place="margin">Ierem. 1.18.</note> He is as a wall of brasse, and a bulwarke of iron, against all the troupes of them. It is Gods word which he bringeth, which is opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue and quicke, and very apt for diffusion, and spreading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. As the voyce in the ayre, so this in the hearts of men doth quickly extend it selfe. He hath a sound commission from him, who will beare him out, to go to Niniue that great citie. I send thee not to a hand-full, but to a spacious charge, and I do furnish thee for them all. I tell thee that they are many, expect and recken of it, but thou shalt do well with them. And this was a happie helpe, that he was told be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, that the citie was so great, that he might foresee the difficultie, and so be amazed the lesse. For if suddenly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out former meditation, he had bene pushed among so huge and vast a multitude, he might right well haue trembled at it, as a few souldiours would, when they expecting no such matter, nor thinke of their enemies, were fallen into an ambush, or gotten into the midst of an armie. Such daungers as come vnlooked for, do not onely bereaue men of counsell, and of sound vnderstanding, but of sence too many times. To preuent which, our Prophet is aduertised before-hand, that the monster of the multitude, that beast with many heades, is to be dealt with by him: I could wish that such of my brethren, as liue here in this Seminarie and store-house of the ministerie, would before the time that the Lord imposed any charge elsewhere vpon them, consider and ponder deepely, what a difficult part of seruice they are to be vsed in: and that there is no kinde of conflict, wherein they may not be exercised. This is the very same counsell, which Christ giueth to his disciples,<note place="margin">Luc. 14.28.</note> 
               <hi>Which of you minding to build a towre sitteth not downe before

There is lesse oddes by much, betweene twentie and ten, then betweene the flocke and the Pastour. They are manie vnto one; the varietie and diuersitie of wits and dispositions, requireth a carefull minde, and also a man resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Peruersenesse and ouerthrwartnesse, must be looked for before hand. Whereupon if with foresight men did meditate and contemplate, we should not here such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, as are rise in the countrey. Oh what a blessed life do you leade in the Vniuersitie? we liue here as in a hell: such crossing and such vexations we tast, as you do neuer dreame of. And these seeming to many of them, to be no lesse then insuperable, cause them to sinke, and faint in their hearts, and to be as dead and discouraged, in going through with their calling. They should haue imagined before, that for their strength and abilitie, euerie place might be to them, as Niniue was to Ionas, a huge and mightie charge: that the contumelie of Atheistes, and bitter hatrest of Papistes, the inuasions of vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>start heretickes, the wranglings of new-found schismatikes, should exercise their patience. That the ciuill sort with their nicenesse, and ouermuch curiositie, the ignorant with their rudenesse and indisciplinable barbarisme, the old with their superstitions, the young with their sports and follies, would minister matter to them. That some with troubled spirites, would seeke to them for comfort, whom they cannot chuse but pitie: that others of troublesome natures, would draw them into quarrels, and partaking of factions, so that all their wits and knowledge, should scant keepe them from brawles. That the greater their talent is, the more shall be their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then; the greater their graces be, the greater shall be their crosses.

by their Heralds, that they would immediatly inuade him, with fire and sword, and irreconcilable hatred.

Or if he and his people, must needes end their dayes, by the outrage of their enemie, who would be much encouraged by prosperitie and desired successe; yet that might be his comfort, which is the last comfort in death, to men in his case, that hee went not awaye vnreuenged, but hee had ridde some of those who came to ridde him, and slayne some of the murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, before that his last breath, was yeelded vp to nature. But there can be no such reuengement taken vpon him who sendeth this: the King of Niniue must suffer all and do nothing.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Now here it may be expected, that the man sent on this errand, might yet picke some occasion, and slippe his necke out of collar, that he might not performe this businesse. It might haue frighted this weake man, to go to a king, and to a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous king, proud, and hawtie by nature, apt enough to reuile the poore preacher, that should be sent; yea readie enough to blaspheme his Lord and maister himselfe, saying who is this God, or what haue I to do with him? Who knew whether he should euer returne aliue, for Ambassadours haue bene slaine, by perfidious and fedifragous, and barbarous Princes, cleane contrarie to the lawe of nature and of nations.

Or it might be imagined, that he who once before had failed so grosly, might now since the ice was broken, still hold on in his course, and come to haue a facilitie in running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. For it is a great matter, to haue once ouer-slipped the bonds of our dutie, and to haue cracked the conscience, which

cannot so easily be soudered againe. But the euent is otherwise; and without peraduentures, our Prophet performeth this charge. He thinketh it enough that he hath broken once, and now he will not be hired to do so againe. He goeth without delaye, and speaketh very liberally, that which is enioyned him. So that now in the steade of a stubburne-minded man, you are to expect an obedient seruant. He ariseth as he is bid, he crieth as he is bid, what will you haue more?

The cause of the meeting of the twelue tribes against one, was good; but the manner of ther handling of it, was not pleasing vnto the Lord; for fury and indignation that any man should stand against them, did mooue them as much as iustice; and they bore themselues the brauer, on the multitude which was with them; which made the Lord yeeld them ouer for two dayes to the enemy, so that first two and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, &amp; afterward eighteene thousand of their strong men were slaine. But when they came weeping with one consent to the Lord, &amp; fasted &amp; offered offerings, the humbling of themselues was rewarded with a victory, a great victory ouer their enemies. So their soule was the better, and they had what they desired. Our Prophet hath his share, in this good arising from affliction, who of a rebellious person, and one of-ward from his duty, is rectified and made orderly, so that now in steed of going, he is ready to runne, he thinketh the better of himselfe, that he may be vsed in such businesse.

He concludeth in that place, that when we are well, we should perseuere to be such, as we professe that we would be, so long as we are sicke. It were to be wished, that our age would looke better to this, that what we vow in our weakenesse, might be performed in our strength, and what we haue in our speech, when we are most deiected, may in deede be in vs, when we are erected againe. But it is otherwise, and we beare our selues in such sort, as if the recouering of our bodies, were the putting off of our minds, and our gayning in the one, were a meere losse in the other. Vpon such is Gods care and labour ill bestowed, that they be not bettered by it. Yet our Ionas in this place, doth make a sounder benefit, of that which he hath suffered. He who in the whales belly, being compassed with the pangs and anguishes of death, had groned for his sinnes, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged his errours, and vowed many good things, if he euer might get out, doth not straight vpon his parting with his kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and his prison, forget what he had sayd, but imagining that his God would require an accomplishment, doth fit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to that which should be required of him.

Hereupon without any kind of stowping or seeking to the Lord, the wicked doth seeke deuises, how he may shake off the euill, which he feeleth hanging on him; and if he could tell how to do it, in despite of God, he would with strong hand ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare him.

            <p n="7">7 In handling this argument, of the diuerse effects of the crosse, in diuerse sorts of men, when I thinke vpon our selues, I cannot chuse but maruell, of what mettall we are made. For to iudge that this assembly, are not louers of God, and againe beloued by God, were as I suppose a presumptuous and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable, and vnchristian sinne; and farre be it from me, to haue the least thought of it. I am rather induced to thinke, that euery one here belongeth to Gods election; for it stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth much with reason, that grace should haue deepe roote in that people, who so early before day-light, come together with deuotion, to heare what the Lord doth say concerning all of them. And God increase this affection in vs all vnto the end. Yet when I looke farther, I see that all is not well. He is blind who now beholdeth not, that God is angry with vs. The continuance of his punishment, doth testifie that his wrath is in no sort appeased. I passe by other matters, of a pestilence lately gone, and the sword yet threatned to vs. But behold what a famine he hath brought vpon our land, and making it to perseuere, yet hitherto doth increase it. One yeare there hath bene hunger; the second there was a dearth, and a third which is this yeare, there is great cleannesse of teeth. The poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer sort do most feele it: the Lord haue mercy on them. So that as in Dauids dayes,<note place="margin">2.

And see whether that the Lord doth not threaten vs much more, by sending such vnseasonable weather,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:623:188"/>
and store of raine among vs. Which if we will obserue, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with that which is past, we may say that the course of nature is very much inuerted; our yeares are turned vp-side downe; our sommers are no sommers, our haruests are no har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uests; our seed-times are no seed-times.<note place="margin">Ammian.

            <p n="10">10 In which respect, I doubt not but our Ionas now is so wise, as to looke to that word onely, and to be obsequious to it, in euery the least thing. When he was bid foorthwith to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire to that place,<note place="margin">Thucydides Histor. lib. 1.</note> he doth it without delay. When Themisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles being banished from his countrey, would needs into Persia, to the great king Artaxerxes, in one yere he would not come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his presence, but spent that time in learning the Persian tong, that he might be able personally to speake to that Prince, &amp; tell his tale himselfe. Here now is no such doubt made by Ionas, but either he could already the speech of the Niniuites, or was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently instructed, that he who once at Babel, made so many tongues of one,<note place="margin">Genes. 11.8.</note> could giue his seruant so many of those tongues as were fit for his businesse. That euidently was shewed, some hundreds of yeares afterwards,<note place="margin">Act. 2.1.</note> in the gift powred vpon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles. Therefore he stood not vpon this, but presently went his way. Neither doth he make scruple of another matter, that himselfe was but a stranger, and therefore he should not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued: that he was to speake to a king, for the which he was vnsufficient: that such things as were necessary, might be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, as his diet and his lodging; but looking on nothing else, sauing Gods commaundement, and nakedly vpon that, he betaketh himselfe to his iourney. True faith and true obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, do not busie themselues with that, which resteth vpon the commaunders direction. It was a most commendable rule, of that worthy Paulus Aemilius,<note place="margin">Liuius lib. 44.</note> that his souldiers should take care of three things, and no more. First that their bodies should be nimble, and such order taken for them, as should be neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Secondly that their armour were fit. And thirdly that their minde should be ready for euery thing, which their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall should giue them in charge, although it came vpon the sudden: but for other matters, they should not trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues about them, but know that those were cared for, by God and by their leader. There can be no better precept,

euen in our Christian warfare against powers and principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and euery thing that withstandeth,<note place="margin">Ephes. 6.12.</note> then to haue all things in readinesse, which belong to our vocation, and to respect the voyce of Iesus,<note place="margin">Hebr. 12.2.</note> who is the Captaine, and finisher of our faith: but not to medle at all with his secret counsels, or with casting too many perils.

This is not alwayes remembred, when we forbeare to speake a necessarie truth, fearing to vtter it, lest this or that should come of it.

<pb n="371" facs="tcp:623:190"/>
of the wall in the outward circumference, a man trauelling on foote, might by reasonable iourneyes, be well three dayes in compassing it. (And that it was the greatest cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of those Easterne countries,<note place="margin">Genes. 18.4. Matth. 4.23. Cap. 28.19.</note> to iourney on foote, may be very well collected, by washing of their feete so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly after iourneyes, and by the trauels on foote, of Christ and his Apostles.) Now by such testimonies, as we do manifestly gather from profane writers, this is found to be so. There be that do cite some thing to this purpose,<note place="margin">Tremel. &amp; Iunius in Ionae. 3. Diodorus lib. 2. Iunius vt suprà.</note> out of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus, but that is not so plaine. But Diodorus Siculus in his second booke (as Stephanus doth recken them) spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth fully to this point. And in the times of Herodotus, and Diodorus, the rudera, the ruines and desolations of Niniue stood, so that if they had written falsly, common men might haue controlled them. Diodorus then sayth, that this city had walles of maruellous bredth, so that carts might not onely go, but very well meete vpon them: that it had fifteene hundred towers, which argueth a great bignesse: &amp; that the walles being foure wayes set, although not equally square, had no lesse in the compasse of the out-side, then foure hundred and fourescore furlongs. Where if we accompt after eight furlongs to the mile, all amounteth to threescore miles, and not onely to eight and fortie, as the Geneua note in the English Bible hath vpon the first Chapter. So then threescore miles in circuite, may be reckened for three dayes iourney, twenty miles to a day, which is more then souldiers march; and for ordinary footemen, in the winter it is harder, in the sommer it is easier. And this I take to be the true meaning of the Prophet, and not onely as some would haue it (which may be true also) that it was full three dayes labour, to go through euery lane, or broade streete in the Citie.</p>
            <p n="12">12 When I opened the first verses of this prophecy, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out of this place, I more fully handled this argument, and shewed that in old time, the Easterne Cities were very huge, as for example sake,<note place="margin">Aristot.

The water then being plentifully there, &amp; the soile answering to it, to yeeld food for such a multitude, &amp; the place being the royal city of the Assyrian Monarchy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore built with all magnificence, for the honor of the kingdome; yea the profane writers confirming it; but that which is most of all, the Spirit of God affirming it, we may very well take Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niue, for an excellent and great city, such a one as I suppose, that neither the old world, nor the new world had any like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.

If men labour, and spend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to obtaine a little, what should they do for much? Then the Prophet need not feare, but take it as a mercy of his God shed vpon him, that he must go to great Niniue. For I doubt not but he was furnished with the powerfull grace of the Spirit, that he needed not feare himselfe, or distrust his owne ability.

And it is mine opinion (although perhaps it be but mine) that the Sauiour of the world, according to those different inclinations, which his manhood brought vnto him, did rouze himselfe the more, and did pierce the hearts of his hearers, with more patheticall speech, when he saw such troupes come about him, that he was forced to go to a mountaine,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.1.

Quintilian sayth of a schoole-maister (imagine that he meaneth a good one, such a one as is well prepared to teach) that since a good Lecture is not like a supper, which being prouided for a set number will serue no more, but as the sun-shine, which may sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie all without scanting, come as many as will; that he is very much incouraged, when he readeth to many, and doth vse such voyce and gesture, as if he should vse to one, a man would thinke that he were madde. Surely this is the case of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full steward of Christ, who aimeth onely at the honouring and glorifying of his maister, and doth not meane to set himselfe at sale, with vaine glory (for there God oftentimes, doth send a curse, in matter, or voyce, or memorie, or one thing or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

And there he began to <hi>cry</hi>: he crept not in as heretikes do, nor whispered like to our Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites, who by secret reconciling, draw men from God and their Prince, and all true loue to their countrey: not as a fearfull cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, who dare not shew his head, for feare lest he should be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but as one of the Lords Prophets, he deliuereth his mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage in open streetes and the market.

He who should haue spoken mildly, and but softly and quietly there, might haue bene passed by of all men: which was the estate of Christendome, when Luther came into the world, and therefore he spake with a stirring spirit, of fortitude and courage, God sending a sharpe surgeon, to sores which were so vlcerated. Our Prophet is in this predicament of vehemency and earnestnesse, which appeareth by all particulars, as first that he began so soone to tell his message; he goeth not about the city, nor gazeth to see the buildings, or with curiositie to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the streetes, or houses, or pallaces, or Temples, but he

straight way falleth to his worke: secondly he thundreth with voyce lift vp, and speaketh out that euery one may take notice; but thirdly, which is most of all, he vttereth that which biteth.

Saint Austen although in most things he be a follower of the Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint, yet as I suppose being put in minde by the translation of Hierome (which about that time began to be published) that in the originall it was fortie, and thereby being put to a push whether to chuse,<note place="margin">Aug de ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitate Dei. lib. 18.44.</note> in his bookes <hi>De ciuitate Dei,</hi> doth modestly like of that which is in the Hebrew fountaine; but being desirous withall, to retaine that which was receiued from

            <p n="17">17 This worthie man as it seemeth, would haue a way by himselfe; but by moderating two sides, he hath drawne them both vpon him. In which his case may not vnfitly be compared to that of Martin Luther which is so famous. For he knowing that the Papists in the matter of the Sacrament, held a Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, as the Septuagint hold three in Ionas, (both of these opinions, both concerning three and the transubstantiating) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing continued a long time, but not from the beginning) and that Zuinglius held that the bread remained after Consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but yet representing the body of Christ (which agreeth with the Scripture, as fortie here doth with the Hebrew,) would needes like to Iustinus Martyr, bring both these sides after a sort together, that there should be bread with Zuinglius, and the body too with the Romanists, not by turning the bread into Christs bodie, but by a Consubstantiation, or ioyning each with other. And in holding this opinion, being driuen to those extremities,<note place="margin">

               </note> as to maintaine that the flesh of Christ is in the bread, and with the bread, and vnder the bread, yea euery where in the earth, and ayre, and heauen, he drew both sides vpon him, and is oppugned by both, with bitternesse and great egernesse. Whereout I do make this vse, that Gods acts are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous, and his ordinances wonderfull, when he suffereth the best to fall, that none in this world may be perfect, but only the Godhead which is immaculate and vndefiled, and so by this meanes all glorie may be his.

In like sort that renowmed man, the great instrument of the Lords glorie, who so cleared that point of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, the very ground of saluation, against all the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines and schoolemen, and so purged out other superstitions, that all Europe at this day, doth shine the brighter for him, (and therefore as his memorie shall be blessed to the end, in despite of all that gaine-say it, so his soule doth rest with the Highest) had his <hi>lapsum humanum,</hi> his errour incident to a man, that we might euermore remember that he was a man, although an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent man, and not more dote vpon him, then we should vpon a creature.<note place="margin">Ministri Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delbergenses in Actis col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquij Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brunens.

            <p n="18">18 But to preuent in our selues the like slips, which befell to them writing concerning Ionas, the best and readiest way is to haue recourse to the wel-springs, wherin the word was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, which Saint Austen himselfe doth confesse,<note place="margin">August. de doctr. Chr. lib. 2.11. Idem Epist. 131.</note> although he were nothing seene in the Hebrew, and but little in the Greeke. In which toungs, the greater knowledge is the greater gift of God, which although he do not graunt in abundant sort to all, (as to one he giueth this thing, to another that, to the end that all may stand in need one of another) yet it is good for a Diuine, to know something in them, that when great doubts arise, he be not quite to seeke, albeit he be not so well furnished, as to reade a Lecture of a toung in an Vniuersitie. In that little wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I haue taken notice, which I confesse is not much, I do find in some of the Auncient, ouersights which are greater then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie, for want of vnderstanding in the originall of the Hebrew; and this hath fallen out in the greatest controuersies. I will name one for all, but such a one, as then the which nothing is more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident, nothing is more materiall. He who hath read the old Councels, or the Ecclesiasticall storie, or the writings of such Fathers, as succeeded the time of Constantine, within one or
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:623:194"/>
two hundred yeares, may sufficiently see and surfet, how Arius and his companie oppugned the Godhead of Christ, and his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie with his Father. What more maine question was there euer concerning the grounds of Christianitie, or what could possibly strike deeper? In the reading of those forenamed wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, we find that at the first Athanasius was the onely man, for writing and disputing, to oppugne them; as was euident in the Nicene Councell, and otherwise afterward. And he suffered so much for his labour, that he well deserued to be called a ring-leader, and bel-wether of the flocke, a pillar of the faith, that inuincible Athanasius, a champion for Christ Iesus, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer else is honorable. Yet it is maruell to see, how in all his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations he is troubled with that place, in the eighth chapter of the Prouerbs,<note place="margin">Prou. 8.22.</note> where wisedome saith of her selfe, (which he cannot chuse but interpret to be the Sonne of God) <hi>the Lord made me,</hi> or created me <hi>the beginning of his wayes,</hi> whereout the Arrians vrged, that Iesus Christ in the Godhead was made or created, and consequently was a creature, and so of another substance.

Yet because the solide substance of all which Iohn did say, was reduced to that head of repentance, and to informe them, that the kingdome of grace, and appearance of Messias, was now to be seene of them, all his doctrine and preaching is layed downe in that briefe summe. So it may be rightly supposed, that this messenger did tell a longer tale in Niniue, euen the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of himselfe, to procure more credit to his words: and the recounting of his punishment, and escaping from the same; but

Secondly I do not thinke, but we may also apply them, when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> we vse some allusion, which is consonant and agreeable to the analogie of faith, or in which there is reason to thinke in the true feare of God, that the Lord himselfe had a reference to such matters.<note place="margin">Ioseph. de bello Iudai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co. lib. 6.6.

But farther, if each man will take the paines to looke on himselfe in priuate, he may say that he hath had his fortie dayes oft-times told, together with Niniue our citie here.

               <hi>The mercie and expectation of the Lord is great toward thee, for when the Angell had offended, he stayed not at all for him, but threw him downe to hell, and when Adam transgressed, he did not deferre his punishment, but droue him straight out of Paradise.

Which although it be all one, to a man prepared (as all of vs euer should be) as if it were at more leysure, yet how fearefull and dreadfull is it, when we looke on common men, of whom we haue little hope, that they haue called for mercie? Imprint this in your hearts and reuolue it, deare brethren, and tell me whether my speech be vntrue and false, that we haue tasted of clemency, more then this city of Ionas did.

            <p n="14">14 The second thing here worth the noting, in these words of our Prophet, is that he letteth them know, that they should be ouerthrowne, but he doth not tell them how.

They entertaine that opinion, that it is God who doth threaten them, and allowing him thereupon, to be infinite and Almighty, as amazed men they do feare, what possibly may be dreaded. He is of force to do what he pleaseth, and they onely must be the sufferers. Now as euery man will graunt, that one skilfull at defence, may rap a sillie child, who hath neither strength nor knowledge, and may strike him at his pleasure, on this side and on that side, and aboue and vnderneath, because euery way he lyeth open, so God if he see cause, can lay a burthen of any kind of trouble on men or ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, who must take what he offereth, and in no sort can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde it.</p>

               <p>The chiefe poynts. 1. The Niniuites are not obstinate, but yeeld. 3. The force of the word of God. 5. Conscience and present feare maketh sooner to repent. 6. The Pastour must not be discouraged if at the first he preuaile not. 7. The Pastour is neare to God. 8. Therefore he should be very wary. 9. The people should vse their Ministers reuerently. 10. Godlinesse is most imbraced where it may be least expected. 11. Fasts are to be proclaimed by the Magistrate. 13. The force of fasting and praying. 14. But we are negligent herein.</p>

That the voyce of musicke should be turned into mourning; the sound of the viole and harpe, into howling and schreeching; that the Princes and beggers should be equalled together, that the daughters of Niniue, the daintiest of ten thousand, depriued of their delicacy, and luxurious attire, the ioy of their hearts for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,

            <p n="5">5 And although they had many things, yea all the things that might be, to deteyne them from these good motions, prosperitie, securitie, satietie of bread, a wall of sinne about them, a sea of sinne within them, superstition and ignorance and contemning pride, which so loueth it selfe that it loueth not to bee controlled, yet the breath of one mortall man (although inspired indeede from an immortall God) doth ouertumble all. For first albeit the words of his Sermon, be most briefly set downe here, yet without question he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueighed against their sinnes, the enormitie of their liues, the crookednesse of their wayes, their outragious impiety, their insolent intemperancie.

The Atheniens and Greekes who neuer knew God did admire vertue, as

But where the Lord himselfe speaketh (if men be not impudent, euen their faces of brasse, and their bowels of the adamant) they must needes shew a conformitie, in acknowledging the equitie of his exclamations against sinne, howsoeuer in some mysteries they yeeld not their consent.<note place="margin">Petr.

For what could be (thought they) more reasonable, or more holy or iust, then that men should not steale, or murther one another, or liue in adulterie, or dishonour those that bare them, or abuse the name of him, whom they accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for their God, and so of the rest? Thus ignorant men do assent, that there is a good and an euill, a lawfulnesse and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulnesse, that vertue is to be praysed, and sinne deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth punishment; and this opinion well rooted in the men of Niniue, doth make much for the Prophet. Secondly it is manifest, that his threates were of such daungers, as were soone after to follow, so that wrath was at their gates, and vengeance at their doores, and would quickly breake in vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them.

For a long space together, he made no speech in the Senate house about whatsoeuer businesse, but that was brought in, as his conclusion in euery Oration. But this earnestnesse of his preuailed not. And that so much the rather, because Scipio Nasica with a contrary opinion, did in euery speech maintaine, that it was for the good of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane common-wealth, that Carthage should continue. Yet as Pliny writeth,<note place="margin">Plin. Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. Histor. lib. 15.18.</note> when Cato on a day, brought a greene figge into the Senate house among them, and auowed vnto them that but three dayes before that figge was growing in Carthage, he made plaine demonstration to them, that if the wind did serue, and all other things were ready, within the space of three dayes, an enemy might come from Carthage to Rome, with a fleete of ships, and an armie, and besiege them in their Citie. And the nearenesse of this daunger, did so much mooue, and earnestly affect the beholders, that whereas they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer before be brought to it, they gaue not ouer till Carthage were layd on the ground. Beware of euill at hand: it is that which stingeth in earnest.

Then let the faithfull Pastour, who standeth betweene the

But let not him appoint the time, and be wiser then his maker. It is the Lords owne word, a softening, seasoning, piercing, a working, winning word, and by the force thereof, he who hath fished a whole night, and caught nothing, may make a draught to be wondered at,<note place="margin">Luc. 5.5.</note> in a Sermon of one houre. That sinfull man Ionas, who lately by his notorious diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and sleeping vpon his fault, had prouoked the Lords high displeasure, and was accordingly chastised for it, hath his labours so countenanced, and graced euery way by his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, that he stirred the greatest city that all the world had, to fasting and repentance. And shall thy single heart deuote it selfe to the Lord, and consecrate all his ability, sincerely and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tierly to the honour of his name, and to the enlarging of his kingdome, and shall not a blessing follow thee, yea an inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable blessing?

And God forbid, that the pastour who ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth to bring the stray sheepe home to Christs fold, should loose his reward with the Lord, for his willing trauels sake; although he should be refused or reiected by men. This is the comparison of Saint Austen. And he addeth farther afterward, that Christ wept ouer Hierusalem, and professed that he would haue gathered them together,<note place="margin">Matth. 23.37.</note> as a hen gathereth her young ones vnder her winges, and yet they would not. By this sayth he; he intended to teach vs, that if we striue to conuert men to grace, and do not obtaine our purpose, we should

not thereupon sinke and be discouraged in our hearts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ sped so before vs. So if we do our dutie, we are sure on euery side. To winne nothing, is the worst that in reason can befall vs: yet we our selues do fare well. But if our faith bee stedfast, and we apply the meanes without fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, we may build so farre vppon God, in the confidence of his promises, that for his owne names sake, and for his Churches sake, our worke shall grow and prosper. If the heart within be perfect, and the externall powers be vowed to God as a sacrifice, our lippes, and tongue, and mouth, shall be instruments of his prayse, to the great loue of the godly, and wonderment of the wicked. It is more then an ordinarie trust, to be put in trust with such Oracles, and that eye which neuer slumbreth,<note place="margin">Psal. 121.4.</note> doth follow and obserue those, who haue this in their charge: and if this trust be discharged, he crowneth his seruants here in this life with much comfort. For there is no ioye like to this ioye, when a man doth tread the steppes of the Sauiour and Redeemer of the world, and is a meanes vnder God, to saue the soules of them, for whom Christ came from heauen. There is no comfort like to that comfort, to stand in a congregation, and turning this waie and that waie, in humilitie to say vnto the Lord, <hi>Behold here am I,</hi>

It must be the publike crier, and publike authoritie, which must set a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>broach such things. So it was in England in the fifth yeare of her Maiesties raigne, when by the most sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred power vnder God, and by aduise of the chiefe gouernors, it was established, that ouer all the land, there should be set ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence and prayer, that the Lord would be intreated to stay the hand of his destroying Aungell, who then ouerthrew many thousands in this kingdome, with the plague of pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.

It is no true fast in a Christian common-wealth, which is begun and ended, with manifest disobedience to that superiour power, which doth serue the same God with them. Do thou expect direction from them, whom the Lord will haue to rule, and be not so censorious or Criticall toward them, whom thou (when thou doest wisely and reuerently consider of it) doest know to be no enemies to God and true religion, as to thinke that they conceiue not the conueniencie, and necessity of extraordinarie humbling of mens soules to the Almightie, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when they are warned of it, and religiously requested.

Fast twise if God do so mooue thee, in steed of euery single time before intended; once to turne away the wrath gone out against the land, and secondly, that the Lord will mooue them that be in authoritie, to do that which is truly pleasing in his eyes. So thou hast saued thy owne soule, and the burthen shall lye on the conscience of other. But take heede of seditious singularitie, and ouer-weening contempt, and condemning of other, lest thou more offend with that, then thou profite with thy abstinence. Diuinitie will not iustifie it, that if a Christian state shall giue solemne entertainement, for dismissing of Embassadours, who may be suspected to come about no religious practise, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters on the other side at the same time, and in the same place, should of purpose to crosse the first, proclaime a solemne fast: or if the chiefe Church-gouernour should bid stay a while, for reasons not irreligious, inferiour men should therefore make a great deale more hast. Neither may the examples of others make good this. We liue by lawes, not by examples. Euery man must not carie the sword, or be a commaunder.

My Ionas too well knoweth the fruite of that in his Niniuites, among whom it wrought not least with the eternall Father, when so openly and generally they did that which they did: for all of them did fast, and all of them put on sackcloth, from the highest to the lowest, The King and his Princes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, the people followed after: but the greatest beginne, and the least follow. The eldest are not excluded: the youngest are not excused:<note place="margin">Psalm. 51.5.</note> for the child but of one day old, is of spotted seede and corrupted. But all of them ioyne together, that if one want deuotion, another may be right; if one of them preuaile not, yet the multitude may obtaine. What a sight was this to behold, that young and old, male and female, the Ladies and their handmaides, the Nobles and their seruants, should be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully lamenting on their faces, with voyce lift vp vnto the highest heauens? How would this pierce to the throne of the vnappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chable Godhead, what heighth could keepe this backe, what cloude would not this seuer, what heauen would not this enter? When so many thousands crye, al Niniue with one eccho, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fraude or hypocrisie, how could God chuse but heare, for the great mercie which is in him? The ioynt prayers of mortall men, haue much force with the Lord. For, to speake after the manner of men, suppose that he were hardly bent to take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance vpon a nation, &amp; at first when they should call for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, would seeme to be on sleepe; yet would not this awaken

him, when he should haue no rest? when on the right hand and left hand, before him and behind him, at the doores and at the windowes, and at the floore which is vnder him, there should be knocking and bouncing, which will not be answered with si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, nor take any deniall. The diuersitie of the noyses, as the shrill voyce of the infants, the wailing of the women, the how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the men would mooue him who is most setled. Their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious importunitie will wring foorth pitie from him. Then it is a fault in vs, that when Gods heauie hand, doth lye sometimes vpon vs, we come not with our forces vnited to sollicite him. We do in a sort strain curtesie, who it is that shal go to Church, but the most will be away. And those who come do it so coldly, that it is as good that they were absent. It is the great congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of spirits throughly mooued &amp; kindled in deuotion, which doth winne God ouer to vs. When citizens who haue trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed, shall open their gates to their Prince whom they haue offended, and the men and women and children, shall lye pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate at his feete, and acknowledge themselues wholly at his mercie and discretion, his heart melteth on them, and spareth them being thus cast downe. So would God deale with vs. But our proude mind commeth not to this: although much miserie be vpon vs,<note place="margin">Basil.

Saint Basile complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that when a most grieuous famine pinched his citie of Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarea, yet very few of the inhabitants sought for remedie. <hi>I come</hi> saith he <hi>to Church to preach or to pray, but scant any is ioyned with me. The men are about their marchandise, the women about their profites. But very few are with me; and those who be, are so gaping and wearie, and so itching vp and downe, as if they looked still when he who readeth the Psalme, would make an end, that they might withdraw themselues from the Church as from some prison. The most here are the scholers who come from the schoole, which take this comfort by it, that they are from their bookes the while, and make no more vse of it: but the stronger sort the while are carelesly gadding through the streetes.</hi> See if he paint not out as with a most perfect pensill, the time wherein we liue.

of merchandise, many thousands of men besides those few which are lost, had perished, and the Lord knoweth what had beene done. And yet the prices of all things continue exceeding deere. Now in this case do we from the greatest to the least, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble before the Almightie? Nay as Basile saith, few come, and those who come, come so carelesly and sleepily, as if they were not present at all: but in many great townes and cities, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a day of ordinarie Lecture, men and women are so scant to be seene, that indeede the boyes of the schoole are more, then all the Church besides: and yet they be not many.

How would the Pastour delight, to see a great flocke about him? how would euery true heart ioy, to heare the sound of Psalmes sung, like the showte of a mightie armie? How would the Lord be pleased to be mooued &amp; called vpon, by the prayers of such a multitude? We cannot excuse this.</p>
            <p n="14">14 Yet I commend the men of Niniue, for what they did, they did wholly.

For what do we in comparison of those infidell heathen men? We haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued gifts farre before them, but bring foorth fruite farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them.

They had the word but one day, or a very little time, but we euen fortie yeares, a goodly space and a large: and therein line after line, and precept vpon precept, now a little and then a little: yet in so many diminishments and extenuations of theirs in comparison of vs, they repented, and all of them repented in sackcloth and ashes, in fasting and lamentation, but we without repenting, go on to prouoke his wrath. Then what

Nothing certainly, but some few such righteous, as were not to be found in Sodome:<note place="margin">Gen. 18.26.</note> but especially his owne mercie, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth vs vnthankfull persons, for his owne sake, and his Sons sake, and for his Churches sake. Let vs pray that this fauour of his may yet lengthen, that it be not cropped off with violence, that we feele not that indeede, which the Niniuites did but heare of, yet a very little while, and much sorrow and affliction.

which vnto some is Lucifer, a bright morning starre arising in their hearts, whereby they are rowzed vp, and stirred from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie and sinne, but to other is Hesperus, an euening setting starre, whereby they are brought to bed, and layed asleepe in impietie. To this purpose we neede no example more signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant, then the preaching of our Prophet, whose words by their contemptuous receiuing of them, were a meanes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to the Israelites, adding hardnesse of heart to their rebellion and vnthankfulnesse; but were such an occasion of peace to the men of Niniue, that no where in the world, hath the word by teaching wrought greater effect, in so short a space of time. In the describing whereof, I lately gaue but a glaunce, dealing no otherwise therin, then if the gardiner topping a tree, should cut off here a bough, and there a shred, that he might afterward come to the maine stocke it selfe. So I haue prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the way, to shew the meanes of the fast and repentance in that citie, by touching the precedent circumstances: but whereas exegetically or expositorie-wise, it is now more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amplified, I am at this present to discouer particularly the substance of all that is here done.</p>
            <p n="2">2 When the Prophet then hauing entred the citie, had in terrible and fearefull sort cried out, that yet for some few dayes it might be spared, but after that glasse runne out, Niniue must be ouerthrowne, the auditours are affected with that horrour of conscience, and miserable molestation, that by their distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, their King doth take notice of the imminent daunger, which was denounced from God; and being prouident for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and his people which were vnder him, he taketh a course, I cannot tell whether more holy, or more happie, to turne away the wrath, which was comming out against him. For by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation which was made with good aduise, he inioyneth a fast for the taming of the flesh, a generall fast both of men and cattell. But to the end that he might seeme to be most liuely touched himselfe, and that he might the more stirre vp the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to deuotion, he performeth all ceremonies of debasing and deiection. He who sate in his maiestie before, now ariseth vp as forsaking it: he who was distinguished from all inferiours, by sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:623:216"/>
in a throne, as if it had beene in a solemne Parliament, now standeth among the common sort, as a person of no reputation. He who before was couered with a royall and princelike robe, layeth the same aside as loathing it, and putteth sackcloth vpon him, and to his tender flesh he ioyneth dust and ashes. An example which very few times hath beene heard of in an Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicke, and therefore it is the more worthie our best considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For the expressing whereof, after some studying what way might be most commodious, I resolued to treade these steppes: first to note some things in generall, concerning him and other Kings, which notes are insinuated by the text: then in speciall to examine the manner of his proceeding, which is varied by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse braunches. But first here it is said, that word of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets preaching, was brought to the King.</p>

            <p n="3">3 I suppose it to be no straunge matter, that speech of the great abashment of his people, should be brought to this King: for the crye of common miseries, and open desolations, will preasse into the Court, and to the hearing of the Prince, who although he seeme to be aboue ordinarie, yet in care he is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed by small things, and such as be but contemptible in shew. <hi>The abu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dance of the earth</hi> saith Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

it is not this, which I hold so necessarie to be obserued, that the king should know of it; but rather that so soone it should come vnto him, for immediatly vpon the crye of Ionas against them, the best vnderstoode of it. Which albeit it may be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the amazednesse of the people, who were not aduised whither else to seeke; or to the idle curiositie of some, who were glad to carie newes of any thing, yet I rather ascribe it to the good gouernment of the King, and his orderly proceeding, that his house was so setled, and his Court so disposed, that matters of moment were imparted to himselfe. He himself did not stand still, as an image wrapped in gold, very glorious without, yet neither seeing nor hearing, but putting all ouer to other, but he saw with his owne eyes, and heard with his owne eares, and with his owne heart considered. And vnto this opinion of him I am induced, by reason of those gracious parts, which the text recordeth to be performed by him, &amp; could not haue beene so done, vnlesse there had bene in him a sensible feeling, with great vnderstanding of his place &amp; office, which groweth by practise.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The manner of some Courts is, that to satisfie the aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritious, or ambitious affections of some few in place, the humor of the Prince is fed with faire tales, or iests, or delights, yea wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse peraduenture, that the other may sway all things at their pleasure. Placentia are sung, and that which may content<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If Sara a faire woman,<note place="margin">Genes. 12.15</note> although a straunger, come into Egypt, the Princes of Pharao will thinke that to be a tale woorth the carying to their maister: but if it be businesse which toucheth neuer so neere, that must not be told, for feare lest it should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet. Thus by his voluptuousnesse, the King is made a child, and as Salomon saith,<note place="margin">Eccles. 10.16</note> 
               <hi>Wo is to the land when the King is a child,</hi> not in age so much as in manners: the land is impouerished, the subiects are iniuried, iustice is troden downe, iniquitie preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, a confusion of all things is begunne and continued, and he who should amend it, silly man is brought a bed with fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and securitie. So no man is more a straunger to his owne charge, and the heauie burthen which lyeth vpon him, then he who is most interested in it.<note place="margin">Vopiscus in Aureliano.</note> Vopiscus in the life of Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, doth vtter to this purpose a good speech, which as
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:623:217"/>
it seemeth he borrowed from Diocletian, who sometimes had made triall of it. <hi>Foure or fiue in the Court gather themselues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and take counsell to deceiue the Emperour. They tell him what is to be liked and allowed of. The Emperour who in the meane while is shut vp at home, doth not know the truth. He must onely know that which they will speake to him. He maketh such Iudges as be not fit for the place, he remooueth such from the Common-wealth as he should keepe, and in briefe the good Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, the honest and wary Emperour is bought and sold by them.</hi> If the good be thus dealt with, how pitifully are they vsed, who willingly fancy, and embrace all delights, tendered to them by their seruants, and are nusseled of purpose, that they might vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand nothing, and thinke very well of it. In such places and with such persons, it is likely that a messenger, who should haue brought such melancholike newes to the king, might haue stayd without doores, or perhaps haue bene sent backe againe, as wise as he came.</p>
            <p n="5">5 But this monarke of Niniue, is not made of that mettall. Such cases as much import, are brought to his hearing. He knoweth that the Prince, as the father of the countrey, is set ouer the people for their good. That the foundation of iustice remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in his owne person, and is thence deriued vnto other men; that if he cease to do iustice in his owne person, if the case do so require, he should by right cease to raigne, and giue ouer the name of a King,<note place="margin">Dion. lib. 69. <hi>Noli igitur regnare.</hi>
               </note> as a woman once sayd to Hadrian the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: and truth cannot be knowne, but by taking and admitting speech from the parties themselues. This is the cause, why the report of Ionas is first brought to his owne hearing, that he may know and iudge, and take order accordingly. This may be a lesson to all the Princes of our time, that they themselues be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of all great causes of estate; that they leane not wholly vpon other, because the Lord hath layd the charge vpon them; but especially that their eares be open to Gods word, when it shall be deliuered by the Prophets, that they may be taught thence, what is healthfull for their people, and acceptable to their maker, on whose seruice their prosperity doth wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend. Here may we conceiue the happinesse of our kingdome,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:623:218"/>
where God hath placed a gouernesse, who thinketh vpon such things. Hence also the Magistrate, and euery housholder, in his priuate family may learne, to giue easie accesse to sober infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that if there be any thing, that doth make for the good of their houshold, or other charge, it may not be reiected. It is best to quench fire, while it is but in the sparke, to stop a water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course at first, to bind vp a wound betimes, to kill young foxes in the neast, to meete with daunger, while it appeareth yet a great way off, and in such things not to rest on those who will faile, but to trust thine owne eyes, thine owne eares, thine owne knowledge. So, many euill matters shall be met with in the egge; good things shall be aduanced, and promoted oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely; and as among the Niniuites all points succeeded well, although they sowed in teares, yet they reaped in ioy, so shall it be with thee. But let word of causes important be still brought to thy selfe.</p>
            <p n="6">6 The next matter which in generall I note in this great person, is that God would haue him to be touched aboue other, that his humiliation might be accepted beyond others. For the Lord is much affected toward them, in the persons of whom he hath imprinted a maiestie, and by speciall ordinance hath made them his Vicegerents.<note place="margin">Psal. 82 6.</note> As he hath seated them in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of dignitie aboue all their fellowes, so the account which he hath of them, is of speciall property.

And if it be suggested that the faculties and abilities, which they had to do great things (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were mighty Princes) might make them to do such matters, as which others in their places might as well haue

effected; yet this serueth not the turne, since a spirite of rarer quality then other men haue enioyed, might apparantly be seene in them. Now where the Lord soweth most, he looketh to reape most largely. Where he powreth foorth most bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, he expecteth most gratefulnesse. And if his seruice be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, but especially contemned by these royall Potentates, he taketh it more vnkindly of them, then of a common man. When Saul being brought to a kingdome,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 15.9.</note> from following his fathers asses, had faulted in that case of Amelek, what furies did follow him euer after, with irreconcilable desolation? It was not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle punishment,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 11.4.</note> which followed after the murther and adultery of Dauid.

The like may be sayd of many the persecuting Emperours: when they being aduanced by Christ, turned their swords and scepters against Christ and his Gospell, he did not long endure their tyrannie, but with violence cast them downe.</p>
            <p n="7">7 But on the other side, God so embraceth the true piety of those in highest authority, that themselues are not onely blessed for their entire deuotion, but their people for their sake. The blessings powred on the heads of them, runne downe vnto the skirts and lower parts of their garments. When such as by Gods hand are lifted vp aboue others, do come nearer then their people to the heauen, not so much in place as in spirit and the inward man, the Lord doth accept them with greater fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and acquaintance.

In Saint Iohns Reuelation, where the Lord himselfe is described in inconceiuable glory, the first thing

How the Gentiles respected this, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by that of Alexander,<note place="margin">Q Curt. lib. 8.</note> who when a poore souldier of his owne, who was as stupefied and amazed with cold and hunger, was by himselfe set downe in his throne neare the fire, told him that if he had so done to the royall seate of the Persians, it wold haue cost him his life, but this saith he shall saue thy life; meaning that there he should be warmed, and freed from his cold.

Then for the king of Niniue, being set in open shew, to arise from his pompous place, is a signe of much humility: to top himselfe, to come downe, with such a depressed diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so grieuous to flesh and bloud, is a matter which is not common.

When the nedle touched with the load-stone, shall beare it selfe toward the North, in passing a great part of the earth or sea, it is a great alteration, when it comming vnder the Equinoctiall line, must giue ouer that property wherein before it was excellent, and might iustly haue caused no little admiration.

common men: and they would that nothing should be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to them, which might increase an opinion of estate. We see that some inferour persons, do pin their greatest felicity on the gaynesse of their backes. There is more care to adorne the body, with vanities and new-fangles, then to beautifie the soule with sanctity and deuotion. The worke of wormes shall not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, to cloath a worme-eaten body. Colours shall be brought from the sea, and pearles taken out of fishes, gold digged out of the earth. Ethyopia and both the Indies shall be ransacked for new deuises, and these things shall be put on with more greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, more carefulnesse, and more orderlinesse, then if it were to do that, which most nearely appertaineth to the gaining of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.

And if it be a griefe, and euen a death in comparison, for such as are not the most honourable, to part with these vanities (for who would liue to lacke things hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some?) how might it straine the heart of a King, to be vncased in such sort, as to put off that which distinguished him from a common man? I feare that there be many in our age, who hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would yeeld to this. Yet the great ruler of Niniue doth make no stay thereat, but at this time putteth away from him, his robe of greatest dignitie, as a hinderance to true piety.

Then if we did as we should, we should seeke to diminish the faults of former ages, and not to adde vnto the measure of them.

Moreouer as the king of that nation, did so ouersway all his subiects, that he brought them also to God, so let all who haue any other vnder them, stirre vp those to true holinesse who are committed to them; that many hands being lifted vp together, may take the stronger effect.

For sitting in his throne, and seate of royall estate, he commeth downe from it, and being attired with princely attire, he putteth that off him, and seeming for his person to be no better, then any of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, he goeth yet farther, and as one meaner then the meanest, putteth sackcloth on him, and sitteth him downe in ashes. But as in the naturall body of a man, it is not sufficient that the heart alone be warme, but the heat of it must be a propagating heate, which may breede the like in the rest of the members, and be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly diffused to the exteriour parts, euen the hands and feete, which are the remotest portions of that <gap reason="foreign">

lyeth on him to do, if himselfe be throughly warmed with heate of deuotion, vnlesse his people also do participate that qualitie, and be brought euen feelingly to know their owne miserie, that so they might worke meanes to appease the Lords displeasure.

            <p n="2">2 This maketh the king of Niniue, who for his owne part had tasted of remorse and anguish of conscience, for his offence toward the Highest, to be willing that his subiects should runne to the same fountaine of sorrow &amp; teares, that with many grones of heart, and much weeping of the eyes, and many hands lift vp, the long suffering God might be mooued to compassion. And if this did not suffice, then his farther desire was, that the empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the reasonable creatures, and hunger of the vnreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ones, euen the oxen and sheepe and cattell, which should breake foorth into bellowing, &amp; bleating and out-crying, might extort and wring foorth commiseration.

And in this last case, the king of Niniue may well be proposed as an example very singular, who thinketh not his dutie to be discharged at all, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse besides the subiecting and debasing of himselfe, he do stirre vp his people to a liuely apprehension of the state wherein they stoode, that they as the followers, &amp; he as the leader, but both they and he, &amp; he as well as they, like humble suppliants might make intercession, to recouer Gods fauour, or at least to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.

But the meanes whereby men get faith, are visible and externall, as the hearing of the word, the receiuing of the Sacraments, the repairing to the Churches where religion is set foorth, the flying from the Synagogues of heretikes and schismatikes, lest other should be infected: the forbidding of their assemblies: and these things Princes may not onely vse and set on foote, but they are bound by dutie to the highest Lord, to exercise and execute them.<note place="margin">2.

               <pb n="451" facs="tcp:623:230"/>9 I might amplifie this by the example of Iustinus the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, spoken of by Euagrius,<note place="margin">Euagr. Hist.

He is not the most eminent, whose weakenesse is such that he must onely follow other men; but since none here can be absolute, as it is the highest glorie to giue, so to take it is no dishonour. Who was euer among the Romans more gracious for his person,<note place="margin">Plutarch. An seni sit gerenda res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publ.</note> or glorious for his actes, then Scipio Africanus, and yet as Plutarke writeth, he so vsed his faithfull and true friend Laelius for his counseller, that some spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not to say, that Laelius was the Poet, and penner of all the play, and Scipio did but act it, and present it vpon the stage. True wisedome had taught that honorable Generall, to be no way wanting to himselfe, howsoeuer other men would talke their pleasure of it. I could wish that in our age, persons of high esteeme, would so vse the help of their wise and faithfull friends, that they might oftentimes runne into so happie an errour. You see that he who commaunded Niniue did hold this rule; and the Spirit of God doth record it to the instruction of our age, and (if we will so receiue it as I haue expounded it before) to his exceeding commendation, that in so waightie a cause he would take the aduise of his Nobles. And yet to say what I thinke, it may not vnfitly be gathered, by those deedes which are reported of him in the former verse, that he himselfe stirred vp his Princes, and was as a spurre to them to giue assent to his Edict: howbeit to shew his mind to be temperate, and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and humble vnto men, as well as deuout to God, he ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them with himselfe, as not failing to grace them, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them in their places. The ambitious man, and he who is
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:623:231"/>
desirous of much gaine agree in this one point, that they loue to haue no fellowes. The man who is greedie vpon money, excluding from himselfe all other companions, can in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate thought onely, deuoure the greatest pray. And the haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and proud heart, being like to the iealous man in his iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie, loueth not to communicate to other, the least part of that honour, which gladly he would appropriate to his owne actions.

He was a wise father who taught thus, and he was a son much to be esteemed, who so inwardly embraced his good precept, that he thought of it many yeares afterward, &amp; recorded it to be remembred of others. Now if it were wisedome and modestie in him so to do, then what humilitie was it, for the great king of Niniue to ioyne with him, I do not say his fellowes (for this great Monarke had none such) but his subiects in his stile, <hi>by

prices. But I will not pursue that argument. Onely thus much I may say, that the reproofe which Saint Austen vseth against the Manichees, doth fitly fall vpon these men, sauing that those old heretikes did hold that for euery day, which our Papists hold but for some daies.<note place="margin">Augustin. de moribus Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nichaeorum. lib. 2.</note> But Saint Austen derideth those, when they thought that he was not more abstinent, who fed moderatly and sparingly, onely vpon salt swines flesh, then those who at their pleasure swilled in wine, and the purest iuyce of the most choise fruites: who did eate most fine cakes, and sweet meats of all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, and rice, and garden fruites belayed with pepper and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and the costly spice of the world. See whether in our time this be not a custome among some people, that if a man were disposed to Epicurize a little, he would not rather choose to fast as some hold fasting, then to feast at a sober banket. This is a blind superstition, and so palpably grosse and filthie, that if it. were not, that custome from old time had so preuailed, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse of our countrimen did yet so hold it in their blindnesse, (and it is our dutie to seeke to win them) I should thinke my self very idle, and should partly be ashamed to speake of it in this place. The fasts in Scripture are pure abstinence: men eate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing and drinke no water: but here they may eate and drinke, and be full and yet fast too. This is one of the grossest Paradoxes which the blind beast of Rome, that deceitfull whore of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, doth broach vnto her followers.</p>

            <p n="14">14 Yet these are not the onely errours, in the fasts of the Church of Rome, but this may be added to them, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they respect the externall worke alone.

            <p n="15">15 I do vrge this doctrine so farre, for some few who yet remaine in our land here and there: but not for the common sort, who stay themselues inough from taking harme by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stayning. For a great part of men spend much of their time in gluttony and riot; and very few now fast, if it be not for want of meate. And herein our sensuality may be iustlie reprooued, that whereas there is such occasion offered, to study for the turning away of Gods iudgements (which appeare in sending famine and otherwise) and againe when whatsoeuer is spared, may find good vent by poore mens bellies, yet we liue not so tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, as in reason we should. Surely the Almighty doth much threaten vs, and therefore we should awake: and besides that, we enioy many things, the continuance of whom is very well worth the begging, as especially the Gospell, and health and peace, and a louely and gracious Prince: let vs therefore not be so farre wanting to our selues, as to forget to pray that these may endure. And as here by the example of the Niniuites, there should in great cases be a great abstinence, so let euery ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ordinarily, so keepe vnder his body, that it may be fit for all ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall and spirituall duties. And yet I do not thinke it conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, for vs who liue in this countrey, to emulate and imitate the fasts of holy men in the Scriptures; I meane not, those of Moses and Elias, which were for forty dayes, and indeed were miraculous matters; but such as was that of the Iewes vnder Hester,<note place="margin">Esth. 4.16.</note> who did eate nothing nor drinke water, for three dayes and three nights; or of some other Christians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who as Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten mentioneth,<note place="margin">August. de mo ibus Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicae.</note> did forbeare in like sort, being both men and women. The difference of climates for heate and cold, maketh the stomacke different, and that may be endured in hote coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, which in the cold cannot. Their inward heate is lesse, and therefore their appetite is not equall. Philosophers and Cosmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers do yeeld the reason of this, and why men eate more in the Northern countreyes, then in the Southerne, and do digest it more readily. And experience doth so farre witnesse this, that as Buchanan hath noted,<note place="margin">Buchan. Hist. Scotiae li. 10.</note> the French men do thinke that we of Britany, that is Englishmen and Scots, are great deuourers of flesh: so the Spaniards thinke of the French men; and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Africa do imagine so of the Spaniards. Then is it an vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall match, for vs that are coldly situated, in comparison of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who liue nearer the Tropike, to imitate them in fasting. And this consideration together with a remembrance, that amating and feare of death, do vtterly quell the stomacke, giueth much light to that place,<note place="margin">Act. 27.33.</note> where it is written, that Paules company did abstaine for so many dayes together, in the daunger of a ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack.

So the people by their mourning attire, might be bettered in workes and conuersation, and Gods fauour might be procured, when there was a witnesse both inwardly and outwardly of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Now as this is worth the knowing, concerning the reason of the changing of their clothes, so the doubt may not vnfitly be mooued, why the beasts are named here, as if they had offended; and why they should be so disguised? The reason is very manifest, wherefore it should be so with the men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: they had grieued the Lord, by transgressions of all sorts, and therefore it was fit, that they should make amends.

            <p n="4">4 But one reason might be, that the people might in those creatures see as in a glasse, what was their owne state. For when their eares should heare the bellowing of the oxen, the braying of the asses, the bleating of the sheepe, the howling of the dogs, making piteous exclamation for want of foode to their bellies; and their eyes also should see the out-sides of them to be vgly

and deformed, like that ground which lyeth as ouer-growne, they might foorthwith remember, that themselues had deserued to be pined, and starued to death, and to be depriued of all pleasures, and delights which they did enioy, that from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth bearing on them many woes and lamentations, they might finally be ouer taken with vnspeakable desolation. God made such vse as this is, of the cattell in the old Leuiticall sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices: for when he for whom they were offered, did see them to be slaine, their bloud to be let out, some of them to be burnt, all of them to be vsed with much violence, if not quarte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and cut in peeces and mangled; he might presently be stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at the heart, to thinke of his owne deserts, that if he had his demerites, he should be martyred and mangled in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die here vpon earth, and his soule should burne and frie in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable flames of hell. It doth teach the Lyon obedience, when he seeth that dogge whom he loueth, and vseth as his play-fellow, to be cudgeled and beaten before him. And when for the young kings fault, the garment which he weareth should be beaten with many stripes, the Prince who had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, might learne what his errour was, conceiuing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe blame-worthy by that representation. The children of the Spartanes might make this vse, when they beheld the bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaues of their fathers, lye tumbling in that filthinesse, which drunkennesse caused to them, as to thinke that they should be but lothsome beasts, if they prooued to be drunkards. A sight so liuely in their eyes, might be as a sharpe spurre in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of the Niniuites, to deplore their owne case, with a most carefull contemplation of it, vnlesse they were insensible &amp; so obdurate in heart, as that no good thing could pierce them.

An insensible sort of people, if there should be any such, which in truth I beleeue not: but these Niniuites should haue bene like to them, if when they had beheld horrour and griefe, and weeping, and out-skreeking, in euery thing attending them, they would not be mooued to thinke, that their part was in the bargaine. And if it were so with that which wanted wit and reason, and knowledge to do euill things, how then should it stand with themselues, who had all these and abused them? Then the cattell serued in such manner, might bee an instruction this way to their maisters.</p>

Thus mans dominion is scanted, and drawne into a narrow roome.</p>
            <p n="6">6 But these creatures are not so quitted, but although they do lesse to man, yet with man they suffer more. For together with him, who now is but as a young maister, or a kind of quarter-maister to them, they stand both generally, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, in deepe disgrace. They which otherwise would haue taken pleasure to do the will of their maister, must now with blowes and stripes oftentimes be forced vnto it. They which should onely haue bene vsed to good, and to the glory of their maker, by his fault who hath fallen, are now applied to euill; yea they be not in that esteeme with him, who first

created them. As in earthlie kingdomes when a Nobleman, who hath receiued many fauours and materiall benefits from his Prince, doth requite him who aduanced and honoured him before, with treason and rebellion, then not onely his owne person (which lyeth subiect to the law) doth vnder-go the displeasure of his offended Soueraigne, but euery man about him, feeleth the smart of that rod, yea euery thing that was his; his familie is frowned on, his followers are held suspect, those which were preferred by him, are turned out of their liuelihood and maintenance; and moreouer his houses which were glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious before, are let runne to decay, their statelinesse soone droopeth, their beautie mouldreth away, his gardens and his orchards are ouer-growne with vncouthnesse, his fish-ponds and other pleasures lye disorderly and neglected; yea if there were any tame thing wherein he did delight, for lacke of being handled, it groweth wild and vntamed: So when Adam in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise, being in the highest degree of honour, prooued a tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour to his God, to whom he was beholding euen for his very selfe, the earthly house where he dwelt, grew out of fashion to him, his pleasurable profits were turned to bryars and thistles, the armes of his nobilitie were vtterly defaced;<note place="margin">Psal. 8.6.7.</note> but those who were his seruants, to attend and wayte vpon him, especially all domesticall kinds of cattell, partaking the reproch which lay vpon their maister, are subiected to much miserie. And as in ciuill affaires, the restoring againe of bloud, and calling backe into fauour, putteth life into all the adiacents, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants of whom I spake before, and maketh them resume some courage; yea the hope of such a matter doth a little cheere their spirit, but the greater the hope is, the greater is their ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critie; and yet as he still is deiected, so still againe they fall: Euen so without doubt, all regaining of good aspect from the Highest, doth refresh these inferiour bodies, as sometimes appeareth, when in noted prosperitie of the owner, the cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell fare the better; but while man doth stand disgraced, they must expect the like fortune; and if extraordinarily at any time he do smart, they must also looke for some vnusuall kind of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Then when this straunge feare and heauinesse, possessed

the mindes of the Niniuites, the horses and beastes of Niniue by partaking that miserie, which belonged to their maisters, might bee taught to be affected with some measure of that sorrow, as knowing that some euill was now lighting vpon them.</p>
            <p n="7">7 This matter will grow playner, if this also be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that the cattell manie times do actually feele shrewd paynes, together with their owners. When destructions happen vnto places, all things abiding in those places, haue their share in the miserie. When a towne of warre is assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, do not the houses oft tast of the enemies batterie, and are not those razed or fired, together with the desolation of the walles? Are not the trees of pleasure neare adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning verie often cut downe? Yea are not the horses woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and perhaps slaine in the fight? or other cattell burnt in the stall? Is not that prouerbe experimented diuerse times in this case, <hi>Loue the maister, loue his dogge, hate the maister,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Sam. 15.3.</note> 
               <hi>hate his dogge</hi>? When Saule was sent to destroy Amalek, was there not a strong charge layed vpon him, to kill the sheepe and the oxen, and euerie liuing thing? And if God send foorth a pestilence, come there not as well rottes of cattell, and great murrens of beasts, as mortalities of men? But if there should be some earth-quake, which either should cast downe the houses, and crush that which were vnder them, or should force the ground to open, so to swallow vp that where withall it meeteth, how could the dumme creatures hence escape? When therefore it was foretold, that within fortie dayes, desolation should betide the citie Niniue, and mention was not made in what particular sort it should come, the inhabitants could not tell, but that the beastes in their place, had as much neede to crye, as those who were their owners. Adde to these, that some liuing things whom vse hath made domesticall, are not so deuoyde of feeling, but that sensiblie they perceiue the ioy, or discontentednesse of those which are their keepers, and oftentimes are affected with some things like to man. Birdes haue their dumpes and their notes, and take knowledge in generall, when they heare

the voyce of musicke. Vsing to the hand, doth make the horse, and dogge and calfe, to play and be wanton, and to expresse some signes of ioy. And I thinke that I do not abuse the word, to say, that some of them in some things, haue a kind of fellow-felling with vs. Now there is nothing, which doth more teach this, then by giuing or denying them foode for their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, which was done among the Niniuites, while the fast conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued. For as the oxe doth know his owner,<note place="margin">Isay. 1.3.</note> so the Asse doth take notice of his maisters cribbe: although he be dull, yet his sence can serue him, to obserue those things which make for the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his paunch. And if this be moreouer true, that those beasts do take delight in their furniture and ornaments, and the proud neighing horse,<note place="margin">Iob. 39.22.</note> as we may gather from the words of Iob, knoweth when he goeth to the battell: if he thinke himselfe the brauer, for his saddles and caparisons, or bels or plumes of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which be about him; then by a reason drawne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, there may be in them a perceiuing, what it is to be spred with vile things, and so it might be a discouragement, to be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with sackcloth. So we see by this time, that it was not without reason, when by the proclamation of the king, the beasts had their part, as well as the men; that either as a glasse set before them, they might mooue them to thinke of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, by seeing the creatures, whose affliction could not chuse but touch them, since they are giuen to men for helpes: Or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by the prouidence of God, they are pinned to the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of man; in ordinary disgraces to be disgraced with him, and in sorrowes extraordinary, to haue their part in like manner. If I had not already bene ouer-long in this point, I might ioyne this also, to that which hath bene sayd before, that it is the more reasonable, that the dumme creatures should feele some por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the paynes for sinne, because they oftentimes are appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant meanes, and helpes and instruments, for men to sinne withall, as might largely be amplified. But no more of that matter.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 8 I obserued in the second place, that next to the sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth imposed on the men and beasts, it was inioyned by the King, that both the one and the other, should cry mightily to
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:623:240"/>
God. Then the next helpe which they had, was prayer and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation. I meane not much to dispute, whether the cattell may be sayd to cry to God. We may hold it for an vndoubted truth, that there be no such meditations, and reasonable discourses in them, as are fit to be in one of vs, when we are praying: they haue no such vnderstanding: and yet the Lord, who in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence doth take care ouer haires and sparrowes,<note place="margin">Luc. 12.6.7.</note> respecteth all their cryes, and taketh many of those cryes, as a kind of calling on him. We neede not feare to speake that, which the Spirit of God hath spoken. In the hundreth forty and seuenth Psalme,<note place="margin">Psal. 147.9.</note> our common translation hath, <hi>he feedeth the young rauens that call vpon him</hi>: the letter in the Originall goeth not so farre, but <hi>he feedeth the young rauens vvho do crye</hi> or <hi>croape,</hi> not mentioning that they call vpon God. But if we will supply it, from the nine and thirtieth of Iob, we may perfect it vp to this purpose: for there the Lord himselfe speaketh thus: <hi>Who prepareth for the rauen his meate,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob. 39.3.</note> 
               <hi>vvhen his birdes crye vnto God, vvandering for lacke of meate?</hi> He who heareth the cry of the rauens, heareth the cry of other things; and he who reputeth their croaping, a calling vpon himselfe, may do so in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures. Then it offendeth him not, when together with the out-cryes of the men, and the howlings of the women, and the schreeking of the children, the bellowing of the oxen, and the bleating of the sheepe was heard: nay without doubt it was the more gracious in the eares of the Lord of hostes. For as when men do sing, it maketh the more perfect musicke, to ioyne to their liuely voyces, the sound of diuerse instruments, which are dead matters without life or feeling, so it helped the heauenly harmony of these calling and praying Niniuites, to haue the out-cryes of the cattell mixed with them; and God did hold this varietie, to be the more perfect a consort. So that the place beareth it not amisse, that both the men and the beasts cryed mightily vpon God. But if there should be any man, more scrupulous then neede is, he may take this to be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the figure <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> which applieth vnto both, that which is meant of one onely: and the whole (by that meanes) hath that adiunct, which is proper but to a part. And then
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:623:241"/>
it may be vnderstood, that the dumme creatures had their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the sackcloth and the fast, but the men onely did pray. But be it either the one way or the other, it yeeldeth this lesson to vs, for the instruction of our duty, that when daunger is threatned, and there is feare or feeling of any direfull thing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon vs, among other our preparations, or aboue other if you will, we should breake into open prayer, and ioyntly deplore our sinnes, and so call to God for mercie. For if any thing in such cases will serue the turne, it is faithfull inuocation, which is better then all burnt sacrifice. Surely the King of Niniueh tooke the rightest course that may be; and whether it were that he were taught, and informed by the light of nature, or the teaching of any other, or by secret reuelation from the spirite of the Eternall, certainely he was in the right path<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, to purchase grace with God, when both himselfe and all his people, as humble suppliants did lift vp their voyce in prayer.</p>

As often as I see thee groning in the sight of the Lord, so often I do not doubt but the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost breatheth on thee: When I see thee weeping, I imagine him to be pardoning.</hi> So gracious and so pitifull is our good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to vs. We may then account it as one of our sinnes, that when inward and outward sorrowes, oftentimes do lay hold vpon vs, we do not vse this remedie. We go on like vnsensible men, as frantike ones being most sicke, and yet we vnderstand it not. And if we find that we neede helpe, we least of all require it by prayer; and he who should first be thought of, that is God the iudge of all, doth come last in the reckening. The Niniuites must all crye, and they must cry to the Lord, and nothing else, not to idols, not to Angels, not to Saints, or any creatures: but I handled that argument once alreadie, vpon some words of the second Chapter,<note place="margin">Ionah. 2.1.</note> that <hi>Ionas prayed to the Lord,</hi> and therefore I do now leaue it.</p>

Then it is not for any weaknesse in the Lord, that man should crye aloude, but to signifie that when we desire to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, our prayers should be vehement and with motion, not onely formall or perfunctorie, or cold, or drowsie and sleepie. But the vsuall prayers of the most men in our time are such; without touch what themselues do aske, and therefore it is no maruell, that they are heard so few times. It is a right good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and also a iust reprehension to the people of his time, which Saint Cyprian doth vse, and it may well be applyed to our age, wherein the minds of many in the time of their deuotions are v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon pleasure, or profite, or some other such earthly thing: Thus he speaketh:<note place="margin">Cyprian. de oratione Do nanica.</note> 
               <hi>Let all earthly and secular and carnall thoughts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, neither let the mind then thinke on any thing, but onely that for which it prayeth. What sluggishnesse is it to be estranged and taken with vnfit thoughts and profane ones, when thou prayest to the Lord, as if there were anything else whereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon thou shouldest rather thinke, then that thou art speaking with God. How doest thou require that thou maiest be heard of God, when thou doest not heare thy selfe? This is to be awake with the eyes, and to be asleepe with the heart, whereas a Christian man should then be awake with his hart, when he sleepeth with his eyes.</hi> Here that we may testifie our zeale, and withall preuent this drowsinesse, it is not amisse when we find our selues to be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, that we do such things, as may be in place of whetstones to sharpen vs; as to bend our knees, to cast vp our eyes, to lift our hands to heauen, to beate our breasts, or the like, yea also with contention of spirit, and extention of voyce, if time and place serue, to releeue our own infirmitie.

            <p n="2">2 Then, in the tenth verse, followeth Gods accepting of their sorrow, and how mightily their deiection, and debasing of themselues in sackcloth and ashes, with fasting and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, wrought effectually with the Highest, to diminish his displeasure, yea to remooue his wrath. But because the closing, and shutting vp of that serious Proclamation in the ninth verse, doth intimate some opinion (although it be with a fearefull mammering) of some such thing as might be, that the Lord might be appeased, although that were not very likely, in the eyes of flesh and bloud, that must not be slipped ouer, but taken in the way. For thereby it shall appeare, that sinne is very horrible to the conscience of the sinner, conceiuing the guiltinesse thereof, that it may well make a trembling, and shaking and dread, a suspition that God will not be mooued to mercie, and yet this distrust doth not so kill the minde, but if faith be vnderneath, it will presume the contrarie, be it neuer so weakely. It doth not resolue for, neither yet define against. On these termes, in these words, standeth the great King of Niniue. But that which was to him vncertaine and
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:623:246"/>
vnresolued, is determined by God, and he spareth indeede. Now that the doctrine may be orderly deduced from these rootes, for our better instruction, we may deuide the words, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> as the verses are deuided, into these two generall heads.

And herein the wisedome of the Almightie Lord, is very highly to be admired, that whereas he hath not giuen downe any law written in bookes, yet by the finger of his power, he hath written it in mens hearts, that there is a good and an euill: lawfull things and vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: that their wise men should teach, that the obseruing eye of some superiour Iudge, was euer at hand to looke on the deedes of men, and at one time or another, to make them smart for committing of euill.

            <p n="5">5 But as I take it, the wisedome of the Lord in decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the ignorant how far he hateth euill, doth appeare more fully in nothing, then by putting into men, a conscience within, which should accuse and condemne the most hard harted sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: which so often as by maliciousnesse great mischiefes are done, should represent the sinne vnto the inward thought, with terrible suggestions of vengeance to follow, and should giue no rest to the disquieted sinner.

which depresseth and crusheth downe, without recouerie if it be not helped with some better perswasion, sent imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly from God. There may in a naturall man, be a strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and wrastling against such motions: but his heart and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science are greater then himselfe, and will put him in minde, that terrible desolation remaineth for him, who hath sinned pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuously, or wilfully, and of purpose, and that he is not very likely to be quitted from such crimes. This knowing of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous iniquities in Niniue, doth make the king thereof, as one who was amated and distracted, to hope but doubtfully, and fearefully, for reconcilement betweene God and his soule, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Lord and his people.</p>
            <p n="6">6 And if he had reason for this, because of the heauinesse of that sinne, which euen by the light of nature, and assent of his owne heart, he might feare would be punished, we may make this vse thereof, that boldly and audaciously we diue not into wickednesse, and plunging into the depth, do not tumble in the suddes of it, and wallow in the sinke, lest when we would be glad to come foorth againe, and turne another leafe, distrust be our portion, and doubting in a high degree, whether God will receiue vs. It is good so to embrace the mercy of our Sauiour, that we also remember the seuerity of our Iudge. When for many yeares together, we with greedinesse haue drunke in the puddle-water of wickednesse, we cannot be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the Lord at our becke will bend himselfe to clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Perhaps, time may be wanting: perhaps the counsell of Gods Ministers; it may be the minde inured to a custome of filthinesse, cannot extricate it selfe: perhaps God will not giue the gift of repentance, but as we haue despised to heare when he calleth vs, so when we shall call to him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfully and vnfaithfully, he will not attend. It may be that the canker of desperate sinnes, hath so eaten out all faith in vs, that we cannot by any meanes appropriate Gods mercy, to our selues and our soules. It is a fearefull thing, when the Lords goodnesse shall be ingeminated againe and againe, to the fainting heart, how readie he is to receiue the repentant; how he calleth to sinners, and openeth the bosome for them, and

stretcheth out his armes: and how Christ of purpose came to dye for offenders; and yet all this shall find no other aunswer, but, These things are for other, they be not for me. I doubt not but the Ministers of God, who haue had tryall in like cases, do sometimes quake in their flesh, and tremble in their bones, to remember such examples, as their owne eyes haue seene. It had bene good for such, who at length be so touched, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede for all men, to haue made stay in time; for if they go on, and will not be reclaimed when mercy is offered, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth if afterward God will turne and repent, and shew pity vpon them?<note place="margin">

But on the other side, while it is in performance, sinne maketh much mirth and glee, and the humour is contented with it, but when it is come foorth, and now may be seene, it causeth to the committer more sorrowes and anguishes, then the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of a woman. And what can be truer? For what griefe is like that, when the creature who might haue bene assured thereof, shall make doubt of the mercy of his maker? It is not well, when the heart shall go but thus farre, at the highest, <hi>Who knoweth of God will turne</hi>? or it may be, that he will do it, but we cannot recken of it.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Yet as this which I haue spoken, may be gathered from the hardnesse of the thing, from the guiltinesse of malicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, from the strictnesse of Gods iustice, from the doubtfull speech of the King: So obserue I pray you therein, a faith like a graine of mustard seed, a sparke among the ashes, a little breath in the body. <hi>Who knoweth if God will turne?</hi> It may be: yet, it may be: it is not a thing impossible: God may do that which we thinke not of: no man can sweare the contrary.

That although in themselues the errours of men deserue desolation, and irrecouerable destruction, yet in that true compassion whereof God is the father, he may be pleased to beare, and winke at transgressions. So that when of mans part, not a dramme of any commiseration may be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, of the Lords part somewhat may be looked for. And that is the onely stake whereunto we must trust, the anker to flye to, the altar to lay hold on, in confidence whereof, the offender who can beleeue may lift vp his head; although his faith be full of weakenesse,<note place="margin">Psal. 130 3.</note> and had much neede to be helped. <hi>If thou Lord shouldst be extreme, to marke what is done amisse, vvho might abide it?

For all of it returned to the good opinion of himselfe; for he still remained in the sinne of pride.</hi> That man who would not be taken for such a Pharisee, and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be refused of the Lord, must thinke that there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else in the seruice of the Highest, then to say or seeme to be holy.

               <hi>Ad Orthodoxos,</hi> moouing this doubt, That if no change do fall vpon the Godhead, why the Lord did say, concerning the annointing of Saule, that he repented, and of the ouerturning of Niniue, that another thing was determined, giueth this aunswer to it: <hi>God both in that which he is, and in this, that he doth such acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as best beseeme himselfe, is immutable: but taking care of those who are subiect to change, he prouideth for the commodity of them, ouer vvhom he doth take care, and oftentimes he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth things. Therefore vvhen he doth pardon and vvhen he doth not pardon, he retaineth his immutability: for those vvho amend their faults, he pardoneth and changeth not, and those vvho re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in their faults he pardoneth not, and yet changeth not.</hi> He applieth this to Saules case, and that other of the Niniuites. The words are somewhat obscure: but in substance he decideth it thus: that the Lord doth hold fast his counsels, but yet chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth things of appearance, which it was thought that he min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Gregory whom I haue named before, hath a saying much to this purpose:<note place="margin">Gregor. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. lib. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Because God himselfe vvho is immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, doth change that vvhich he vvould, he is sayd to repent, although he change the things, but doth not change his counsell.</hi> If this yet be not so plaine, that the ignorant may conceiue it, then take it thus: that God from the beginning meant to spare them, but yet on that condition, that they should first repent. And to bring them to that repentance, he sent his threatnings by Ionas, of purpose wishing their good: yet because absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in word he denounced that vnto them (the more to feare and fright them) which he purposed but conditionally (if they turned not vnto him) therefore he speaketh of God, as they thought,<note place="margin">Hieron. in Ion. 3.</note> not as he did. Hierome doth fully giue downe his mind, according to some part of this doctrine: God is sayd to change his minde: <hi>Nay rather God perseuered in his purpose, meaning from the beginning to pity them: for no man desiring to
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:623:253"/>
punish, vvill threaten that vvhich he meaneth to do. Then by his threatnings he sheweth, that he meant not to destroy them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="14">14 For conceiuing of the rest, whereof Hierome doth make no mention, we are farther to take knowledge, that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally God when he threatneth, intendeth that if men repent not, then this or that shall fal out: but if they turne vnto him, that it shall not be done. And God layeth this downe vniuersally, as a certaine Axiome of himselfe, to be so vnderstood in all the course of the Scripture, where any threats are mentioned. But yet more significantly in no place, then by the Prophet Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy, where he speaketh in this manner:<note place="margin">Ierem. 18.7.8</note> 
               <hi>I will speake suddenly against a nation or a kingdome, to plucke vp, and to roote out, and to destroy. But if this nation against vvhich I haue pronounced, do turne away from his vvickednesse, I vvill repent of the plague vvhich I thought to bring vpon them.</hi> Now this being allowed for a maxime, all denouncings of iudgement from him, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in them a condition, secretly and inclusiuely: where if the threates be not executed, no absolute speech is broken (for farre be that from the Lord) but onely a comminatorie word hath obtained that, which it would haue. God sent vnto Ezechiah,<note place="margin">Isai. 38.1.</note> and bad him set his house in order, for he should dye, and not liue. This seemed to be an absolute speech, yet it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it this condition, if Ezechiah did not make his peace by teares and repentance: but when that once was accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, Ezechiah liued and dyed not. Yet because such feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full words, are deliuered from the Lord, as firmely resolued by him, and men know not the contrary, but that he meaneth to strike, he forbearing is sayd to change that which indeede he neuer decreed, and this supposed change he calleth a repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: therein framing his words to our dulnesse, who are men to be taught, and learne best, when we heare our owne phrases.</p>
            <p n="15">15 I thinke it yet not amisse, to mention thus much farther. That there be some of the ancient, who thinke that God fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his threatnings vpon Niniue, so that Niniue was destroyed: that is, the sinfull Citie did cease now to be sinfull, so that the euill of it was ouerturned, not the men, not the walles, not the houses; and this way God performed whatsoeuer himselfe did
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:623:253"/>
threaten.<note place="margin">Augustin. de ciuitate Dei. 21.24.</note> And this is the opinion of Saint Austen: <hi>The wals</hi> sayth he <hi>standing vp, the city was ouerthrowne in the euill manners of it,</hi> and so albeit not simply Niniue, yet sinfull Niniue perished. Hierome on the fourth of Daniel,<note place="margin">Hieron in Daniel. 4.</note> subscribeth to this doctrine, but it is in other words. <hi>The Lord doth change his sentence, but that is not on the men, but on the workes which were changed. For God was not displeased against the men, but against their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which when they were not in the men, God doth not punish that which now was ceased to be.</hi> He thinketh that sinne being abated, the city might stand vpright, and yet God keepe his word also. Thus we see that God, and good men agree, that it was that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance which they layed on themselues, nay which they layed on their sinnes, which kept them from the Lords punishment. For either God or they were to chastise their euill wayes. All ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie great or small, must of necessity haue punishment, either from man repenting, or from the Lord reuenging. But he who repenteth, layeth a chastisement on himselfe. Then the vpshot of all, is on the part of these Assyrians, that with their teares and cryes so affectionate and so passionate, so harty and sincere, the Lord who had strong reason to deale with them as with So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to root out their memoriall from the earth, and from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heauen, hath changed that doome, which of likelihood was to be pronounced against them. His anger is appeased: his fury is dissolued: the city standeth as it did: no ruine, no destruction.</p>
            <p n="16">16 This is a great comfort to vs, that if the Eternall father did deale thus with these Ethnickes, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they turned to him, he turned also to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nay he first se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t one to turne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we may assure our selues a faire deale more of his mercy: if after our transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, &amp; very many infirmities, we run &amp; fly to him with a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing sorrow.

and sueth vnto vs that we would be his owne. Let vs not take heart thereby, to abuse his kind affection: let vs not prouoke his iustice, with wilfull prouocations. He loueth to spare, but such as are willing to be spared: not those who offend vpon malicious wickednesse. He ouerthroweth the proud Oke, which will not stoupe at his blasts, but he cherisheth the bending reede.

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing now come to this fourth Chapter which is the last of this Prophecy, and remembring with my selfe, how long it is since I first began this worke, I partly imagine it to be fatall to the businesse which is handled in this booke, to be done very slowly. For the Prophet was very long, before he would begin, and could not be haled to it, till it might not be auoyded: sometimes he goeth backward, and other times slowly forward, and what with flying to the sea, and lying there in the whale, and going afterward to preach, and staying when he had done, he is long about a little. And God hath so disposed of me, that I haue bene much slower, in opening to you how farre he is from speede. Before that I can come to this fourth Chapter, the fourth yeare is now expired, in which time a quicke discourser, might deliberately haue gone ouer a good part of the Scripture, if either this place had called him oftener to it, or other occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s had not elsewhere diuerted him. But be it as it may be; Gods will must be done: and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he may be pleased to affoord so much grace, that he who

hath attained to the end of three, may complete the fourth also, that so, although slowly (for ouerrunning my Prophet) yet surely at the last, according to that power which God shall giue vnto me, I may on to the end.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Now then hitherto we are come, that he who at first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused and could not be induced to it, hath preached to the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuites as sharpe as sharpe may be: yet fortie dayes, and Niniue is like to be destroyed: and his sermon hath so wrought, that their beautie, and pleasure, and musicke, and all mirth is turned out of doore, and sackcloth and ashes, and weeping and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, great signes of repentance are come in steede of them: their heart is dismayed, and their whole bodie shaken: no helpe now nor comfort,<note place="margin">Philo Iudae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us in legati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one ad Cani<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> vnlesse it be from heauen. But where mans means do faile, there Gods mercie doth breake foorth: he is mooued to pitie, and in commiseration all past shall be pardoned. Here a man would haue thought, that in the meane while, the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger as sent from God, and therefore full of all mild and loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behauiour, would haue opened his heart with the largest ioy, because the seede which he had sowed, had fallen in so good ground,<note place="margin">Matth. 13.8.</note> that it had now brought foorth not thirtie, not sixtie, but many thousand fold. That his toung had so farre beene the instrument of Gods glorie: that his threates as the thunder shold so be trembled at: that his mouth had in so high a degree beene the meanes of the Lords mercie, that both Prince and people, old and young should be quit of their transgressions, and excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of their iniquitie. But it falleth out cleane contrarie, and he as the man who had onely learned that lesson, to do nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, is growne into great anger, and is so filled with choler, that he fretteth and chafeth hand-smooth with the Lord, that he had not razed downe the whole citie Niniue euen to the foundation. That which should haue beene to him for his glory and his crown, to haue helped so many prisoners from the dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon of darknesse, and the shadow of death, is the greatest vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and corrosiue that might be to him in his distemper; which yeeldeth to vs a singular example of the infirmitie of man, that such a one as he was, on so light an occasion should be so farre offended, and that with God himselfe. The true cause whereof,

howsoeuer it seeme different and diuerse to diuerse, yet by all is agreed on to be most blame worthie. I cannot so fitly expound the manner of it as this historie requireth, but that by degrees I must descend vnto it, and so out of one thing winne the matter of another. I thinke therefore best, first to referre all things to these two heades, a generall doctrine which may be gathered in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> grosse, and a particular instruction which the words literally of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> both fitly in my iudgement taken out of the text.

But most do conceiue that Ionas in his owne person deliuered this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie to the Church, (and there is no reason to the contrarie) but yet from the beginning to the end thereof, he telleth such a tale, that if all his enemies should haue studied to lash him, they could not haue matched that, which his owne hand hath publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed: not one word to his commendation, but all to his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praise. That he fled from his charge, and would haue gone to Tharshish: that he slept in securitie, and a heathen man did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake him, and teach him his dutie: that the lot fell vpon him as a noted malefactour, that for his due desert (after that a tempest had pursued him) he was tumbled into the sea: that there for three dayes he was iayled vp in a whales belly: that all that while he was little better then in distrustfull despaire. Nay moreouer, that when he was out againe he preached indeeed, but as a shrewd cow after that she hath giuen milke, doth cast it downe with her heele, so he marred all with his murmuring, and furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous displeasure. And this was the case of Moses, who without doubt wrote those fiue bookes which are called by his name: &amp; there as he spared not his brother nor his sister,<note place="margin">Num. 12.1. Exod. 4.25.</note> that is, Aaron and Miriam, nor Tsippora his wife, if she came in his way, so he least fauoureth himselfe, but relateth that the Lord had almost killed him for his negligence,<note place="margin">24.</note> in not circumcising his child: that in those prouocations wherewith the people prouoked God himselfe did fall to murmuring: that the Lord was so displeased with him,<note place="margin">Num. 11.11. Deut. 34.4.</note> that therefore he debarred him from comming into Canaan. Thus the inditing spirit doth rule the writers pen, and as ouer-maistering the hand of a young learner, maketh him to set downe what it will, and not what the other fancieth. This is one great argument of the finger of God, and a supernaturall power that is in these bookes of holy writ, that not flesh and

               <pb n="506" facs="tcp:623:258"/>6 My next obseruation in this generall compasse, is that Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas is here described, to haue sinned once againe. This plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully appeareth in the first Chapter, &amp; so it doth in this last chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by the reproofe of God himselfe vsed toward him: and the words of my text do necessarily include it: for to be grieued at the Lords will, and to be angry at his workes, is a very high transgression. And so much the higher, because it is in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, a sanctified seruant, sequestred for Gods businesse, and attendance on himselfe, more enlightened then ordinarie, and better acquainted with diuine mysteries, then other men. Then from this man it is euident, as well as from Dauid, from Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, from Iosiah, from Hezechiah, from Peter, that the greatest in this life fall,<note place="margin">1.

Hist. lib. 6.35.</note> who denying repentance to sinnes after Baptisme, and secluding offendours from acceptance into the congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among the faithful, much impeached Gods mercy, and layd an intollerable burthen vpon mens consciences. Why should the seruant be hard, where the maister is easie and gentle? Where the wise owner is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, why is the steward straight? When he whom it most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth, hath proclaimed by his Prophet,<note place="margin">Ezech. 18.21.22.</note> that if a sinner repent be it once or be it often, from the bottome of his hart, God will put away his sins quite out of his remembrance. Indeed from the falles of the old Patriarkes, we should not learne, to aduenture vpon iniquities with greedinesse and boldnesse, lest presuming, we come short of that which was granted vnto them. For if we will prouoke God, in hope of that which in likelyhood will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be giuen to vs, because we would so prouoke him, who can tell whether the Lord will turne, and repent, and abate his furie? The end wherefore the examples of fals in the greatest men, are

Yet it is a thing too common for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines and carnall men, so to apply good to euill. <hi>Many vvill fall with Dauid</hi> sayth Saint Austen,<note place="margin">August. in Psal. 50.</note>

            <p n="7">7 Saint Chrysostome taketh occasion by Dauid,<note place="margin">Chrysost. de paenitentia Homil. 6.</note> of whom Austen also spake, to draw a threefold benefit from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of his transgression, which I thinke not amisse to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in this place. <hi>Dauid</hi> sayth he, <hi>for three reasons vvas suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to go astray. First that he might make the righteous man to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> looke more earnestly to his way. He perhaps sayth to himselfe, I am a religious man: I am famous for many merites: now I haue done those things which appertaine to the garland. Deceiue not thy selfe,</hi> sayth he, <hi>thou hast done no more then Dauid.</hi> His mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, that if such captaines and leaders in the faith, so gracious with the Highest, so acceptable in Gods sight, yet by humane infirmities haue fallen, and fallen notoriously<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then no man shold be proud, none senslesly secure, no man confidently foolish, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his turne may be next. He should set a watch before his heart, and a hatch before his lips, that nothing may enter thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nothing may come out thence, which is not weighed and ballanced. And that this is one of the causes, why the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sights of the best are made knowne in the Scriptures, Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten also consenteth:<note place="margin">August. de Doct. Christ. lib. 3.23.</note> 
               <hi>The sinnes of great men are vvritten to this purpose, that the saying of the Apostle may euery vvhere be trembled at, vvhere he sayth, Let him that standeth, take heede lest he fall.</hi> The second reason in Saint Chrysostome is, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
               <hi>it might appeare, that Christ Iesus alone in mans body vvas pure from all offence.</hi> For if the holiest creatures, and most sanctified sonnes of women, men vpright and fearing God, men after the

            <p n="8">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 8 The third reason in Chrysostome, is a matter of more comfort:<note place="margin">Chrysost. vbi suprà.</note> 
               <hi>The faults of others are vvritten, that sinners may the lesse despaire of their owne errours: but if any one haue offended, let him daily confesse his sinnes: yea if he haue sinned a thousand times, yet let him go forward to confesse a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times.

<pb n="509" facs="tcp:623:259"/>
busie, to take aduantage of the tendernesse and softnesse of them, who earnestly desire to haue peace with God. And he seeing that it grieueth them, to displease so good a father, straightway representeth to their eyes the fearefulnesse of his iustice, and the multiplicity of their crimes. Oh it is a deadly enemy, suttle and full of sleights: he hath baytes for euery one. For the wanton, shewes of wantonnesse: for the idolater superstitions; for the Atheist, wayes of obstinacy: for the enuious, cause of spite: for him who hateth to sinne, a tickling pride of doing well: for those who loue the word, terrours out of the word, to beate them downe &amp; to drowne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: so that all threatnings shall be applied to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; mercies shalbe passed ouer, as no way appertaining vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort. How careful had we need be, &amp; stand continually on our watch, serue God while we haue time, pray to him for perseuerance, &amp; euermore be busied about that which is good, that solitarie idlenesse &amp; melancholike tentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, great meanes to a greater fall, do not grieuously oppresse vs? But to preuent that obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is common to all those who are so affected, as I speake of God who writeth for all our good, that testified in his sacred booke, that the bel-wethers of his flocke, haue stu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled &amp; lyen along, &amp; that not in toyes or trifles, but in causes of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, they haue giuen witnesse of much weakenesse. And yet they haue risen againe, more humbled and more purged, more renewed by grace, taught to flye from themselues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the throne of mercy, to repose all their saluation on him who is farre more sure,<note place="margin">Psal. 51 17.</note> then the strongest rocke or castle. And when the spirite is thus contrite, God accepteth it as a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice: he is so farre from despising the troubled broken heart, that he loueth it and embraceth it. Thus he dealt with them in old time, vnder the threatning law: and therefore he will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do so vnder the Gospell. The errours of our time are no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then theirs were: we are made of the selfe same met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall: he is made of the selfe same mercy.

The Lord thought best to spare the inhabitants, but our man is of another mind. Here in the meane time are two sides, but the match is very vnequall. I am certainely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that Ionas is not like to gaine much by such bargaines. The potter is of one side, and the pot-sheard of another. Fire and thunder and flaming lightning doth say it shall be so, and flaxe and towe doth say otherwise. And yet this weake one is right angry, that he may not beare away the bucklers. Now a man might haue seene this messenger a perfect male-content, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing went not as he conceiued before, that it should. But why should this fretter greeue, that Niniue should haue a tast of his mercy, who is the father of pity and compassion? All agree that he did so, but there is not any common consent, what that was which specially did mooue him. Hierome telleth that
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:623:260"/>
some imagined,<note place="margin">Hieron. in Ionae. 4.</note> that Ionas was now growne spitefull, and boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led very much with enuy, that the Gentiles should be called. As if Gods grace toward him, and other of his people, were now so much the lesse, because it was communicated to a forrein na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This was to make no difference betweene the sonnes of Cham and Sem: to bring Esau and Israel to be beloued alike. This were to make the Ethnickes as good men as the Iewes, yea to make such as were, or hereafter might be great enemies to Ierusalem, to tast the best fruites of Sion. Where then was the promise to Abraham, or the oath which was sworne to Isaac, if the Niniuites should be called, as well as the holy seed? Thus perhaps flesh might reason, and murmure in our Ionas.</p>

            <p n="11">11 But Hierome writing vpon this text, doth disclaime that to be the reason of this mans choler here, and cannot thinke that the Prophet was so simple, as to vexe at it. And indeed I am of this mind, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whereby he might well gather, that it was no newes, nor strange thing, that he should spare offenders. But what then was it, which caused this sorow? Hierome giueth a more pregnant reason, that he by this foresaw,<note place="margin">Hier. in. Ion. 4.

For if the rising of others had bin the sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of Israel, that ioyntly as two sisters they might haue serued the Lord, two people, but of one church, it had bin a gaine to the latter, but no losse to the former.

Not one word of reiecting: not any thing of his people. But to put it out of question. That had bene a zelous iealousie toward the honour of the Lord, an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Church,<note place="margin">Exod. 32.32.</note> an imitation of Moses, a drawing neare to Christ, a thirst that his people should be saued. But my text doth not grace it so, but calleth his passion, anger. <hi>He vvas displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: he vvas angry.</hi> And lest any man should imagine him to be angry and not to sinne,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4.26.</note> God himselfe is in dislike with him for it, which he vseth not to be, but toward those who transgresse, <hi>Doest thou vvell to be angry</hi>? Then let vs go a little farther, and take it that he murmured, because the Niniuites perished not: &amp; this not because he desired their destruction, as principally inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it; neither because he originally enuied their finding grace with the Lord; but because it followed consequently, vpon that which he intended. But the maine point which did vexe him, and put him to all the sorow, was lest he should be accounted a false and lying Prophet, to tell a tale, and deliuer a message which prooued cleane otherwise. He had spoken it definitely, in the name of the Lord, <hi>Yet forty dayes and Niniue shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.</hi> And since that the city stood in maiesty as before, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched and vnharmed, he might very well be taken for a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and a fainer. And this is declared by the text, to be the cause of his moouing. <hi>Was not this</hi> sayth he <hi>my saying, vvhen I was yet in my countrey</hi>? that is, did I not suppose, that thou who art
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:623:263"/>
so mercifull, and doest take pity so soone, wouldst relent from this thine indignation, and so I should be sent but on a sleeuelesse errand? Therefore I tooke this course, and preuented this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience by flying to Tharsis. Then his anger was, because by the Lords direction he was forced to say that, which he saw fell out otherwise.</p>
            <p n="13">13 It is his reputation then whereupon he so much stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: yet perhaps with a certaine reference to this, lest God should be blasphemed, and traduced as vnconstant. But vnder this opinion, not knowing of what spirit he is, or ought to be, in a most preposterous zeale he could haue wished with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,<note place="margin">Luc. 9.54. 2. Reg. 1.10.</note> that as in the dayes of Elias, fire might be brought from heauen, to consume the city Niniue, or that the earth might o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen vnder them and swallow them vp,<note place="margin">Num. 16.32.</note> as Corah and Abiron were serued. All this while he runneth on a very wrong ground, exacting ouermuch the rigour of the letter in his preaching, and not knowing that inclusiuely God vnderstood this condition, Niniue shall be destroyed: that is, if they repent not. But he is firmely perswaded, that the glory of the Lord is like onely to appeare, and be eminent by vengeance. He had already sayd it, and auerred it, that ruine and desolation was immediatly to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: and a Prophet was sent foorth of purpose to do that mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage; therefore in his opinion it is high time, that the thing were now perfourmed. If we thinke of him alone, then a matter of reputation and credit in the world, doth carry him so farre head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long. But that was fame dearely bought; and the credit of one man, prized at too high a value. What? must God be the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister and worker of his ambition, and must he establish it by such a ruine, and such destruction of so many thousands? This, although in a different sence, was pride little inferiour to that of wicked Haman,<note place="margin">Esther. 3 3.</note> who because he would teach such fellowes as Mardocheus was, next time to bow before him, would haue all the Iewes, which were dispearsed through sixe score and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Prouinces, to be slaine vpon one day, and the mighty king Assuerus must be he that must do it, by a very sharpe proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Our Prophet looketh so much to the ruffe of his owne glory, that rather then himself will be tainted for his word, not an
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:623:264"/>
earthly Assuerus, but God must be the instrument, to destroy the liues of thousands. In the warres, he is thought but a hard Generall and Commander, who when himselfe vnaduisedly by fury or sudden passion, hath sayd he will haue this; or such a day he will do it, when afterward it falleth out to be a thing of great difficultie, yet will thrust his souldiers on, and make them be slaine like sheepe; whereas if he had his will, that for which he did sweate, will bring no profit to him, but the matter is, he will keepe his word. Oh the liues of men should be deare, and bloud should be much esteemed. There was a Romane who could say, I had leyser saue one citizen, then destroy ten of mine enemies. The Niniuites who formerly were miscreants, are now come to be Gods subiects: then Ionas thou shalt be but a bloudy lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if for thy words sake, thousands of them should dye. It is better, that thou shouldest loose thy will: better that thou shouldest lose thy longing, then they should lose their liues.</p>
            <p n="14">14 If it were, that he thought the glory of God was ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded by that bargaine, and thereupon he was angry, that is a most inconsiderate zeale, to take on him to be wiser, then the very fountaine of knowledge. Can man be more iealous then God himselfe is of his glory? Can the creature better know what belongeth to it, then his maker? How dareth flesh band with God, for iustice or for mercy, or for true vnderstanding? Were it not the easier way for it, to thinke it selfe to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, to be defectiue, to be farre short of the Lords proiects and purposes? and to suppose that he best knoweth what is fittest for himselfe, and for all those which are vnder him? If the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet had bene set to the guiding of an Elephant, or a ship vpon the sea, he knew not how to rule it: yet the silly man would now sit in a throne, and dispose of Niniue, and by a consequent, of the world, and of God also, how he should order it. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be the Lords honour which is in question, yet he will be the caruer, to tell what best befitteth. It had bene his part ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to subiect his discretion to the discretion of his maker, and if that wise Creator would in iustice haue proceeded against that people, to like well of that iustice, because the Lord liked of it: but if he would haue inclined to a fauourable pardoning,
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:623:264"/>
to be best pleased with that.<note place="margin">Exod. 32.32.</note> Nay rather if he with Moses had stept in as an intercessour, it had argued more charity; or if he imagined that to vndertake that, was too hard a point for him to manage, yet at least vpon the smallest inkling, that grace should be affoorded, he should haue waited for it, and should haue reioyced that light might breake out of darknesse, and that the frowning countenance of God, had bene turned into a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. And if he could not be induced to go thus farre, yet he should neuer haue made stay, to be content with the Lords do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: let him worke his will: but to fret and grieue and vexe at it, yea to chide with God as he did afterward, is a fault of a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous nature.</p>
            <p n="15">15 The doctrine which we must learne by it, is of more then ordinary benefite.

               <hi>Thou ô God being deepe in counsell, and hearing the substance of my mothers desire, didst not care for that which she did then aske, that in me thou mightest do that, which she euer asked.</hi> Thus the Almighty dealeth with other of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, working all things to the best, but it is at such times as he himselfe doth thinke good. If it be in him to blesse, it is in him to do it, when it seemeth good to himselfe. Therefore let vs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be angry, and repine at that, which he altereth from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of our mind.</p>
            <p n="16">16 But among all, let the Minister be most patient this way. He peraduenture beateth downe pride, or cryeth out against ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion: he is derided for it: then he powreth out many threats against scoffers and deriders. If repentance follow in them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and so their prosperity continue, let not him be offended at it, but let him rather reioyce, that God hath so prospered the word which came out of his mouth. Againe, it may be that he requesteth at the hands of his heauenly father, that he would spare some whom he seeth to be tempted, and in Christian commiseration, wisheth that they were refreshed, with the sweete deaw of Gods comfort: Or else he seeth some tainted with superstition, and doating on the See of Rome, whom yet he loueth in humane affection, as being of neighborhood or kinred, or because they be of his charge, or for their louely behauiour, and other amiable morall vertues. Let him vse the best meanes that he can to bring them vnto the sheepfold, by preaching, by exhortation, by conference and by prayer, but especially by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and holy conuersation: but if God still shut their eyes, let him not be angry at it, and fret against the Almighty: but leaue all to his dispensing. Perhaps that houre which afterward shall appeare, is not yet come. Perhaps God meaneth that it shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer come; but according to his vnsearchable purpose, he will leaue them in darknesse. Here do thou admire Gods iustice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them; but his fauour to thy selfe: stand amazed at the one,

and kindly embrace the other: but be patient in both. And as it may be sayd of Socrates, Aristides, or Curius, or Fabricius, that for the desire of honesty which was more in them, then in other people of their time, we could in humane commiseration, wish that they were in heauen, among the Lords elect, but that when we in Christian vnderstanding do thinke vpon the matter, we find that it is not for vs to be more mercifull, then God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of mercy, and fountaine of louing kindnesse; so in this case of our owne experience, we may not take vpon vs, when we haue wisely considered of our duty, to be more pitifull to our friends, then God who is perfect pity.

not in this? When worldly things do faile vs, and there is helpe from no man, when friends are few, or weake, or absent, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps growne vnfaithfull, but foes are fierce and malicious; when Sathan himselfe suggesteth all things to the worst, when the thoughts within are much disquieted, the conscience euen amazed and standing at the gaze, scant knowing which way to walke: then to powre foorth our complaints, and discouer our miseries to him who doth know all, because he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie, to him who considereth all, because he is our father; and who both can and will take pity of the distressed. The pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of this, doth both expeditely and assuredly bring reliefe to him that trieth it: that sigh which breatheth out sorow, by a backe-breathing bringeth in ioy. That hand which being thrust out, doth reach a supplication vpward, reacheth downe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation: deliuerance doth breake foorth, or at least patience sitteth within: yea now there may be ioy in suffering. Thus mercie is powred downe, and seasonable showers of sound and sure refreshing do fall vpon vs, as vpon the thirsty land. Were it not for this precious ointment, the heart which is sometimes puffed and stretched with care, would breake and rent in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: but by praying it is suppled and mollified, and stroaked, till it returne vnto his setled nature.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Then are not we to blame the while, who hauing a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie so faire, so louely in it selfe, for what is like speaking to God? so profitable for vs, for what doth so asswage our grife? so acceptable to our maker, for what doth he account a better sacrifice then this? so readie at hand to vs, for where or when may we not pray? Yet in our manie molestations, we ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seeke to ease our selues, with any thing then with this; and so indeed we disease our selues, either presently heaping more euill vpon euill, or if we thinke that we slacke our sorow, it commeth foorthwith more vehementlie on vs, as the feuer doth to him who drinketh cold water in his fit: there may be a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficiall skin bred aboue, but rankled, festered, dead flesh doth putrifie vnderneath.

if we speede not there, then more money shall be imployed, to fetch it another way: if that practise go not forward, we will trye a farther conclusion of slander and defamation, so to quit a friend in his kind. If that way we cannot reach him, yet we will haue our peny-worthes out, in railing vpon him, or at least in secret whispering: inward we chafe, and outward we act it, with more then tragicall gesture And thus we do in those things, which we account not as trifles, but in such as bite and gripe vs, and breake our sleepe and quiet. Yea in matters of greater consequence, we runne a very wrong race. If our conscience be now touched with the horrour of some thing past, or feare some future punishment, or a falling away from grace, which terrours are sometimes incident to the faithfull, we either wish merry company, or some sport to passe the time, or musicke, or some stage-play, or if we be much possessed, we throw our selues on our beds, and in melancholy we muse, or we walke so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie, till we be euen steeped and dissolued in most dull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, the heart frighted, the spirits weakened, the braine crased, the remembrance perished, and so either Gods graces are obscured, and diminished in vs, or endangered quite to leaue vs, which I cannot speake without horrour. Where now is our Christian wisedome, and spirituall vnderstanding, when we haue a helpe so compendious, so forcible, so effectuall, to be wanting yet to our owne good? Here the author whereon we should take told, is earnest and frequent prayer: we are to get vs into our chambers, and there with mightie contention, to knocke and rap at heauen gate, to begge resolution and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant patience, of him who denieth not any good thing to the asker, that so the issue may prooue well, and the end may be with comfort. In this sort to sollicite with a liuely faith, and not sleepingly or faintingly, is the launcing of that impostume, which doth canker and heate within vs: and this we may do, if we were but single &amp; alone. But if this serue not the turne, then let vs ioyne with other faithfull: the more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany the more cry. Where two or three be together, there Christ will be among them.<note place="margin">Matth. 18.20.</note> That which commeth slowly when it is intreated by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall ones, commeth quickly when many are ioyned together.

               </note> so is it sayth Saint Gregorie, <hi>vvhen we ioyne hands in prayer,</hi> we aske so much the stronger, we obtaine so much the sooner. But whether we be alone or otherwise, the heauen and our heart will make a consort, which will allay all distemper. If the fire be not thus let out, or our wine be not thus vented, it doth breake the place which holdeth it. Wise men vpon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation, lay it downe as a most expedient rule, that griefe of mind should be imparted to some one or other: it is much eased with the telling: but by taking part in the hearer, and by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell and comfort from him, it is very much diminished. If it be prescribed to vs, to do thus by man, then how fit is it that we should haue recourse to God, that we should double our selues before his approoued goodnesse, who best considereth, and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth soonest, and therefore were it but in that, he excelleth all other; but otherwise none of Adams children is to be compared to him: for he scorneth not at the miseries of other men: he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembleth not hypocritically: he telleth no tales to enemies, who would ioy at the fall of those whom they hate: he playeth not false as men do, who take aduantage of the sufferings of their neighbours; but concealingly and compassionately he seeth all, and he salueth all. He then who flieth to this sanctuary, is well, and very sure of succour.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Then hitherto our Ionas is right, that in the midst of his disturbance mentioned in the former verse, he went and prayed to the Lord. But he doth not keepe him there: for although the cloth were good, he setteth an ill dye vpon it; yea he staineth it and marreth it all. For if we will but looke backward, and see what anger was in that mind of his, from whence all was deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and if then we will looke forward, and see how turbulent the words themselues are, laying a sault on God, and drawing an ill conclusion, from the pity of him who is most mercifull, and afterward wishing to dye, we may easilie coniecture that the fashion marred the garment, and the sauce disgraced the meate, I meane the qualitie of his worke, defaced the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

of it. For he prayed indeed, but it was tumultuously, and expostulatory-wise, rather chiding then beseeching: he calleth God to a reckning, as if his counsell were amisse, and Ionas were in the better: and on he goeth most impatiently, and wished that he were dead. How apparant is the infirmitie of man, and how vnfit is he for celestiall businesse, when our prayers which are the beautie and glorie of our best thoughts, shall be mingled with so much euill? And how do other men swarue, when Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets go thus awry? In matters touching men what slips are there, when in that which immediatly appertaineth vnto God, there is such stumbling and falling? How many are the sinnes, which we must haue forgiuen at Gods hand, before that we can speed well, when we faile so in his seruice? When euery thing requireth a purity and cleannesse;<note place="margin">Exod. 3.5.</note> the ground whereon we stand, that the shooes of all base affections should be put off from our feete; the Tabernacle whereinto we enter, that we should be washed and purged; the seate before which we appeare, that the best clothes of our soule should carefully be put on; his greatnesse to whom we come, that we should onely intend to him; yea the approching of our selues, that for that time at the least we shold be appropriated, and deuoted to himselfe, we are, and we are not; we draw neare with our lips, and our hearts are a great way from him. The very name of praying, and of praying to a Iudge, should strike a terrour into vs, and imprint in vs a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence both what we did and how.<note place="margin">Chrysost.

Yea if we will acknowledge that which is the truth of the matter, we are filled with such wandring thoughts, and stragling cogitations of Mammon and of ambition, of enuy or of lust, that rather we do any thing,<note place="margin">Deut. 6.5.</note> then that which we are doing. Whereas all the heart, and all the soule, and all the strength should be the Lords, the vigour of our wit, the intentnesse of our braine, the most fixed meditation of the spirit, that if it were a thing possible, we should be wrapped from the earth, and sequestred from that body, while we be in that holy exercise. Some other times, the manner is not the onely thing wherein we trip, but the matter it selfe is naught. For gold and precious stones we bring stubble and straw: we aske such things of him, who is an immaculate, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted and vndefiled spirit, as we would be ashamed that men should know. We tender that to our maker, which we would not aske of our neighbour. I do not here speake of such vanity, as wherein the Pharisee abounded,<note place="margin">Luc. 18.11.</note>

Do not these things very sutably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with so sacred a Maiesty? Do they not become vs very well? I doubt not but that we may aske for such things, as are needfull to this life, if we place them in their fit place, and sue for them with condition, If it shall seeme good to the Lord; but those other things are toyes and trifles, and do fauour of carnall

But Ionas thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth otherwise, that God might spare his honor, and himselfe might saue his labour, and stay at home at the first, and not come with a great shew, and all but in a sleeuelesse errand. And whereas he ranne to Tharsus, he supposeth that he had reason for it: he tooke the best course that might be; and if the Lord might be pleased so to thinke of it, he did well: he did as he should: that did he.

            <p n="12">12 We who neuer dranke of those dregges, yet may make the same confession: for we feele Gods fauour euery day. It is an argument of his loue, that we haue so many things, life and breath, and foode and rayment: that many such accidents do not ouertake vs, as whereby other come to ruine, sword and fire, and hunger and pestilence, and diuerse others occurrents, which destroy many in this life: that in so many prouocations, for forty yeares together we haue enioyed such rest, that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to come will heare it and scant beleeue it, but neuer againe expect it: the soule so fed and the body: such honour and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, in all the coasts of the earth, vnder a womans conduct, that we cannot chuse but confesse, that the Lords aspect hath bene good ouer this blessed Iland. But besides that generall sea of grace, which lieth open to all that come, how long suffering is the Lord to euerie one of vs? Indeed he is singular in clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, for when he found nothing in vs, why his eye should be vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon vs, then he preuented vs with grace, and touched our heart with a feeling.

            <p n="13">13 But to returne to my Ionas. Thou saidest when thou wast in thy countrey, that God was so kind and gracious, and would relent from the furie which he threatned to the Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites: then wherefore doest thou now grieue at it? Thou didst resolue before, that the end and conclusion would be such; therefore it is likely, that God aduisedly performed that which he did, since thou hadst thought so long of it. Then why art thou now angrie at it? Who would grieue that fire should burne, or water should be moist? that the earth should be dull and heauie? that the Sunne should yeeld foorth light? The creatures cannot so much challenge those properties, as God doth chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to himselfe the title of mercie. Then so it is, and thou thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest so, and saidest so long agone, and yet thou grieuest that it is so. Thou thoughtest it so in the Theorike, but beleeuedst it not in the Practike. He is gracious where thou listest, but must not be so where he pleaseth. To Ionas he is and may be, but not so to the Niniuites. But thou saidest that he would do it, and yet thou chafest that he did it. Now Ionas thou condemnest thy selfe: thine owne mouth hath so taken thee, that thou canst not auoide this straight. For if God be iust, and do punish this people, then thou saidest ill, that he would repent of the euill: if he be kind and do not destroy them, then thou frettest amisse, that he who is grace and pity, should shew himselfe in his kind.

Then thy collection for the iustifying of thine anger is most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd and preposterous: God is mercifull, therefore I fret because he will shew mercy: when it should haue bene cleane contrary, God is mercifull, therefore I should grieue, if he should not shew mercie to them: or, he is slow to anger, therefore he will forgiue them.

            <p n="14">14 It is a lesson to vs, that still we submit our iudgement to the iudgement of the Lord: that we seeke not with our owne wit to carrie that which is his, besides the streames of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, but to looke to his reuealed will, and with modestie and humilitie, to submit our selues thereunto. For if vpon any affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of discontent, or enuie, or ambition, or gaine-saying, we will varie from his designements, he will let vs be as absurd and vnreasonable as Ionas was, to please our selues in conclusions, which manifestlie teach the contrarie to our opinion.

And if we be as Ionas, that is Prophets, &amp; will be foolish, in things which touch his owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations, he will most of all take and whip vs. In this case Gods counsels are deepe, and oftentimes leaue a scarre, of a mind vnsatisfied in it selfe, or of iust reproofe with other, when the crachets of our wit must ouer-rule his will, and we will haue it our way, when God hath sayd it otherwise. What a dash of great reproch to this day,<note place="margin">Vineentius Lyrinens ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers. haeres. cap. 23.</note> did light vpon Origene, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the feare of a farther danger, when the spirit of his conceit, must be taken for the marrow of the Scripture, and looke what with trickes he deuised, other men must straight beleeue. His conclusions grew as inconsequent, as euer this did of Ionas. Because we also are Prophets, let vs feare in like sort, to force the word of God to any thing, but to what he meant it; or to broch any new deuises by singularitie of opinion. For as the
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:623:275"/>
Lord both blesseth and graceth things done with a good mind, although they haue their imperfections, so when our purpose is but vanity, or rarenesse, or a fancy to sing a note beyond all men, in that where soundnesse seasoned with care and industry, is best, God a little to bridle vs, leaueth vs vnto our selues, and in steed of praise more then common, our spot is more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. Concerning the matter of Gods businesse, the best ground is the common way: to teach as the Lord doth teach, and as the words are naturally, and then if all other good helpes be vsed, it is not amisse: but let no humane passion make vs va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from the substance, because we will haue it one way, when God will haue it another, lest the Almighty be not so much honoured as otherwise he should, and we our selues be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforted.

had spared the king of Amalec, and by a greedy couetousnesse had saued the cattell aliue, he despaireth vpon those threatnings, which were denounced against him by Samuel: then he grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to lose his kingdom: afterward hearing that Dauid was the man, who should succeed him, he seeketh euery way to slay him. After his hatred toward him, he hated euerie man who in least sort entertained him,<note place="margin">1.

Being in vp to the shooes, he will on to the shoulders, and it was more by grace then by nature, that he had not diued ouer head and all. For first he had vnaduisedly resolued on the destruction of the city, without any sparing: and in his longing for it, he was growne bloudy in mind; then seeing that God would pardon them, he is displeased at it, and he prooueth angrie with the Lord himselfe. His wrathfull mind breaketh foorth, and excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing himselfe for all, he layeth the fault on the Lord. Yet here he sitteth not downe, but furious as he is, in all hast he will be dead, to be rid of all the trouble.

            <p n="2">2 In this place I am to handle the conclusion of his prayer; wherein after that he had tendered his owne iustification, as it is in the former verse, and had vexed himselfe that he could not see that which he intended, he requesteth that he might dye, accounting his peeuish anguish to be a thing so intollerable, as that a liuing man might not beare it. Wherein he still continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an example of humane frailtie, which being led by aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ction, and fancy-full opinion of some present incombrance, forgetteth the rules of piety, and very grounds of reason, and speaketh it knoweth not what. For how vnfit was that motion, because o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men must liue, Ionas himselfe will dye. Because he might not haue reuenge on those who hurt him not (for their
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:623:277"/>
faults were against the Highest) he would be reuenged on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Thus dealt he at that time; when as a man whose heart had bene seasoned with vnderstanding, should haue taken such contentation, at the conuersion of so many sinners, that his ioy should haue bene the greater, and his life should haue bene the sweeter, to see such a metamorphosis, that vnrepentant sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners should be now crying out for pardon. But my text leadeth me to speake, not what a one he should be, but what a one he was, and therein these two verses offer to vs seuerall matters: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the one, the desire of Ionas that his life should be taken from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> him: the other the increpation or rebuke, which the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth on him.

Is it nothing, that he hath giuen thee speech and reason, which he denieth to euery thing but man? Is it nothing, that his sonne redeemed thee with his bloud, and payd such a raunsome for thee? Or, to note what my text doth note, is it nothing that thy life is dayed and houred, and inched out, by a fearefull God and a terrible? who among so many motions, and directions, and disposings, and altering transmutations, of heauen and earth and water, yet hath thee so in his reckening,<note place="margin">Psal. 139.1.</note> and beareth such an eye vpon thee, on thy in-going and thy out-going, of thy lying owne &amp; thy rising, of thy sicknesse and thy health, of thy liuing and thy dying, as if onely he did intend vnto thy selfe in speciall.

But I speake here of that case, which might touch our Prophet nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer: that is, that although he did pretend, that he willingly would be dead, yet he doth not take a course, violently to lay hands on himselfe and his owne bodie, but prayeth the Lord to dissolue him. Wherein it appeareth, that although he were peruerse and discontent; yet he was not come to that height of iniquity and impietie, as to destroy himselfe. A sinne of the most straunge nature, that any is in the world, that whereas all other sinnes are to preserue the body, indeed, or in a fancie, in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance or in substance, this is to ouerthrow it. Yea to ouerthrow it with God, and ouerthrow it with man, in this world and the next, without hope and all recouerie, vnlesse the Lords mercie which cannot be limited, do that whereof is no warrant.

For thou must loue thy neighbour, but as thou louest thy selfe; and the patterne of all dutie to be extended in him,<note place="margin">Matth. 22.39.</note> is taken from thine owne person. Then when the Lord hath created thee, and put thee into the world, and bid thee there to keepe, as in a standing place, as in a watch or ward, from whence thou mayest not mooue till he come to discharge thee, wilt thou dare to leaue

cited to our Sauiour, by Satan the great tempter in the story last mentioned. When he would haue Christ throw himselfe from the pinnacle of the Temple, he incouraged him by that place of the Psalme:<note place="margin">Psal. 91.11.12.</note> 
               <hi>He shall giue his Angels charge ouer thee, and with their hands they shall lift thee vp, that thou dash not thy foote against a stone.</hi> Where, as euerie man may see, he cited the Scripture falsly, leauing out that which is very materiall, <hi>to keepe thee in all thy wayes.</hi> He shall giue his Angels charge ouer thee, to keepe thee in all thy wayes. I haue heard that a reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, preaching on a time in our sister Vniuersity, at the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall of one or two gentlemen, who came to an vntimely end by swimming, enforced out of that place of Mathew, that it is the pollicy of the tempter, to draw men from their owne wayes, to the waies of other creatures. And therin (as I haue heard) he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s way was to go, a birds way was to flie, as fishes way was to swimme: and if we would leaue our owne pathes, dangerously and without cause, to do as fishes or birds do, we tempt God in that case, and suppresse as much of the Psalme to our selues, as Satan did to Christ. For God will keepe thee in all <hi>thy</hi> wayes, not in the wayes of a bird, not in the wayes of a fish. I cannot say that at that time, by collection from that text, or by the dolefull example which was then before his eyes, that reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend learned man vtterly forbad that exercise, as impious &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull; neither dare I do so: for fishermen haue vse of it: and Peter in the presence of our Sauiour,<note place="margin">Ioh 21.7.</note> girded his linnnen gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him, and threw himselfe into the sea: and the meanes that some escaped from the ship-wracke,<note place="margin">Act. 27.43.</note> in the company of Saint Paule, was their swimming: and souldiers in passing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, are oftentimes constrained to betake them to this exercise.

How vncomfortable a thing is it, in a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall deadly wound, which may very well be thy share, to thinke that thou hast sought the dissolution of thy soule from thy body, and to haue rather stood on thy manhood, and fame with other men, then vpon thy Christian dutie?

What the Emperour Honorius, sonne to that good Theodosius, thought of this, appeareth hereby, that as Theodoret writeth,<note place="margin">Theodor. Hist. Eccl. lib. 5.26.</note> he tooke away all sword-playings and gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorie fights, which so long had bene vsed in Rome, because they were the meanes of many slaughters.

This was but a worldly reason, which yet holdeth among vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. But for the auoiding of slaughter, vpon other men or our selues, which point concerneth the Lords commandement, we should flie from these great occasions of murther, which is so horrible a sinne.

Yet one word more before I leaue this, and that is, that in the Primitiue Church, it was somewhat a strange kind of opinion, that men confessing Christ might make away themselues, to withdraw their bodies from torments, which their persecutours would offer to them; and they knew not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely whether their strength were able to sustaine.<note place="margin">Euseb. Hist.

And he addeth farther there, that a certaine Chistian mother &amp; her two daughters being taken, and fearing lest she or they should be defloured, which of all things she detested, step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped aside from their keepers, &amp; threw themselues into the riuer, and so perished in the water.<note place="margin">Cap. 27.</note> Afterward, the same Eusebius speaketh of another matrone, who going into her chamber, as it were to attire her selfe, while the officers of the Emperor expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted her returne, thrust her selfe through with a sword. And these matters Eusebius doth not onely historically relate, but by an insinuation, doth little lesse then commend them: but of certainty he euidently approoueth them. Now true diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie doth maintaine, that this praise is not good; but such deeds are very vnlawfull. God who simply forbiddeth all murther on our selues, doth also forbid this, because he giueth no exception

in this point or case, either directly or indirectly. The Prophets and the Apostles, and our Sauiour Christ himselfe, did with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie expect, that the will of God should be wrought vpon them by others: they did not make themselues guiltie, by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing violent hands on their owne flesh.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 11 Ionas being full of errours, yet knoweth that it is the

Lords part, to giue life and take it away: and he is not ignorant that to vse violence on himselfe, were a very grieuous sinne: but yet he goeth so farre, as to wish himselfe dead: he prayeth God to end his life, and concludeth it to be better for him, to dye then to liue. Here is a double fault in the Prophet; one, that the cause which did mooue him, to such vehemency of thoughts was a matter much vnbeseeming: for all his anger was, that the Lord would spare the Niniuites, which he thought was against his credit, and the esteeme of a Prophet; and Ionas by a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent is in this case growne bloudy. But of this before in this Chapter. The second fault is, that in this his mad and raging an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he doth wish himselfe dead. For this in him proceeded from a vexed vnquiet heart, possessed with impatiency, and not from a sanctified resolution. We deny not but in some cases, a man who is here on earth warfaring, and in a combat with his spirituall enemies, may wish himselfe out of life. As when there is a meere and feruent desire to be ioyned with his head, to be with the blessed Trinitie, and the Angels about the throne, as accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting that glory to be the garland, for which we must sigh and grone. And this doth Saint Paule teach vs by his euident example,<note place="margin">Philip. 1.23.</note> where he professeth of himselfe, that <hi>he longed to be dissolued, and to be with Christ.</hi> And this loue hath filled the minds of many of the martyrs, who thought all to be dung, in comparison of that heauenly celestiall beatitude, which is aloft with God. And therefore they feared not to presse on to that marke, by fire, and sword, and racking. And is these dayes of the Gospell, that is one of the consolations, wherein we do abound, that we see many of our Christian brethren and sisters, when in the extremitie of their sicknesse, they lye vpon their death-beds, to embrace our Sauiour Christ, and thirst for their dissolution, to thinke each houre a yeare, before they be in heauen. Againe, when there is truly in vs a setled hate against sinne, which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth from a seruent loue to the Lord, whom we grieue to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please, not for feare, but for kindnesse toward so gracious a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; then it it is a good desire, soberly and with ripe iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to wish our selues out of this body, where dayly we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke him, whom we loue so entirely. And in this also, we haue
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:623:283"/>
the steps of holy Paule to treade, and to walke in, who conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the great burthen of sinne, which was vpon him, and how it did euermore disturbe him, doth cry out passionatly, <hi>O wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched man that I am,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Roman. 7.24.</note> 
               <hi>who shall deliuer me from this body of death?</hi> Where certainely he intendeth so much, as that in this conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, he could wish himselfe from this earth. But on the other side, if they be but froward thoughts, and werying perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which distemper vs too much; or if it be for some sorowes, and afflictions which fall on vs; or because by one or other we are thwarted in our designements, then in wishing for death, we prooue plainely to be offenders, for want of submitting our will vnto the Lords will, for lacke of waiting with patience, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the leysure of the Almightie. If Elias that powerfull Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, be ouertaken thus, to cry, <hi>novv it is enough, O Lord take away my soule,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Reg. 19.4.</note> 
               <hi>for I am no better then my fathers,</hi> because Ieza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel pursued him, to destroy him if she could take him, he may not be excused.</p>
            <p n="12">12 But for our man, it is euident that he was in this bracke: it was no earnest motion to be with God which did stirre him; for now he was angrie with him: neither was it because he loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed sinne; for he heaped that as fast on him, as possibly he could: but because in a testie peeuishnesse, and vnbeseeming curst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, he could not see that effected, which he so hotely desired, that was, to see all Niniue brought to vtter desolation. And in this fury, the man would be nothing else but dead. He had neuer bin dead before, and therefore did not know, what it was to come vnprouided and vnfurnished, yea indeed clothed with froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, before so high a Iudge. If it then had bene remooued when it was in that fury, with what comfort could his soule ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch before the tribunall? Whereby it appeareth, how merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the Eternall dealeth with vs, who oftentimes in his loue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth to vs those things, for which we wish; which if we should euermore enioy, we were better be without them. Theseus as Tully saith,<note place="margin">Tullius Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic. lib 1.</note> by obtaining the thing which he desired, gained this, that his only sonne Hippolytus was lost, and torne in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The same which that fable reporteth, of those wishes which Neptune graunted to him, that they did hurt and not helpe
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:623:283"/>
Theseus, is true of Gods part toward vs: if he should euermore graunt, that which we wish on our selues or other, it would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerturne our bodies, and make our soules to perish. Do we not many times, vnaduisedly wish our selues in our graue, as Ionas did in this place, when I wis we little thinke it? And if then there should come any, who would take vs at our word, should we not make twentie pauses, yea a hundred exceptions, before we would be readie? It is but Aesopsfable, but the morall thereof is true,<note place="margin">Aesopus de Sene &amp; Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te.</note> that a poore and desolate old man, turning home from the wood with a burthen of stickes vpon him, threw them downe, and in remembrance of the miserie which he sustained, called oftentimes for death to come to him, as if he would liue no longer. But when Death came to him in earnest, and asked what he should do, the old man presently chaunged his mind, and sayd that his request vnto him was, that he would helpe him vp with his wood. This most commonly is our case: we would find some other businesse to set Death about, if he should come to vs, when vainly we haue wished for him. And it is not much vnlikely, that our Prophet in this place, would haue played such a pranke, when he prayed to God with such vehemency to take away his soule. But be that as it will be; let this stand good betweene vs, that with anger and with chasing at that which the Lord decreed, and with wishing death in his rage, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet highly offended. Which being so largely discoursed, now come we in the second place, to see how the Lord taketh this, which I shall passe as briefly ouer, as I haue bene long in the former.</p>

            <p n="13">13 That which Ionas had witnessed in the second verse of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> this Chapter, that the Lord is very mercifull and slow to anger, is in this place experimented: for when the pot-sheard so grossely had ouerseene it selfe, to grudge against the potter, the creature against his maker, the hote spirite of man would easily haue imagined, that he to whom the wrong was done, to the end that he might preserue his greatnesse entire, would haue let him knowne his owne, and receiued all roughnesse from him. How would a land-lord here haue ruffled vp his tenaunt? but
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:623:284"/>
the Prince would haue rung such a lesson to his subiect, that he should well haue remembred with whom he had to deale. Nay may we not iustly thinke, that the mighty Iehoua, who is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with the thunder, and clothed with the lightening, who speaketh and the earth doth tremble, who mooueth and the heauen doth quake,<note place="margin">Leuit. 10 2. 2. Sam. 6.7. 2. Reg. 5.27. 2. Chr. 26.19.</note> who blasted Nadab and Abihu dead in the instant: who stroke Vzzah in a moment, that he neuer spake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: who made the body of Gehazi, and the face of King Vzziah to be couered with a leaprosie: who so disgraced He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode,<note place="margin">Act. 12 23.</note> that in the ruffe of his maiestie he was eaten vp with wormes, would haue shaken vp Ionas so with tauntings and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches, that he should neuer haue forgotten it? But the Lord to giue a token of his infinite moderation, and vnconceiuable softnesse, maketh no answer but this, <hi>Doest thou vvell to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry</hi>? Wherein as he doth shew that Ionas was to blame (and therein ouerturneth the excuse of Saint Hierome,<note place="margin">Hieron. in Ionae. 4.</note> who most wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly would couer all, as if there were no fault, and therefore goeth not right, since the text is to the contrarie) so he bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth with the infirmity of the distracted Prophet, and doth rather warne him kindly, then intreate him very roughly. <hi>Doest thou vvell to be angry?</hi> as if he should haue sayd, Thou frettest when thou shouldest not: wilt thou be the Iudge Ionas, to decide what is most for my glorie? thou takest on thee to preiudice my wisedome, or my will: that either my discretion is not such as it should be; or when I know the best, yet I will follow the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. This is not aright Ionas: for if any haue occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie it is I, who must be ruled now and not rule, be directed and not gouerne. This mild increpation would haue mooued any man, but him who was steeped in anger, as Ionas was. I do not here any farther pursue Gods patience in his owne person, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I haue oftentimes touched it.</p>
            <p n="14">14 My lesson which I gather here, is rather for our selues, that when we haue to do with passionate persons, that is to say, brethren which are weake, but not desperately euill, and see them ouertaken with affections of anger, of sorrow, or displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, we by our mild behauiour, seeke to win them from that fault.

The bending yeelding spirit is most likely to preuaile, with the most robustious persons; but a good man will haue an eye, that he yeeld not in things vnlawfull. The Apostle dealeth thus with the Corinthians:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4.14.</note> 
               <hi>I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloued children I do warne you.</hi> The Apostle would not of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose shame those, whom he saw comming willingly inough to God, but the matter it selfe will shame (yet with a bashfulnesse to good purpose) the man who is intelligent, when he shall see another, who is greater then himselfe, to be calme when he is troubled, yea more &amp; more to be calme, when he seeth another troubled: when himselfe is surprized with heate to behold his better to stand vnmoueable, no more but to heare him and be silent, or onely to looke vpon him, or to turne away, to be gone vntill the storme be past: or if there be a speaking, onely to say as God sayth here, without further prouocation, <hi>Doest thou well to be angry</hi>? He who is wise and prudent, hath learned to pity those who are blind and deafe, or distracted in wit, and not to study to be like such: but those who are impatient, are for the time no better. Blind, in that they see not what is commodious: deafe from heating any reason: yea possessed with a frensie, to speake and do things vnlawfull. Where although flesh and bloud would suggest, that as one noyse is best of all beaten backe with another noyse, or one woodden pin with another, so violence with violence, and great words with great speeches, are soonest done downe and appeased, yet Christian imitation of the best, and patience fit for Saints, biddeth treade another path, of quietnesse and of softnesse.</p>
            <p n="15">15 I know not to whom this precept may rather be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, then to the Ministers of the Gospell, who should not be ouer readie, to take knowledge of such censures as their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do passe vpon them, for those things which they preach: when it is not of any malice, or pretended thought to disgrace, but of idle curiosity, and because men haue their fancies.

longer, but on the next Sabaoth day, to sound out of the pulpit, an inuectiue declaration against such carping iudges? when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the words were mistaken, perhaps increased and aggraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by the carier of the tale. But the end is, that whereas before the party was a brother, and a hearer, now he prooueth to be an enemy, and forbeareth to heare the Sermons, from whence he onely looketh to be galled: the congregation is disquieted, and in steed of one speaking before, now each mans mouth is open: and the pastour himselfe being now torne and rent on euery side, is troubled in his mind, and discouraged in his calling. How much safer were it here, if it could not be auoided but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge must be taken, in priuate thus to appease the thing which is not right? Do you well to be angry, or do you well thus to say? But if it be a thing possible, the way were to heare and not to heare: to auoide all notice of it. There was neuer man wiser then Salomon,<note place="margin">Prou. 19.11.

And I feare that to a iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and sober reader, it will too plaine appeare, that those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent lights and great pillars of the Church, haue somewhat troubled their owne wits, and forced the text also, to make that good in Iesus, which is onely true in Ionas. For although there be some thing, which by the open witnesse of our Sauiour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, hath good place in him,<note place="margin">Matth. 12.40.</note> that as the Prophet <hi>vvas three dayes and three nights in the belly of the vvhale, so the sonne of man should be three dayes and three nights in the belly of the earth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hieron. in Ionae. 1.</note> and some things more besides, which not vnfitly may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble him, yet it is most apparant, that very many matters are as far from him; in the one whereof and other, he may quickly
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:623:286"/>
be satisfied, who listeth to looke but on the obseruations of Mercerus,<note place="margin">Merceri ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruat. in Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae. 4.</note> vpon the booke of this Prophecy. But if any would be refractary, and stand stiffe for that, which is past in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters fore-going, yet here he must needes yeeld, or be mightily ouertaken. For how fitly shall this going out, and expecting what shall become of the city, be applied vnto Christ? What shall the gourd be, which is spoken of in the next verse, and the worme which did destroy it? Shall the one be his flesh, and the other his death, or some thing farther fetched? The gourd brought ease to Ionas, and delight and contentment, but Christs flesh brought him none, but rather sorrow and much anguish. The Prophet grieued to leaue the thing which shadowed him, but Christ willingly died &amp; gaue vp the ghost. But aboue al, this messenger which now was at Niniue,<note place="margin">Ioh. 19.30.</note> was offended with God, and did chide and chafe at him: and when the Lord disliked that, as it is in the ninth verse, and asked him whether he did well to be angry, for the gourd which was destroyed, he most fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously and testily foorthwith replied, that he did well to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the very death. There is no extenuation or imagining supposall, which can fit this to Christ, and keepe the text sound too, and therefore let vs rather leaue those fathers, where they study a little too much to be like Origene (who would turne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie thing into Allegories, although the story wrecked for it) and let vs harken to Saint Austen,<note place="margin">Augustin. de Trinitate. lib. 4.6.</note> where he speaketh like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, yet in a matter more generall: <hi>Against reason no sober man, against Scripture no Christian man, against the Church no peaceable man will thinke</hi> or dispute. But both reason and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture put vs here from a figure, and therefore we must literally vnderstand it of the Prophet, and ayme onely at the story.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Then mention is made before, how Ionas was agrieued, that the city should be spared, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had preached the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. But there is some difference among the interpreters, whether that knowledge was giuen vnto him being in the city, that it should not so prooue as he had fore-told, and so he came trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled out, not meaning to stay in that place, where he might be derided as a lying Prophet; or whether he was informed that the Lord would be mercifull, after his comming foorth, when
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:623:286"/>
he seuered himselfe, partly to fright the Niniuites, but especially to sequester himselfe, from taking part of their hastening de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. Againe it is controuersed, whether this which now followeth to the end of the Chapter,<note place="margin">Ionae. 4.1.</note> were a new griefe that sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized him, besides that which before had troubled and vexed him, or rather but onely a farther explication of that which is past, which Iunius and Tremelius not obscurely do insinuate, expressing the beginning of this verse and the next, by, <hi>For he vvent out of the city,</hi> and <hi>for the Lord prepared a gourd.</hi> And thirdly here ariseth a farther ambiguity, whether at his comming out, the gourd were prepared ready, so that thereby at the first he eased himselfe, plotting the leaues thereof as fit to shadow him,<note place="margin">Iun. in Ionae. 4.</note> in manner of a booth, to the which also Iunius very openly doth bend, so intending that he sate there, no more then one day (for the next morning the gourd withered) or whether as some other do rather suppose, he made himselfe first a booth, or sommer-house of boughs, whereof when the freshnesse was soone decayed, by the drying vp of the greenenesse, then the gourd sprung vp in place, as a fresher and kindlier and more contentfull cooler. Which doubts so far foorth as they shall vary any point of doctrine, I shal touch very briefly; but because they make no difference in the substance of the story, I mind not to pursue them, auoiding on the one side, confusion of the part of the hearer, which cannot chuse but arise by intricate things; &amp; on the other side curiosity in the speaker, which by following such nice points cannot chuse but be suspected. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to keepe close to the text, and to make all as plaine as possibly I can, this verse doth offer to vs foure obseruable circumstances, first, his going out of the city, <hi>Ionah went out of the city,</hi> secondly, his sitting downe &amp; where, <hi>he sate on the East side of the city,</hi> thirdly, what he did there, <hi>he made him a booth and sate there in the shadow,</hi> fourthly, the end and reason of his staying in that place, <hi>till he might see vvhat should become of the city.</hi> While I handle these things as Gods Spirit shall direct me, affoord me your wonted patience.</p>
            <q>

            <p n="3">3 If Ionas hauing very peremptorily preached the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of Niniue, were aduertised in the city, that the decree

gone out against them was altered, and that God who meant to strike would now shut vp all, and quit it with a pardon, then this messenger who mightily stood vpon his reputation, as before I haue shewed (although therein he made no dainty, to mistake the whole matter, which must euer be supposed) had great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be gone. For allowing his owne ground, that himselfe had sayd one thing, and now there fell out another, in the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring whereof, he was no way satisfied, he might thinke that as a lyar, he might iustly be derided, and pointed at with the finger, as he went in the streets, for a fellow threatning much, and then performing nothing. Now that a man should come so farre, and should openly cry out, before such a multitude, who brought it to the Kings eare, that there was ready at the dores the ruine of a place Imperiall, as that was, the Queene of many kingdomes, and Mistresse of many nations, and should set all not in an vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rore, but in skreeking and lamenting, and in the end and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot, it should neither be so nor so: Yea that Gods name should be vsed, and threates should be vttered from that fearefull Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uah, that the Lord might be taunted at, as well as he, There is a wise God of Israel,<note place="margin">Psal. 42.13.</note> to send such a message; and where is now his God? as in another sence was often sayd to Dauid; might well make this erring and misunderstanding man, to slinke aside from them, who before had bene witnesses of his terrible words, which now were returned al to wind. For had he bin but a man, yet to speake an vntruth voluntarily and asseuerantly, had bene a shamefull thing, especially in the hearing of many and great men,<note place="margin">Eccles. 41.17.</note> as Syracides well noteth, <hi>be ashamed of lies before the Prince and men of authority</hi>; but being a Prophet, and denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing all voluntarily, and of likelihood mentioning a very strange matter, that he had bene in the whale, and yet had escaped, and now should tell so palpable and notorious a lye, was a disgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full reproch, yea reproches a great many. And that this also should be in the name of the Lord, whose honour should be much dearer to him then this life, but not lay open to be blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed by Ethnikes and Atheists, might make him who was led and possessed with a fancy of ignorance and errour, to flye the sight of men:<note place="margin">Dan. 4.30.</note> like some Nabuchodonosor, to get him into the

They who haue the greatest spirits in aspiring to honour, and stand most on their brauing, are most of all deiected, and disgraced in their thoughts, when they sensibly misse their ayme.<note place="margin">2.

It is good to be moderate in affecting things desired, and then if there be no speeding, the griefe is the lesse. Ionas for being too much eger on his thoughts, is the more discontented, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore partly angry, and partly ashamed, getteth himselfe out of the city.</p>
            <p n="4">4 But if we will take it, that being out of the place, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was brought vnto him, that the Lord would spare Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niue, then the reason wherefore he departed is otherwise, and that was for his owne safety. For if desolation were now to come vpon them, and as reprobate cast-awayes, or impenitent sinners, they were to smart home, the Prophet had great cause to hasten him from among them, lest remaining with them, he might with them be striken. Nature it selfe had taught him, to flye from that which he threatned as a plague to others. He is in vaine wise, who is not wise to himselfe. And it is true of a Prophet, as well as of a Sophister, <hi>Odi Sophistam,</hi> and <hi>Odi Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetam, qui sibi non sapit.</hi> I like not that Sophister, nor I like not that Prophet, who is not wise for his owne good. But Gods owne direction might make him wary therein, who when he meant to destroy Sodome and Gomorrha,<note place="margin">Genes. 19.12.</note> he sent two Angels to Lot, both to warne him and to hasten him, from the daunger there to follow. And when he was disposed to make Corah, Dathan and Abiron,<note place="margin">Num. 16.26.</note> a fearefull example to all succeeding ages, he made Moses cry to all that were neare him, <hi>Depart from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you perish in all their sinnes.</hi> Ionas might learne by these. And Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians vnlesse they will tempt God, by presuming of his mercy,
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:623:288"/>
or of their owne merite are bound to depart from all such pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where they know that deseruedly the rod of the Lord doth hang ouer. If it come once to that passe, that the sinnes of who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Babylon be gone vp into heauen, &amp; God remember her ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, we must take it as spoken to vs,<note place="margin">Apoc. 18.4.</note> 
               <hi>Go out of her my people, lest you be partakers of her sinnes, and that you receiue not of her plagues.</hi> Yea we should so much feare, to be ouertaken with the sinnes and sufferings, of men infamously wicked, that when we haue no speciall warrant, nor any reuelation but Gods generall iustice, that punishments will follow, yet we should by all meanes decline them. It was Saint Iohns case, who comming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Bathe,<note place="margin">Euseb. Hist. Eccles. 3.22.</note> where he found the Arch-hereticke Cerinthus wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing, he went hastily out and called to his company, Let vs flye away with speed, lest the bathing house do fall vpon vs. It were much to be wished, that as he did by the hereticke, so all who loue religion, or ciuility, or honesty, would do by noted sinners, that if they come in place, where drunkards or swearers be, or ruffianly companions, whom onely filthinesse of speech or disguised haire, or other swaggering behauiour full of rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse Thraso-like, doth commend shall I say? or much rather doth condemne, they would secretly slip away, or flye backe, as as a man who hath trod vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a serpent. For if plagues do waite on sin, as vndoubtedly they do, why may not God strike suddenly betweene cups and crowzings,<note place="margin">Dan. 5.30.</note> as almost befell to Balthasar? Why may he not turne the weapons of one against another, like the Centaures and the Lapithes?<note place="margin">Ouid. Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morph. lib. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> And what assurance is there, that he who is with the wicked wilfully, and amidst their follies, should not suffer with the wicked? It is good to feare the worst, and to auoide the occasion of plucking any euill on vs, although God do not say before, that there and then he will strike.</p>
            <p n="5">5 But it is manifest that destruction is to come to Niniue, therefore Ionas were very vnwise, if he would not get him pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, if so be that yet he had not intelligence, that the Lord would spare the place. And withall it is likely, that Gods spirit did suggest that to be done of the Prophet. Wherein the scope at which the Lord did ayme, might be double. First to sauegard
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:623:288"/>
his seruant, that the iust with the vniust, the Israelite with the Niniuite, might not be ouerthrowne. For oftentimes the Lord disposeth so,<note place="margin">1. Reg. 22.37.</note> as that Ahab alone shall dye, and Iehosaphat shall escape. But at the siege of Hierusalem, when it was taken by Titus, this manifestly appeared. For when the rest of the city most miserably dyed, by the sword and grieuous famine, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocke was made of all things, both within and without, the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Apostles,<note place="margin">Epiphan. de mensuris &amp; ponderibus.</note> that little faithfull flocke, being forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by an Angell, had gotten themselues to Pella, a city not farre off, where they remained in safety. Another cause why the Lord might make Ionas remooue, might be the more to fright and terrifie that people: for if he had stayed there still, they foorthwith would haue gathered, that it had bene but a bugge; for why should he who brought the newes of euill to other, expect the extremity of the euill with the other? But now when he departed, and left them all to the vengeance, they might iustly suppose, that some sore thing was following. Then if they grieued not before, yet they might begin vpon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: if they did repent before, they might proceed more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly, to continue it and increase it. So mercifull is the Lord to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward those whom he will saue, that one thing or another shall be represented to them, yea peraduenture diuerse matters, this heard, another seene, a third supposed or imagined, all which shall quicken on vnto grace. As those whom in his purpose he hath designed to euill, shall haue all things to the worst (as all the miracles were to Pharao) they shall either haue their sight blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that seeing they shall not see, or they shall haue eares &amp; not heare; so where the Lord hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he may shew himself admirable in his mercies, many matters shallioyne to helpe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as affliction<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, sicknes, pouerty, reading, good cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sell, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, hope, feare, &amp; a thousand other things. If the Niniuites shal be called, they shal not only heare the Prophet preach the word, but they shall behold his example, of going out of the city, more liuely to auoide that by repentance, which they see another flie from by wisdome. And this be spoken of his departure.</p>
            <q>

farre off, against the East of the city, as Hierome doth translate it, or on the East of the city, as other more plainely haue it, which place why of all other he chose for his abode, may be very well worth the doubting. At first I was of opinion, that some of the Popish writers, might make this as a figure of some thing in the Church, for so farre sometimes do they straine. The matter which I minded most, was that his sitting vpon the East side, might foreshew the manner of the Christians seruice, which was accustomed to be toward the East, as Gregory Nazianzene writeth,<note place="margin">Greg. Naz. Epist. 66. Aug. lib<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. de Serm. Domini in monte. Iust. Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now if I had found this, then had I spoken somewhat largely, concerning that custome of praying toward the East, with some consequents of it, as the building of Churches Eastward among the Christians, and the manner of buriall obserued likewise, from the East to the West. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I find none who haue intimated so much, and I loue not to discourse that, whereof there is no ground, I passe it ouer, and rather come to more probable reasons, of the which one is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, that he sate on the East side, because the holy city Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem (in the which most apparantly of all the earth, the Lord resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) was Westward, toward which he did looke, as well as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Niniue. For that thing being true, which Dauid hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, <hi>In Iewry is God knowne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 76.1.</note> 
               <hi>his name is great in Israel, At Salem is his Tabernacle, and his dwelling in Sion,</hi> and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was to come, being to come from thence-ward, he might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther looke that way, then to any other coast or quarter of the heauen.<note place="margin">1. Reg. 8.44.48.</note> And since we do find in that prayer of Salomon, at the dedicating of the Temple, that the Israelites being in straunge lands, were to looke toward that place, when they begged any thing of God, our Prophet in blind zeale might turne himselfe thither, to aske the consummation and performance indeed, of that which he had spoken. Againe if the Lord had promised, to send from that place, comfort to his being in distresse, whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he was pleased to shew mercy, it might well be coniectured, that now intending anger and iudgement in high measure, he might from thence send it vpon the city Niniue. Which way if
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:623:289"/>
it should come, then Ionas was so wise, to be as farre of-ward as possibly he might, and be within the sight of Niniue also. If a pestilence should be, he would not haue that pestilence come ouer his body: if fire and brimstone came, he would not haue that fire come ouer his head, but so farre as it might be, he would be out of danger. But concerning the withdrawing him from the perill, I spake but euen now, in his going out of the city; and that the Iewes looked to Hierusalem, I formerly touched, when I opened the second Chapter,<note place="margin">Ionae. 2.4.</note> and therefore of that no farther.</p>
            <p n="7">7 A second cause there is more commonly assigned, why he sate on the East side, and that is, because there as it may be supposed, was a hill, from which he might looke downeward, and see this mighty place, which now was in such hazard. You must thinke that all his heart and soule was now on Niniue, as imagining that therein was his making and his marring, his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit or disgrace, and therefore he was much eased, that he had such a hill, where his eye might be vpon it. And certainely if he were fit to fret, as it is most plaine that he was, such a hill might make him fret the more, when each houre he should see those houses stand, which he wished might fall; those men aliue whom he wished dead; that multitude in safety, after whose ruine he thirsted. Nothing grieueth enuy more, then that which it behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. The Scripture maketh mention of a wicked euill eye,<note place="margin">Matth. 20.15. Chrysost. in Genesim. Homil. 16.</note> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a grudging sence. Chrysostome writing vpon Genesis, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth that to be one of the greatest temptations, wherewith Sathan oppugned Adam, when he was in the blisse of Paradise. He bringeth him in speaking thus: <hi>What profit is it to you to be here in this Garden, and not to enioy those things which this deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate place doth yeeld? Nay therefore is your griefe the more bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and smartfull, that see these things you may, but vse them you may not.</hi> What he vrged there as an argument, to a wanton lustfull eye, no doubt he plieth much, to an enuious spitefull eye. What a griefe is it, to see the thing which thou doest hate, and not to see thy will on it? How carefull should we be, to pray to God, to remooue vs from the causes of such tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that he do not set before vs things, whereon we may set
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:623:290"/>
our mind, with an euill passion or sinister affection; that he do not place vs on hils, or in roomes fit to behold them, lest our sinne be thence increased; but especially that he suffer not our heart to be defiled, with lusting or malice, or our eye to be infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; but both of them to be single. The greatest fault in Ionas was, that enuy and bloudy crueltie had filled his heart before, but it now did helpe his sinne more forward, that he had a hill to behold that, which was a spurre to his enuy.</p>
            <p n="8">8 If he had bene a man of any mercy, or but of common pity, it had wrought with him otherwise. For if of himselfe he would not be content in piety, that an increase of his maisters retinue should be made, by the comming in of so many, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and sorrow: If in charitie he would not ioy, that so many men who were dead, should reuiue and liue againe, and so many which were lost should be found; yet in ordinarie huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and manly commiseration, when he had bene vp in the mount, and seene so many houses, so goodly and glorious workemanship, as must needes be in that city, such temples and such pallaces, so sumptuous and delightfull: when he saw that in such a masse of houses as there was, there must needs be thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of people, some of them morally honest, some infants who neuer actually deserued to perish, this rigour of his fury, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie of his stomacke, must at the last haue relented. If magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and multitude, and both before his eyes, could not worke, nothing could worke with him. Yet the heart of Gods sonne was farre more tender, then this of his seruant. For when Christ who doubtlesse was to bring a sharpe sentence against the Iewes,<note place="margin">Luc. 19.41.42.</note> came within the sight of Hierusalem, and beholding loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vpon it, how great it was and stately, he could not forbeare to weepe, and vtter words of compassion, <hi>Oh if thou hadst knowne at the least in this thy day, those things vvhich are for thy peace, but now they are hidden from thee.</hi> Yea heathen men by that light which nature yeelded to them, when it came to that passe, that they saw great things must perish, they haue wept that it should be so, and could haue wished the contrarie. An example of this in some sort, may be that gentle and soft and kind Titus, who deserued to be called <hi>Deliciae human generis,
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:623:290"/>
the delicacy of mankind,</hi> for he being to see that executed, which Christ foretold should happen to Hierusalem,<note place="margin">Ioseph. de Bel. Iud. lib. 6.14. &amp; 7.10.</note> stretched foorth his hands, and called heauen and earth to witnesse, in great bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse, that he was not to blame, that the Iewes perished in such sort, but they themselues: and would not by any meanes, that fire should be set on the Temple.<note place="margin">Liuius lib. 27<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

For in as much as at the first he had bene vnwilling to come to do his message, and had smarted well for it, hauing now sustained the brunt, and endured the worst of the matter, he might verie well expect the end, either for his owne satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or the better to tell it to other; besides the point of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which might tie him to stay the longer, because he came the later.

His mind was so on that credit of his, which he loued, albeit it were to be stained with bloud, that although there were no hope of it, yet he would hope beyond hope. <hi>Quid non spera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus amantes?</hi> for his fancie doth suggest vnto him, that although in generall he knew, that God was mercifull &amp; pitifull; although he saw that they repented, from the king to the begger, in sack-cloth and ashes, in fasting and strong prayer; although of late he had vnderstood, that the sentence was reuersed, and the whole iudgement reuoked, yet there might be good expectation, that they should be whipped and lashed, with some meaner kinde of punishment, if they vtterly did not perish. And if he might see but some thing, yet he should not loose all his longing. Yea there might be a farther hope, that they who at the first day of the fortie, were by his preaching stirred vp to repentance, yet within a litle while after, might turne vnto their vomit, and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in the mire.

Now if it had bene referred to his discretion, to giue the signe of inuading, or to put fire to some mine, which might haue blowne vp all, he would willingly haue done it. His fingers would haue itched, till all had bene effected. How filthie is mans nature, how prone to bloud and all naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse, if Gods grace be a litle from vs, when an Israelite and a Prophet, shall sit and watch euerie moment, (as Aegeus did for his sonne Theseus) when such a citie as Niniue shall come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation?<note place="margin">Liuius li. 45.</note> When that noble Paulus Aemilius had receiued from Perseus (who was now enforced to miserie) a letter which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the yeelding of himselfe, and the kingdome of Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, to the mercie of the conquerour: although this was like to be much for the gaine and honor of Aemilius, yet now thinking that his fall was the ending of that monarchie, which while A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander liued was renowmed in all the earth, he broke foorth into teares: But our Prophet, when a kingdome of farre greater esteeme, then Macedonia at that time was, is to be dissipated and ruinated, albeit he gaine nothing by it, neither wealth, nor ease, nor honor, can be content to reioyce, and take much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in it. And so he is on fire vpon it, that nothing can perswade him, but that it will be done, because done he would haue it; and if it should not be done, yet he will trie the vttermost, and know a reason for it, why he should be put from his purpose: but indeed he will not otherwise beleeue, but still it shall be so.</p>
            <p n="13">13 Such doubting as this is, where so euer it be found, and a striuing to haue things be, according to mans proiect, against the apparant truth of Gods designes, or his word, is deriued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the capitall or chiefe enemie of our soule, who like the old man in Horace,<note place="margin">Horat. de Arte Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</note> is <hi>spe longus, long in hope,</hi> and will not quickly giue ouer, if he haue a mind to a matter.

Who knew whether that his fortune or pollicie may be such, as to hold him there when he had him? But indeed he was ouer-matched: for when he brought him to the crosse, he brought him as to a chariot, whereon he was to triumph, and when as a fish he had catched at his bodie being put into the graue, as if he had taken it for a baite, with the hooke of his Diuinitie which was couered vnderneath, him selfe was catched and choaked. But vntil that he had fully felt it, he would neuer be brought vnto it.

for that is not Christian wisedome, but to harken what the Lord doth say of vs, and of all men.

Albeit these people were farre more,<note place="margin">Genes. 18.23.</note> yet he doth not for them as Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham did for Sodome, that is, double and triple a passionate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, that they might be forgiuen, but hauing a desire that himself might seeme no lyer, he doth wish &amp; could willingly put to his hand, to helpe it forward, that all were ouerthrowne. But when he taketh notice, that without his motion God would spare that multitude, he fretteth and rageth at it, and in excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding discontentment, remaineth not farre off, euen hoping be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond hope, that some euill would befall them. Being thus in
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:623:296"/>
his anguish, because he might not haue his will (for so the most do interprete it, and the literall proceeding, and going on of the story do seeme to enforce it) or being troubled otherwise (as some other would haue it) with the scorching heate of the Sunne, while he remaineth there expecting what should be the end, God raiseth vp a certaine plant, or growing kind of creature, to yeeld some reliefe to this angry person, that so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently some little comfort might accrew vnto him. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this were prepared at the first, when he came out of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he made his booth onely with that, or whether hauing cut downe some other boughs, and enioyed them in manner of a sommer-house, and those now being dried, the other did spring vp as a better sort of succour, more naturall and more fresh, it is not much to our matter: but by Gods speciall worke he had it, and sate vnder it. There is a double drift which is ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at, by the sending of this greene thing to the Prophet, one to teach him by a parable, and demonstratiue instruction, that he was much to blame, that himselfe louing such a trifle, would haue had no reckening made, of such a city as Niniue. But of that I shall haue occasion to speake in the end of the Chapter, where the Lord himselfe apparantly deduceth it in that manner.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The other thing to be considered by vs for the present, is the plaine direct narration, wherein we are let to know, that Ionas to comfort him, and appease him for the time, hath a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle tree raised vp vpon the sudden out of the ground, which the Lord of purpose stirred vp, so that it had not bene there, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon that occasion. Which when it had brought vnto him a delicate pleasing shadow, fitting to his oportunity, he tooke as much ioy in it, as if it had bene some great treasure. But when he was more proud of it, then a wise man would haue bene, the glory and beauty of it, was dashed quite on a sudden. There commeth a little gnawing worme, which destroyed the life of this greene thing, so that it prooued to be dry and withered, and the couer was now as nothing, the shadow was cleane ceassed. Then he who very lately thought himselfe a happy man, in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing somewhat to refresh him, is now as farre to seeke, as euer he
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:623:296"/>
was before. That you may the better conceiue this whole case of the Prophet, so plentifully teaching vs as it doth, may it please you to note with me those three things, which the text doth or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly offer to vs. First the prouision here made for him, of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> by the Lord; and therein we may obserue the thing it selfe which was sent, and then by whom it came, and afterward the vse of it. My second part is the hasty contentment, which the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Prophet too violently, and greedily receiued by the comming of this to him. And the third is the dissolution, &amp; ending of all his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ioy, by taking his pleasure from him. The instructions arising hence, shall be mingled with the doctrine.</p>

            <p n="3">3 What that was which is here spoken of, hath not onely bene doubted, in the auncient primitiue Church, but it hath caused some stirre also. The Septuagint expressed it by <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, which our English translation doth apparantly follow, and nameth it to be a gourd. The later Greeke interpreters, to wit Aquila, and Symmachus, and Theodotion, not liking of that word, did render it by <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, which is as much as Iuy. When Hierome afterward tooke on him to translate the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, out of the Hebrew into Latine, he following those later ones, put it <hi>hederam</hi> that is Iuy. And his translation now in his owne time growing to be read, and that commonly in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, it seemed straunge to the people, who were before vsed to copies taken out of the Septuagint, to heare such an alteration. The matter was most exasperated, by occasion of a Bishop which was in Af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Here the good man was enforced, to haue recourse to the Iewes, to know the Hebrew of them, who either vpon ignorance, or malice to the Bishop, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance to all the Christians, whom they could be glad to see <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this Hierome acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth to be the true thing, which here suddenly grew vp to Ionas, which could be neither gourd nor Iuy; as for diuerse o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reasons, so because they had neede to be held vp, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained by other proppes, like to the vines amongst vs, but this shrubbe of it selfe, beareth and shooteth vpward. Yet the reason why he expressed it by Iuy, was especially to giue the name of such a thing as was knowne in other countreyes, and Iuy did best please him, because Aquila and his fellowes thought good
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:623:297"/>
so to expound it. Now hauing no apt Latine word, <hi>I thought it not fit</hi> sayth he, <hi>to vse the Hebrew,</hi> Kikajon, <hi>the Lord prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a</hi> Kikajon, <hi>lest Grammarians lighting on it, when they could not vnderstand it, should imagine it or conceiue it, for some strange beast of India, or mountaine of Baeotia, or some other monstrous matter.</hi> Thus was Hierome put to his shifts, neither ignorantly nor faithlesly, peruerting the holy Scripture, but putting such a word, as according to that reason which God had giuen vnto him, he iudged to be most conuenient. This is an instruction to vs, that either in translators or expositours of the Scripture, we should not be too seuere, to censure them or controll them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially when their learning and faithfulnesse is knowne to all, and that they willingly would not swarue: For as sometimes they cannot sound to the depth of Gods judgements, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all men being by measure, so other times againe when they may take things rightly, they may want a word for their matter, because the tongue will not beare it; or they may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by a Periphrasis, to circumscribe and delate that, which the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues could wish were shorter. (And yet afterward, another may come, who at the first sight, lighteth on a word or phrase, whereof the former could not thinke.) Here to shew a mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, in obscurities and great difficulties, the translatour shall do well, to giue a reason of his deed, in some obseruations or il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrations, that those things may appeare in the margent, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Chapter,<note place="margin">Hieron. in Ionam.</note> which do not in the text: and this way did Saint Hierome much make amends, by his commentary, which clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all this doubt in Ionas.</p>

Secondly that the leaues of this, being large like to the Plane-leafe, as some haue set it downe, or to the Vine-leafe, as the most agree, were apt to yeeld a shadow, which is the point here intended. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto this may be added as the third, which I did not mention before, that this plant is very subiect to the gnawing and hurt of wormes, which more cleareth that, which anon followeth in the third place.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Now we haue that whereon all the working was, agreed vpon; whence it followeth to be considered, who it was that sent it thither. <hi>The Lord God prepared this Ricinus.</hi> And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest it is, that he prepared it suddenly, for it followeth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <hi>Thou hast pity on the gourd,</hi>

               <hi>which grew vp in the night, and perished in another night.</hi> Therfore if it were not made in a moment, which may probably be disputed, yet it was but one night in growing. This sheweth the power of God, in the generall dispensation of all things in the world, that when he listeth, he can make and send creatures on the earth, which shall complete his designements. He can raise vp vnto vs, both trees, and fruits, and graines; when the earth seemeth to be barren, and the seede to be rotten in it, by too much or too little moisture, he can amend all with a word, and make the fields to be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and the drowned ground to be chearfull.

               <hi>He turneth the flouds into a wildernesse, and drieth

In the time of dearth in Samaria, within the space of a day he can make a measure of fine flowre to be sold for a sicle,<note place="margin">2. Reg. 7.1.2.</note> and two measures of barley to be at the selfe same rate: when to the vnbeleeuer it seemeth a thing incredible, though the very windowes of heauen should open, and raine downe corne. We haue had some late experience of his power in this behalfe, when after yeares spent in moisture, and haruests seasoned with teares, he hath sent a more blessed reaping, and gathering in of corne. It is a great comfort to his seruants, that euermore he can, and oftentimes he doth prouide for his in their neede, not a shadow onely with Ionas, to hang ouer their heads, but satiety or sufficiency of all good things besides. If he do not yeeld abundance, yet patience and obedience doth hold it selfe content: it hath to do with a father; it hath to do with a Lord; a father who surely loueth, a Lord who can do all things: in his wisedome he best knoweth, what it is which will serue the turne: in his kindnesse knowing of it, he certainely will bestow it. But if it were for our good, what combining or conspiring of all the world against vs, what aduersity or extremity, shall hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vs from our happinesse? If among our owne, we find not that comfort which we should,<note place="margin">Genes. 39.2. Dan. 2.48.</note> then as he did to Ioseph, and as he did to Daniel, he can send it among strangers. If both our owne and strangers, and all mankind should leaue vs, yet birds and beasts he hath for vs,<note place="margin">1. Reg. 17.6.

            <p n="7">7 As the raising of this plant doth note his vnmeasured power, so the word which here is vsed, doth note his all-seeing prouidence. <hi>He prepared this Ricinus.</hi> I finde this word in the first Chapter,<note place="margin">Ionah. 1.17.</note>

Where is the Atheist and the Epicure, who if he will be so good, as to allow the being of an high power, which sitteth aboue in maiestie, yet he will not be perswaded, that he meaneth to trouble himselfe with inferiour &amp; small matters.

            <p n="8">8 The end why God sent this pretie tree, was to couer the head of Ionas, that it might be a shadow for him, to comfort him in his griefe. That the man was out of tune, I haue shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so often, that I need not againe repeate it.

by his peeuish and froward griefe, doth send him here a small thing, to serue his turne the while. The nature of fretting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons is, that when they haue apprehended any great cause of discontentment, as they perswade themselues, they are sorely troubled with it: but if a second cause be heaped vpon the first, and another vpon that, no measure doth containe them, but they rage and storme, as if all things had conspired to worke their bane, and they were men accursed. And indeede by this meanes, the wicked oftentimes do come to their finall destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. But God being better minded to all those whom he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, doth moderate their vexations, and measure out their grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunces, that they many times shall haue their backe burdens, but they shall not haue too much. Either one thing or another shall stand vp in the gappe, although it be so small a matter, that taken by it selfe, it seemeth rather contemptible: but for that present time, by the fancie of the partie, may be thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie the hauing. When the mother hath beaten her child, whom she would haue to be chastised, but not his heart broken, shee reacheth out an apple to him, or some trifle to appease him. In comparison of God we are as babies, especially when furie &amp; passionate vexation hath surprized all our affections, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as a child is pleased with a little, (but that endureth but a small time) so a little thing doth stay vs, although I dare not say doth content vs. When we are readie to drowne, a little twigge being suddenly catched on, doth relieue vs. When we are ready to famish, a little food doth preserue vs, and hold our life for the time. And it is maruell to see (so humerous is our nature,) how small things bring breathing to vs, euen as little ones as this sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, which was here ouer the Prophets head. When Ieremie was oppressed with miserie vpon miserie, nothing was more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie to him,<note place="margin">Ier. 38.6.</note> then his thrusting into the dungeon. Yet when by the blacke-Moores meanes, he was gotten out of that hole, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he were still restrained in the vtter court of the prison, and had euils enough vpon him, yet this appeased him well; as may easily be gathered,<note place="margin">Ier. 39.17.

Ionathan in the battell had ouer-fasted himselfe, a little hony taken vp vpon the end of a sticke, recouered his dimmed eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight. Doubtlesse the conflicts of Paule were many while he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at Rome, with Gentiles and Iewes, with the learned and vnlearned, with the persecuting tyrant, yet I verily suppose (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Gods spirit doth mention the matter) that it was a good ease to him,<note place="margin">Act. 28.30.</note> that he might hire a house by himselfe, and at home be free from their baiting. In this point let euery one of Gods children looke to himselfe, and remember, if oftentimes when his fretting hath bene greatest, he hath not had some allay, by the comming in of a friend, by receiuing of some letter, by hearing somewhat else which better doth content him, by some thing before not thought of, which pleaseth for the time, and if by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, yet by falling on sleepe. These be mercies from the Lord, who will not haue his to sinke; and there is not the least of these, seeme it neuer so base a thing to the standers by, but it is sent in vnto thee, euen from heauen and the Highest, to refresh thee as his child, as this shadow was here to Ionas. And thus much be now spoken of these three circumstances, arising from my first generall note, what it was that was prepared, by whom, and to what end.</p>
            <q>
               <l>And Ionas was exceeding glad because</l>
            </q>
            <p n="9">9 We are now in the second place, to looke in what sort he embraced this fauor. He was exceedingly glad. The oportunitie of the thing, which so serued him for his purpose, to refresh him withall, and peraduenture the rarenesse of it, (for rare things in euery kind do most of all delight) put the Prophet into such glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as if he had found some precious treasure. If it were not, that we all are such, it were strange to see of what mettall this messenger here was made, that a litle maketh him grieue, and a lesser thing maketh him glad, and as a child or a boy, moderately he taketh nothing. What a matter was this, that Ionas who had bene trained vp in Israel, and had done the Lord seruice there, who was sent in a message to such a Citie as Niniue, where his words might concerne a Monarke, and Princes, &amp; great Peeres, should be so sillie a creature, as to ioy in a thing so brittle? In de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting men fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> too much embracing the delights of the world,
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:623:301"/>
we figuratiuely vse to call all pleasures here, but verie <hi>fumos &amp; vmbras,</hi> no better then smokes and shadowes, not that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally imagine, that men set their hearts vpon such things. But here is one who in earnest is much in loue with a shadow, and that not the shadow of himselfe,<note place="margin">Ouid. Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morph. lib. 3.</note> as the Poet fained of Narcissus, but of a little tree. Here if he had had some company, it is likely that he would haue led them round about this his ioy, and shewed them all his pleasures, which with some admiration he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it. If this man had bene some Salomon, that he might haue had in all magnificence, whatsoeuer his heart desired, he would haue bene much in loue with it: but if he had bene in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise, he would haue bene mightie proud of his trees, and fruits, and shadowes; very likely that doating on them, he would not so soone haue parted with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as Adam did. Yes, possibly much sooner, if possibly that might be: when he shewed himselfe so fantasticall; any toy would soone haue turned him, who was vp and downe with such trifles.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Hereafter do not maruell, that the Lord forbiddeth men to glorie in greater matters:<note place="margin">Ierem. 9.23.</note> 
               <hi>Let not the wise man glorie in his wisedome, nor the strong man glorie in his strength, neither the rich man glorie in his riches; but let him that glorieth, glorie in this, that he vnderstandeth and knoweth me,</hi> when a Prophet shall be pleased in such silly shadowes, as if it were in some cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall ioy. For the emphasis of the word doth intend that he was very highly pleased. And yet it is a thing much vaine, to set too great affection on strength, or wit, or wealth, or any terrestriall matter. For do we not a wrong to God, and much spoile him of his honour,<note place="margin">Matth. 22.37.</note> that when we are to loue him with all our heart, and all our soule, to thinke of him, to rest in him, to make him our meditation, and to vse all other creatures but as his gifts and blessings, by a million of degrees subordinate to himselfe, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be employed to the setting forward of his seruice: we will dreame of them, and thinke of them sleeping and waking, in company and alone. Do not parents thus oftentimes, set their hearts vpon their children, and make almost Gods of them? at euery word my sonne, or my boy, or little girle: and when they grow somewhat bigger, there are no children like their children:
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:623:301"/>
the wind may scant blow on them: the very ground is the better that they do go vpon: the sleepe is neuer too much broken, nor the belly too much pinched, to heape vp trash for these chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Yea from whom will they not pull, euen the widow, and the fatherlesse, to enrich this their delight? Do they not grieue to part with a peny to the vse of the most holy businesses, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it may diminish their portions? This made Saint Austen say,<note place="margin">August. in Psal. 48.</note> 
               <hi>For whom do they keepe their riches? for their children</hi> he aunswereth, <hi>and they againe for their children, and the third des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent for theirs. But what is here for Christ? what is here for thy soule? Is euery whit for thy children? Among their sonnes on earth let them thinke vpon one brother aboue in heauen, on whome they should bestow all, or at the least deuide with him.</hi> But Christ and God shall stand backe, when it commeth to these daintie chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Now to speake plainly, was this the end wherefore thou beggedst children at the hand of thy maker, to delight thy soule with them? Was this the cause wherefore God gaue them, that they might thrust him out from the habitation of thy heart? Thou doest vse his blessings fairely, to ioy more of the gift, then thou doest of the giuer, not to thinke who sent the tree, but to ioy onely in the shadow. It is oddes of many to one, but that thy wantons,<note place="margin">1.

            <p n="11">11 Looke what is here said of children, is as true also of beautie.

I thinke now he might much sooner find examples of such things, then Diogenes could find a man. But for the male sexe, are there not which take more care of their slicking and of their platting, then of the kingdome of heauen? Did Ionas more set his heart on the shadow of his head, then they do on their haire? He chode with God for the one: &amp; they will stand to the vttermost with Gods officers, his vice-gerents vpon earth, for the other: yea be thrust from a societie, or be clapped vp in prison, rather then part with that fleece.

            <p n="12">12 When Ionas thought with himselfe, that he had such a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> pleasing knacke, as no man had the like, it is all dashed on the sudden. The Lord prepared a worme. Perhaps it was a cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillar, perhaps of some other kind, and this the very next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, after that the Prophet was in his glorie, came and gnawed the stalke of his shrowde, and made it forthwith wither, so that the shadow and greennesse of that, which the man before estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as his chiefe delight, did perish in a moment. Now might this vexed soule easily learne, that his loue before was vaine, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a little worme was able to ouerturne his felicitie. Looke what course God vsed here in this his extraordinarie worke, the same he oftentimes doth vse in matters which are more common. When things come to vs in hast, as this tree did here in one night, they as hastily part againe. When riches come too quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they quickly take their flight. Sudden glories decay suddenly.

When we behold greene things to shew themselues, as with a kind of violence, we may feare a quicke dissolution. The fruite which is soonest ripe, is found to be soonest rotten. When chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in tender yeares, do abound with incredible wits, as being ouer forward, they hold out few times long. God doth recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence that in towardlinesse, which he denieth in time, &amp; when he hath made them fit, he taketh them to himselfe. When the greennesse, and the freshnesse, and shade is more then it should be, then feare some worme which may gnaw, some sicknesse which may dissolue this rath-ripe soone-rotten fruite.</p>
            <p n="13">13 But this doctrine is yet more generall: for if there be any thing, (come it soone, or come it late) whereon the heart is too much set, God hath meanes to destroy it, and the more our ioy is on it, the rather he doth remooue it. For there is nothing here of longer lasting, then seemeth good to himselfe: and to speake generally, here is nothing of continuance.

            <p n="14">14 To weane vs from such thoughts, and make vs see our folly, when we let our eyes be dazeled with the brightnesse of such a glasse, God doth take away that, wherein our pleasure did most consist: that when we haue admired some things of this world as excellent, and thought them to be great, yet lose them in a trice, we may see how vaine they be, and so direct our thoughts, our hopes and meditations, vnto that which is more lasting. And this he doth to vs in his fatherly discretion: for as the burned child dreadeth the fire, so when by sound experime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it shall be beaten into vs, that we haue leaned but on that, which is like a broken reede, which faileth and peraduenture hurteth too, we may afterward passe by such things, as not esteeming them at all, or but thinke of them in their place. And this is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine argument of Gods friendly mind vnto vs, that in the end he meaneth to bring vs home to himselfe, because he cutteth off such snares, and intanglements, and impediments, as would plucke vs from heauenly studies: he maketh the wildernesse te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, and bitter, and smartfull to vs, that we may the more long for Canaan. But he suffereth the worldlings and Epicures to enioy their fill: their pleasures do stand with them, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low one another, that they may haue their heauen here, &amp; their glorie vpon earth, (for elsewhere they shall not see it) that being full fed with earthly and temporarie delights, they may be in

loue with those follies and choking vanities. And that is the cause, why wicked and vnmortified men being readie to dye, do account it a hell vnto them, to leaue all and depart with death Gods messenger, which commeth for them, and must be the end of all, when they see themselues housed with glorie, and lodged with all kind of beautie, their fish-pooles &amp; their orchards with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doore to please them, their musicke of all instruments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doore to delight them, their cattell about their ground, their children about their table.

The wind and Sun are set to warme him without, who was so hote within, that since he was prone to anger for the loosing of his shadow, he might see what it was to misse it, when there was now such vse and necessitie to enioy it. Ionas being like himselfe, very quickly apprehendeth this, &amp; boyling in impatiencie, would be no lesse then dead, to be rid of this vexation. In his very heart he doth wish it, such a fierie heart was his heart, that his life were remooued from him. And his toung secondeth his mind, so that he feareth not to speake it out, that it were better for him to die then to liue. So because he had not his shadow, he would not haue his life.</p>
            <p n="2">2 God who had a double purpose, first to reprooue his impatiencie, and vntemperate kind of cariage, and secondly by his owne words to schoole him, that he should not be so hard-harted, and very cruell to Niniue, doth not let him wast himselfe in his choler, no not for a moment, but asketh of him mildly, if he did well to be angrie for such a greene growing couer: so gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him to vnderstand by an insinuation, (if his iudgement had bene capable thereof) that he went much awry. But the other in his furie, will not be checked therewith, but commeth on him againe, <hi>I do well to be angry,</hi> that I do, <hi>euen to the death.</hi> You see he maketh no spare at God, but fondly hauing thought, he doth vtter it more foolishly; and he maketh no stay, but come what will come of it, out shall his passion go. Thus yet farther is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red matter of the Prophets weaknesse, who maketh no care to bind one sinne vpon another, and in the same transgression of anger &amp; impatiencie, to lay lode vpon lode, which yet the Lord doth beare with, and turneth to our instruction. Which that we may the better fasten on to our edification, we may note in the former verse, Gods triall, and Ionahs patience: Gods trial which was little, and his patience which was none. In the latter verse, the Lords reproofe, and his entertainment of it: the one mild, which had great cause to be rough and seuere: the other frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and boisterous, who if he had looked well to it, had great reason to bend and carie a lower saile. In all these the first thing offered, is the plaine direct narration of that which befell to Ionas.</p>

When Iob had the newes first brought vnto him, that his oxen and his asses were seazed on by the Sabees, his case had bene much amended, to haue grudged and grieued at it: whereas his Camels and his sheepe, yea his very children were vnder the same hazard, yea his flesh euery houre lay sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to be striken with blaines and sores. This messenger sent to the Niniuites, who thought to haue found his harbour in the morning, as greene for him as he left it in the euening, had bene wel helped vp, to mutter that all was dry and withered, when he was within ones fingers, who (to teach him that no sorrowes do vse to go alone, but one waiteth on another, when he is disposed so to send them) could bring a second cause of vexation on his head, which immediatly he doth. For when the Sunne did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise, whose appearance is most pleasing, for dispelling of the darknesse, and bringing light to the world, and therefore by all creatures is naturally desired, God accompanied that Planet, with such a more then common heate, that this weake man could not beare it.

As in Exodus,<note place="margin">Exod. 14.21.</note> when the red sea was miraculously to be made to part it selfe in sunder, to giue passage to the Israelites, God caused a strong East wind to blow vpon it all the night, &amp; that made the sea to become dry land. In the eight &amp; fortieth Psalm, God is said to breake the ships,<note place="margin">Psal. 48.7.</note> and it is with the Easterne wind, which intendeth it to be boisteous and blustering. In the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie of Esay,<note place="margin">Isay. 27.8.</note> when God speaketh of such afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as he wold in some measure lay vpon his people and Church, he saith, that he will keepe that measure, when he bloweth <hi>with his rough wind, in the day of his East wind,</hi> which importeth a very great storme. This made some thinke that the wind which was sent here, was a vehement and great East wind, and so they do tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate it. And none herein are more forward then the Rabbines of the Iewes, being the more encouraged thereto, because the adiunct here vsed, doth come of the radix <gap reason="foreign">

But see whether this imply not a very flat contrarietie. For whereas the Sunne with a maruellous par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching heate, did beate vpon him, (which matter is euident in the text) if so great a wind had bene added therunto, it had brought all to a temper, which might tollerably be borne. For what the Sunne had warmed, the great breathing had cooled; and what the wind had hurt him, by the too cold blowing on him, had bene helped by the Sunne heating, and so of the two extremes had bene made a mediocritie, which needed not to haue offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this patient so impatient. Then we must looke farther yet, and find some other meaning. The word in the originall will best vnfold it to vs; for <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="601" facs="tcp:623:306"/>

Now that the wind hath some force of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie heate, may be gathered from such blastings, as are spoken of in the Bible:<note place="margin">Agg. 2.18.</note> as when it is said, <hi>I haue stricken you with blastings,</hi> meaning their corne, or the blossomes of their fruites vpon the trees; which if it be not sufficiently declared, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of husbandmen, who (if I be not deceiued) do call it a red wind among vs,<note place="margin">Genes. 41.6.</note> yet let the dreame of Pharao confirme the one and the other; that the wind doth blast, and especially the East wind of all winds. For the seuen thinne eares of corne, which are there mentioned, are said to be burned or blasted, &amp; that with the Easterne wind, as supposing that in those East parts, neare Egypt or Palestina, that wind is much accustomed to it. Then that which parcheth the corne and maketh it satty, that which scaldeth the blossomes by a still warme exhalation, being now vsed of purpose (by him who ruleth all things) to make the aire to be sultrie, might well double the heate vpon Ionas.<note place="margin">Luc. 12.55.

            <p n="7">7 This hath made some dispute, I say not that a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent measure, but penurie and necessitie, and aduersitie, and the crosse, are rather preseruers of pietie and dutie, then plentie and prosperitie:<note place="margin">Plutarch. de praeceptis co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>jugalibus.</note> illustrating their intent, by that Parable in Plutarke so well knowne to euery man, of the Sunne and the wind, who were at strife whether of them two should sooner put a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the cloke which he had vpon him.

Againe, were there neuer such, who when in this place they were maisters but of small things, &amp; the greatest part of their maintenance, so depended vpon Gods prouidence, that in the beginning of the yeare, they could not make account to reape one halfe of that, which would satisfie, and yet God sent it in vnto them, were then studious and diligent, and laborious in their calling; but afterward when they came to more eminent and noted preferments in the Church and common-wealth, haue bene dumbe as the fish, and go the Church as it will go, neither toung nor pen shall once mooue to ruinate the forts of Antichrist, or to build one foot for Christ. Shall I say that they haue left the net, because they haue that for which they fished?

But that is the bloud of a goate; and these men touch not bloud. I could wish that bloud did not touch them, and that the bloud of better things then goates. Their idlenesse in aboundance, and aboundance in their idlenesse, is stained with the bloud of the sheepe of Gods pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, who perish for want of foode.

Shall God the more he sendeth vs, be the lesse honoured for it? Shall we in our small wealth pay him much, and flie off from him in the greater? It was a fault both noted and condemned in the Carthaginians, that whereas they were sprung from Tyrus,<note place="margin">Diod.

to be maisters and possessours of greater matters) to send at all, and so by little and little came to contemne that Hercules. In the seruice of the true God, let this neuer be said of Christians, of learned men and Ministers, that they so forget themselues.

But no man while he is on earth, is at the highest of his desires: there remaineth yet one steppe to heauen, before the obtaining of which, if any settle his thoughts, it is no better then in the depth of folly.

impietie. Let Ionas in this case, be an example of infirmitie to be auoided in other men, who because he had not some accident, would needes part with the substance: who because he had lost that shadow, which he he neither had, nor needed in all his life, before those last foure and twentie houres, would needes depart with his life. That which was of all humane things the most precious, should be lost for that which is of small moment. Yet there be some in our time, who treade the steps of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, nay do go a great way beyond him, (for what he said they performe) most damnably working their destruction, for vaine trifles in comparison of that soule, which the Lord suffereth to breath within them. But I haue handled that question twise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this Prophecie, and therefore I leaue this whole matter, and come to the second verse.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Doest thou well to be angrie for the gourd?</l>
            </q>
            <p n="10">10 Here the maner of Gods reproofe might yeeld good matter to vs, to note in what mild sort he doth it: that whereas it had bene fitter that Ionas should haue bene meeke, and the Lord should haue bene mooued, Ionas is the stirring partie, and God himselfe doth speake calmely. But I haue touched this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this present Chapter,<note place="margin">In vers. 4.</note> and what we should learne from it. Againe it might be noted, that he speaketh not here simply, thou doest ill to be angrie, but by an interrogation, which as in Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torike we are taught, doth vrge and pierce the deeper. And therefore euen in the Scripture, for more veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie sake, things are propounded by questions. But to leaue all this concerning the manner, the matter is it which I do point at, wherein God doth as much as demaund thus; Sonne of man art thou wise, or art thou obedient, to rage thus for the gourd? See what thy wisedome is, thou ragest at the death of this greene thing, and why doest thou aske for thine owne death? Thou canst not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the spilling of that which is as nothing, and yet thou wilt preasse earnestly to the killing of thy selfe, a creature farre more excellent. And is there not great reason, why thou shouldst be thus offended? to chafe and brawle with thy maker? It is on the one side for a gourd, and on the other for a sweate, procured by the wind and Sunne. Are not these great spurrings and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocations
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:623:310"/>
to anger, a blast of wind and a shadow; because thou hast too much of the one, and too little of the other. I did looke that thou shouldest suffer farre greater things for my sake; not the shadow onely of thy head to be taken from thee, but thy head it selfe by the sword; not the heate of the Sunne alone, but of the fire to burne thee as a martyr if I would. I see that thou wouldest shrinke at great things, as at torture or cruell torment, when thou sinkest so at a little. But where is thy obedience, that as yet thou hast not learned to subscribe to all my pleasure? Thus might God iustly reprooue him, &amp; by his words illustrate the malignitie of his humour, if we onely will vnderstand it, that now he meant the gourd. But if we will conceiue it, that he bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth him for all his anger, and not alone for the gourd, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Niniue should be spared, then Ionas lyeth more open to him; for that he who had bene fauoured, should not grieue that other men should find the selfe same mercie. He sinning had bene deliuered from drowning and the whale, therefore he did ill to vexe,<note place="margin">Mat. 18.24.</note> that others also sinning should liue. When one ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant hath found fauour, peraduenture for a hundred talents, he should not grudge if another his fellow seruant do find the selfe same measure. But I will not extend this doctrine so farre as to this point, because the text euidently deliuereth it, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe of him was for his anger about the gourd.</p>
            <p n="11">11 We may make this vse thereof, that if it were such a fault, fit to be blamed by Gods owne mouth, to be so much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted for a matter of so small consequence, I will not say farre from Gods kingdome, but from the life and being of a man, see whether we may not iustly be taxed by the selfe same Lord, for fretting and such distemper in things of like importance.

This ariseth from some root of preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous emulation, or auarice, or ambition, or such a plant as by right should not haue place in the heart. But because we haue not more, shall we loath that which we haue? How worthily

may the Lord take from vs that which we do enioy, when we will so prescribe vnto him? But because we haue too much lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to embrace these worldy things, although they be but shrubs and shadowes, therefore we so take the losse of them, and vse worse meanes to gaine them, euen dissembling and decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and lying, and forswearing, (such parts as become not Christians.) May not God now say to vs, as here he saith to Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas: Do you well thus to be mooued, for the gaining or the loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of matters of so small moment? May it not be much suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that in the day of great triall, when temptations shall grow strong, you will slippe your necke from the yoke, or sinke vnder your burthens, when such petty points ouerthrow you? Would you with the Apostles leaue all, or be offered vp with Saint Paule?<note place="margin">Marc. 10 28. 2.

I wish that this were laid to the heart of all of vs in this place, that with consciences content, and resting vpon Gods prouidence, we might chearefully go forward, with that which is assigned to vs for our share or lot, to the honour of the Lord, the Church, and Vniuersitie. In a wife religious man, nature is content with a little, and if we could defalke and pluck that away from our mind, which otherwise may not be had, there be few but haue enough, vntill God do send more. And by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the want of this mind in vs, it falleth out oftentimes, that they haue least contentment, who seeme to enioy the most. But beware of comming to that passe of murmuring, and of fretting, when we haue not what we would. If we needs will follow the Prophet, let vs follow him otherwise, then in that, for the which so iustly he is in this place rebuked.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N that which goeth before, the intemperate fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and vnaduised rashnesse of the Prophet hath bene such, that he is readie to take an occasion of chiding with the Lord, vpon a most trifling cause, euen the withering of a gourd. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reprooued for it, not by his fellow seruant, but by his maisters owne mouth, he standeth on his owne iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, that he did well to be angry, yea if it were to the death. In which moode if he had departed, his iudgement now was so peruerted, that he would haue thought that he had had a great hand vpon God, that he himselfe had bene in the right, and the Lord had bene to blame, because he had not fitted his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. But the inconceiuable wisedome of the euerlasting Father, doth so farre ouermatch him, that where he expected victorie, although it were but in words and thoughts, he is taken at that aduantage, that he is for euer put to silence in this matter. For
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:623:314"/>
his owne speech is so fitly returned vpon himselfe, and he is so caught and entangled in the words of his owne mouth, that he is enforced to yeeld a greater thing, then that whereof the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent question was, and that is concerning Niniue: that since iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice was pleased to turne it selfe into mercie, and seueritie into clemencie, nothing was done vniustly, or vnbeseeming him, who is the rule of truth. For that was it which the Prophets maister in this place especially did ayme at; that his seruant shold be satisfied, and thereby all the world be aduertised to the full, that the holy one of Israel is delighted to shew pittie vpon the sonnes of men: that where repentance ascendeth from the earth to the heauen, there a pardon will come downe from the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est vpon his creatures: that Niniue it selfe whose sinnes did crye for vengeance, vpon submission and conuersion, should be spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from destruction. So that mankind in generall taking notice of such grace, and propensenesse vnto clemencie, might confesse that the Lord is gracious, and that his mercie endureth for euer.</p>
            <p n="2">2 But to make this the more euident, and so to worke in the Prophet a manifest conuiction of his errour and mistaking; from that which had bene done, and said before of the gourd, he doth gather a kind of Parable, which is rather reall then verball, full of wisedome and arte, familiar to Gods spirit; which doth natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yeeld a most significant comparison both of persons and of matters, and in the vp-shot conclude the equitie and integritie of the Lords proceedings. Wilt thou assume to thy selfe a priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be mooued with affection, and wilt thou deny me my prerogatiue in the like? wilt thou wish that ought should be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and wilt thou grieue that it should be spilled, and shall not I much more take a delight in preseruing that which otherwise would perish? Yea is all thy loue fixed on that greene thing, wherin the pleasure was small, but the profite none at all: which was but the sonne of a night (for so it is in the Hebrew) quickly vp and quickly gone? And shall not I more respect a citie, and such a citie as is that mightie Niniue, wherein, besides store of cattell, the life of the worst whereof, is farre to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore things without sence, are young and old, male and female of reasonable creatures, to a very great sort of thousands. By
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:623:315"/>
such not disputation, but demonstration rather, is warranted the fauour which was shewed to that citie, and the mouth of him who murmured is to such purpose stopped, that there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth no more replie. In handling all which matter, I shall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to deuide that which very well will not beare it, and shall touch such obseruations successiuely and in order, as the text doth offer to me. Wherein first I must say something of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and of other the like vsed in the Scripture.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The vse of speech is one of the rarest gifts, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Creator hath giuen vnto man. For it ministreth a power of opening the inward thought, or of discoursing freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning high or low causes, of celestiall matters, or terrestriall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, of spirits, of Angels, of the ioyes of the elect, of Christs incarnation, of the blessed God himselfe. But the excellencie of this is so much the greater, because it maketh man not onely to differ from the beast, but from other of his owne kind, yea and from himselfe also. The difference is great betweene the rude lippes, and the toung of the learned; betweene zealous and cold speech; the mildnesse of comfort, and the sharpnesse of rebuke; betweene affirming, and asking by a piercing interrogatiue; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene naked asseuering, and figuratiue vttering of the intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the mind. But of all kinds there is none which doth more cunningly creepe by an insinuation into the vnderstanding, and leaueth deeper impression with a feeling conceit, then a Parable doth: whose proper nature is to make shew of one matter, and to aime at another: and if it be personall the issue of it is to touch to the quicke, &amp; in a sort to extort that, which otherwise would not be graunted. The exercise whereof is for elegancie so seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and for powerfulnesse so effectuall to procure admiration, and attention in those which heare, that in the sacred Scriptures men inspired with a supernaturall and celestiall spirit, haue held this as the height of that whereunto they could attaine. When Dauid would raise himselfe to speak of high meditations, which exceeded the common qualitie,<note place="margin">Psal. 49.4.</note>

               <hi>The parables of Salomon.</hi> Yea the Son of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, who spake as neuer man spake, whose words were with authoritie, and not as the Scribes, whose speech prouoked reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and amazednesse, and astonishment, to heare that it was so gracious, spent not the least part of his doctrine in Parables &amp; similitudes, the mysticalnesse whereof preuailed much with the auditours.<note place="margin">Matth. 13.1.24.31.33.44 45.47.</note> See the thirteenth Chapter of Saint Mathew, and there you shall find seuen Parables, of the sower, of the mustard seede, of the leuen, and of the treasure, and other things beside. These made the people wonder, and giue more honour to him.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The Ministers of the Gospell, who haue a generall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to be imitatours of Christ in any thing that they may,<note place="margin">1.

Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, and Comparisons, Allusions, Applications, yea Parables, and Prouerbes which may tend to edification, and illustrating of the word. For they haue to do with weake ones, as well as with the strong, with some of queisie stomackes, with some of dull capacitie, with some which must be entised &amp; allured with a bait of industrie and eloquence, of prety and witty sentences. And where should labour be spent, but in the worke of God, which he who doth negligently is accursed;<note place="margin">Ierem. 48.10</note> or where should skill be shewed, but in fishing for mens souls, after whom Christ himselfe so caught? And such is the weaknesse of sinners, that they are as much mooued with the forme &amp; with the vtterance, as they are with the matter.<note place="margin">Aug. de doct. Christ. l. 4.24</note> Saint Austen telleth that in Caesa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea a citie of Mauritania, where himselfe sometimes liued, was a brutish senselesse custome, that on certaines daies of the yeare, the people of that place did gather themselues together, and as if they had bene mad, the father against the children, and the children against their fathers, and the neighbours against their neighbours, did throw stones with that violence, that not a few were killed with it. Who would thinke that any one, who had the face of a man, would grow to that stupidious foolerie? Yet
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:623:316"/>
let it not seeme incredible. For first so graue an authour as Saint Austen is doth witnesse it, &amp; that of his owne knowledge: and secondly I find that Leo Africanus doth make mention,<note place="margin">Leo Afric. in descript. Africae. lib. 3.</note> that a custome not vnlike this, doth remaine vntill our time, in places very neare that, to wit, in the kingdome of Fez: and thirdly such absurdities haue elsewhere bene experimented. But concerning this of Saint Austen, he aduoucheth of himselfe, that being to disswade his neighbors of Caesarea from this so long a setled cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, he speaketh to them in a loftie and eloquent kind of ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>in grandi dicendi genere,</hi> and preuailed in his desire. It is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie to be gathered from the narration of the author, and whole course of his report, that his opinion was, that if he had spoken coldly, but <hi>frigidè &amp; ieiunè,</hi> as of a common matter, he had fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of his whole purpose. So it is with other pastours, in other people and places.</p>

For one who is out of the way, cannot be brought in againe but by another turning.</hi> This is as true of the Preacher, as it euer was of the Oratour. If we had none to heare vs, but Lidia or Cornelius, persons right deuout, and affected with religious attention,<note place="margin">Act. 16.14. cap. 10.1.</note> we needed not be very carefull; but because among such as come to vs, some are weake and must be comforted, some rude and must be informed, some drousie and must be awaked, some hard and must be suppled, some peruerse and with full streame of power must be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed; to please the tastes of so many, and to helpe on those which hang backward, all good meanes are to be vsed, that God himselfe may be glorified, and our brethren may be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.

<pb n="621" facs="tcp:623:316"/>
difference of flesh, of the starres in heauen, and the like. Such li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie for comparisons, for Parables, for Examples, is left to vs, in time and place to be vsed in Gods businesse. Prouided euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that it be not for oftentation of the vanitie of mans wit, but onely for edification, and to the benefite of the hearers: that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> we turne not all into Allegories, to make plaine things obscure, and to destroy the letter, as Origene sometimes did: that we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies keepe the maiestie of the sacred word of God, and not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> giue other men occasion, to thinke vnfitly and vnreuerently of so high a mysterie, by bringing that which pleaseth vs, but no bodie besides; euen ridiculous and base stuffe. As we must euer speake those things which sauour of sound doctrine, so we must euermore handle them as the pure and chast word of God.</p>
            <p n="6">6 As this may most generally be said of Parables, that they haue an vse in diuine things, so to speake a little more specially, we find some of these in the Scripture, which in particular cases go exceedingly to the quicke of that which is in question, and being personally applied, do very much confound the guiltie. Such a one was that which Iotham vttered to the Sichemites,<note place="margin">Iudic. 9.8.</note> where the trees would choose a king, and the Bramble must be he; by the which he doth reproch vnto them, their vnthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse toward him and his fathers house. Such a one was that of Nathan to Dauid,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 12.1.</note> of him who had many sheepe, yet tooke one from his poore neighbour, whom when Dauid had condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the Prophet so turned all vpon him, that as Dauid some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times killed Goliah with his owne sword, so Nathan tooke him in his owne word. That is the wisedome of God, that he can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend another man; as in the Gospell he caught the bad ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant in his owne talke,<note place="margin">Luc. 19.22.</note> and replied: <hi>From thine owne mouth I shall iudge thee.</hi> That which was said in the person of a stranger, if another will apply to his owne person, he will then amend his iudgement. This was the case of Ionas, to whom the Lord vsed a Parable, but rather reall then verball. He had a gourd and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed it; then he loosing it raged at it; but knew not what all this meant. The Lord then to bring him forward, and make him see his hard heart toward that great citie Niniue, asked if he did well to be angrie. Ionas balketh him not at all, but forth with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth,
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:623:317"/>
that he did well to be angrie, yea if it had bene to the death. Here indeede the Lord doth come on him. Thou hast pittie vpon this trifle, and shall not I vpon Niniue: Thus with his owne rod he beat him, and with his owne net he caught him. After the battell of Cannae,<note place="margin">Liu. lib. 23.</note> when Mago being sent from his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hannibal, had in the Carthaginian Senate much boasted of the victorie; how many armies and Generals of the Romanes they had ouerthrowne, and withall for the finishing of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, desired a new supply of souldiers and monie. It is written that one Himilco a friend to Hannibal, tooke occasion to insult ouer Hanno another noble man, who was of the aduerse factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and who euermore had disswaded their making warre with the Romaines: That he was a proper counseller, who had sought to hinder that which had brought them such aduantage, such a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie, and such honour. But it was the wisedome and art of Hanno being thus prouoked, to retort the matter vpon him <hi>ex tempore</hi> as he did. You speake of a glorious victorie; but what gaine we thereby? for if you had lost the field, what could you haue asked more then now ye do, that is fresh men and monie? Haue the Romanes yeelded vnto you? or haue they sued for peace? If they haue not, then their stomacke is as great as it was before: and if their force be diminished, so is yours as well as theirs: so that peize the one with the other, you are as farre from your purpose, as you were at the beginning. It was there the praise of Hanno, that he turned their owne tale vpon them. In this place God being so much wiser, as infinite and vnlimited may be beyond dust and ashes, turneth both matter and words vpon the head of our Ionas, and doth teach him such a lesson, that what the Prophet thought made most for him, he shewed made most against him. By his anger for the gourd, he condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his former anger. If he would grieue that the greene thing should be marred, because he liked it, how vniustly did he fret that Niniue should be spared, when the Lord had a liking to it? So step by step, and by degrees God is faine to teach him to know himselfe, and that wherein he thought himselfe very cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Yet at length by a demonstration, plainely gathered from the precedents, he euicteth what he desireth. Now let vs see
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:623:317"/>
what that was.</p>
            <p n="7">7 The second thing which I note, is the forme or expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of the Parable, by entring a comparison betweene the Lord and Ionas. There is a great Antithesis betweene the persons co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and the things whereabout they stroue, and the end of their intention. Of the persons one was a man, whose breath was in his nostrels, who had neither wisedome to iudge, what was fittest to be done, nor power to bring about, what he fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had imagined: whose pleasure if it were amisse must be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured by a iudge; if right, then it must depend vpon the becke of another. The one was he who was fancifull, and mutable, and humorous, and inconstant in all his waies, who would doate on a greene bough, and be spitefull to a whole citie. But the other was that grand one who raigneth aboue in heauen, full of power and full of wisedome, who directeth all his creatures in number, waight, and measure: whose word goeth for an Oracle, whose will is for a law, who can do what he listeth, &amp; none must stand against him. So the things whereof the question was, were in like sort different: the one spake for a tree, or greene herbe of the ground, which grew vp on the sudden, and as suddenly was gone, which was but of one daies standing, and which so long as he had it, was not at all by his labour: he neither planted nor watered it, but his great maister did send it: and againe for that space wherein he had it, none else was the better for it, but he alone made vse of it: and his pleasure was no more, but either to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it vnder it as a shadow or a bower, or to gaze and looke vpon it. But the other thing was Niniue, the huge citie of the world, the gouernesse of the East, the mansion of the king, the glorie of the Empire, where were so many thousands as were leaues vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the gourd: where children were in great number, little infants, and little innocents: and where was much store of cattell, the life of the worst whereof was better then a gourd. A citie, and a great citie, and populous, and repentant, should sway more then a shadow. Then their ends were as different: the one wold shew his fancie, the other would shew his mercie: the one thought of his present pleasure, the other would record to all posteritie an example of clemencie &amp; pittie: the one had respect
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:623:318"/>
to himselfe, the other to his creatures. Now if the seruant so lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the gourd, because he liked it, how might the maister loue a citie, because he had a mind vnto it?</p>
            <p n="8">8 For the better opening of this comparison, the text ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth vnto vs,<note place="margin">Ionah. 1.2.</note> that <hi>Niniue was a great citie,</hi> which I haue touched twise before, as first in the first chapter, where that ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>a great citie,</hi> is giuen vnto it: and then in the third chapter, where it is named <hi>an excellent citie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 3.3.</note> 
               <hi>and of three daies iourney.</hi> In which two places, both from the Scriptures and other appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued authours, I shewed the greatnesse of it, for the compasse &amp; for the wals, and made plaine the reasons of it. Now here some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is added for the hugenesse of the place, which agreeth with all the rest; that there were so many infants within the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of it,<note place="margin">A million is commonly taken for ten hundred thousand: but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for ten thousand.</note> as one hundred and twentie thousand: so many, as if we take a million for ten thousand, do make no lesse then twelue millions, which arise to sixe score thousands. And lest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man should imagine, that children of riper age were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended there, the text describeth these children to be all of them so little, that they could not discerne betweene their right hand and their left hand: which seemeth to be some Prouerbe among the Hebrewes,<note place="margin">1. Reg. 21.21</note> like that, <hi>I will cut off from Ahab euery one that maketh water against a wall,</hi> that is, all that are males: &amp; here are meant none but very young ones. I know that some haue thought the number set downe here, to be a certaine num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding for an vncertain: &amp; so they do interpret it, that there were many thousand babes; and no more to be implyed. But I wil not do that iniurie to the Spirit of God, as to doubt but this number must definitely be taken for so many thousands full out: that there were at least of these little ones sixe score completed thousands. The compasse of the citie, as in former times I haue shewed, was three-score Italian miles, wherin that many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, yea a hundred thousand houses might stand, may well appeare from proportion of other cities. Athens was neuer tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which proportion if we will compare place to place, we shall see that there needeth no scruple to remaine in this whole matter. Ordinarily there are more of children in al places, then of any age by proportion. All who are elder, haue first bin infants: but all infants grow not elder: death cutteth off many of them. Allow then that these children of three yeares old and vnder, or foure yeares if ye will, were the seuenth part of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: yet the whole number of inhabitants, shall but little exceed the double of the Romanes. If you will suppose the children for the tenth or the twelfth part, and not so low as the seuenth, yet Niniue will still beare it. Then this must be accepted as a iustifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble truth, not onely ratified by faith and the word of God, but probable and most likely in the naturall course of things.

Socrates the Historien doth tell of some,<note place="margin">Socrat. Hist.

            <p n="10">10 If I should proceede at large to obserue vnto you eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry point, which may fitly be deduced hence, I might iustly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend your patience. I will therefore but briefly touch that which may be enlarged farther. In speaking of the gourd, it is said that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the Prophet did neuer labour for it: he had it when he thought not of it. This commendeth the most large bountie of him who ruleth all things, who not onely sendeth somewhat to Ionas without his labour, but to euery man besides. In that sort he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with him, from whome we all are deriued: he put him into the world, as into a house prepared and furnished to his hand. Although not in that high degree, yet many men of the world do tast of this in great measure. Inheritours vnto kingdomes, &amp; other earthly possessions left to them by their parents, and for which they did neuer sweate, but found them readie prouided, are partakers of this blessing. Their thankfulnesse should be the greater, because their labour was the lesse. Many of vs here as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled, haue experience of Gods kindnesse powred on vs in that behalfe; when we inhabite houses which we our selues ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer built, and feed of that, and are clothed with it which we
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:623:320"/>
did neuer buy. Gods selected and choise instruments our hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable founders, haue prouided these things for vs, wherein we had no more finger, then Ionas had in his gourd, and the enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof we could no more promise vnto our selues, then they which least partake them. It behooueth vs to remember, that these consecrated things are not disposed by God, nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed by his seruants, for idlenesse or luxurie, or pampering of our selues, but there is another end which will exactly be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of vs, the glorifying of Christ, an attendance at the altar, a seruice in the Tabernacle, or at least a doing of good in a ciuill and sociable life, that it be not ill spent vpon vs, which might better be spared. Now as some do plentifully tast of wels which they neuer digged, so there is not the poorest man, nor most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented creature, but herein he hath a share. For doth he liue and mooue? what paines did he take for that? It was giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he thought not of it. Hath he the earth to beare him, the water to refresh him, the aire to returne him breath? what doth he for all these matters? We are very dull if we see not, that all the treasure vpon earth, is not like to these gifts: the worth whereof we conceiue not, because we haue them, but let vs want them but a little, and we shall easily see at how high a rate they are to be esteemed. But who is he that will earnestly enter into himselfe, and call his wits to remembrance, who may not see that from his cradle vnto this day, many things according to his proportion haue bene bestowed vpon him: which came wholly by Gods prouidence, and quite without his trauell. The conscience of each priuate man may best of all testifie this: but euery one hath had more or lesse; the most needie many an almes, and other men other matters. He who sent the gourd to the Prophet when he did not labour for it, sent these good gifts to them, and it was none but himselfe: his name be praised for it.</p>

kindreds and their houses, and the accompt of the children. And did he then precisely know, how many and whose they were, and doth he not so now? Was there knowledge vnder the law, and is there not in the time of grace? was there fauour to the Gentiles, and is there not to the Christians? Yes, he is the Lord and chaungeth not: his goodnesse shall neuer decrease. Then certainly as he is not ignorant of the reprobates, so he taketh note of the faithfull with a peculiar knowledge: he vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth how many be in each of all their families, what old ones, and what impotent, what young ones and weake ones there be, and there is not one of them, but by one meanes or another, he feedeth him and sustaineth him. If we could looke backe a little, and remember those pinching seasons which not long since gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped our land, it would teach vs this point; when some poore who had many children, were miraculously so kept aliue vnfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mished, as no mans wit could deuise.<note place="margin">Psal. 147.9.</note> He who feedeth the yong rauens, then prouided for them. He neuer made a belly, but he made meate for that belly: he neuer framed a backe, but he made clothes to couer it. Perhaps in that hard season, the poore sold and pledged that little which they had. But the time was in Egypt,<note place="margin">Genes. 47.13</note> when the rich ones were glad to do that; when first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and cattell went, and then afterward land and libertie. But suppose that some sold their stuffe to releeue themselues and their children: yet was not their life preserued? and may not God send a time to restore those things againe? Who gaue them that stuffe at first, but he who may giue it them a second time? And it may be that in the meane while, he did teach vnthriftie persons not to wast as fast as they get, but by diligence to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide somewhat against a day of neede.

He who could raine bread from heauen, &amp; bring water out of a rocke, can touch the heart of some friend, or kinsman, or neighbour, or peraduenture of some straunger, to take them to his protection: or worke some other meanes, which it is not in mans power specially to prescribe. And the more to strengthen the faith of such whom this concerneth, in our age he aduanceth men of low estate to great places: as Saul from seeking the Asses,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 9.3. Psal. 78.70.</note> and Dauid from the Sheepe-fold, to be rulers ouer Israel; so the children of poore parents, by wisedome and by learning, by Diuinitie and by Law, by skill in nauigatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or militarie seruice, to stand before the greatest, yea to sit some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with Princes. Then let heathenish solicitude and caring without end, neuer trouble the hearts of Christians: they haue to do with a Lord who knoweth them &amp; their retinue: he hath them in a rolle, and maketh prouision for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: their <hi>dimensum,</hi> that is, their portion shall not be detained from them. Yea to make them the more assured, that the Lord doth thinke on the meanest men, in my text he speaketh of cattell, that in Niniue they were not forgotten. They are also his handy-worke, and therefore he neglecteth not them, but he accompteth of them in their due place. He made them to beautifie the great frame of the world, that the earth should not be solitarie and naked in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place: he created them as attendants, and seruants vnto man, to do him many offices: his eye is daily vpon them, to multiply them and feede them, and therefore it is no maruell, if he do for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get them no where. But in Niniue by an open Proclamation fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the King and his Nobles,<note place="margin">Ionah. 3.8.</note> they were forced to abstaine from their foode, and to crye to God as they could, and therefore as they bore some burthen in the penance, so the Lord meant that they also should haue a part of the mercie. Now if these brutish creatures be so thought on by the Highest; if by so many res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects he hath tied them to himselfe, then how precious is the life and lasting of man, how is that eye which neuer slumbereth nor sleepeth, fixed vpon him? An horse, or oxe, or asse is res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:623:321"/>
by his maker, and therefore a man much more. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are cared for by him, and accounted of, and considered, and therefore elder folkes more.</p>
            <p n="13">13 I should not leaue these children yet, but shew that the Almightie God, who is gracious to all creatures, old and young, and man and beast, according to the course of his ordinarie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, had great reason to spare the little ones, and with them all the City. For the Lord neither vseth else-where, neither doth practise it in this place, to send any extraordinarie punishment, onely for originall sinne; and yet there was little actuall trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression in these silly infants. That which should haue happened vnto them, was most for their parents sakes; &amp; they already had repented in sackcloth &amp; in ashes; therefore together with the reconciling of the elder sort, they also were vndoubtedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled. But he who would haue spared Sodome,<note place="margin">Genes. 18 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He might haue vrged Ionas thus: If the men &amp; women haue deserued to be destroyed, yet what haue the children done? But I will prosecute this no farther. Thus euery way the integritie of Gods deede standeth vpright: his threats were to their good: his forbearing was a signe of his endlesse commise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which the most rigorous man, if he would not put off the bowels of all humane affection, must not onely acknowledge to be blamelesse, and free from reproofe; but also graciously ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the same. And if any would be so impudent, as yet to rest vnsatisfied, although God had debased himselfe, to come to yeelde a reason, and capitulate with his seruant; yet this must stop his mouth: He liketh it, and therefore who dareth dislike it? But it is not so with our Prophet: for although in former times he wanted no faults, yet he is not still so refractarie, as stubburnly to stand out, but his curst hart at length commeth downe, and he yeeldeth as he should. For as if he had bene fully answered by this last demonstration, we finde not that he replyed: but he is as mute as a fish. Which may be a good instruction, to men the most peremptorie and setled in their opinions, that with the
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:623:322"/>
strength of their fancie or preiudicate conceite, they be not too straightly laced in their thoughts to other men. For where an ill mind toward other is entertained, by mistaking or wrong infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, or whispering tales of slanderers, if an answere may be heard, or reason compared with reason, furie may be quickly appeased.<note place="margin">2.

But if we will be so head-strong, that nothing can reclaime vs, let vs consider other folkes, and not onely our selues, and griefe will soone be appeased. If Ionas had had the grace to thinke that it might be his case, as it was the case of the Niniuites, or that it might be the portion of Hierusalem Gods owne Citie, he might haue bene patient before. But being now as he was, when he looked vpon the Lord, and saw that it more concerned him, for the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His silence sheweth his consent. Because he gaue no reply, it seemeth that he was satisfied. He endeth well who began ill, and better late then neuer. Thus albeit the entrance was rough, the close was very calme.

Or if you would except against that their example, because they were so furnished, with speciall gifts and graces, how should they who were our fathers, and begetters in the faith, men of qualitie like our selues, clothed with the same infirmities, haue aduentured vpon the seruice?

If we must needs be reprooued, how much better is it to endure that for doing of our dutie, then for sitting still and doing nothing? I dare pronounce this, as first of all from out the Scripture, so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly from some other matters which my selfe haue heard and seene, that at such time as we come to our death-bed, (when it were ten thousand follies to flatter our soules in vanitie, and sooth our selues with a lie) it is one of the hardest and heauiest burthens, to thinke that we haue neglected the ministerie of the Gospell: our owne harts cannot be satisfied, by exclaming against that ouersight. And on the other side, it is a ioy of all ioyes, inconceiueable and vnspeakeable, that our conscience shall giue witnesse, and that before the Lord, that we haue not refused to beare the heat of the day, to stand vp in the gap, but haue planted and watered duly: we haue passed on with cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, to the marke which is before vs, and haue not liued as a by-word, or a burthen of the Church.

That <hi>virtutis amore,</hi> to loue vertue for vertues sake, and religion for religion, is the right that we should ayme at. Let vs shake off all incumberments, and if we haue a message in our mouthes, at one Niniue or another, let vs do it, let vs deliuer it.

For the force of that word is great, which commeth from the most high maiestie of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie: and especially when it is vttered with a zeale, which is mixed with sober discretion; and when Gods honour is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally shot at by the speaker, and his omnipotencie is throughly sollicited with frequent and holy prayer, to giue a blessing to the labour. And what a ioy is it, to be an instrument not contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, in sauing the soules of men; to haue had a peece of a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, in completing that for which Christ Iesus came from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen? Lord send vs thy best direction, that we may make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of our calling, that nothing do abash vs, or detaine vs in the exercise of our vocation, but that with an vpright foote we may crosse the way of this pilgrimage, that so we may be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to raigne with thy Sonne Christ Iesus, to whom with thee and the euerlasting Spirit, be glory and praise eternall.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>HRISTIAN Reader, hauing learned this lesson, that a Minister of the Gospell is to do good, in and to the Church of Christ, so farre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth as possibly he may while he liueth in this world; I do not refuse to publish to the view of many men these small labours of mine, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther learned or vnlearned may reape some profite from them. And if in the perusing of them, thou do find either directly or by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance, that mention is made of some things, which were done or suffered now some yeares past; vnderstand it for a truth, that I first aduentured on the handling of this Prophecie in the yeare <hi>1594,</hi> and brought it to an end in <hi>99.</hi> For it is the manner of our Vniuersitie, that no one man doth continually keepe and reade our English Lectures or Sermons, as it is in diuerse other charges in this Realme; but in as much as there be among vs many, who are furnished with great gifts and graces from aboue, our exercises here are supplied by sundry persons; who when they haue perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med any of these solemne ones, are not immediatly called againe, but haue a conuenient space left to employ their talent, in other Churches of the citie, or countrie adioyning, or in their priuate Colledges, or where else it pleaseth God to offer them oportunitie. But among other the most holy, religious, and fruitfull exercises in our assembly, there is none in my opinion more honorable to the Almightie, nor more profitable to our brethren among vs, then those Lectures, which with solemnitie are kept both winter and sommer on the thursday mornings early; where sometimes before day-light, the praises of God are by preaching sounded out in the great congregation. For there euen on the working dayes, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our youth which are sent hither for good education from most places of this land, are trained vp in the knowledge of godlinesse, which maketh them afterward the more deuoutly able, to do ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice and performe a dutie in Church and common-wealth: but

the elder and strongest sort, by fresh and various remembrances are quickened to go forward in the way of righteousnesse, the weak are comforted, the straying are recalled, the obstinate are conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and all kinds of men which will repaire thither are duly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed. It were great pittie therefore, but that the reuerend &amp; godly Vice-chauncellers, and chiefe gouernours of this body, shold from time to time take faithfull care, to perpetuate this holy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice and businesse, by stirring vp the spirits of many of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren with alacritie and chearefulnesse to continue this free-will offering to the Lord, which he himselfe certainly will requite, and alreadie in his mercie hath not left vnrewarded in many of them who haue taken paines this way. There is no man that in the end loseth, but gaineth by the true seruice of our Almightie maker. In the turnes of this voluntarie Lecture, haue the most part of these Sermons vpon Ionas bene preached: which hath bene the cause that I haue bene forced to be so long, in perfecting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summating this worke. But yet, now that I am resolued to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it farther, I thinke it not vnfit therein to recount those things, which vpon speciall occasions of the times, had their first and most direct vse before; in as much as I haue warrant thereof by examples of holy Scripture, where there be plentifully recorded to vs matters past: and in the Sermons and Homilies of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers of the Primitiue Church, we at this day reade me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of famines, or pestilences, or warres, or vnseasonable weather, or such other like occurrents, from which great vtilitie may now be reaped; as to teach the people (for their comfort in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie, or warning in prosperitie) that God dealeth by men in this age as in former times; and the Minister, that he shold not be blind but quick-sighted, to make application to his auditorie, of such be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites or punishments, as are sensibly represented to his congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The same or the like vse we may make of hearing that good or euill, which lately before befell our selues or our brethren, that so by things which are past, as well as by the present, Gods name may be glorified, and our consciences religiously edified. As for the most part of matters handled here, be they either exhortations, or applications, or doctrines, or refutations of any opinions, Popish, or otherwise erronious, they haue their perpetuall commoditie, and

In the reuoluing whereof if any man shall take profite, I shall be right glad, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a blessing of God on me, that he maketh my weaknesse the meanes and instrument to build any thing, be it but little in his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall house. The Lord direct vs aright in our knowledge and vnderstanding: the Lord guide our waies, that we may euermore walke in his feare, that passing ouer the dayes of this pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage with comfort, we may in the end dwell in ioyfull and euerlasting habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. <hi>Amen.</hi>
