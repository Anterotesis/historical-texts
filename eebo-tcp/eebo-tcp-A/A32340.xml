         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the fatall Blow there given to the Prince his Forces,
the Court hath continually rung with sorrow, and
his Highnesse is very sad and melancholy: Since which
time, there hath been a great disputation held by his Privy

Councell, whose result was, That new propositions should
be sent to the Parl. of Scotland, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 That his declared
Majesty would wive his assent, for the setling of Religion,
according to the solemn League and Covenans.</p>
                     <p>2 That he would wholly apply his Ear to the Councell

might be had to the tender Consciences of those who have
adhered to or assisted him.</p>
                     <p>But this will hardly be; for he must either become a
perfect Covenanter, or else a despised Prince.</p>
                     <p>Many of the Royall party have caused proclamation to

they fell upon Ballyshanon, have taken it, and are rallyed,
being about twelve thousand within twelve miles of Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin
and fallen to their old way of disputing passes: which
when lost, they run to the next: they increase by the coming

               <head>The Scots-Resolution touching their King.</head>
               <p>First, that prevailing party of Sectaries of England,
who have broken the Covenant, and despised the Oath
of God, corrupted the truth, subverted the fundamentall
Government, by King and Parliament, and taken away the
life, look upon us with an evill eye, as upon those who
stand in the way of their monstrous and new-fingled devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
in Religion and Government, and though there were no
cause to fear any thing for that party, but the Gangrene
and infection of those many damnable and abominable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
which have taken hold on them, yet our vicinity unto
and dayly to commerce with that nation, may justly make
us afraid that the Lord may give up many in this land un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a spirit of delusion, to beleeve lyes, because they have
not received the love of truth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Neither is the Malignant party so far broken
and brought low, as that they have abandoned all hopes of
carrying on their former designes against the Covenant,
and work of Reformation, besides many of them in this
Kingdom who are as Foxes tyde in chaines, keeping in evill
nature, and waiting opportunity to break their cords, and
again to prey upon the Lords people. That the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Armies in Ireland, under the command of the Marq.
of Ormond, the Lord Inchiqueen, the Lord of Airds, and
George Munroe, who forgetting the horrible cruelty that
was exercised by the Irish and English Nations in that
Land, have entred into a Peace and association with
them, that they may the more easily carry on the old design
of the Popish, Prelatical and Malignant party, and the Lord
of Airds, and George Munroe, have by treachery and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
brought the Province of Ulster, and Garrisons
therein, under their power and command, and have redac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
our Country-men, and such as adhere unto the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103456:4"/>
and cause of God in that Province unto many miseries
and straits, and are like to banish the Ministers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
and to overturn these fair beginnings of the worke of
God, which were unto many a branch of hope, that the
Lord meant to make Ireland a pleasant Land.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, But which is more grievous unto us then all
these, our King notwithstanding of the Lords hand, against
his fathers opposition to the work of God, and bearing
down all those in the three Kingdomes, by which it is come
to passe, that his Majesty hath hitherto refused to grant the
just and necessary desires of this Kirk and Kingdom, which
were tendred unto him from the Commissioners of both
for securing of Religion, the liberties of the Subject, his
<hi>Mai</hi> Government, and the peace of the Kingdom; and it is
much to be feared that those wicked Councellours may so
far prevail upon him in his tender years, as to engage him
in a War for ouerturning (if it be possible) of the Work of
God, and bearing down all those in the three Kingdoms that
adhere thereto, which if he shall do, cannot but bring great
wrath from the Lord upon himself and his Throne, and
must be the cause of many new and great miseries and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
to these Lands.</p>
               <p>And albeit the Lands be involved in many difficulties and
compassed about with great and imminent dangers; yet
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>here is hope and ground of consolation concerning this
thing; the Lord is in the midst of us, and we are called by
his name, our ears hear the joyfull sound of the Gospell,
add our eyes see our Teachers. We behold the arm of the
Lord stretched out daily in working salvation for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and answering their desires upon their enemies, by ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
things in righteousnesse; although we be few in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103456:4"/>
yet the Lord of Hosts is with us, and in the power of
his strength we shall be able to prevaile; although our land
be filled with sin, yet we have not been forsaken of the
Lord our God, but he hath always had compassion upon
us, and delivered us in all our distresse; although some of

they may be persecuted but shall not be forsaken; they

uniformity and the work of Reformation in these hands
