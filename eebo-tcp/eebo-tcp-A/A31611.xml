            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Tho ſhe was a Princeſs endued with the greateſt gifts of Fortune and Nature, (Wealth and Beauty) yet ſhe reſembles the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in nothing more than a lowly Humility: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Madam,</hi> I have good Reaſon to preſume, that ſhe cannot deny you to be one of her Maids of Honour.</p>

            <head>Eromena: OR, THE NOBLE STRANGER.</head>
            <p>WHen the Earth had long lain marbl'd up in Froſts, and grown weary of the white Livery of Nature, began to inveſt it ſelf with the more pleaſing Enamel of the verdant Spring; when a young <hi>Spartan</hi> Lord, attended with a noble and magnificent Train, had almoſt ſpent the Morning in the Chaſe of a ſtately Stag, which they had
<pb facs="tcp:105567:5"/>
forc'd from the ſafer protection of the Foreſt, to the hazards and perils of a flow'ry Plain, till dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by his clamorous Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to the horrid Aſcent of a craggy Cliff; where, as it were grown proud to fall a Sacrifice, he ſinks weeping, while the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious ſhouts of his Hunters eccho the ſad News of their Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's Death to the diſtant Herds.</p>
            <p>So ſoon as their ſhrill Horns had perform'd his funeral Obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies, their fight was entertain'd with a more ſtartling and fatal proſpect: from their lofty Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they behold a Ship, with Chriſtian Colours, combating with an whole Squadron of <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh</hi> Pyrates; the Air had not the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105567:5"/>
leaſt Blaſt of Anger in her looks, nor the Clouds of Horror, when the mercileſs <hi>Turks,</hi> with their prevailing numbers, over-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er'd, and boarded the wretched Chriſtians, to whom nothing could poſſibly afford any aid but only the prevalent Oratory of their Prayers; which propitious Heaven ſoon heard, and pitying their Miſeries, commanded a Delivery.</p>
            <p>Preſently the Clouds, big with impending Showers, loud Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der roaring, and horrid Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning roving through the darken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Air, proclaim a Tempeſt; <hi>Neptune</hi> rouls his watery Plains into tranſparent Mountains, and hurls them at the head of <hi>Jove</hi>;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105567:6"/>
and Nature her ſelf look'd ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted, as if ſhe would ſink back into that matter that firſt cover'd the face of rude and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted <hi>Chaos</hi>; ſtrait the floating Caſtles are torn; among the towering Cliffs, the Sails and Maſts rent by the angry Winds from the huge Hulk, gave as ſad Groans as departing Souls from ſinful Bodies. But the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning by degrees to recover her loſt Light, made way for a more ſad Diſcovery: Now the curl'd Waves begin to diſplay the Trophies of their Cruelty in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing funeral pomps and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd ruines; here you might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſome wretched Objects, that having long ſtruggl'd with the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105567:6"/>
foaming Billows, ſink and dye; yonder a pair as conſtant in their Friendſhip as any whom the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets have deify'd, meet their Fate both together, and dye in each others Embraces: the <hi>Trytons</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh the beautiful and tender Virgins in their Lovers ſight, and afterwards quench thoſe bright Lamps their Eyes in a too certain and unlamented Deſtiny.</p>
            <p>Whiles ſuch ſad Spectacles drew pity from their Hearts and tears from their Eyes, a grating and ſurprizing Noiſe aſſaulted their Ears, which in baſe, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cowards might have begot an extraordinary Fear, but in them ſtirr'd up a flame of Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and Courage, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105567:7"/>
under the Rock a Company of thoſe ſhipwrack'd perſons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in a deſperate Combate; but when by a nearer approach every <hi>Individuum</hi> became more plain and obvious, from Surpriſe they were to ſuch a Wonder in which <hi>Poets</hi> uſe to celebrate their Heroes, to ſee a noble <hi>Chriſtian</hi> with every Blow expell a <hi>Turk</hi>'s black Soul. Yet at length the number of his Foes blunted the edge of his Valour, and had made him ſtoop to an ignoble Conqueſt, had not the brave <hi>Therſander</hi> (follow'd by his ſmall Retinue of Hunters) by a ſpeedy Aid, crown'd Chriſtian Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude with the Lavvrel of Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; vvhich vvas ſo compleat,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105567:7"/>
that only one ſurviv'd to be the unwelcome Meſſenger of their Ruine.</p>
            <p>But when <hi>Therſander</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio</hi> (for ſo was the noble Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian nam'd) took a ſerious view of their pitied dead, they found one worthy Soul that had not yet diſſerted the tottering habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Life, though his Wounds were ſo numerous and dangerous that his Friend, the Noble <hi>Hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi> took the greateſt Care ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable to reſtore his juſt expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Spirits, to gather ſtrength ſufficient to get to <hi>Therſander</hi>'s Palace; to which, he of his own innate Goodneſs (and their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity prompting) invited them to repoſe, making his Dwelling
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105567:8"/>
at once both a Sanctuary and the Throne of Charity to neceſſitous Strangers. 'Twas now in the cool time of the Evening, when <hi>Phoebus</hi> was repos'd in the lap of <hi>Thetis,</hi> when they arriv'd at the Caſtle</p>
            <p>And here the extraordinary Splendour of the Palace, and the Commodiouſneſs of its Scituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are ſufficient to commend themſelves. It was loftily ſeated on the Aſcent of a ſtately Hill, whoſe Baſis was well fring'd with long-liv'd Oaks and prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Cedars, which ſweetly ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the adjacent fragrant Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, through which a ſpacious River ſmoothly glided to inrich the flowry Valleys, and render
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105567:8"/>
them both pleaſing and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>Here the Noble <hi>Therſander</hi> choſe rather to make his Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence than in the lazy Greatneſs and idle Trifles of the glittering Court: here it is that he is now grovvn old in Virtue, and begins to bow under the weight of Time; and ſince all the Glories of his younger days, now in the Calm of his Age, had left him nothing to embalm his Name but Virtue, he ſtrives in that to be at once the greateſt Wonder and the beſt example to his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, the leaſt of his Actions being fill'd with a Goodneſs ſo ſweet and amiable, that like the ruines of once flouriſhing Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:105567:9"/>
ſacred to the Gods, the adoring Vulgar reverence their Memory, and think nothing more ſacred than the demoliſh'd Monuments of never-dying An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity.</p>
            <p>In his Hall hung no Pictures repreſenting the wanton embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of an obſcene <hi>Venus</hi>; nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed any thing that had the leaſt reſemblance of Softneſs or Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacy; the Walls were all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with uſeful and ſhining Armour, which his own Servants, valiant and loyal, manag'd when ever his Prince and Country re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd their Aſſiſtance, and never made uſe of them againſt either in a popular Faction, whoſe cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Seeds were firſt engender'd
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105567:9"/>
by Hell, and maintain'd by Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition.</p>
            <p>His Friend <hi>Aphron</hi> being reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd of his Wounds, and <hi>Hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio</hi>'s Diſcontent being quite loſt in the ſplendour and pleaſure of the Palace, they had no <hi>Remora</hi> to ſtay them, but only to pay thoſe Acknovvledgments which the Gratitude and Generoſity of <hi>Therſander</hi> requir'd them. They were juſt preparing to take their leaves, when a Meſſenger brings in a Packet to <hi>Therſander,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a Mandate from his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Maſter, to attend him the next day; and that his Appearance at Court might be the more ſplendid and illuſtrious by ſuch Attendants, he incites in them a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105567:10"/>
ſtrong deſire to view the Royal Divertiſements of the Court, by a Story, the fatal Truth of which hath often transferred the <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> Glory to the utmoſt Confines of the Univerſe.</p>
            <p>It was my Fate Sirs (ſaid he) to be then an Attendant on my Prince, when the ſame occaſion that draws him to this place now, prov'd at once the Cauſe of Joy and Grief. Not far from hence lies the Vale of <hi>Ceres,</hi> where his belov'd <hi>Eromena</hi> reſides, a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that Nature only created for Man to wonder at; and when created, ſhe broke her Mould, ſo that ſince ſhe has not been able to produce her equal: ſhe vvas not more the comfort of his Age
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105567:10"/>
than the glory of her Sex. But I engage my ſelf in a too tedious Relation, vvhich in brief take thus.</p>
            <p>When Beauty was firſt enrich'd by Youth, with manly ſtrength; her Royal Mother vvas the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Partner of his Bed, who kept up a flame of Vertue in her Soul that gave light to a Beauty, truly great and excellent. Some years had now paſt over 'em ſince they were firſt acquainted vvith thoſe private Pleaſures that enrich the Nuptial Bed, 'ere ſhe made her Offerings at <hi>Lucina</hi>'s Temple. Both their good Angels ſate in Council for her ſafety, and an univerſal Joy fill'd the Breaſts of both Parents vvith big and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105567:11"/>
hopes of a Boy to be the <hi>Spartan</hi> Heir; while the Subjects expreſs theirs in exalted <hi>Io</hi>'s, and ſounds of Triumph.</p>

whilst I, putting off the frail Robes of Mortality, take my Paſſage through the cold Grave, to mount and mingle with the ſhining Stars. O my Lord!

which the exceſſive love of her Royal Father had rais'd beyond all parallel, that as long as this Place is graced by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence, no Cauſe, although Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, but is heard and judged by the Royal Princeſs, whoſe Mercy, when Deſpair has ſhrunk up the Spirits of the Oppreſt, has been their ſafeſt Refuge and <hi>Aſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum.</hi>

            <p>Beneath them were plac'd the Hiſtorians, whoſe long-liv'd Works have erected for them ſo high and firm a Monument of Fame, as neither Men nor Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity it ſelf ſhall ever demoliſh.</p>
            <p>All which, the Genius of the Princes ran over with an heedleſs Haſte, untill obſtructed by a more myſterious Viſion that fix'd her wandring Fancy.</p>
            <p>A Light, bright as the Sun, directs her where ſhe beholds the better Genius of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> mounted on a ſtately Throne, whoſe proud State was ſupported by three noble Knights, who equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:105567:26"/>
aim'd at the Royal Seat; vvhich ſince they could not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to, vvas equally divided 'tvvixt her three fair Daughters: When the divided Throne had fix'd a Diadem on each Angle, the royal Stem that bore her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Crovvn, brings to her Vievv its glorious Race of Kings, vvhoſe Rear vvas led up by her Royal Father.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105567:27"/>
much more when ſhe ſaw the aged Prince appear again dreſt in a poor Pilgrims Weed, leading a lovely Boy, in whoſe innocent Looks ſhe reads the ſoft Lectures of Pity and Compaſſion: but while ſhe ſtood gazing on the ſweet Youth, by a ſudden and inviſible Fate, he ſeem'd tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd to the Perſon of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Horatio</hi>: with Aſtoniſhment ſhe beheld him, offering the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of his Heart to her fair <hi>Idea</hi>: there the exceſs of Joy had rob'd her of her ſweet Slumbers, had not a ſudden black Cloud of fear obſcur'd the glorious dream; preſently a dreadful Miſt, black as the Vapors of the <hi>Stygian</hi> flood, fill'd the place with a quick, but
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:105567:27"/>
horrid Darkneſs; and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe its terror, 'twas follow'd by loud Claps of Thunder, charged with Volleys of ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Lightning, which gave the Princeſs light enough to behold the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Horatio</hi> groveling in his Blood; which ſhe no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſaw but ſhe ceaſed to be the Miſtreſs of her Paſſions, and burſt forth into ineffable Shrieks and paſſionate Invocations. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing founded in her Ears but his hollow expiring Groans, which bathed her in a cold Sweat of tears.</p>
            <p>But now a ſecond Flaſh of Lightning, attended with a wild Horror, preſented the pale form of her Royal Father; which no
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:105567:28"/>
ſooner vaniſh'd, but a Troop of Ghoſts ſeem'd to deſcend from the dark Priſon of the cold grave, endeavoured to ſeize her, and bear her to the gloomy Confines of that ſad abode; when juſt as ſhe appear'd to ſink, lo! a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplendent Cloud bow'd from the fair Arch of Heaven, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the Noble <hi>Horatio</hi> clad in bright Armour, who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately redeemed her from the threatning danger: which done, the horrid Darkneſs vaniſh'd, and the welcome Sun of glorious Comfort, diſplay'd its Beams, by whoſe Light ſhe beholds a Throne ſomewhat reſembling the former, but far more rich and ſtately, on which the good
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:105567:28"/>
Genius's (miniſtring Angels) plac'd her and her lov'd <hi>Horatio</hi>; in which extaſie of Joy ſhe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakes, and with a pleaſing Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deſcants on the particulars of her Dream; the memory of which ſhall live ſo long within her thoughts, untill Fate fulfill thoſe illegible Myſteries of the dark Predictions.</p>
            <p>Soon as the Morning dawn'd, the Princeſs roſe, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately withdrew from all bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome Society to improve her Joy in the private ſhadows of a ſilent Grove; in which pleaſing and delightful task whilſt her Fancy was enrich'd by her Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, <hi>Horatio</hi> enters with ſo great an haſte, as diſcover'd ſome
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:105567:29"/>
great diligence to ſome ſupream Commander; but when he arriv'd ſo near as to diſcern how private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhe had retir'd, a reverend fear ſtops his progreſs, leſt ſo ſudden an Intruſion might diſturb her Paſſions, which now lay at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor in a ſafe Haven of ſerene Thoughts: He ſtays ſo long till her Commands made him enter; on his Knees he preſents her with a Packet from her Royal Father, the Contents of which (if it be poſſible that Love can groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a greater Curſe than Deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration) made her Sufferings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more intollerable than the pencil of Fear could repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them: the Stile was ſuch, as that it did not altogether com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:105567:29"/>
nor intreat, but only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his Royal Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and the paternal Affection he bore to the ſafety of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which could no otherwiſe be confirm'd but in an affinity with the Prince of <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> the ſplendour of whoſe Name ſtood exalted on the higheſt pyramid of Honour: the neighbour Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries have bow'd their ſervile Necks beneath his Sword, and now humbly offers both it and them at her Royal Feet; but too late did that ſecond <hi>Mars</hi> bend his Forces to ſtorm that fair Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Citadell,</hi> which ſhe deſign'd to ſurrender to a more lovely and powerful Commander.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:105567:30"/>Long her confus'd thoughts hover'd between fear and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; her denial to her Royal Father muſt of Neceſſity incur his Diſpleaſure; but to run coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Current of her own Love, would inevitably plunge her in the Ocean of Miſery, and make her commence her Hell here by depriving her of her Heaven, her lov'd <hi>Horatio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of all the Lords of the Court, <hi>Horatio</hi> was by the King thought the beſt and fitteſt to go this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy to the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Lacedaemon</hi>: You cannot imagine with what Reluctancy and Grief the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py <hi>Horatio</hi> receiv'd his Order; but yet he reſolv'd neither to prove diſloyal to his <hi>Prince,</hi> nor
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:105567:30"/>
a delinquent to his Love; he ſtrove what in him lay to defer the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Intentions; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending himſelf unworthy of the Honour he was pleas'd to confer on him, when many of a much higher Rank were diſregarded. But this did not in the leaſt divert the Intentions of his Royal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; he thought him too worthy to beſtow it on any other, and that the Words he had ſpoken were only the effects of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty.</p>
            <p>But Love, Almighty-Love, made him thus ſtruggle with his Duty: now he muſt go, and be expos'd to the Hazards of the Ocean, and at laſt ſollicite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be made miſerable him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:105567:31"/>But when the ſweet <hi>Eromena</hi> knew this, that the only perſon ſhe ador'd and lov'd was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be her unhappy Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitor, and that no means ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable could hinder or prevent it, ſhe retir'd into the ſecret'ſt Arbour of the Garden, near which the perplexed <hi>Horatio</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated a little before to give ſome Vent to his Paſſions, and paſs an hour away in condoling his Misfortunes, and the miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Honour conferred upon him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Princeſs</hi> came too for the ſame Intent; and having ſeated her ſelf in a very melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly poſture, began to recollect what fatal Conſequence and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects might attend their Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:105567:31"/>She was ever Miſtreſs and Empreſs of her Paſſions till this Hour: never before now did ſhe give Love the Reins, and vent her ſorrowful Paſſions in ſuch la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable Tones: 'tis impoſſible to expreſs what Raptures ſhe breathed forth, how her very Soul went out with her Words, and were both drown'd in their own Tears. <hi>Ah, Cruel Father!</hi> (ſaid the languiſhing <hi>Princeſs) thus to rob me of the only Object of my Pleaſure and Delight. My only Heaven upon Earth is in the Sight and Enjoyment of my dear</hi> Horatio; <hi>and my future Heaven would not be Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven entire without him too. O Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures! Oh majeſtick Royalty! fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel, ſince he must go without whom all
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:105567:32"/>
the Pleaſures and Pomps of Courts are dull and inſipid. I ever before ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Love but the blind Deity of a vulgar Error; but I find now, That the Voice of Mankind is the Voice of Heaven. No,</hi> Lacedaemonian! <hi>wert thou the Emperour, nay, God of the Univerſe, that had'st more Charms than Subjects, thou would'st never be capable in the least to vie with my poor lov'd</hi> Horatio. <hi>'Tis true, he is a Prince born high, fitted for Greatneſs, and created for Command; a Soul, as great as ever y<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Horatio</hi> (who had before ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſconded himſelf in an adjoyning
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:105567:32"/>
Arbor) with aſtoniſhment heard the paſſionate diſcoveries of the languiſhing <hi>Princeſs.</hi> She never diſcover'd her Amour to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but only in ſpeaking Sighs, and the pleaſing Rhetorick of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Looks: but now he heard the ſurprizing Story from her own Lips, a ſudden ſtartling Joy preſently ſeiz'd him, but 'twas ſoon converted into a more ſtartling Grief, becauſe he was ſo ſoon to leave her: <hi>No, My</hi>

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:105567:33"/>
of Words the tranſported <hi>Horatio</hi> preſently diſcover'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and preſently a ſhower of Bluſhes fell upon her fair Cheeks: <hi>Ah</hi>! Horatio (ſaid ſhe) <hi>what curst Fate has hitherto attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us? What croſs Stars ſhone at our Births, and had ſo ill an Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon both our Lives? I know not what of us is regiſtred in the Book of Fate; but ſure I am, (if my late Dream be true) the Gods have yet ſome greater Happineſs in ſtore for us. Horatio</hi> was as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive as his Place and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition would permit him, to know what it was. She who could deny nothing in honour to one whom ſhe ſo dearly loved, gave a true Relation of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:105567:33"/>
her myſterious Dream. With Wonder he heard ſo ſtrange a Story, and gathered very good <hi>Omens</hi> from its ſtrange Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But ſtill the fatal Worm gnaw'd within 'em both: <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio</hi>'s Departure was the Sting within 'em: he only expected the pleaſure of his Prince when to depart; which not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was brought to his Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by a Meſſenger, to have time of Preparation for three Days; in which ſpace, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd Orders and Diſpatches from his Royal Maſter for the Management of his Affair.</p>
            <p>The time was come, when the mournful <hi>Horatio</hi> took his leave of the King and Court to ſet Sail for <hi>Lacedaemon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:105567:34"/>But above all, the mutual Sighs and paſſionate Expreſſions of the Royal Lovers, were inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible: Rivers of Tears fell from her fair eyes; Grief, ineffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Grief, only permitted her to bid him adiew. Never a ſinful Soul parted from a Body vvith more heavy Pangs and irreſiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reluctancy than theſe tvvo almoſt deſpairing Lovers: all her Time and Thoughts vvere taken up and employ'd in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to Heaven for his ſafe Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val; nor vvas it in the leaſt deaf or frovvard; the Rhetorick of her prevailing Oratory caus'd the kind Gods to convey him to his deſir'd Port in tvvo days. He
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:105567:34"/>
vvas very nobly and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently conducted by the choice of all the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Nobility to the Princes Palace, vvhere vvhen he came, he found all the Court in a profound melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly: a Cloud of Grief had dravvn its fable Aſpect over all their Faces. He vvonder'd at firſt vvhat it meant, but vvas ſoon acquainted by the Prince's Miniſters, that their Royal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter lay very ſick of a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Diſeaſe, and that there vvas very little Room left for of his Recovery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>HORATIO</hi> immediately thought of the Royal Princeſs's Dream, and began impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to reflect on its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:105567:35"/>
when a Meſſenger the next Morning came to his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and acquainted him of the Death of the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Prince: <hi>Horatio</hi> preſently prepar'd to condole the loſs of the Court in the Death of their Maſter: here the Fates prov'd very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious to his Love; now he was aſſur'd that the Dream was more than humane, and not the vain <hi>Chimaera</hi>'s of a troubled Fancy: he ſaw now, <hi>That even Dreams likewiſe are from above,</hi> and that Fate intended ſome extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Revolution to make him happy by the Death of his too potent and formidable Rival.</p>
            <p>Preſently he diſpatches away Letters to the King his Maſter,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:105567:35"/>
to give him advice of the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his Embaſſy by the Prince's Death. This News was very ſurprizing to the King, who immediately thereupon diſpatcht Orders for his coming home. This likewiſe was ſoon known to the Royal Princeſs, who was now altogether ſo much tranſported with Joy, as ſhe was before with grief. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry minute with Impatience ſhe expected her wiſh'd <hi>Horatio</hi>: all her Thoughts ran on him; his <hi>Idea</hi> was always in her Fancy, as the only Object ſhe ador'd and lov'd. He on the other ſide was no leſs raviſhed with the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Remembrance of his former Misfortunes, and the eager ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:105567:36"/>
of the Society<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Converſe of his Soul's Darling, the admir'd <hi>Eromena.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No ſooner had he received his Orders, but impatient of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, he ſummons all his Retinue on Board, and vvith proſperous Sails in fevv days arriv'd at his vviſht for Haven. Novv Love once more reſum'd it's proper Seat and Throne: all the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his Soul were now em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in its ſublime Myſteries: nothing but the lov'd Society of his dear <hi>Eromena</hi> could content him; which he did not long ſecurely enjoy, before ſome, too maliciouſly inquiſitive into their Amours, envy'd their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and diſcover'd the whole
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:105567:36"/>
Intrigue, and repreſented it too obſcure and odious in the eyes of the King: at firſt he ſeem'd ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry averſe to every of the leaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of it; but then recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting of what a noble and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique Extraction <hi>Horatio</hi> was, and how much he had deſerv'd for his ſignal Services, began to be more calm and ſerene.</p>
            <p>Now the brave <hi>Horatio</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a greater Favourite than ever, though the Princeſs for a while diſſembled her Paſſion from the eyes of the Court; yet the King, to make him the more illuſtrious, ſtill careſs'd him with new Favours, and honour'd him with freſh Titles and new bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Glories. All the eyes of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:105567:37"/>
the Court were now ſet on him; they all knew his Worth, but wonder'd from what Source this Stream and Deluge of Honours might flow: they thought that this ſudden Exaltation on the Wheel of Fortune was only to give him the greater Fall, and render his Ruine the more plain and obvious. They little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd that the Gods ſell nothing to Men but only for Labour and Deſert: and how great the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of <hi>Horatio</hi> were, his Royal Maſter ſufficiently knew, and that all the Honours he could confer on him would not be in the leaſt anſwerable, unleſs the ineſtimable Gift of his Royal Daughter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:105567:37"/>One day ſeeing her all alone, and penſive, he thus accoſts her; <hi>My dear</hi> Eromena, <hi>I have often wondred that in the midst of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, ſo fully fraught with Delights, and ſo great a Croud of Pleaſures, (where you are as much Miſtreſs as I Maſter) you ſhould ſo far abandon your Royal ſelf, as wholly to be given up to Grief and Cares.
