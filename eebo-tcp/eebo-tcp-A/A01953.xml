            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Syracusans</hi> v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed such varietie of dishes in theyr ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, that when they were sette, and their boordes furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, they were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times in doubt, which they shoulde touch first, or taste last. And in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion the worlde giueth euery writer so large a fielde to walke in, that before he setpenne to the booke, he shall find him selfe feasted at <hi>Syracusa,</hi> vncertaine where to begin, or when to end. This caused <hi>Pindarus</hi> too question with his Muse, whether he were better with his art to discifer the life of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Nimpe <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> or <hi>Cadmus</hi> encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ter with the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> or the warres of <hi>Hercules,</hi> at the walles of <hi>Thebes,</hi> or <hi>Bacchus</hi> cuppes, or <hi>Venus</hi> iugling. Hee sawe so many
<pb facs="tcp:3498:2"/>
turninges layde open to his feete, that hee knewe not which way to bende his pace.</p>
            <p>Therfore as I cannot but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mende his wisedome, whiche in banqueting feedes most vpon that, that doth nourish best; so must I disprayse his methode in writing, which following the course of amarous Poets, dwelleth longest in those pointes, that profite least; and like a wanton whelpe, leaueth the game, to runne riot. The <hi>Scarabe</hi> flies euer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a sweete flower, &amp; lightes in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shard: It is the custome of the flye to leaue the sound places of the Horse, and suck at the Botch: The nature of <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquintida,</hi> to draw the worst humours too itselfe: The maner of swine, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the fayre fieldes, and wallow in the myre: And the whole practise of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, eyther with fables to shew theyr a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses, or with plaine tearmes to vnfold theyr mischiefe, discouer theyr shame, discredit them selues, and disperse their poyson thorugh all the worlde. <hi>Virgill</hi> sweates in describyng his Gnat: <hi>Ouid</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:3498:2"/>
hestirreth him to paintout his Flea: the one shewes his art in the lust of <hi>Dido,</hi> the other his cunning in the inceste of <hi>Myrrha,</hi> and that trumpet of Baudrie, the Craft of loue.</p>
            <p>I must confesse that Poets are the whetstones of wit, notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ding that wit is dearly bonght: where hony and gall are mixed, it will be hard to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the one from the other. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull Phisition giueth sweete Syr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropes to make his poyson goe downe the smoother: The Juggler casteth a myst to worke the closer: The <hi>Syrens</hi> song is the Saylers wrack: The Fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers whistle, the birdes death: The wholesome bayte, the fishes bane: The Harpies haue Uirgins faces, and vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Talentes: <hi>Hyena</hi> speakes like a friend, &amp; deuoures like a Foe: The cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest Seas hide dangerous Rockes: the Woolfiettes in Weathers felles: Many good sentences are spoken by <hi>Dauus,</hi> to shadowe his knauery: and written by Poets, as ornamentes to beautifye their woorkes, and fette

            <p>But if you looke well too <hi>Epaeus</hi> horse, you shall finde in his bowels the destruction of <hi>Troy:</hi> open the sepulchre of <hi>Semyramis,</hi> whose Title promiseth suche wealth to the Kinges of <hi>Persia,</hi> you shall see nothing but deade bones: Rippe vp the golden Ball, that <hi>Nero</hi> consecrated to <hi>Iupiter Capitollinus,</hi> you shall haue it stuffed with the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinges of his Beard: pul off the visard that Poets maske in, you shall disclose their reproch, bewray their vanitie, loth their wantonnesse, lament their follie, and perceiue their sharpe sayings to be placed as Pearles in Dunghils, fresh pictures on rotten walles, chaste Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons apparel on common Curtesans. These are the Cuppes of <hi>Circes,</hi> that turne reasonable Creatures into brute Beastes; the balles of <hi>Hippomenes,</hi> that hinder the course of <hi>Atalanta;</hi> and the blocks of the Diuel that are cast in our wayes, to cut off the rase of toward wittes. No marueyle though <hi>Plato</hi>

shut them out of his Schoole, and banished them quite from his common wealth, as effeminate writers, vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table members, and vtter enimies to vertue.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> were verie desirous to imitate the <hi>Greekes,</hi> and pet verie loth to receiue their Poets: insomuch that <hi>Cato</hi> layth it in the dishe of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> the noble as a foule reproche, that in the time of his Consulshippe, hee brought <hi>Ennius</hi> the Poet into his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince. <hi>Tullie</hi> accustomed to read them with great diligence in his youth, but when hee waxed grauer in studie, elder in yeares, riper in iudgement, hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>pted<note place="margin">Tusc 1. 2.</note> them the fathers of lyes, Pipes of vanitie, &amp; Schooles of Abuse. <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imus Tyrius</hi> taketh vppon him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the discipline of these Doctors vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>Homer,</hi> wresting the rashnes of <hi>Aiax,</hi> to valour; the cowardice of <hi>Vlisses,</hi> to Policie; the dotage of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor,</hi> to graue counsell; and the battaile of <hi>Troy,</hi> too the woonderfull conflict of the foure Elementes: where <hi>Iuno</hi>

It is a Pageant woorth the sight, to beholde how he labors w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Mountaines to bring foorth Mise; much like to some of those Players, that come to the scaffold with Drum &amp; Trumpet to profer skirmishe,<note place="margin">A desperate conflict.</note> and when they haue sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ded Allarme, off go the peeces to encounter a shadow, or conquere a Paper monster.

            <p>It should seeme that the abuse of such places was so great, that for any chaste liuer to haunt them was a black swan, &amp; a white crowe. <hi>Dion</hi> so straightly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth the ancient families of Rome &amp; gentlewomen that tender their name &amp; honor, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>e to Theaters, &amp; rebuks the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> so sharply, when he takes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> napping, that if they be but once seene there, hee iudgeth it sufficient cause to speake il of them &amp; thinke worse.

the ende beeing right, which once throughly tryed out, at handye stroakes, neither hee that offered iniurie shoulde haue his will, nor hee that was threatened, take any hurte, but bothe be contented and shake handes. Those dayes are now chaunged, the skil of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians, is exercysed in caueling, the cunning of Fencers applied to quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: they, thinke themselues no Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, if they bee not able to finde out a knotte in euery rushe; these, no men, if for stirring of a strawe, they prooue not their valure vppon some bodyes fleshe.

            <p>PERICLES was woont (Right ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipful) as oft as he put on his robes, to preach thus vnto himselfe: Consider wel <hi>Pericles,</hi> what thou doest, thou commaundest free men, the Greekes obey thee, &amp; thou gouernest the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of Athens. If you say not so much to your selues, the gownes that you weare, as the cognisances of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie; and the sword which is cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before you, as the instrument of iustice; are of sufficient force to pur you in mind, that you are the masters of free men, that you gouerne the worshipfull Citizens of London, and that you are the very Stewards of her

Maiestie within your liberties. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sith by mine owne experience I haue erected a Schoole of those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses, which I haue seene in <hi>London,</hi> I presume the more vpon your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, at the ende of my Phamphlet to present a fewe lynes to your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable reading.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Augustus</hi> the good Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> was neuer angry with accusers because hee thought it necessarye (where many abuses flourish) for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man freely to speake his minde. And I hope that <hi>Augustus</hi> (I meane such as are in authoritie) will beare with me, because I touch that which is needefull to bee shewen. Wherein I goe not about to instruct you howe to rule, but to warne you what dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger hangs ouer your heads, that you may auoyde it.</p>
            <p>The Byrde <hi>Trochilus</hi> with crashing of her bil awakes the <hi>Crocodile,</hi> and deliuereth her from her enemyes, that are readye too charge her in deadesleepe. A little fishe swimmeth

continnally before the great Whale, to shewe him the shelues, that he run not a ground: The Elephants, when any of their kinde are fallen into the pittes, that are made to catch them, thrust in stones and earth to recouer them: When the Lyon is caught in a trap, <hi>Aesops</hi> Mouse by nibling the cordes sets him at libertie. It shall be inough forme with <hi>Trochilus</hi> to haue wagged my bil; with the little Fish to haue gone before you; with the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants to haue shewed you the way to helpe your selfe; and with <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sops</hi> mouse to haue fretted the snares with a byting tooth for your owne safetie.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Thracians</hi> when they must passe ouer frosen streames, sende out theyr Wolues, whiche laying their cares to the yse, listen for noyse: If they hear any thing, they gather that it mooues; if it mooue, it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed; If it be not congealed, it must be liquide; If it be liquide, then will it yeelde; and if it yeelde, it is not

good trusting it with the weight of their bodyes, leste they sincke. The worlde is so slippery, that you are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten inforced to passe ouer Yse. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I humbly beseech you to try far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; trust lesse; not your Woolues, but many of your Citizens haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>read sifted the daunger of your pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, and in sifting beene swallowed to their discredite.</p>
            <p>I would the abuses of my Schoole were as wel knowen of you, to refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: as they are fouud out by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to their owne peril. But the fishe <hi>Sepia</hi> can trouble the water to shun the nettes, that are shot to catch her: <hi>Torpedo</hi> hath craft inough at the first touch to inchant the hooke, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the line, to bewitch the rod, and too benumme the handes of him that angleth. Whether our Players be the Spawnes of such fishes, I know not wel, yet I am sure that how many nets soeuer ther be layde to take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, or hookes to choke them, they haue Ynke in their bowels to darken the

water; and sleights in their budgets, to dry vp the arme of euery Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate. If their letters of commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were once stayed, it were easie for you to ouerthrowe them. <hi>Agesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> was greatly rebuked, because in matters of iustice, he inclined to his friends and became partiall. <hi>Plutarch</hi> condemneth this kinde of writinge, <hi>Niciam, si nihil admisit noxae; exime; Si quid admisit; mihi exime; omnino autem hominem noxae exime.</hi> If <hi>Nicias</hi> haue not offended, meddle not with him: If hee be guiltie, forgiue him for my sake, What soeuer you doe, I charge you acquite him. This inforceth Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates like euill Poets to break the feete of their verse, and singe out of tune, and with vnskilful Carpenters, to vse the Square and the compasse, the Rule and the Quadrant, not to builde, but to ouerthrow.</p>

            <head>To the Gentlewomen Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of London, Flourishing dayes with regarde of Credite.</head>
            <p>THE reuerence that I owe you Gentlewomen, because you are Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens; &amp; the pitie wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I tender your case, because you are weake; hath thrust out my ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d, at the breaking vp of my Schoole, to write a few lines to your sweete selues. Not that I thinke you to bee rebuked, as idle huswiues, but commended and incouraged as vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Dames. The freest horse, at the wh: ske of a wand, girdes forwarde: The swiftest Hound, when he is hallowed, strippes forth: The kindest Mastife, when he is clapped on the back, fighteth best: The stoutest Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, when the Trumpet sounds, strikes fier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest: The gallantest Runner, when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple showte, getteth grounde: and the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctest liuers, when they are praysed, winne greatest credite.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3498:41"/>I haue seene many of you whiche were wont to sporte your selues at Theaters, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> you perceiued the abuse of those places, schoole your selues, &amp; of your owne accorde abhorre Playes. And sith you haue begun to withdrawe your steppes, continew so stil, if you be chary of your good name. For this is generall, that they which shew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>selues openly, desire to bee seene. It is not a softe shooe that healeth the Gowte; nor a golden Ring that driueth away the Crampe; nor a crown of Pearle that cureth the Meigrim; nor your sober countenance, that defendeth your credite; nor your friends which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany your person, that excuse your folly; nor your modestie at home, that couereth your lightnesse, if you present your selues in open Theaters. Thought is free: you can forbidd no man, that vieweth you, to noate you, and that noateth you, to iudge you, for entring to places of suspition. Wilde Coltes; when they see their kinde begin to bray; &amp; lusty bloods at the showe of faire women, giue a wanton sigh, or a wicked wishe. Blasing markes are most shot at, glistring faces cheefly marked; and what followeth? Looking eyes, haue ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb facs="tcp:3498:42"/>
hartes, liking harts may burne in lust. We walke in the Sun many times for pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, but our faces are ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ned before we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne: though you go to theaters to se sport, <hi>Cupid</hi> may catche you ere you departe. The litle God houereth aboute you, &amp; fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth you with his wings to kindle fire: when you are set as fixed whites, Desire draweth his arrow to the head, &amp; sticketh it vppe to the fethers, and Fancy bestirreth him too shed his poyson through euery vaine. If you doe but listen to the voyce of the Fouler, or ioyne lookes with an amorous Gazer, you haue already made your selues assaultable, &amp; yelded your Cities to be sacked. A wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton eye is the darte of <hi>Cephalus,</hi> where it leueleth, thereit lighteth; &amp; where it hitts, it woundeth deepe. If you giue but a glance to your beholders, you haue vayled the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net in token of obedience: for the boulte is falne ere the Ayre clap; the Bullet paste, ere the Peece crack; the colde taken, ere the body shiuer; and the match made, ere you strike handes.</p>
            <p>To auoyd this discommoditie, <hi>Cyrus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to looke vppon Panthea, And <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3498:42"/>
the great on <hi>Darius</hi> wife. The sicke man that relesheth nothing, when hee seeth some about him feede apace, and commend the taste of those dishes which hee refused, blames not the meate, but his owne disease: And I feare you will say, that it is no ripe iudgement, but a rawe humor in my selfe, which makes me condemne the resorting to Playes; because there come many thyther, which in your opinion sucke no poyson, but feede hartely without hurt; therefore I doe very ill to reiect that which other like, and complaine still of mine owne maladie.</p>
            <p>In deede I must confesse there comes to Playes of all sortes, old and young; it is hard to say that all offend, yet I promise you, I wil sweare for none. For the driest flax flameth soonest; &amp; the greenest wood smoketh most; gray heads haue greene thoughts; and young slippes are olde twigges. Beware of those places, which in sorrowe cheere you, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile you in mirth. You must not cut your bodyes to your garmentes, but make your gownes fit to the proportion of your bodyes; nor fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> your selues, to open spectacles, but tye all your sportes to the good disposition of
<pb facs="tcp:3498:43"/>
a vertuous minde. At Diceplay, euery one wisheth to caste well; at Bowles euery one craues to kisse the maister; at running eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one starteth to win the goale; At shoting euery one striues to hit the marke; and will not you in all your pastimes and recreations seeke that which shall yeelde you most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite &amp; greatest credite? I wil not say you are made to toile, &amp; I dare not graunt that you should be idle. But if there be peace in your houses, and plentie in your Coafers, let the good precept of <hi>Xenopho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
               </hi> be your exercise: in all your ease and prosperitie, remember God, that he may be mindeful of you, when your heartes grone, and succour you still in the time of neede. Be euer busied in godly meditations: seek not to passe ouer the gulf with a tottering plank that wil deceiue you. When we cast off our best clothes, we put on ragges; when our good desires are once laide aside, wantonwil begins to prick. Being pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue at home, if you go to Theaters to driue avvay fancies, it is as good Physike, as for the ache of your head too knocke out your brains; or when you are stung with a Wasp, to rub the sore with a Nettle. When you
<pb facs="tcp:3498:43"/>
are greeued, passe the time with your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boures in sober conference, or if you can read, let Bookes bee your comforte. Doe not imitate those foolishe Patientes, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing sought all meanes of recouery, and are neuer the neere, run vnto Witchcrafte. If your greefe be such, that you may not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close it, and your sorrowe so great, that you loth to vtter it, looke for no salue at Playes ortheaters, lest that labouring to shun <hi>Sylla</hi> you light on <hi>Charybdis;</hi> to for sake the depe you perish in sands; to warde a light stripe, you take a deaths wound; and to leaue Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, you flee to inchaunting. You neede not goe abroade to be tempted, you shall be inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed at your owne windowes. The best coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel that I can giue you, is to keepe home, &amp; shun all occasion of ill speech. The virgins of Vest a were shut vp fast in stone walles to the same ende. You must keepe your sweete faces from scorching in the sun, chapping in the winde, and warping with the weather, which is best perfourmed by staying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
