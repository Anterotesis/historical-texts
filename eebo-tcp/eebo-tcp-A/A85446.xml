            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>Concerning Religion.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>FIrſt, if the Phyſitians and Attendants muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſt out the Patient whenſoever any hazard of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is poſſible, all diſeaſes are diſperate: But the unitive</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:125422:3"/>
                  <hi>principles of Chriſtianity teach us, that ſeparations of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, are then onely Lawfull when neceſſary, and then onely neceſſary when the malignity of the poyſon is greater then the vertue of the Antidote, or obligation of duty. Here two things then ought to be weighed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, whether it be more probable as things now ſtand, that the Iriſh Papiſts ſhould pervert the Engliſh Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, or that the Engliſh Proteſtants ſhould convert the Iriſh Papiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, whether the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Proteſtants be more obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by any ſpecial duty to continue many of the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts (though the probability of infection were greater) than by that general fear and probable hazard to remove them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The conſequent of the firſt diſjunction ſeems moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable on theſe grounds.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Natural Conſcience makes all perſons, who ſtand in awe of a Diety, preferre ſome Religious Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Obſervations before none; When therefore no tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is given to the exerciſe of Popery, and the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion publiquely profeſſed throughout the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is very conceivable that Natural Conſcience may perſwade many Papiſts (at leaſt) externaly to frequent the Proteſtant Aſſemblies; and many have been woon in the Ordinances, who by external Motives were firſt induc'd to them; But what Temptations in ſuch an Inſtance may invite Proteſtants to turn Papiſts, is not conceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By the Cruelty of the Papiſts in the late Rebellion, the Proteſtants are more confirmed againſt Popery (as the Original of thoſe Cruelties) and by thoſe heavy Judgments wherewith God hath avenged the blood of his Servants; The Papiſts themſelves made leſs in love with that Profeſſion which lead them on to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:125422:3"/>
thoſe cruelties, and thereby provoked theſe judgments; in this inſtance therefore it is much more probable, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts ſhould be converted than Proteſtants perverted.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when God intwiſts his intereſſe with man's, man is commonly ſo inamoured with his own, that in ſuch a caſe he is not apt to leave God's; and ſuch is the preſent caſe in <hi>Ireland,</hi> it is not even for the civill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſs of Proteſtants to turn Papiſts, it is for the Papiſts to turn Proteſtants.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in time of peace, when the higheſt externall inducements, ran on the Papiſts ſide yet many Iriſh were reduced to Proteſtaniſm, for every one Engliſh ſeduced to Papiſm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Objection, </hi>Againſt this ſome may perhaps pretend,<hi> That the Papiſts in </hi>Ireland<hi> are hardened in their Idolatry, and few of them converted of late.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Firſt, that it is not ſtrange if onely few of them be converted, yea it is even wonderfull that any of them ſhould of late be converted conſidering,</p>
               <p>Firſt, the heavy preſſures under which they have groaned to the very grinding of them, by which means more families have been deſtroyed under the protection of Proteſtants, then in oppoſition againſt them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the many diviſions among thoſe who are called Proteſtants, and bitterneſſes of thoſe who are thus divided, becauſe by the former the Papiſt ſees not where to fix if he ſhould come to us, and becauſe of the later he ſees not what friends or ſecurity he could partake if the ſhould fix.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the intire neglect of ſending forth inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to inſtruct them; it is ſad obſerve how Garriſons are placed in every quarter where the Iriſh inhabite, Miniſters in none; as if our buſineſs in <hi>Ireland</hi> was onely to ſet up our own intereſs, and not Chriſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:125422:4"/>Fourthly, the lamentable ignorance of moſt and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous haereſies of ſome, who have been employed and allowed publick maintenance, in Proteſtant congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, under the notion of Preachers.</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſo that if the Iriſh Papiſts be hardened, we muſt blame our ſelves for it. 'Tis certain that in theſe few places, where Miniſters make it their work, to deal with them and to remove thoſe groſs ſcandals out of the way, they find them, more pliant and flexible to ſubmit to ſcripture directions, then ſome of thoſe who complain of their hardneſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, who art thou who complaines of their hardneſs? didſt thou ever pray for their ſoftning? if no, mourn for thy own hardneſs, if yea, labour for what thou haſt prayed, and preſume not to caſt the duſt off thy feet till thou haſt thus laboured. Many fearing God, and ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſpiritual advantage of thoſe poor natives, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that the Lord's harveſt in <hi>Ireland</hi> is farr more then the Labourers.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the blade appears not above ground, aſſoon as the ſeed is ſown; ſupernaturall habits are infuſed after the manner of acquired; after good husbandry hath been uſed, ſtand ſtill awhile, and ſee what increaſe the Lord will give; nay what he has given; Many of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire now, earneſtly, to put their Children into the Care of the Engliſh of qualitie adjoyning to them; offer largely to their maintenance in the Education of the Religion and manners of England; I ſhall not ſearch mens hearts to cenſure, the doing this for ſiniſter ends; who knows but God may have ſoftned and convinc'd them by his rod; But this is certain, The means is good (though their ends are bad) and God may bring a good end out of that too; The ſon may be ſincere, though he father be a hypocrite, and what his earthly father in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:125422:4"/>
onely for the ſaving his eſtate, his heavenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may advance to the ſaving of his ſoul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Objection. But ſome may be employed to inſtruct them as well in </hi>Connaught,<hi> if they ſhould be tranſplanted thither, as if they be not tranſplanted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Firſt, thoſe that ſhall be employed, muſt be either ſuch as are already in the other parts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or out of <hi>England:</hi> If the firſt, they muſt be either Miniſters, or Gifted men; For the Miniſters, they are ſo few, that they ſuffice not the places inhabited already; And for the gifted men, although they (might poſſibly be ſpared hither without any conſiderable loſs in them, and to convert heathens (as they count the Iriſh) were a fitter work for new Apoſtles (as they count them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) then to pervert Chriſtians, yet 'tis probable they may be as unwilling to preach, where there is need of them, as they have been forward to intrude themſelves, where there was no need of them; But alas, they muſt firſt ſtay at home, and be ſome years catechiz'd before they go, that ſo they may be learners before they ſhall be teachers, Rayling at Miniſters; Ordinances, and all the reformed Churches obſervations will perſwade the Papiſts, they are men of their own Religion, not that will turn them from it; And other Divinity theſe know not; and for Godly learned Miniſters to be brought out of England, to go among the Iriſh, will ſure be a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult work, when we find it ſo hard to invite any to come among the Engliſh.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the company of profeſſors is a powerfull engagement to profeſſion, the ſetting of brands together, and ſome already kindled to theſe unkindled, is the way to get heat, when the ſpirit of the Lord is pleaſed to blow them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, mans ſoul is like a narrow mouth'd bottle, the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:125422:5"/>
to fill it, is not to pour buckets of water over it, but to take it ſingly, and pour in the water gently by little and little; publick preaching may be compared to the former, but private catechizing and family duties to the later.</p>
               <p>If then theſe Papiſts be ſuffered to continue in the Engliſh plantations, they may enjoy the labours of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly able Miniſters, the encouragments of Proteſtant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, and the Catechizings of private Chriſtians, all which are powerfull morall inſtruments to converſion; but if they be tranſplanted, as their conſociation may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably ſettle them on their old lees, ſo their ſeparation certainly deprives them of theſe advantages; And by a perſiſtance in their former Principles, continue them Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts ſtill, or by a forgetting them (if poſſible) and no better diſtil'd into them, make them turn Atheiſts.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Let us conſider whether there be not ſome ſpeciall obligations which in conſcience and religious duty more binds us to continue theſe poor Natives (though Papiſts) with us, then that general fear and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible hazard of infection binds to tranſplant them (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince theſe have been ſhewn to be but Panick.)</p>
               <p>It is a clear Maxim in Chriſtian Religion, that we muſt not commit a leſs ſin, though it were to avoyd a greater; in evils of ſuffering the leſs is eligible, in evils of ſin none is aligible; if then this Act of tranſplantation be ſinfull and contrary to theſe obligations which lie on us, the avoydance of future infection will not acquitus, it will not free us from the guilt of murther, to kill our ſelves, leſt another ſhould kill us. Conſider then, That many of thoſe who are thus puniſhed with the guilty, are guiltleſs at man's Tribunall, which onely judgeth of outward expreſſes, the heart and intention thereof being peculiarly ſubjected to the judgment of God who onely
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:125422:5"/>
can only ſearch it; many are ſuch as not only did not act againſt the Engliſh in the Iriſh Rebellion, but did eminently act with them, and for them; and were inſtrumental, not only in the ſerving of ſome privat perſons (which might be the reſult of particular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection) but alſo of ſecuring ſome, &amp; reducing other publique places of ſtrength to the power not onely of the Engliſh Nation, but of the Parliament; and ſhall theſe Innocents be puniſhed with the Guilty? the Lord would not deal ſo with <hi>Sodome.</hi> Heathens did uſe to remark with great Rewards, thoſe who in common Cauſes abſtained from common defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; they that forgot the Bonds of Relation, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Nation, in the day of our Weakneſs, ſhould not be forgotten in the day of our Powr's. Is it an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Crime to act with and againſt the Engliſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Why then is there an equal puniſhment?</p>
               <p>Objection.<hi> The avenging of blood is of ſtricteſt obligation, and the Iriſh in the late Rebellion having contracted a national bloud-guilt, no eye muſt pittie them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Firſt, if by Nation be meant the greateſt part, the aſſertion is true; but if it be every individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, then it was ſhewn before, that there was a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in acting, and therefore ſhould be ſo in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Nationall guilt is expiated by nationall judgements; the wickedneſs and bloud-guiltineſs of <hi>Benjamin</hi> did not neceſſitate an univerſall deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but 25000. being ſlain, wayes are ſtudied to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the remainder.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, particular bloud-guilt of private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, is expreſsly excepted from pardon by that act
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:125422:6"/>
of Settlement, which vouchſafes pardon to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and as it is unjuſt that thoſe who are pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhould ſuffer for the guilt of thoſe who are not: ſo it is unneceſſary that puniſhment ſhould be infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in common, when triall of the guilt and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the guilty may be ſingle.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if all murther be unpardonable, and this whole nation be in that degree, guilty of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as renders them unpardonable, then no puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inferiour to death is proportionate unto their guilt; to which it is conſequent, that the tranſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them into <hi>Connaught</hi> is unjuſt, as in the defect being leſs then that guilt or obligation to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo in the exceſs removing them from the Engliſh, by whoſe evidence alone the Courts of Juſtice can proceed to their triall; and therefore tends more to their pardon then puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, that even murther is in ſome caſes pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, appears by the practiſe of all States &amp; Armies. <hi>David</hi> did not unjuſtly to pardon <hi>Abner,</hi> who yet made it a ſport to ſhed bloud; and by the nature of the thing it ſelf, for every unlawfull breach upon man's life is murther, and every Abettor of that breach is guilty of the ſame murther: ſince then war may be unlawfull on both ſides, but is not ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily on both ſides lawfull, either the war muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue whileſt one man therein ingaged ſurviues, or the guilt of murther is in ſome caſes pardonable.</p>
               <p>And if in any caſes, then certainly in theſe two.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when the guilt was for moſt part contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, either through ignorance or infirmitie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when the pardon directly leads to publick good, and the ſparing of a few to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:125422:6"/>
of many; The former ingredients make the guilt leſs evill, the later ingredients make the pardon more good. And in the preſent inſtance both theſe concur.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Iriſh nation were generally ingaged in the Rebellion, either through ignorance of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and apprehending they acted by the King's commiſſion, and for his and God's ſervice; or through infirmitie, partly fearing their Prieſts threats, partly their Land-Lords frownes, partly the violences of others, of the Engliſh who at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning reckoned an Iriſh man and a Rebell tanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount, and on that ſcore forced many into war, (who deſired peace) with the Iriſh in armes, who accounted and declared all Enemies, that joyned not (at leaſt ſeemingly) with them, and proceeded with more ſeverity againſt diſſenting natives than Engliſh.</p>
               <p>On the cleering of this objection from juſtice, hangs indeed the whole weight of the controverſie; And therefore the doing it ſolidly, can be of no mean concernment; the way will be, by Conſidering of the Reſolution, that the law gives to two or three queſtions, and the application of them to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent affaire.</p>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:125422:7"/>
enjoyned for the evil of doing. The ends thereof are commonly miſtaken, men making puniſhment the end of puniſhment, &amp; the gratyifing either the Law it ſelf (which is without ſence of the ſatisfaction) or God (who delights not in ſuffering, as ſuch) or the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty injured (the ſcratching of whoſe itch, in the way of revenge, barely, is utterly unlawfull) the truth is, an injury done is unrepealable, and neither God, nor the law of Reaſon delights in accumulation of ſuffering, or are pleaſed with pain (barely as it is paine) Reaſon dictates, man muſt do nothing to hurt another man, unleſs it have ſome good end, and in the paine of the Enemy alone ſo nakedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, there is no good but falſe and imaginary; Therefore were it not for whats to come, the Law would never puniſh (though the greateſt crime, for whats paſt, for thats irreverſible; Therefore the ſayings of the wiſe men are, we muſt come to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, not as it were ſweet, but profitable; ſome things are honeſt ſimply, ſome upon neceſſity, of which ſort is puniſhment; No wiſe man inflicted a puniſhment becauſe a fault is done, but that it may be done no more, for juſtice is not Anger but Caution; to deviſe how one may bite him that bites us, is the part of a beaſt; from whence (it follows) although you do no injury, though you puniſh an offence, yet you likewiſe do no injury, if you do not puniſh (unleſs in connexion with the ends) contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the vulgar, who are as inexorable as <hi>Nemeſis,</hi> and thinks him the juſteſt man, that like <hi>Draco,</hi> writes all his Laws in Blood. Now the ends of puniſhment are theſe three. 1. That the Offender may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcued from lapſing into the ſame fault for the future.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:125422:7"/>
2. The Offended from future injuries; And 3. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to all by the penance of few.</p>
               <p>From whence it will follow (to the third head) contrary to the Stoicks judgement, who ſay (that puniſhment is due to the offence, and a wiſe man gives every one his due, and therefore no delinquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſhould ſcape) by better reaſon, there being not alwaies a juncture of thoſe ends with ſuffering, That ſometimes it may be taken off, or relaxed; Before a penal Law will not ſeem ſo ſtrange, but even after a penal Law likewiſe. If the ends for which puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ordained in a moral eſtimation be not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, or if other ends on the oppoſit part occur, not leſs profitable and neceſſary, or if the ends pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the puniſhment may be attain'd any other way.</p>
               <p>Anſwerable to theſe reaſons were their actings: when God gave the Law, he deprived not himſelf of all power, but reſerved a liberty to pardon; none can put any one to death without Law, nor any but the Supream pardon them, ſayes another; and this mercy they diſpenc'd on theſe two cautions of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Ignorance, where they found them; for that theſe take off from voluntary, and that from guilt.</p>
               <p>Now if ſtrict Law give thus much ſcope for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, what ought mercy and goodneſs, which ſhould be in all to their like; but eſpecially when Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall Law (goodneſs and mercy) commands this too.</p>
               <p>To apply this firſt particular to the caſe of the Iriſh, it will thus ſtate it, as was declared before, that though their crimes have been heinous, yet they
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:125422:8"/>
are to be puniſhed onely with reflexction (not on their evill paſt, but the good to come) and then onely if no other way will compaſs this end, but their puniſhment, and then onely in ſuch a degree as they are found capable of the diminutions of puniſhment, Iignorance and Violence; and certainly neither of theſe will be denied, but that as a great part of them acted through ignorance, ſo the force of an Army levied was ſufficient to compell the reſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 The ſecond queſtion is Anſwered thus; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates may contract guilt from the Commons, they viciſſively from their Magiſtrates and heads, or Rulers, &amp; in ſharing in the publick crime, muſt in the puniſhment; But it is to be noted likewiſe, that there are publick puniſhments and private for example (as when a Common-wealth is overthrown, it ſuffers a publick death; reduced to a Province, undergoes ſlavery, a City loſes its Walls, Shipping, Officers, Treaſure, Laws, Enſigns, Magazines; in ſharing theſe each particular may ſuffer; But that particular men for the offence of a Community without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſhould loſe the things that are proper to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves is unjuſt; publick offences brings publick puniſhments particular guilt, particular ſuffering.</p>
               <p>Apply this ſecond to the Iriſh, and let the active ruling part be diſtinguiſhed from the paſſive ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective, and publick puniſhments from particular, and juſtice is done.</p>
               <p>The laſt queſtion is thus ſatisfied; How long a Commonalty ſhall be proſecuted with juſtice; ſhall puniſhment be alwayes exacted while the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity laſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:125422:8"/>No: Thoſe being extinct by whom merit was derived to the Community, the merit it ſelf is alſo extinguiſhed, and puniſhment cannot conſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out merit; You may account it a ſufficient puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that none of the offenders are now alive (ſayes the Civil Law) It is a miſtake in mans dealings (though with God juſt) that becauſe Children re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive honours and rewards for their fathers good deeds, that they ſhould be puniſhed for their evill; Becauſe a benefit may without injury be conferd on any, but ſo cannot a puniſhment.</p>
               <p>This decides the laſt part of the Scruple, touching the Iriſh, for the bloody perſons (known) are all dead by Sword, Famine, Peſtilence, the hand of civill juſtice, or remain ſtill lyable to it, or are fled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond ſea from it; The Prieſts and Souldiers (the kindlers of the war in the beginning, and fomenters of it ſince) are for the firſt univerſally departed the Land, and for the ſecond, to a vaſt number, and the moſt dangerous, &amp; the remaining, are weary of war, having long ſince ſubmitted, and thoſe that are out, ſue for nothing but mercy; for the poor Commons, the Sun never ſhined (or rather not ſhined) upon a Nation ſo compleatly miſerable; There are not one hundred of them in 10000. who are not by the firſt and fourth Articles, of the act of ſettlement under the penalty of loſing life and eſtate; The Tax ſweeps away their whole Subſiſtence; Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie makes them turn Theeves and <hi>Tories,</hi> and then they are proſecuted with fire and ſword for being ſo. If they diſcover not <hi>Tories,</hi> the Engliſh hang them, if they do, the Iriſh kill them, againſt whom they have nothing to defend themſelves, nor any
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:125422:9"/>
other that can; nay if any perſon melted with the bowels of a man, or moved by the Rules of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Equitie, labour to bring home to them that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Mercy which the State allowes, there are ſome ready to aſperſe them as favourers of <hi>Tories,</hi> cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of bloud guiltineſs; and briefly, in a probable computation five parts of ſix of the whole Nation are deſtroyed, and after ſo ſharp an execution, is it not time at length to ſound a retreat? Muſt we ſtill cry juſtice, juſtice? wherefore is juſtice ſo invok't againſt them? was it not for cruelty? God has a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd it; let others take heed how they become guilty, eſpecially they that aveng'd it; The fair vertue of juſtice (overdon) degenerates into the ſtinking weed of Tyranny, Beaſts ſcorn the humble Prey; Heathens having Conquer'd by Juſtice, have conquer'd again by Mercy; The State does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a Cordial for that Conſumptive Nation; it is onely deſired they would be pleaſed to accelerat it, leſt by dying before, they loſe the opportunity of ſhewing they would at laſt have had pitty.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the Pardon of this national Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guilt is ſubſervient to publike good, and in order thereto ought to be extended to all ſuch as are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to no other guilt than what is Common and National, may be evidenced by diverſe arguments; but in regard they conclude in like kind, againſt the tranſplanting of the Iriſh, into <hi>Connaught,</hi> it is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune to proceed to the ſecond inſtituted com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, whether it be more conducive to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good of the Engliſh Nation, and to the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of them intire, to continue the Iriſh or tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant them?

               <head>2. Concerning Publick Good.</head>
               <p>THE publick good of <hi>Ireland</hi> reſpects either the publick Revenue, or the good of the preſent, or of future Engliſh Inhabitants and Planters.</p>
               <p>Firſt, For the publick Revenue. The Revenue or Contribution of <hi>Ireland</hi> is generally raiſed out of Corn, and the Husbandmen of that Corn are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Iriſh, the removal therefore of theſe neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily infers the failer of that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For,</p>
               <p>1. The Iriſh, who raiſe their Contribution out of Corn, live themſelves on the roots and fruits of their Gardens, and on the milk of their Cows, Goats, and Sheep, and by ſelling their Corn to the Engliſh, provide Money for Contribution; if then the Iriſh ſhould be thus tranſplanted, their Corn would not be vendible, not to one another, for all would be Sellers, not to the Engliſh; for to carry it 50, 60, or 100 miles to Engliſh Plantations, would make it ſo dear to the Buyer, and cheap to the Seller, that it cannot reaſonably be thought practicable.</p>
               <p>2. The Lands of <hi>Ireland</hi> are generally ſo unapt for Corn, without much charge in manuring them, and the Harveſt-ſeaſon ſo catching, without many hands to ſave the Corn, that the firſt Crop ſeldome (if ever) makes the Husbandman a Saver: if then the Iriſh be removed from their Lands prepared for Seed, to the waſt and uncultivated Lands of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naught,</hi> the Lands they leave can pay no Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the firſt year, becauſe they will become waſt till others inhabit; and the Lands to which they remove can pay none, becauſe (being waſt) they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:125422:10"/>
muſt ſpend a year of their time, and much of their principal Stock to improve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them, before they can derive any ſutable profit out of them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For the preſent Inhabitants, Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and others.</p>
               <p>1. The Souldiers lately disbanded (eſpecially the private Souldiers) have neither Stock, nor Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to buy Stock, nor (for the moſt part) skill in Husbandry: But by the labours of the Iriſh on their Lands, together with their own induſtry, they may maintain themſelves, improve their Lands, acquire Stock, and by degrees inure themſelves ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably to that courſe of life: But the tranſplantation of the Iriſh leaves theſe poor mens proportions of Land totally waſt; and unleſs they can, like <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chednezzar,</hi> live on Graſs, they muſt periſh, or ſell too too cheap their dear-bought recompence.</p>
               <p>2. The other Inhabitants, by the labours of the Iriſh Tenants or Servants, are enabled to contribute to the publick charge, and maintain themſelves and Families in ſome meaſure: But the tranſplantation of the Iriſh will utterly deprive them of all manner of livelyhood; and as the deſtruction of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh already planted in <hi>Ireland</hi> is a ſad evil in it ſelf, ſo in its conſequence it can be no encouragement to other Engliſh to plant.</p>
               <p>3. Conſiderable numbers of Engliſh Families, (upon the hopes they had of peace and quietneſs) have already ſcattered themſelves into the Country, laid out (what they ſaved thriftily, or got hardly all this long time of languiſhing) to begin a new For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune with) on purchaſing Farms, buying Stock, building Houſes: But now this early hope muſt be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:125422:10"/>
nipt in the bud; for if tranſplanting goes forward, (it will ſo multiply <hi>Tories</hi>) the Engliſh cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly live in the Country, and their Stock cannot poſſibly live in Towns, and their Improvement and Buildings muſt be utterly loſt, and themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally (when they leaſt feared it) undone.</p>
               <p>4. The Army, and all the Inhabitants, derive their Bread, Meat, Drink, all the moſt neceſſary means of living, from the labours of the Iriſh; and if theſe be tranſplanted, then they muſt either fall with their own weight, or purchaſe ſuch ſupports out of <hi>England</hi> at rates too high for their condition, or leave the Land.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, For future Inhabitants, Adventurers, Souldiers, and ſuch others as ſhall engage in the planting of <hi>Ireland.</hi> The firſt and chiefeſt Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to the ſettlement and advancement of a Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are thoſe natural riches of Food, Apparel, and Habitations. If the firſt be regarded, there are few of the Iriſh Commonalty but are skilfull in Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, and more exact than any Engliſh in the Husbandry proper to that Country. If the ſecond, there are few of the Women but are skilfull in dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſing Hemp and Flax, and making of Linnen and Woollen Cloth. If the third, it is believed, to every hundren Men there are five or ſix Maſons and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters at leaſt of that Nation, and theſe more handy and ready in building ordinary Houſes, and much more prudent in ſupplying the defects of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Materials, than Engliſh Artificers. Since then 1000 Acres of Land (Plantation meaſure) being but of indifferent goodnes, with the reſt of the Lands
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:125422:11"/>
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſhall require as much Stock as whoſe ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal price and charge of tranſporting will amount to 15000 or 2000l. Since likewiſe Husbandmen and Tradeſmen that are laborious, can ſubſiſt by their Labours and Trades comfortably in <hi>England,</hi> and moſt will not probably leave their native ſoyl on any terms; and thoſe who will, on extraordinary terms. It is neceſſarily conſequent, that the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantation of the Iriſh doth not onely deprive the Planter of thoſe aforementioned advantages, but alſo ſo exceedingly aggravates his charge and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in planting (by his irremedicable want of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he brings not with him out of <hi>England</hi>) that his charge will manifeſtly appear to be more than his profit; and it is not eaſily conceivable how or when five or ſix Millions of Acres are like to be planted or inhabited upon ſo clear an account of expence and loſs.</p>
               <p>Objection.<hi> Againſt all theſe advantages it is onely objected, that the Engliſh may degenerate, and turn Iriſh, unleſs a ſeparation by tranſplanting the one from the other be obſerved; and to this purpoſe experience of former ages is urged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Of future contingents no man can paſs a determinate judgement; but if we ſpeak morally, and as probably may be, it may much rather be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that the Iriſh will turn Engliſh. Thoſe To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks before inſtanced concerning Religion do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it as very probable, that with the Religion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by the Engliſh, it is likely they may receive their Manners alſo. And this is confirmed by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of all of that Nation who embraced the Proteſtant Religion. And as to former experience,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:125422:11"/>
even that likewiſe ſeems to add weight to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, becauſe whatever inducements perſwaded the Engliſh formerly to turn Iriſh, the ſame more ſtrongly invite the Iriſh now to turn Engliſh.</p>
               <p>1. When <hi>England</hi> was reformed from Popery, no care was took, nor endeavours uſed to ſpread the reformation in <hi>Ireland;</hi> by which means the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Colonies there continued ſtill Papiſts, and ſo in Religion were alienated from the Engliſh, and and faſtned to the Iriſh: But now it being moſt probable that moſt of the Iriſh will embrace the Proteſtant Profeſſion, it is upon the ſame grounds moſt probable that they will embrace the Engliſh Manners.</p>
               <p>2. Former Conqueſts of <hi>Ireland</hi> were either the undertakings of ſome private perſons, or ſo mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by publick perſons, that the power and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble advantages of the Land remained in the hands of the Iriſh: But as in the preſent Conqueſt the Nation of <hi>England</hi> is engaged, ſo is the power and advantage of the Land in the hands of the Engliſh. For inſtance.</p>
               <p>1. The Iriſh were the Body of the People, and too potent for the Engliſh (eſpecially at ſuch times as the troubles of <hi>England</hi> cauſed the Armies to be called thence, which Hiſtorians obſerve to have been the times of degeneration, as a means to ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſervation.</p>
               <p>2. The Iriſh were the general Proprietors of Land, and an Engliſh Planter muſt be their Tenant; and the temptation of this relation and dependence is very prevalent (at leaſt) to bring the Poſterity to a complyance, and that to a likeneſs, and that to a ſameneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:125422:12"/>3. The Iriſh were the chiefly eſtated, and the intermarriages with them were accompanied with greater Friends and Fortunes than with the Engliſh, who were not onely Strangers, but for the moſt part (till of late years) comparatively poor.</p>
               <p>4. The Lawyers were Iriſh, the Jurors Iriſh, moſt of the Judges Iriſh, and the major part of their Parlament Iriſh; and in all Diſputes between Iriſh and Engliſh, the Iriſh were ſure of the favour.</p>
               <p>But now the condition of <hi>Ireland</hi> is (through Gods goodneſs) ſo altered, that all theſe Arguments are much more forcibly perſwaſive, that the Iriſh will turn Engliſh.</p>
               <p>3. The frequent uſe of the Iriſh Language in all commerce, and the Engliſhes habituating themſelvs to that Language, was one great means of Iriſhfying the Engliſh Colonies: But now the Language will be generally Engliſh; and if the Iriſh be mingled with the Engliſh, they will probably learn and be habituated to the English Tongue, which is found by experience to be ſuddenly learn'd by the Irish; whereas if they be tranſplanted into <hi>Connaught,</hi> the diſtinction of the English and Irish tongue will not onely be continued, but alſo the Irish left without means of learning English.</p>

The range of the <hi>Tories</hi> will be ſo great, and advantages thereby of ſecuring themſelves and Cattel ſo much, that untill the whole Land be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe planted, it will not be probable that our Armies ſhould either have intelligence of their places of abode in their faſtneſſes, or be enabled to find them, thoſe who are acquainted with the ſervice of <hi>Tory</hi>-hunting, know much of this difficulty. And im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible it is, that thoſe parts of the Land which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn to thoſe Faſtneſſes, should be planted in many ages, if <hi>Tories</hi> (ſecured in them) make incurſions on ſuch as shall plant.</p>
               <p>4. The Irish numbers (now ſo abated by Famin, Peſtilence, the Sword, and Forein Tranſportations) are not like to overgrow the English as formerly, and ſo no fear of their being obnoxious to them hereafter: but being mixed with, they are likelyer to be ſwallowed up by the English, and incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into them; ſo that a few Centuries will know
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:125422:13"/>
no difference preſent, fear none to come, and ſcarce believe what were paſs'd. The chiefeſt and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenteſt of the Nobility, and many of the Gentry, have taken Conditions from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and have tranſported at ſeveral times 40000 of the moſt active ſpirited men, moſt acquainted with danger and diſcipline of War, and inured to hardneſs; the Prieſts are all banished; the remaining part of the whole Nation are ſcarce the ſixth part of what were at the beginning of the War, ſo great a devaſtation has God and Man brought upon that Land, and ſo far are they from thoſe formidable numbers they are (by thoſe that are Strangers to <hi>Ireland</hi>) conceived to be; and that handfull of Natives left, are poor laborious uſefull ſimple Creatures, whoſe deſign is onely to live, and their Families, the manner of which is ſo low, that it is a deſign rather to be pitied, than by any body feared, envyed, or hindred.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For the future. By this Tranſplanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</p>
               <p>1. The Irish Commonalty are put under the power of thoſe Chiefs, who have engaged them in ſo much Blood in the late Rebellion.</p>
               <p>2. They are collected into one Rendezvouz, and ſo fitted for an united undertaking, when occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion shall be adminiſtred. <hi>Scilurus,</hi> his Arrows might eaſily be broke ſingly, but bound in one bundle, they abide any ſtreſs.</p>
               <p>3. They are ſeated in a Country furtheſt diſtant from <hi>England,</hi> and for the Sea-shore moſt remote from the courſe of the English Fleet, where there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may receive Arms from any Forein Prince with moſt ſecurity, modelize themſelves into Arms,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:125422:13"/>
and be furniſh'd irreſiſtably for a new war; by means of theſe advantages, the Engliſh in the laſt Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on firſt loſt <hi>Connaught,</hi> and laſt regained it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they exceedingly miſtake who ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the paſſage out of <hi>Connaught</hi> into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther three Provinces is difficult, or may be eaſily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> defended againſt the Iriſh, if they ſhould thus be armed and fitted for a new war.</p>
               <p>Whereas it is evidently for the ſecuritie of the Engliſh and Engliſh intereſſe, to divide the Iriſh one from the other, eſpecially the Commonaltie from the Cheifs, and both from the advantages of receiving probable aſſiſtants from Foreiners.</p>
               <p>Objection.<hi> But notwithſtanding many of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements to joyn with the Engliſh, yet many of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh have of late turned </hi>Tories, <hi>by means of this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation.</hi> 
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The miſtake is great in attributing that effect to this cauſe. The reall cauſes of thoſe later <hi>Tories</hi> are ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Common-wealth's neceſſitie for money to maintain the Army of <hi>Ireland,</hi> brought the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted people under a tax ſo inſupportable, that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralitie of them were forced to a monethly diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their principall ſubſtance, which by degrees brought laborious husbandmen to ſo ſad a ſtate of povertie, that they were neceſſitated to this hard choice of ſtarving or turning <hi>Tories.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Lawes were impoſed on the protected to diſcover and reſiſt Enemies upon pain of death although they neither had nor were allowed Armes or means to inable them to it, or defend themſelvs; nor could the Law-givers protect them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:125422:14"/>
in their eſtates, or lives, from that Enemie to whoſe malice and fury the obſervance of thoſe Lawes made them liable; ſo that both the contempt of, and obedience to them, expoſed theſe poor people to be puniſhed with death either by the Engliſh or Iriſh.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the violence and oppreſſion by ſome of the Souldiers inflicted on them is incredible; and by the injured people's juſt fear to complain, many hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible facts of this nature go daily unpuniſhed.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the narrowneſs and ſtreightneſs of the Parliaments conceſſions of mercy to that Nation in the firſt and fourth article of the act of ſettlement, which doth not declare one in 500. pardonable ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for life or eſtate; and when men ſee a line of deſtruction meaſuring out their portion, nature teaches them to perſerve their lives as long, and ſell them as dear as they can, by reſiſting to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, the power of that ſtate whoſe declared re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves exempt them from all mercy.</p>
               <p>Object.<hi> But if this toleration of Iriſh cohabiting be allowed, the Adventurers and Souldiers (it is feared) will acquieſce in them rather than expoſe themſelves to the expence and difficultie of tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and planting with Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> All the Iriſh, and all their ſtock is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate to the fifth part even of the three provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and therefore cannot ſatisfie the proprietors ends, of planting their land; though being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagiouſly diſperſed and diſpoſed of, they may be inſtrumentall by their labours, and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, to make preparation for, and to facilitate the ſettlement of ſuch others as the planters muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:125422:14"/>
bring thither for the full improvement of his Land.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee no neceſſity of this tranſplanting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in regard of the three great ends alledged, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Profit, Safety, but rather ſo great a neceſſity of them, that there's no reaſon at all for it.</p>
               <p>But there is one thing more which wiſe men will conſider, and that is, the impoſſibility of this tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting. Among the five things, Impoſſiblilities are one head that are excluded deliberation. There are Laws made, and Orders gone out, for their going Univerſally into <hi>Connaught</hi> by <hi>March</hi> next; But ſuppoſe they ſhould have a dram of Rebellious blood ſtill in them, or be fullen and not go; It is not impoſſible but this may be ſo, nay it is certain it will be ſo, for they were by Orders to remove long ſince, and yet an inconſiderable part onely obeyed, the generality chooſing to run all hazards obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than condeſcend.</p>
               <p>They ſay they can but find want and ruine, (at the worſt) if they ſtay, and why ſhould they travel ſo far, for that which will come home to them? can it be imagin'd that a whole Nation will drive like Geeſe at the wagging of a hat upon a ſtick? but theres an Army to compell them; I, this is the way to have an Army, nay to have two Armies, one more then we would (of the Enemies) and then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to have one leſs then we would again, never a one of our friends; Surely more Engliſh Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers have periſht by the Countrey, then the Sword of the Iriſh; They are more afraid of <hi>Tories</hi> then Armies, and Woods and Boggs then Campswhere; It will be harder to find them then vanquiſh them; And
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:125422:15"/>
when will this wild war be finiſhed? <hi>Ireland</hi> Planted, Inhabitants unburthened, Souldiers ſetled? at this rate who will be able to ſtir abroad for fear, to live at home for want? And when a dangerous expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment has been tryed, it may be Quiet will be ſought at a dearer rate then it might be found now; It's a ſad thing to fight againſt men till they are reduced to us, &amp; then to fight againſt them, becauſe they will not part from us.</p>
               <p>And that this is certainly the true ſtate of the controverſie (and not any dregs) of Rebellion in them unpurg'd, yet will by this evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that thoſe whom Fear or Want has made lately to ſwell the number of the <hi>Tories</hi> ſo much (to ſhew their diſpoſition to quietneſs) did at their firſt going out, and do ſtill continue to offer ſecuritie for their peacable demeanors in the Engliſh quarters, if they may be accepted, and to take the firſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, to go beyond ſea for Souldiers; And if this will not be granted, who knows what deſperation may make them willing to do, and us unwillingly to ſuffer?</p>
               <p>Although to diſcover ſo many monſtrous and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident dangers and loſſes neceſſarily impending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the generall removall of the Iriſh out of the three Provinces into <hi>Connaught,</hi> and not againſt ſmall ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, but ſuch ſeverall great Intereſs, <hi>viz</hi> the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Iriſh Papiſts, or making them turn Atheiſts, the knitting again like Worms their divided ſepts and amities which are now cut in ſunder, the entai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling barbarouſneſs upon them by ſuch a conſociation for ever, the giving them power to rebell again by crouding them all together, and will, by the great
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:125422:15"/>
injury they conceive they have in this action, againſt, which they have ('tis ſtrange) as great a reſentment, as againſt loſs of eſtate, yea even death it ſelf. The aſperſing the Engliſh Nation with Cruelty, ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and in ſome ſort unfaithfulneſs. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the States Revenue, the ſtanding Army, the disbanded Souldiery, former Engliſh Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, preſent Adventurers, and future Planters.</p>
               <p>Though it were enough to repreſent barely a <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra</hi> ſo pregnant with miſchievous heads, to have it cut off, and new reſolutions to ſucceed thoſe which have been before, and invention to project on all hands upon what ſurer grounds an action of ſuch moment may be founded: yet if the Parlament ſhall be pleaſed but ſo much to reſpect the good meaning of what is here written, as (by their cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency paſſing by all the infirmities thereof) to let the reſidue fall under the cognizance of any perſons deputed thereto. There are likewiſe Expedients ready to be humbly tendred, if they may be accepted, which offer at leaſt at the aſſoyling all theſe difficulties and diſturbances, and the putting that whole Land (by Gods bleſſing) into a quiet and flouriſhing eſtate: but it was judged more convenient to exempt them from the publication of this Paper, that the Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might neither ſeem to have their Wiſdomes foreſtall'd, if they ſhall adviſe on other Expedients, nor their Counſels revealed, if any thing offered there ſhould happen to find favour in their eyes.</p>
               <p>There are ſome things wherein the Reader is to be premoniſh'd, to ſtop his wonder how ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Reſolutions could paſs, or be let paſs from the hand of Authority all this time. For which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:125422:16"/>1. Thoſe that were in <hi>England</hi> muſt ſee and hear with their eyes and ears that were in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Informations given from them, were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to ſquare their directions to them: Now it is no wonder if thoſe that were but Strangers to that Land ſhould not (at firſt ſight) underſtand the compleat intereſt thereof; and ſo though their wils were zealous to that which was good in the general, yet their underſtandings not fully inform'd (ſo ſoon) might cauſe them to deviate in ſome particular.</p>
               <p>2. When theſe Reſolutions were at firſt taken to tranſplant the Irish univerſally, the face of things much differed in <hi>Ireland</hi> from what it appears now; and that might be conveniently propounded (nay done in one time) which will not ſo well ſuit with the ſeries of Affairs at another: then Neceſſity might have made it fit to have tranſplanted, now the unfitneſs makes it not neceſſary: So that both the one and the other might have been juſt and unjuſt, as they were accommodated to ſeveral times and conditions. It is impoſſible for men to foreſee all things; Events failing from what was preconceiv'd, may make Counſels vary from what was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contriv'd.</p>
               <p>3. Though thoſe that ſate at the Helm ſaw it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in their Wiſdomes to give out ſuch Orders in thoſe times, yet in their Goodneſs we ſee they did not think fit to execute them even till this time, as if they did wait a time to be gratious to the Irish Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and would expect all opportunities that might enable them therein, and any new accidents inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, that would conſpire thereto.</p>
               <p>And now (God having put the ſame into their
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:125422:16"/>
hands at preſent) it is the earneſt ſuit of many, and ought to be the deſire and prayer of all mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and ſober Chriſtians, that he would put into their hearts to embrace and uſe it; That Mercy may be remembred in the midſt of Juſtice, by thoſe who themſelves deſire not Juſtice without Mercy, and that thoughts may be had of what indulgence is due to the frailty of a man, as well as what ſeverity to the obſtinacy of a Rebel; it being an Heroick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs not to inſult upon an humbled Enemy, and Wiſdome not to make him deſperate.</p>
               <p>The converſion of that Nation will be a more pious work than their eradication, it was that was pretended, faſted, prayed, preach'd for ſo often; ſure it was intended. God hath complicated our good with this mercy, as if he would not let Men be too cruel to thoſe poor blind Natives, without being ſo to themſelves; and would reward their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate thoughts towards them with the many good effects that will thereby accrew.</p>
               <p>The unſetling of a Nation is an eaſy work, the ſetling is not, it has coſt much Blood and Treaſure there, and now Prudence and Mercy may accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish the work; the opportunity for it, will not laſt alwaies, 'tis now; the Phyſicians late aſſiſtance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairs, where his early help might have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous. The Souldiers (there) exhauſted with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable labours, hope now for their reſt. The old English, having lain ſo long under Taxes, wait for their Jubile. The Adventurers expect ſome Crop at length, from what they have long ſince ſo plentifully ſown. The State may challenge a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue from what she has ſo amply expended on.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:125422:17"/>
It had been better <hi>Ireland</hi> had been thrown into the Sea before the firſt engagement on it, if it will never turn to account, but ſtill to expence: but the time is come when the Venture will defray the expence of the Voyage, if all be not shipwrack'd in the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours mouth; all there contrive quietneſs, pray for peace. This Tranſplantation is the main <hi>Remora</hi> that puts to a ſtand. The Seed-time was, the Harveſt would come on. The Spring will haſten after ſo sharp a Winter. And how glorious a Victory will that be, when both the Bodies and Minds of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are overcome! the firſt by power, the ſecond by love? How will the Souls of the Iriſh bluſh here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, that they ſhould have been once cruel againſt thoſe, whom they find ſtill ſo mercifull towards them: when Love ſhall hold a ſtricter rein upon them than fear, and make them waſh away that Blood they have drawn from others, by Tears drawn from themſelves. How ſhall they bleſs God for their Unproſperouſneſs, and rejoyce in thoſe Infelicities whereby they are made happy? And the Engliſh that are in that Land bid paſt cares, and fears, and preſent wants adieu, and leave thoſe Hives they have been almoſt ſtarved in, like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious Bees, to repair their old Stocks with new Honey. How at eaſe will the State be from thoſe cares, that, like Vultures, have continually preyed upon their hearts in the behalf of that Land? And what a pleaſing ſight will it be to <hi>England,</hi> inſtead of meagre naked Anatomies, which ſhe received driven from <hi>Ireland</hi> in the beginning of a War, to empty her ſelf of her young Swarms thither in the beginning of a Peace? If Antiquity deceive us not,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:125422:17"/>
that Land was once called the Iſland of Saints; and if Novelty deceive us not again, it may find as ſtrange a change to good, as it had a fall to ill; God has made (in the nature of Inſtruments) the good or ill of thouſands beneath, to hang upon the breath of a few that are above. O what a guard had there need to be on their lips, whoſe words diſpence death! what prayers to God! what uprightneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Man! If any Errours be committed, thoſe on the right are eaſyeſt cancell'd; It is better to ſave one innocent, than deſtroy many guilty perſons: but to make guilty perſons become innocent (by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving) how excellent will that be? How much more comfort will the heart receive hereafter, to hear the once poor erring Iriſh live good Proteſtants, honeſt Subjects, than to have heard they dyed blinded Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, bloody Rebels? And there can come no glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from that ruine which may be avoyded. The moſt contemptible things carry Engins of death a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them; a Gnat, a Hair, a Raſin-ſtone can deſtroy, but great glorious univerſal agents (like the Sun) are the Parents of life; A ſtorm or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent may throw down a houſe, but art and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry are required to build it; and this way treads a deſtructive path, as hath been ſhewn, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould be no longer trodden in; God grant they whom this concerns moſt, may be as ſenſible of it, as ſome are whom it concerns leſs; that they may mind this Affair according to the greatneſs of its conſequent (which ſlights all mediocrity) and will be tranſcendently good or evil; and as Comets may reflect obliquely upon vulgar men, but more eminently ſignifie for great Perſonages, ſo theſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:125422:18"/>
effects may be ſhowred among the Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but will be poured upon the head of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. But I had forgot that I had ſaid before, that Tranſplanting is an impoſſible work, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is enough to pray (and may hope to prevail among wiſe men) that they would be pleaſed to leave<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> undone that which they are not able to do, which I take to be a reaſonable and modeſt requeſt.</p>
