            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that he is a brother as holy,

before you paſſe your verdict, I would
intreat you to take this ſhort character which
I heare of him along with you, and then cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
what he writes accordingly. Firſt, he
is a man of ſo giddy hairbrain'd a nature,
and ſo ſhallow of apprehenſion, that without
fear or wit, he runs headlong, and takes
hold of the <hi>Aſſes</hi> Author's ſleeve, and there
he will pin his faith; ſo much does he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
what Religion is. His learning, wit,
and manners agree very well in conſort,
they are all ſo ſmall. He is a ballad Poet,
having for his pay ten groats a ballad, and
a pot of Ale: a fellow of no reckoning. To
conclude, he is the Common Spunge to the
Society of Stationers, who ſeed him with a
bit and a knock; yet is he better fed then
taught, for he would make you believe that
his impudence is pure piety and holineſſe.</p>

            <l>Fogg in Rye dough, thou image of a Lawyer,</l>
            <l>Fitter to make a Carman, or a Sawyer,</l>

            <l>Muſt Readers preach; has the Church no degree;</l>
            <l>Nor order? <hi>Scribes</hi> go take the Lawyers fees.</l>
            <l>Hell's where confuſion is, and rotten ſpeech,</l>
            <l>The Lawyer took's own pill, and ſpoke at's
breech.</l>
            <l>The journey-pew ſupplyes his need, as 'tis,</l>

            <p>THE Doctor fearing that his
Name would not be far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
ſpread by his former paper;
and being altogether unwilling to
lay down the bucklers, and acquieſce
under the calumnies caſt upon him by
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100374:20"/>
               <hi>Dauncey</hi> and <hi>Cook,</hi> enters again,
though not himſelf, yet by proxy; and
endeavours to clear himſelf by cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterizing
them; and although he
ſeem to do it never ſo well, yet let
him know, that he was not poſſeſt of
over much wiſdome when he <hi>beat the</hi>
Aſſe <hi>for bawling;</hi> for if he had had
but patience, in ſhort time he might
have ſeen the <hi>Aſſes</hi> Author recant,
and Cudgell himſelf for his Foolery.</p>
