         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Where this Eminent Servant of God, disowns his Humane Eloquence, but not that Divine Elocution in which he excells, and checks those plausible affectations, and artifice of words, which the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of his time made use of, who fed their Auditors, with the <hi>vain glory</hi> of words, in the Contemplation and delight of which they went away, without any <hi>other</hi> improvement than what bare Rhetorick could afford.</p>
                  <p>I may (not unfitly) allude to a passage in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> where it is said,<note place="margin">Franz. hist. Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal. cap. <hi>26.</hi> p. <hi>554</hi>
                     </note> that <hi>Lacon</hi> hearing a Nightingale Sing, and by the briskness of its warbling and delicate Notes, and by the clearness, and quavering cadency of its Voice, judged it a good prey; but when he saw it, and found it to be of so small a size (for 'tis not much bigger than a Sparrow) he disdainfully left it, and said, <hi>vox es, praeterea nihil, thou art a voice and nothing else.</hi> So, whose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever deceives people with those fancy-taking modulations of empty Rhetorick, in the Ministry or Sacred work of Preaching, will in the end become despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and will not only be forsaken of their Judicious Auditors, but will also by the great <hi>Pay-master</hi> be called <hi>unprofitable Servants.</hi>

                     <hi>Illyricus</hi> says, that although we find not in the Sacred Scriptures, that idle or delicate itch of Words, that external sweetness or allurement, that nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merosity of sounds, or those pleasing trifles, which the vain-glorious Orators of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> beautified their so much celebrated <hi>harangues</hi> with, yet we find there a Grave and Masculine Eloquence, exceeding all others.</p>
                  <p>By the very precepts of <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> what may be ones mans <hi>Eloquence</hi> may be anothers <hi>Folly,</hi> because the stile must be found according to the various circumstances of Persons and Things. The <hi>Lawyer</hi> pleads Eloquently, and strives to move the Affections of others. The <hi>Judge</hi> pronounces the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence Gravely. A <hi>King</hi> commands or forbids Plainly. But if the <hi>King</hi> perswades, or the <hi>Judge</hi> contends, they throw off the person of a <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Judge,</hi> and assume the person of a <hi>Subject</hi> and <hi>Pleader.</hi> What then is the Law of the <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords</hi>? Do we think our <hi>God</hi> will use <hi>Inductions,</hi> as <hi>Plato; Syllogisms,</hi> as <hi>Aristotle; Elenchs,</hi> as the <hi>Carmeades; Epiphonema's</hi> as <hi>Cicero; Subtilties</hi> as <hi>Seneca;</hi> or words <hi>far</hi> fetcht, joyned together with an artificial <hi>Sintax</hi> with respect to weight, number, and sound? If a <hi>Royal Edict</hi> were published in that kind of speech consisting of School follies, every wise man would laugh at it. The more plain the Word and Law of the great <hi>God</hi> is, 'tis so much the more becoming the Divine <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Lawgiver,</hi> and more profitable for mankind, because so 'tis more easily understood, being like dayly food, accommodated to every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat. But what if in that <hi>humility</hi> of stile in Scripture, there be more <hi>height</hi> and <hi>loftiness,</hi> and more profoundness in its <hi>Simplicity,</hi> more <hi>beauty</hi> in its nakedness, and more vigor and <hi>acuteness</hi> in its (seeming) <hi>rudeness,</hi> then in those other things we so praise and admire? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This <hi>Holy Book</hi> is of most powerful efficacy to instruct the humble, and confound the proud. In History, the <hi>main</hi> thing praise worthy is <hi>Truth,</hi> which is here set forth indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitably.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>True</hi> Beauty abhors (and indeed needs not) the bedawbings of a pencil for the more <hi>naked</hi> it is, 'tis so much the more <hi>attractive;</hi> and as <hi>Jewellers</hi> say, <hi>The richer the Gem is, the less it needs the assistance of Gold or Art to set it off, &amp;c.</hi> If a <hi>proper</hi> and comely man walks upon <hi>Stilts</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear <hi>Taller,</hi> it adds nothing to his beauty, but diminishes the <hi>decorum</hi> of his natural proportion.</p>
                  <p>Yet nevertheless there is in Scripture a <hi>peculiar</hi> and admirable <hi>Elegance,</hi> so that I may boldly say that <hi>Cicero</hi>'s smooth and elaborate blandishments, are but exercises of <hi>Puerility,</hi> in comparison of the grave, lively and venerable Majesty of the Prophet <hi>Esaias</hi> stile, as the very <hi>Exordium</hi> of his Book shews, Esa. <hi>1.2.</hi> &amp;c. which is full of Ingenity and Eloquence, Humility and Grandiloquence; Reason and Affection. And it may be safely asserted, that considering the Method and Stile, that was thought most convenient by the Sovereign <hi>Dictator</hi> of this blessed Writing, the Argument of which it treats, and the manner of expression there, no other Writing can Parallel it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that which is <hi>Holy,</hi> is withal <hi>Venerable</hi> and <hi>Grave,</hi> and such things need no paint or artificial illustrations, and because the multitude of Readers is promiscuous, it was needful that it should be understood by all, because every man is concern'd to believe and observe it. And hence the Scriptures were written in the <hi>common</hi> Language, viz.

And that which <hi>Criticks,</hi> admire in <hi>Homer, Thucydides,</hi> and <hi>Pindarus</hi> singly, are univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally found here, which must not be understood of <hi>that</hi> elegance that tickles the fancy, and relishes with the fleshy Ear, but the inward and most noble part, <hi>viz.</hi> an <hi>illuminated Soul.</hi>

                  <p>The Words of <hi>Picus</hi> Earl of <hi>Mirandula</hi> are notable, in his Epistle to <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molaus Barbarus,</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Non movent, non per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suadent sacrae li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terae; sed cogunt, agitant, vim infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt, legis rudia verba, &amp;c</note> 
                     <hi>The Sacred Scriptures,</hi> saith he, <hi>do not move, nor perswade; but compel, stir up, and force. Thou readest words that seem rustick and unpolisht (viz.</hi> in the opinion of the wise men of this World) <hi>but they are lively, quick, inflaming, sharp, and penetrating even the very spirit, transforming the whole by an admirable power.</hi> And his excellent <hi>Nephew,</hi> another <hi>Mirandula</hi> lib. <hi>2.</hi> Exam. vanit. Doctrin. Gent. says, <hi>that although Scripture stile seems to us more Rude than Eloquent, yet it has an extraordinary power to command the Reverence and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the peruser.</hi> Of these two <hi>Mirandula</hi>'s (the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nkle and the Nephew who were the Ornaments not only of <hi>Italy,</hi> but of the Age they lived in) the aforesaid <hi>Bibliander</hi> says, that after they had perused all approved Authors, and had almost surfeited with humane literature, they betook themselves to the Study of (and acquiesed in) the Scriptures, with which they were so ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visht, that they could not be satisfied.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jerome</hi> says of the Book of <hi>Esaias,</hi> that <hi>the floridness of his stile can be represented by no Translation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That expression of the Learned (and otherwise praise worthy) <hi>Erasmus</hi> is to be wondred at, who says, <hi>qui fit?</hi>

                     <hi>ut Apostolorum sermo non solum impolitus sit &amp; inconditus, verum etiam imperfectus, &amp;c. How comes it to pass? that the speech of the Apostles is not only unpolished, and confus'd, but also imperfect and solaecising</hi>— adding a little after, <hi>the Authority of the Apostles is not to be Judged by their mode of speech, but their meaning. Neither may a Godly man be offended more with their undrest stile, than with their plain and homely cloathing;</hi> conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>that the Apostles learnt not the</hi> Greek <hi>Tongue from the Orations of</hi> Demosthenes <hi>but popular speech</hi>— whereas all true Christians know, that
<pb facs="tcp:41512:4"/>
they learnt it of the <hi>great God</hi> who is all wise and Eloquent (in whom no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent quality is wanting) who infinitely surpasses <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> and who directed their minds, their Language and Stile to express the sacred Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of true Wisdom, as is very evident from Matth. <hi>10.20.</hi> Luke <hi>21.15. 2</hi> Pet. <hi>1.21.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib de vero Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu. c. <hi>21.</hi>
                     </note> Hence <hi>Lactantius</hi> says, <hi>that such as were accustomed to sweet and artificial Orations or Verses, despised the plain and common mode of Scripture speaking as rude, because they delight in that, which tickles the sence and fancy, which while it captivates the mind, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guides and insnares. But cannot God (who form'd the mind, tongue, and voice) speak Elegantly?</hi> Yes certainly, <hi>for by his gracious Providence he has ordered those Divine things to be published without the disguise of any artificial bedawbing,</hi> (which conceals the true meaning of the speaker) <hi>that all may understand what he delivers.</hi> By which words, as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses the Scripture to be no way imbellished with humane Art, so he asserts, that the phrase is pure; and divinely Eloquent, and adapted to express its sacred Contents.</p>
                  <p>The difference of the sacred stile (with respect to the <hi>Hebraisms</hi> in the New <hi>Testament</hi>) from those prophane <hi>Rhetoricians,</hi> (whose main end was to <hi>beguile</hi> attention, and inveagle mens minds by the artifice of words) should be an argument to confirm the minds of such men (as believe the Apostle) in the Faith,<note place="margin">

                     </note> because of the antiquity, certainty, and perfection of that sacred Tongue, first taught by the soveraign Creator; rather than urg'd as a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to Judge it <hi>impure, imperfect</hi> or abounding with <hi>solaecisms.</hi>

                     <hi>Graceless Eloquence</hi> attired in the most Illustrious dress of <hi>Tropes</hi> and <hi>Schemes,</hi> adorn'd with the borrowed phrases of <hi>Tully</hi> or <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> and whatever the common places of <hi>Phrase-students</hi> can afford, is certainly an engine of mischief, <hi>breathing out threatning and slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> (the Scholar of <hi>Gamaliel</hi>) did before his Conversion, <hi>Acts 9.1. &amp;c.</hi> For those accomplishments, if unsanctified, are (like a <hi>Sharp</hi> sword in a mad hand) fit only for the baffling (as far as it can) of plain and Naked Truth.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, that there are many <hi>Hebraisms</hi> in the New Testament, that is, a mixture of the <hi>Idiom</hi> of that <hi>sacred</hi> Language with the <hi>Greek,</hi> which the Heathen <hi>Grecians</hi> (being ignorant of the <hi>phrase</hi>) accounted <hi>barbarous.</hi> But <hi>Christians,</hi> who know that much of the Old Testament is quoted in the New, should rather esteem it an <hi>Ornament;</hi> because the propriety of the first Langu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age (than which no speech is more significant and emphatical) is diffused into the other; and because (as <hi>Heinsius</hi> a man as <hi>Glas.</hi> says, <hi>Learned to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, in Prolegom. Aristarch. sacri.</hi> well expresses himself) <hi>if any man will be so impudently bold, as to say that the Scriptures are any way defective, he declares himself thereby not Learned, but a Blasphemer, and brutally mad, as well as ignorant of the quality of man, who is no Judge of what God sayes or does, but ought rather to be a supplicant and attend his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations with Reverence and Adoration.</hi> And as <hi>Hillary</hi> words it, <hi>when the discourse is of the affairs of the great God, we must yeild him the Prerogative of knowing best what he says or does, and instead of carping, pay him veneration.</hi> The Mysteries which God proposes to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived in his holy word, as they are in themselves most true and best, although all humane Reason, which Judges by its own wisdom or carnal conclusions, should otherwise determine: So their Eloquence (an inseparable companion of Divine Wisdom is to be esteemed the <hi>best</hi> and <hi>most</hi> elegant by the faithful, unless we suppose that God who immediately dictated them to his <hi>Amanuensis,</hi> spoke nonsense, and is inferior to his Creatures in that qualification, which is down
<pb facs="tcp:41512:4"/>
right <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> and any asserting that deserves not only derision, but the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verest castigation.</p>
                  <p>The peculiar <hi>Idiotisms,</hi> and most pure character of speaking, which the Holy Spirit used in the publication of the <hi>saving</hi> word of Truth, are by the excellent <hi>Glassius</hi> (a man for his singular pains, and exquisite Learning to be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by all posterity) as he himself <hi>modestly</hi> says, in part (for what mortal can express its whole energy?) delivered in his <hi>Gram. sacra.</hi> (a work well worth Translating). And the <hi>Lights</hi> of speech, that is, the <hi>Tropes</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> there, are in this sacred <hi>Rhetorick</hi> treated of, being indeed the substance of what he writ in Latin upon, that Subject (we hope) faithfully Translated, The <hi>Tropes</hi> in <hi>this</hi> Volume, and the <hi>Figures</hi> in the second. Only the Reader may Note, that we <hi>have</hi> not absolutely tyed our selves to his words but have to the best of our abilities exprest his sence, abridging where need was, and supplying out of <hi>other</hi> Learned Authors to which be referr'd, or who had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the same thing in our Language, which we consulted, and inserted what was judged necessary for the compleating of this work. Which,</p>
                  <p>Does not only open that part of Scripture which is <hi>Tropical</hi> and <hi>Figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> but may teach) the Reader (if ignorant of it) <hi>Rhetorick</hi> in general, an Art of such <hi>General</hi> use, that no writing can well want it: I mean, not a <hi>jingling</hi> affectation of <hi>Words</hi> or <hi>Sentences,</hi> but the use of <hi>Tropes</hi> and Figures, which nervate sence, and move the affections of the Hearer or Peruser.</p>
                  <p>Although the <hi>design</hi> of this work, was principally intended to open Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Metaphors,</hi> yet many express Similitudes, and other Terms borrowed from an humane custom of speech or appellations, obvious in, and proper to common &amp; Earthly things, are improved <hi>Parallel wise</hi> in the Second Part, for common Edification; at which the Learned and Candid Reader will not Carp: For we bring not all as <hi>Metaphors,</hi> but as Terms that may be used as advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, and as much to profit, though in the strict notion of that <hi>Trope,</hi> not agreeing with its definition (which we give in its place) of which we caution our Reader under their respective heads.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>First</hi> Book the Texts alledged are cited from the very original <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> because there are many <hi>Tropes</hi> (peculiar to those sacred Languages) which our <hi>excellent English Translation</hi> rather expounds than renders <hi>verbatim.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have taken <hi>Care</hi> to make necessary <hi>Tables</hi> for both Parts, and we purpose, with Divine help, to continue our Labours in another <hi>Volume,</hi> which you may, in page the last of the <hi>First,</hi> and <hi>p. 76</hi> of the <hi>Third</hi> Book of this Volume, have a brief account of: Our design being to compleat this said <hi>Philolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> for the benefit of such as want the acquirements of humane Literature, and are Students in sacred <hi>Learning.</hi>

                           <hi>Luke</hi> 22.36. <hi>Then said he</hi> (that is Christ) <hi>unto them, But now he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: And he that hath no Sword let him sell his garment, and buy one.</hi> By this speech is signified, that to that quiet and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able way of living, which the Apostles had hitherto enjoyed in the School of <hi>Christ,</hi> should immediately succeed a most greivous persecution, even to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun that very night, and that the Enemy with Swords and Clubs were at hand, so that such as confide in an Arm of Flesh, and would consult (as men) about the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of themselves and theirs, could have no better way, then to dispose of all, even to their very Coats, and provide themselves with Military defences to resist the Enemies violence. By this <hi>sign</hi> therefore, the thing <hi>signified</hi> is to be understood; For <hi>Christ</hi> does not require, that his Apostles should buy Swords and defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but by the necessity of a Sword, he <hi>symbolically</hi> insinuates or intimates the greivousness of that danger, which threatens them from the Enemy. So says <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylact,</hi> and <hi>Enthymius</hi> upon the place. The Apostles understood these words of Christ properly and therefore say, <hi>verse</hi> 38. <hi>Lord here are two Swords,</hi> to whom he said, <hi>it is enough.</hi> By which answer he modestly and tacitly reprehends the absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of his Disciples, as if he had said, I perceive you do not apprehend the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my <hi>Parabolical</hi> speech, therefore it is enough to have admonished you thus much, your experience and the fulfilling of my prediction will supply the place of an exposition, when in a little time a Military Host shall invade, to repel which a hundred Swords shall not be enough. See <hi>Brentius</hi> and <hi>Erasmus</hi> upon the place.</p>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41512:27"/>
what dost thou still stand upon terms with God, wilt thou not humble thy self and desist from the conceits and imaginations of thine own integrity, since these greivous and sudden afflictions are sent for your your sins from an angry <hi>God,</hi> therefore rather bless him, that is, pray to him, and in humility seek his face (for so to bless sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies to pray, or make supplication) and beg him to release thee of this miserable Life, since 'tis better for thee to dye once, then to die dayly.</p>

                        <p>But others with greater probability judge this Counsel to be very wicked, for he reproves her for it plainly — <hi>Thou speakest as one of the foolish Women speaketh,</hi> and certainly <hi>Job</hi> would never have said so, if her speech had only imported an humble preparation for his approaching Death— It was rather a speaking the Devils mind, to bid him Curse God and Dye, <hi>viz.

                           <p n="2">(2.) By that Temptation the Devil endeavours to intice Christ into some sin, or distrust of the Divine Oracle, or into a vain ostentation, or empty Glory, if by the Devils suggestion he should work a Miracle, &amp;c.</p>

Consult your own honour, and let it not be said that you furiously persecuted him, to whom you have given Royal Honour.</hi> Caesar <hi>does not fear this King; do you rather pity him, and give over your thoughts of Crucifying him.

He judged it not to come therefore from the High Preist, because so hasty and rash a signification of offence did not become his Office and Authority, nor was such a speech of (at least dissembled) Sanctity like to proceed from him. It is therefore plain that this Councel was not convened in the accustomed place, where the Judicatory order and debates was defined or assigned to be according to every ones dignity and merit, but near the Tower, whither they were called from the Tribunal where <hi>Paul</hi> was, which is indicated in the 30 ver. of the preceding chapter. —And he Commanded the Cheif Preist and all their Councel to appear (in the <hi>Greek</hi> it is <gap reason="foreign">

The Church not only wants a Magistracy, but also Persons fit to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine and compose such differences as ours. The Apostle answers, that the latter is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true because the meanest Christian in these matters have a right of equality with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est.

This is a new Argument taken from publick shame, for to wrangle or go to Law, before a Pagan Judge, was no less then to bring a scandal upon the Church: Therefore there is a caution given against that, and because brought occasion of shame upon the Church, therefore the Apostle says deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly, I speak it to your shame,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>OF a <hi>Metaphor</hi> in general, let the following things be noted.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As to its <hi>Definition,</hi> it is said to be a [<hi>Trope,] when a word is trans<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from its proper and Genuine signification to another less proper</hi>— Or when <hi>like is sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by like. Fabius lib.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 6. calls it <hi>a short similitude</hi> — There are other Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, but all to this sence. Some in handling the Definition of this Trope tell us, that a <hi>Metaphor</hi> may be taken, either from a simple <hi>similitude,</hi> or from <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logye</hi> or proportion. And that these two are different, because there may be a si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude betwixt two, as between <hi>a living</hi> and <hi>a painted</hi> man whence the name of the <hi>Man</hi> is ascribed to the <hi>picture.</hi> But in proportion two answers two, as <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> in his second Book of the Soul compares a <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>oot</hi> to the <hi>Mouth,</hi> because it performs the same office to a Plant, as the Mouth does to a living Creature — Here is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a double similitude, for a <hi>Plant</hi> is compared to a <hi>living Creature,</hi> and the <hi>Root</hi> to his <hi>Mouth,</hi> because <hi>Plants</hi> receive their nourishment from the <hi>Root,</hi> as a living Creature does by the <hi>Mouth.</hi> Of the first sort is that Metaphor, when <hi>drops</hi> of <hi>Dew</hi> are called <hi>Pearls,</hi> when <hi>Flowers</hi> are called <hi>Stars,</hi> or a gross corpulent man is called a <hi>hog.</hi> Of the later are, when the <hi>master of a Ship</hi> has been by Poets com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a <hi>Waggoner,</hi> and <hi>e contra,</hi> because he takes the same care of his Waggon, as as the Master does of his Ship. In Scripture <hi>Metaphors</hi> we shall observe the same distinction, but promiscuously.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As to its <hi>difference</hi> from a similitude and Parable, the difference is either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, or more large; for in a similitude there is a manifest <hi>comparison</hi> of one thing with another, and so 'tis a <hi>logical</hi> Argument; but in a <hi>Metaphor</hi> there is one thing put for another that's like it, which nevertheless in its explication is to be handled by an apparent similitude. And we are to note here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that frequently in Scripture (especially in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> of <hi>Solomon</hi>) a Word or Phrase may be expounded by the <hi>deficient particle,</hi> And in such it is rather a contracted Similitude, then a Metaphor; and therefore many things of that nature are not hereafter reckoned amongst <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors.</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. As to its <hi>Dignity,</hi> as this <hi>Trope</hi> is the most frequent, so it the most florid and pleasant, giving a most wonderful energy or power, and evidence to the style of

                     <p n="4">4. As to the <hi>manner of handling,</hi> whereas the <hi>properties</hi> of things from whence they are deduced, are <hi>many</hi> and <hi>various,</hi> there must be great <hi>care</hi> and <hi>accuracy</hi> used to find out the <hi>Reason</hi> of the <hi>similitude,</hi> and the <hi>Scope</hi> or intention of the <hi>Comparison,</hi> lest there may be an <hi>Abberration</hi> from the proper coherence of the Text, or the <hi>Analogy</hi> of Faith, to do this it is needful that a person be well acquainted with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective <hi>Natures,</hi> and the Phylosophical <hi>Notions</hi> and <hi>Theories</hi> of all things from whence this Trope is taken, as also with the peculiar <hi>Customes,</hi> and distinct qualities of other Nations, particularly the ancient <hi>Jewish</hi> state in their Ecclesia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>More particularly there ought to be care taken, that one <hi>Metaphor</hi> be not <hi>strained</hi> to express things in themselves quite <hi>opposite,</hi> nor make the <hi>parallels</hi> run till they grow <hi>lame</hi>; for one <hi>Metaphor</hi> may be brought to signifie <hi>many</hi> things, with respect to some <hi>different</hi> qualities and <hi>diverse</hi> Attributes. Thus <hi>Christ</hi> is called a <hi>Lyon, Rev.</hi> 5.5. because noble Heroick and unconquerable: The <hi>Devil</hi> is called a <hi>Lyon,</hi> because roaring, rapacious and devouring, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Wicked</hi> men and Tyrants are called so, <hi>Job</hi> 4.10, 11. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.17. Because they are fierce, outragious, and cruel to weaker men, as the <hi>Lyon</hi> is to weaker Creatures.</p>

                     <p>[<hi>Leaven</hi>] expresses the wonderful force and <hi>penetrating</hi> vertue of the <hi>Word</hi> and Kingdom of <hi>God, Matth.</hi> 13.33.

Because of its <hi>malignant</hi> and <hi>sowring</hi> quality, which is also very <hi>spreading,</hi> and insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates it self into all the parts.</p>
                     <p>[<hi>Sleep</hi>] Metaphorically denotes the quiet and peaceable <hi>Death</hi> of the Godly, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4.13, 14. And the <hi>carnal security,</hi> carelessness, and infidelity of sinners. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.11. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.14.</p>
                     <p>The [<hi>Sun</hi>] amongst other things denotes <hi>happiness,</hi> because of its light and splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.31. and <hi>in felicity</hi> or misfortune because of its scorching and exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive heat, <hi>Psal.</hi> 121.6. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.6, 21. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>[<hi>A shadow</hi>] signifies <hi>protection</hi> against evils, as <hi>Esa.</hi> 49.2. and many other places— because it <hi>defends</hi> from intemperate heat. It also denotes great <hi>perils</hi> and calamities (as <hi>Psal.</hi> 23.4. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.79.) because of its darkness and foggyness, which are symbols of <hi>sorrow</hi> and <hi>evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>[<hi>A River</hi>] Metaphorically denotes <hi>plenty</hi> of good and desirable things, <hi>Psal.</hi> 36. 8. —46.4. <hi>Esa.</hi> 66, 12. Because of the abundance of its Waters and the useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness thereof well known— It also denotes <hi>terrors,</hi> perils, and overwhelmings, <hi>Psal.</hi> 18.4. and 124.4. because of the danger of its <hi>rapid</hi> and sudden inundations.</p>
                     <p>The [<hi>Harvest</hi>] is used in a <hi>good sence, Psal.</hi> 126.4, 5, 6. <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.37. And elsewhere, because of the great profit and necessity of the gathered fruit. 'Tis also used in a <hi>bad sence, Jer.</hi> 51.33. <hi>Joel</hi> 3.13. because it is cut down and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.</p>
                     <p>[<hi>Treasure and Treasurer</hi>] is also to be understood in a <hi>good</hi> sence, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.20. &amp;c and in a <hi>bad sence, Rom.</hi> 2.5. both are joyned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.35.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes <hi>Metaphors</hi> taken from <hi>diverse</hi> things, are <hi>joyned</hi> together, where
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41512:31"/>
there is a necessity of a distinct enumeration; an evident example of this we have, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. to the 16. ver. Where <hi>Metaphors</hi> are taken sometimes from <hi>Men</hi> of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent circumstances and capacities; sometimes from <hi>Beasts</hi> to set forth the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inflicted by God. So in <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20. The Metaphors taken from <hi>Civil Society,</hi> and from <hi>building</hi> are joyned together, to set forth the Mystical Conjunction of the Godly in <hi>Christ,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. As to the <hi>variety</hi> of the Metaphors <hi>Bartholinus</hi> rightly says, That they may be taken from all things in the World, whether substances or accidents, natural or artificial things. And <hi>Cicero</hi> says, <hi>Nihil est in rerum natura, unde simile duci non possit,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">lib. 3. de oratione.</note> that there is nothing in nature from whence a similitude may not be brought, adding, that the variety of <hi>Metaphors</hi> is almost <hi>infinite.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Others say, that 'tis as <hi>possible</hi> to empty the Sea with <hi>sieve,</hi> as to reduce or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine <hi>Metaphors</hi> to certain <hi>Classes</hi> or bounds. — The like may (in a manner) be said of the <hi>Metaphors</hi> in Holy Scripture. But in as much as it is very profitable for such as are studious in that Sacred Writing, it shall be endeavoured so to dispose of most, if not all, the <hi>Metaphors</hi> (as much as may be done among such a <hi>multitude</hi> of them) found there, especially the most frequent and illustrious, as that they may be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to a certain <hi>Order,</hi> under their respective <hi>Heads,</hi> which will inable us to give a found judgment of the most Elegant and Rhetorical part of the Bible. And if any be missing, the Harvest being large, it may stir up others to gather up and improve the gleanings.</p>
                     <p n="6">6.

And so all words which express humane Affections, are first to be separated from all in perfections, and then understood of God. The words of <hi>Augustine</hi> are notable— The Anger of a man (says he) causes a disturbance and a torment in his mind; but the VVrath of God executes its vengeance with a perfect equity and tranquillity, void of all disturbance; the mercy of man has some mixture of heart misery, and from thence in the Latin Tongue hath its derivation— The Apostle exhorts not only to rejoyce with the rejoycing, but also to weep with them that weep. But what man of a sound mind can say that God can be touched with any anxiety or torture of mind, the Scripture every where affirming him to be full of mercy. The zeal of men is often tainted with a mixture of spite, envy, or some other disorderly passion; but 'tis not so with God, for though his zeal is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest by the same word, yet 'tis not in the same manner with the Sons of Men.</p>
                        <p>The words of <hi>Chemnitius</hi> deserve notice, <hi>Scholars</hi> (saith he) <hi>by a depraved ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of that Rule,</hi> that <note n="*" place="margin">

I will not execute the fierceness of mine Anger, I will not return to destroy <hi>Ephraim,</hi> for I am God and not Man) <hi>they affirm should be taken according to effection not affection.</hi> It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that accidents having no place in God his commiseration, is not such an affection as ours, but in regard his Mercy is not distinguished from his Essence, it is certain, that it must be much more ardently in God, then we are able to think, &amp;c.</p>

Therefore where art thou? I do not ask in what place, but in what state? Whither has thy sin hurry'd thee, that thou hidest thy self from God, whom before thou hast sought. This is more a chiding, then a question; from what good, from what blessedness, from what grace, and into what misery, art thou fallen? Gen.</hi> 4.9. <hi>And the Lord said unto Cain, where is Abel thy Brother? Augustine</hi> says, he asks not as an ignorant, that would fain,<note place="margin">lib. 12. contra <hi>Faustum Manich.</hi> cap. 10.</note> know, but as a Judge to punish the guilty— See <hi>Gen</hi> 32.27. <hi>Num.</hi> 22.9. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.9, 13. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.14, 15. <hi>Esa.</hi> 39.3, 4.

                        <p>To this may also be referred when God seems to <hi>deliberate</hi> as if he had not known (or doubts) what to do.</p>

                           <hi>Junius</hi> in his <hi>Commentary,</hi> on <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.8. says thus. God that he may more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply shew the wonders of his Mercy seems in Scripture to use a consultation with himself after the manner of men, and then, as if swayed by Mercy to his Creature, though a sinner, after his disputes in his own mind, and a (seemingly) doubtful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, inclines at last to a sentence of Mercy— of which there is an eminent instance in <hi>Hos.</hi> 11.8, 9. <hi>How shall I give thee up Ephraim? How shall I deliver thee Israel. My Heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together, I will not execute the fierceness of my Anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim, for I am God and not man,</hi> &amp;c.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Musculus</hi> in his Comment upon the place says very excellently, that <hi>Moses</hi> by an <hi>Anthropopathy</hi> ascribes the faculty of <hi>Smelling</hi> to God, and writes not of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of <hi>Noah,</hi> for it is not said that the Lord smelled the Odor of the Burnt-Offering, but a sweet savour; for God smells not by the Organ of Nostrils as man does, for it was not the smell of the Sacrifice of Beasts that yeilded that fragrancy, such being in themselves rather nauseous then sweet — Hence we learn that our Works of what kind soever they be, have a certain Smell which ascends to the Nostrils of God, and is either approved by him as sweet and pleasing, or disapproved as noysome and unsavoury. This Odor is, not what our external works represent to sence, but what results from the spirituality of our Hearts; for good Acts proceeding from a good and pious intention smell sweetly, but bad ones the contrary. In the Sacrifice of <hi>Noah,</hi> there was a Corporal and external Savour, which was obvious to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of men, but the piety of his Heart was pleasing to God, whilst in the sincerity and faithfulness of a pious mind, he acknowledged and celebrated the goodness of his Lord, &amp;c. To this may be referred several other places where this phrase (of a <hi>sweet smelling</hi> savour is sound, as Exod. 29.18, 25, 41. Levit. 1.9. and 2.12. and 3.16. and 8.21. Num. 28.2. Ezek. 20.28., 41. &amp;c Doubtless in these places respect is had to the <hi>Messias</hi>

                        <p>And the Learned <hi>Gerhard</hi> says— God is every where, with respect to his Essence, but he is said to dwell in Heaven with respect to the more ample appearance of his Majesty and Glory; so the whole soul is in every part of the Body, but most radically in the head, most effectively in the head, because, its most excellent effects are from thence produced— So <hi>Alcuinus</hi>— God is therefore said to dwell in the Heavens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Angels and the Souls of blessed Saints have a clearer and more illustrious prospect and knowledge of him, then the Saints on Earth can have, by reason of their dwelling in so gross a habitation. Likewise <hi>Polanus</hi>— The Scripture often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time says, that God dwells in the Heavens, not that he is there included, but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, that he is above all in Majesty, Power, and Operation, so as that he cannot be hindered by any on Earth; as also that our minds may be elevated above the World, so as that we may have no low, or carnal, or worldly thoughts of God, &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>This [<hi>Prescience</hi>] of God, inasmuch as it is certain and never failes, therefore such as he Foreknew he also predestinated, for this Foreknowledge is never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out predestination. <hi>Ambrose</hi> confirms this interpretation, in these words.

Hence the Prophets are so obscure, because when one thing is treated of, there is suddenly a change to another thing or person. as Psal. 2.1. The New Testament is introduced, as speaking and complaining of Christs Enemies (See Acts 4.24, 25. &amp;c.) And verse 3. The Wicked themselves speak— ver. 4. The Churches or the Psalmists words are set down, ver. 6. God the Father speaks, ver. 7. God the Son; then again the Father, ver. 10. And then the Royal Psalmist speaks the Conclusion.</p>

                           <hi>Christ</hi> is called a [<hi>Vine] John</hi> 15.1.5.

The <hi>Vine</hi> is <hi>homogeneal,</hi> or of the same Nature with the Branches, so is Christ according to his humanity with Believers, Eph. 5.30. Heb. 2.14.— The Vine imbibes or drinks in a copious humor, and plenty of moisture, which it after Communicates to the Branches: So <hi>of the fulness of Christ we all receive grace for grace, John</hi> 1.16. By a vital jujce de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the Vine, the branches are animated, vegetated and fertiliz'd, so as to bear sweet fruit: By the vertue of Christ and his Spirit given to Believers they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened, quickned, and made apt to bear the fruits of Piety to God (which fruit cheareth God and Man, Judg. 9.13.) but in the manner of this conjunction, there is a diversity or difference. For, <hi>Branches</hi> grow upon the Vine naturally; but Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are ingrafted in the true Vine <hi>Spiritually,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>This is the <hi>primary</hi> Reason of this <hi>metaphor</hi>; but by way of inference other things are intimated, <hi>viz.</hi> The meanness of the Vine, as to outward aspect, Ezek. 15.2, 3. Quadrates very well with <hi>Christ</hi> in his state of Humiliation, <hi>Esa.</hi> 53.2, 3. —The dignity of the Vine, before other Plants, the delicate smell of its flowers, and the excellency and preciousness of its fruit, &amp;c. with other things may be congruously applyed to <hi>Christ</hi> the true and Celestial Vine.</p>

                        <p>In General, The Light of God is to be taken with reference to some Celestial benefits, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 36.9. <hi>In thy Light shall we see Light,</hi> where the preceeding and following words shew, the sence to be, that by the Grace of God manifested in his Word, we come to true blessedness.

                        <p>Hence we come to our Saviour, who is particularly called the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Sun,</hi> not with respect to his Divine Essence, and Person as distinct from the Father, as before, but with respect to his office, benefits, and operations, <hi>Esa.</hi> 9.2. <hi>and</hi> 42.6. <hi>and</hi> 49.6. <hi>and</hi> 60 1. <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.32. <hi>John</hi> 1.4.9. <hi>and</hi> 3.19. <hi>and</hi> 8.12. <hi>and</hi> 12.35, 36. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.47. The Metaphor of [<hi>Light</hi>] in Scripture expresses information, whereby the darkness of the understanding is dispelled, as also a taking away of Sin, (which is compared to Darkness, and a giving of Comfort, all which our Saviour most eminently exhibits from himself to Believers.</p>

                        <p n="2">(2.) That <hi>Sun</hi> only shines by its own Light, and communicates brightness to the <hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> —So <hi>Christ</hi> is the Fountain of true Light, illuminating the Church, and Teachers of his word (which are compared to <hi>Stars,</hi> Rev. 1.20.) with his own proper Light.</p>
                        <p n="3">(3.) As there is but one Sun which excels and illuminates the inferior luminaries of Heaven; so Christ has the preheminence (<gap reason="foreign">

With respect to <hi>Efficacy</hi>; for as the Sun chaces away darkness and clouds, illustrating all things: So Christ dispels the darkness of the mind, by the Light of his Word; the darkness of sinners, by the light of his most Holy Merits; and the darkness of calamity, by the light of his comforting Grace.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. With respect to <hi>Equality,</hi> for the Sun <hi>rises on the Evil and the Good,</hi> (afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its light without distinction to all things sublunary) <hi>Matth</hi> 5.45. which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless <hi>blind men,</hi> and such as <hi>Sleep</hi> by day, do not enjoy: So Christ illuminates every man that cometh into the World, (that is, he affords the means of illumination,) 1 John 1.9. Yet unbelievers, who are blinded by the <hi>Devil,</hi> and such as give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the liberty to sleep securely in sin (and that by their proper, fault and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar vice) John 3.19. and 2 Cor. 4.4. Do not enjoy that saving light or illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which is the reason why the Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> speaking of the actual illumination of the Sun of Righteousness, says, —<hi>To them that fear the Name of the Lord shall the Sun of Righteousness arise,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. No man can resist or hinder the course and efficacy of the Sun: So no Devil, or Tyrant can retard or hinder the course and energy of the Gospel of <hi>Christ, the Sun of Righteousness.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. The Sun refreshes and quickens the World by its heat, which nature demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates in the Spring: So <hi>Christ</hi> quickens and makes alive those that are spiritually Dead, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.5. and causes a Divine heat of Love and Devotion, <hi>Luke</hi> 24 32.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. That which the Prophet mentions, by the phrase [<hi>with healing in his Wings</hi>] is to be understood of the first beams or rays of light called the <hi>Wings of the morning,</hi> (or the first appearance of the Sun) <hi>Psal.</hi> 139.9. that is, the first Sun beams— This celestial Sun is also a <hi>Physitian</hi> which can heal and deliver from spiritual Death. The Sun when it rises gives some ease and comfort to sick persons, let all that are soul sick rejoyce in this justifying and healing Sun of Righteousness.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The Sun rising causes <hi>Joy</hi> to all things, who were (as it were) immersed in the Melancholy sadness of night as the Poet says,
<q>
                              <l>Phosphore redde diem, quid gaudia nostra Moraris?</l>
                           </q>
                           <q>

                        </p>
                        <p>So by this heavenly Sun of Righteousness, true cause of Joy is given unto men, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.10, 11. <hi>Esa.</hi> 9.2, 3.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. The Sun does make all sorts of Earthly fruit <hi>Ripe,</hi> to which it also gave the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of vegetation— So Christ is the <hi>Author and finisher of our Faith,</hi> Heb. 12.2. <hi>He worketh in us to will and to do, Phil.</hi> 2.13. <hi>That we may walk worthy of the Lord, unto all well pleasing, being fruitful unto every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God, Col.</hi> 1.10.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. It is said of the <hi>Heliotrope,</hi> (an herb so called) that it always turns and inclines to the Sun: So let our hearts always incline to Christ.</p>

There is nothing more pleasant to those in Captivity then to behold the Sun: So there is nothing ought to be more comfortable to us in our spiritual Captivity, then by the Eyes of Faith to behold Christ the Sun of Righteousness, &amp;c.</p>

To <hi>Mary</hi> wondring at this, the Angel answers, that it should be by the supernatural, and most singular operation of the Holy Spirit and Highest power, which operation is by an <hi>Anthropopathy</hi> expressed by <hi>overshadowing,</hi> describing the manner of, as that there should be Divine protection, which is the <hi>metaphorical signification</hi> of a shadow, as before. For God being a consuming Fire, would consume <hi>Mary,</hi> by filling her with his peculiar and Majestical Glory, unless there were some Divine <hi>obumbration</hi> or Shade between; as God covered <hi>Moses</hi> with his hand in that peculiar and extraordinary appearance of his Divine Glory, lest by the dazling and Majesty of Gods presence he should be consumed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.22.

This is superior to all Heavens, not by situation but dignity, and greater than every Heaven, not by extension, but from his own immensity, by which he is beyond all, but not excluded, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>So it is taken when <hi>God</hi> is said <hi>to dwell in Heaven, Psal.</hi> 2.4. 1 King. 8.39.43. &amp;c. So <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.15. <hi>Look down from thy Holy Habitation from Heaven, and bless thy people,</hi> &amp;c.

That is, he went forth from that inaccessible Light of Divine Majesty, and manifested himself in the Flesh. And the same Throne of Majesty is in the Heavens, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.1. and 1.3. to which <hi>Christ</hi> (as <hi>God-man</hi>) in his state of exaltation went.

See <hi>Psal.</hi> 8.1, 2. and 108.5. &amp;c. By which places, not so much the hight of the place, as the sublimity of the Divine Majesty is expressed.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Heaven is <hi>metaphorically</hi> taken for the spiritual Kingdom of God, and that state of happiness wherein he manifests and communicates himself to Angels and Men— And that is,</p>
                        <p n="1">(1.) Of <hi>Grace,</hi> viz. The gathering and gracious Government of the Church Militant in this Life, to which belongs the appellation of the Kingdom of Heaven of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes attributed to the <hi>Church, Matth.</hi> 13.11, 24, 31, 33. <hi>and</hi> 20.1. <hi>and</hi> 22.1. &amp;c. So when it is said <hi>to plant a Heaven, Esa.</hi> 51.16. <hi>and to create a New Heaven, Esa.</hi> 65.17. By which phrases the Restauration of the Church by <hi>Christ</hi> is noted, which is begun in this Life, and compleated in Eternity, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13. The Reason of the Comparison is, because as the natural Heaven is very far distant from the Earth, so the ways of God in ruling his Church, and giving blessedness to believers do exceedingly surpass the manner of Earthly Administrations, <hi>Esa.</hi> 55.9. And as in the natural Heaven all things are in the exactest order, full of Light and radiance: So God in his Church, is the God of order and peace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.33. Leading, Teaching, and saving his people by a most convenient order of <hi>mediums,</hi> and that by the Light of his saving Word.</p>
                        <p n="2">(2.) Of <hi>Glory,</hi> viz. The Eternal and unspeakable felicity of Angels and Holy men, in the beholding and perfect fruition of the glorious God. To which belong those phrases, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.10. <hi>Their Angels in Heaven behold the face of my Father</hi>— the speech is of the Angels appointed as keepers of the little ones— By which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the Angels though acting on Earth for the good of Christians are neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less really in Heaven, that is, in a celestial state of blessedness, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.20. <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures are said to be laid up in Heaven, Luke</hi> 8.22. <hi>To have treasures in Heaven, Phil.</hi> 3.20. <hi>To have our Conversation in Heaven</hi>— By which phrases Faith and Christian Hope aspiring and tending to Eternal blessedness is to be understood. From this Heaven <hi>Satan</hi> is said to <hi>fall like Lightning, Luke</hi> 10.18. <hi>Satan</hi> (says) <hi>Illyricus) fell not from a place, but from his degrees of dignity— to wit from the favour of God and spiritual Blessedness, into the greatest wickedness, punishments and eternal and spiritual calamities.</hi> Of the scope of these words of Christ, <hi>Erasmus</hi> says thus— Jesus <hi>that he might fortifie their Mines, against that disease of vain glory, which even the Saints are sometimes tainted with, proposes the example of</hi> Lucifer <hi>to them, who for his pride was suddenly cast down from so great felicity — I saw</hi> (says he) <hi>Satan falling from Heaven
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:41512:66"/>
like Lightning. His dignity in Heaven was very eminent, and yet for the swelling pride of his mind is flung from the highest (glory) to the lowest (wretchedness) how much more ought you to beware of pride who carry a mortal body about you, obnoxious to all perils.</hi> But others understand this of the power and efficacy of <hi>Christ,</hi> which by the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apostles he put forth, to which <hi>Satan</hi> against his Will was forced to give way, and was (as it were) cast down from the height of that power which he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised over men.</p>
                        <p>In [<hi>Heaven,</hi>] we are also to consider the <hi>Ornaments</hi> of it, as the <hi>luminaries</hi> as they are called, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.14. The <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> which are the Organs of Light, —The Sun and Moon constantly shining do <hi>metaphorically</hi> denote eternal blessedness in Heaven. <hi>Thy Sun shall no more go down, neither shall thy Moon withdraw it self— Esa.</hi> 60.20. the explication follows, <hi>For the Lord shall be thine Everlasting Lights, and the days of thy Mourning shall be ended.</hi> See <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.5. Such things as concern the state of the Church in this Life, and Heaven are mixt in this chapter of <hi>Esaiah,</hi> as an accurate inspection into it, will shew. The <hi>Chald.</hi> in Translating these words of the Sun and Moon, does (not unelegantly) expound them <hi>thy Kingdom shall no longer be abolished, nor thy Glory transferred.</hi> The Light of the Sun denotes prosperity, as shall be shewed hereafter; therefore on the contrary the <hi>setting</hi> or <hi>darkness</hi> of the <hi>Sun metaphorically</hi> denotes calamity, sorrow and misery, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.9. <hi>Her Sun is gone down while it was yet day. Chald.</hi> their glory is translated in their Life time— that unexpected and most heavy calamities are treated of here, the foregoing and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing verses shew. <hi>Amos</hi> 8.9. <hi>I will cause the Sun to go down at Noon, and I will darken the Earth in a clear day,</hi> that is, I will suddenly overwhelm you with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy strokes and calamities. So <hi>Micah</hi> 3.6. <hi>Joel</hi> 2.10. <hi>and</hi> 3.4. <hi>Esa.</hi> 13.10. On the other side an <hi>Increase</hi> of the Sun and Moons Light, <hi>metaphorically</hi> signifies great spiritual happiness, <hi>Esa.</hi> 30.26. <hi>The light of the Moon shall be as the light of the Sun, and the light of the Sun shall be seven-fold, as the light of seven days,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had said, the help which I will afford you shall be so great and illustrious, that in that time the two luminaries of the World the Sun and Moon (as if they would congratulate the Deliverance of the People) will be more chearful and more shining then they were wont to be. Some refer this to an <hi>Hyperbole.</hi>

                        <p>THere are two principal effects of the Luminaries and ornaments of Heaven, viz. to give light to the World, and distinguish times. In <hi>Metaphors</hi> taken from light we will distinctly treat of <hi>Nouns</hi> and <hi>Verbs,</hi> which are sometimes joyned together.</p>
                        <p>Generally light is taken,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. For Life it self, <hi>Job</hi> 3.20. <hi>Wherefore</hi> (has God) <hi>given light to the miserable,</hi> (so the Hebrew) the explication follows, <hi>and Life to the bitter in soul, ver.</hi> 21. <hi>Which long for Death, but it cometh not.</hi> Hence comes the phrase <hi>to see the Light,</hi> that is, to live, or be born alive, Job 3.16. <hi>To walk in the light of the living,</hi> that is, to act amongst the living, or to live, either a corporal or spiritual Life in God, <hi>Ps.</hi> 56.13. So <hi>David</hi> prays, <hi>Ps.</hi> 13.3. <hi>Lighten mine Eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of Death.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. For any <hi>prosperity</hi> and joy of mind arising from thence, <hi>Esth.</hi> 8.16. <hi>The Jews had light and gladness, and Joy and Honour,</hi> where the synonymous terms make out that it signifies the eminency of the Jews prosperity, and joy for their Divine deliverance, <hi>Job</hi> 29.3. <hi>By his light I walked through darkness,</hi> that is, being free from Calamities I led a happy Life, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. <hi>The light of my countenance they cast not down,</hi> that is, they grieved me not, but studied to please and gratifie me in all things, <hi>Psal.</hi> 97.11. <hi>Light is sown for the Righteous,</hi> the explication follows, <hi>and gladness for the upright in heart.</hi> The word <hi>sowing</hi> is also <hi>emphatical,</hi> as if he had said, 'tis reposited and hidden as seed is in the ground, but in its own time it will certainly come forth. See Esa. 61.11. Col. 3.3, 4. It is sow'n with the seed of the heavenly word, and a most full and bright harvest of this celestial seed will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the Resurrection to eternal Life. So <hi>light</hi> is also taken, Psal. 112.4. Pro. 13.9. Esa. 45.7. and 58.8. and 59.9. The Reason of the comparison in this and the forgoing passage is to be fought in the profitableness, and pleasure of light, Eccl. 11.7. &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. For the <hi>open</hi> and manifest state of things, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.27. <hi>What I tell you in Darkness, that speak ye in the light,</hi> another <hi>Metaphor</hi> of this publication follows, and <hi>what ye hear in the ear, that Preach ye upon the house tops.</hi> The sence is, you are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called by me, that you may Preach publickly to the whole World, what you privately heard from me. So Zeph. 3.5. John 3.21. 1 Cor. 4.5.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. For <hi>Grace,</hi> Benevolence or Favour, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.15. <hi>In the Light of the Kings Countenance is Life,</hi> the exposition follows, <hi>and his favour is as a cloud of the latter Rain.</hi> So tis taken of God as was said in the chapter of an <hi>Anthropopathy.</hi>

                        <p>More especially the mystery of <hi>Regeneration, Renovation,</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently expressed by the <hi>metaphor</hi> of light, and that respecting,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The <hi>Organical cause,</hi> which is the word of God, which is frequently called so, by a Reason deduced from the quality of light, which represents the difference and knowledge of things to the Eyes, Psal. 43.3. Prov. 6.23. Esa. 2.5. —5.20. 2 Cor. 4.6. 1 John 2.8. Thus the Apostles because of their Preaching the word of God are called the <hi>light of the World,</hi> Matth. 5.14. and their light is said <hi>to shine before men,</hi> ver. 16. that is, the light of Doctrine by diligent Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as also the light of a good life and example.</p>

                           <pb n="107" facs="tcp:41512:67"/>2. The <hi>Formal</hi> Cause, which is the saving knowledge of Christ and true Faith manifested by love and good Works, Act, 26.18. Eph. 5.8. 1 Pet. 2.9. 1 John 1.7. Hence believers are called <hi>Sons of light,</hi> Luke 16.8. Eph. 5.8. 1 Thes. 5.5. And good works the <hi>Armour of light,</hi> Rom. 13.12.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The <hi>Final</hi> Cause, and the last scope and effect of Faith, which is life eternal often noted by the term of <hi>Light, Esa.</hi> 60.19, 20, <hi>John</hi> 8.12. <hi>Act.</hi> 26.23. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. &amp;c. From these there may be an easie Judgment made of certain Verbs belonging to light.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Psal.</hi> 13.3. <hi>Lighten mine Eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of Death.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Verbs.</note> He prays for the light of heavenly wisdom from the Word of God, also the light of watchfulness and circumspection, whereby he may avoid the snares of the Adversary. He alludes to humane sleep which easily overcomes those that sit in darkness, or shut their Eyes — whereas if the light shines in our Eyes we can hardly sleep.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.8. <hi>The Commandement of the Lord is pure enlightning the Eyes,</hi> that is, the mind, by giving understanding and knowledge as well of the Divine Will, as of our own corruption, and prudence in the management of affairs, that a man may not belike a brute, which is void of rational intellectuals; <hi>Psal.</hi> 34.6. <hi>They looked on him and were enlightned,</hi> that is, believers were made glad by the Lord by his gracious and saving deliverance, lest they should be dejected and derided by the wicked. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.18, 19. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 8.1. with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Esa.</hi> 60.5. <hi>John</hi> 7.37, 38, 39.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>John</hi> 1.9. <hi>That</hi> (viz. Christ) <hi>was the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh</hi> (or coming) <hi>into the World</hi>— Upon these words <hi>Erasmus</hi> very fairly para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prases. <hi>In this darkness of the World, men eminent for holiness shined, as little Stars in the thick obscurity of night, and as it were through a Cloud shewed some light, but only to the Jews and the adjacent parts. But this true light imparted its splendor not to a single Nation only but to all men, that come into this dark World— He came, that by a Gospel Faith he should shine in and give light to the Hearts of all men in the World— No</hi> Scythian, <hi>no</hi> Jew, <hi>no</hi> Spaniard, <hi>no</hi> Goth, <hi>no</hi> Brittain, <hi>is excluded, neither King nor Servant. There is a sufficiency of light for all, and if they remain in darkness. it is not the lights fault but their own, who perversly love darkness and abhor the light —He shines to all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lest any one should have a pretext of excuse; for if they perish, they do it wilfully and knowingly, as if one would dispute against the Sun-shine at Noon, and will not lift up his Eyes to be confuted,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. There is an eminent description of spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al illumination. See <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.8, 9.</p>
                        <p>To <hi>light</hi> by way of privation is opposed sometimes a [<hi>Shadow,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Shadow.</note>] which is light hindered from a total shining, by the interposition of some body. This <hi>metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> signifies protection and defence against adversaries of any sort, as a shade de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends from the Suns intemperate aed scorching heat, <hi>Esa.</hi> 16.3. —30.2, 3. <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.20. &amp;c. For so 'tis attributed to God as before chap. 8. towards the end.</p>
                        <p>But where the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and Types of the Old Testament are called <hi>Shadows</hi> with respect to <hi>Christ,</hi> Col. 2.17. Heb. 10.1. It is not to be understood that they are <hi>naturally</hi> so, but <hi>artificially</hi> and like a picture, for Painters first draw a <hi>shadow</hi> or or an umbratile kind of delineation, and afterwards perfect their picture with lively colours, the former vanishing out of sight. So it was with the sacrifices and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Ancients, which figured Christ, and ceased when he came— which explication is evident by the opposition of <hi>Shadows,</hi> and the very Image of things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes, <hi>Mists, Fogs,</hi> and <hi>Darkness</hi> are opposed to <hi>light,</hi> which hide the splendor and beauty of things, and hinder men from making, a right distinction separation or definition of objects, begetting disturbance and confusion in the mind, and contain in themselves nothing pleasing or laudable and therefore signifie <hi>evil</hi> in Scripture. But because there is the same Reason of contraries, (which mutually answer each other) we shall be able by the consideration of light, to pass a judgment upon its opposite.</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <pb n="108" facs="tcp:41512:68"/>1. As <hi>light</hi> signifies <hi>Life,</hi> so <hi>darkness</hi> and a <hi>shadow metaphorically</hi> denote <hi>Death; Job</hi> 10.21. <hi>Before I go, whence I shall not return, to the land of darkness, and the shadow of Death: ver.</hi> 22. <hi>A Land of darkness, as the gloominess of the shadow of Death and without order and it shineth as darkness.</hi> This is a <hi>periphrasis</hi> of Death and the Grave. —<hi>Psal.</hi> 88.12. <hi>Shall thy wonders be known in the dark?</hi> See <hi>ver.</hi> 10.11. <hi>and Job</hi> 28.3.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As <hi>light</hi> signifies <hi>Prosperity</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi>; so darkness denotes <hi>evils,</hi> unhappiness and calamity, and consequently that sorrow, mourning, and grief that follows. See <hi>Job</hi> 5.14. —15.22. —17.12. —18.5, 6. <hi>Psal.</hi> 44.19. <hi>and</hi> 88.18. <hi>and</hi> 143.3. <hi>Esa.</hi> 5.30. —47.5. —50.10. —59.9. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 8.21. —13.16. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.2, 6. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 32.8. <hi>Joel</hi> 2.2. —3.4. <hi>Amos</hi> 5.18. <hi>Micah</hi> 7.8. <hi>Nahum.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.15. &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. As <hi>light</hi> is put for that which is <hi>manifest</hi> and apparent, so <hi>darkness</hi> is put for that which is <hi>hidden,</hi> secret and unknown, <hi>Job</hi> 12.22. Eccl. 6.4. <hi>Esa.</hi> 45.19. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.27. See <hi>John</hi> 3.20, 21. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.11, 12.13.

And what will happen then?) But together with it, that night comes, which is more dark and terrible.

Some think that the Prophet derides the vanity of the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Astrologers. Others thus, the morning or day break gives an indication of the Suns coming, so this evil that was to come upon <hi>Babylon</hi> was not without its marks and tokens that went before it, which were as illustrious as the dawn that ushers in or harbingers the day.

A <hi>Womb</hi> is attributed to the <hi>morning,</hi> because of the mystery of God in his spiritual begetting of his Children— The unfolding of this <hi>Trope</hi> is thus, as the Dew by a wonderful and invisible way, as it were, <hi>born</hi> of the <hi>Womb</hi> of the morning, that is, it plentifully falls at that time, without any help or assistance of man, <hi>Job</hi> 38.28.

Who have no Morning &amp;c.</note>The other place is Esa. 8.20. where the <hi>morning</hi> is put for the grace of God, and that comfort and peace of spirit which flows from it, the words in Hebrew are, <hi>because there is no morning in him</hi>— But Interpreters do not agree whether this is to be understood of men, or the perverse Doctrines of such as consulted them that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to foretell things to come, by a devilish or familiar Spirit. If it be referred to <hi>men,</hi> it bears this sence— <hi>To the Law and to the Testimony</hi>: If they speak not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this word, they shall have no morning that is true light. This is true in it self, but the letter of the text is not altogether conformable to it, for it is not in the plural to them, but in the singular to <hi>him</hi> (or <hi>it.</hi>) But others expound this text better thus— <note n="*" place="margin">Note that this explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew text which is word for word as here English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> [<hi>To the Law and the Testimony</hi>] that is, recourse must be had, thither for the Law and Testimony must be consulted according to the Will of God, [<hi>otherwise</hi>] (that is, if they do not speak the truth of Divine Grace there) [<hi>let them speak,</hi>] an <hi>Ironical</hi> concession joyned with indignation: <hi>let them speak,</hi> because they will not do otherwise, though seriously and frequently admonished, <hi>let them speak</hi> (I say) <hi>according to this word,</hi> (viz.) <hi>in which there is no morning</hi>] that is, no light of Divine Grace or Comfort, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>And let him pass through it</hi> (the Earth) <hi>hardly bestead and hungry</hi> (the singular for the plural) <hi>and it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their King and their God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Now whereas the Prophet calls this speech of that wicked People, (viz. that they were to seek Councel of them that had familiar Spirits, &amp;c. and not of the Law and Testimony) a word without a <hi>morning,</hi> or void of the light of divine Grace and Consolation, it certainly follows according to the intention of the Prophet, that that morning of Grace and Comfort is to be found in that word of the Law and Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny alone, with sure and safe counsel in Tribulations and Afflictions, which to distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed minds is like the <hi>morning</hi> sweetness, or the pleasure of a lovely day-spring. Such as neglect or reject this Word, walk in darkness, and are involved in errors, and perish everlastingly. The other Interpretation in substance agrees with this.</p>
                        <p>[<hi>Noon</hi>] is taken for things most <hi>evident, Deut.</hi> 28.29. The Latines have a Proverb, <hi>meridiana lux,</hi> Noon light, which is put for a most clear and evident thing. There is a comparison with the Noon time, when there is mention made of the light and splendor of felicity, <hi>Job</hi> 11.17. <hi>And</hi> (thy) <hi>time shall arise above the Noon day,</hi> (so the Hebrew) that is, thy most illustrious Glory shall shine all round or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thee. See <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.6.</p>
                        <p>The [<hi>Evening</hi>] is elegantly opposed to the [<hi>Morning,</hi>] when the speech is of the vicissitude of Calamities and Comforts which God observes in Believers, <hi>Psal.</hi> 30 5. <hi>Weeping may endure for a night</hi> (or as the Hebrew, <hi>may lodge for an Evening</hi>) but joy (cometh) in the Morning: that is, the Godly are compelled to weep in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Cross and Sufferings, but the most joyful morning and light of Divine help will come again. See <hi>John</hi> 16.20, 22. <hi>Psal.</hi> 126.5, 6. So the word <hi>Vesperascens</hi> drawing towards an Evening, is used for ceasing, <hi>Esa.</hi> 24.11. The <hi>Sun-setting</hi> in the Evening leaves the darkness of night to succeed it, so when joy ceases it leaves Calamity and Mourning.</p>

                        <p>Sometimes the <hi>Night</hi> signifies the Reign or Dominion of Impiety and Hell, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.12. But what we find, 1 Thes. 5 7.

There if we would not be oppressed, let us not sleep as others do who have not known the light of</hi> Christ: <hi>But let us be watchful and sober, having always a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect mind, that we admit not any thing through incogitancy, which may prove offensive to the Eyes of God or men. For as such as sleep a natural sleep, do it by night, and such as be drunk with wine, are usually so in the night; so they that sleep in sin, are involved in darkness of mind, and such as are drunk with carnal desires and delights</hi> (so called) <hi>are entangled in the mists of a dark mind.

                        <p n="2">2. [<hi>Fire</hi>] also denotes the Word of the Gospel of Christ published among the Gentiles, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.49. In treating of this we must have respect to the <hi>vertue</hi> and efficacy of Fire— as well to its <hi>shining</hi> and enlightning quality (wherein it agrees with what we said about light which betokens conversion and the mystery of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) as also its <hi>kindling</hi> quality, for the Word of <hi>Christ</hi> kindles the Love of God, Holiness, and heavenly desires in the Hearts of men, to which is referred <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.9. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.32. And the appearance of the Holy Spirit in the likeness of Fire, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.3. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.11. And lastly its consuming and destroying quality— For the Word of Christ shall consume all its adversaries, Judge, Condemn, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy them, <hi>John</hi> 12.48. To which may be reduced, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.14. and 23.29. To this Divine Fire, there seems to be another strange Fire opposed (as in the <hi>Type, Lev.</hi> 10.1.) viz. of false Doctrine and humane Traditions, <hi>Esa.</hi> 50.11. Behold all ye that kindle a Fire, that compass your selves about with sparks; walk in the light of your Fire, and in the sparks that ye have kindled, &amp;c. <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Tremellius</hi> upon the place say— That Christ in this place convinces the proud Spirit of the Pharisees, and almost the whole Jewish Church of impiety, because in their spiritual darkness they went about to kindle lights for themselves, neglecting the light of Gods Word, and that Gospel illumination which Christ offered them, &amp;c. They esteemed that a profitable Fire and light, which really brought the Fire of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wrath and Eternal Damnation upon them.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Because of its <hi>burning</hi> quality Fire is attributed to them who bring perdition, hurt, loss, or utter destruction; hence Fire is said to be before God the just Judge, and avenger of his Enemies, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.3. and 97.3. <hi>Esa.</hi> 26.11. and 29.6. and 30.33. and 66.15, 16, 24. 2 Thes. 1.7, 8.

                        <p>Hither must be referred those places where by the term (<hi>Fire</hi>) we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand invading Enemies and desolating Wars, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.63. <hi>Esa.</hi> 42.25. <hi>Jer.</hi> 48.45. <hi>and</hi> 50.32. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21.32. <hi>and</hi> 30.8 (in which place the <hi>Chaldee</hi> for <hi>Fire,</hi> puts <hi>a people strong like fire) Amos</hi> 1.4, 7, 10, 12, 14. <hi>and</hi> 2.2, 5. Some think there may be a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> because Wars for the most part are managed by Fire and Flame.</p>
                        <p>It is also attributed to other things, by means of which terror, hurt, and death are brought upon any, as <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.15, 20. <hi>Esa.</hi> 33.11, 12. <hi>Obad. ver.</hi> 18. <hi>James</hi> 3.5, 6. <hi>Jude ver.</hi> 23.

                        <p n="4">4.

So every man that would avoid sin, (or offences) and Hell-fire, the consequence of it (as appears by the foregoing verses, which have a co-herence with this) must be salted with a certain wholesome Fire, that is, seasoned by Crosses and Afflictions: Or, this Fire will have the same efficacy on him, as salt has on flesh, <hi>viz.</hi> to preserve him from the putrefaction of security in sin. Elegantly therefore is salting attribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Fire, and both are joyned to denote the Mystery of the Cross: Because there is an agreement betwixt those two, both causing pain, and both abstracting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming that which is corrupt or putrifyed; as also because they were joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in sacrifices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41512:71"/>
For between him (who was a Candle lighted by the Divine Wisdom) and Christ, the true light of the World there is a manifest difference put, <hi>John</hi> 1.8, 9. To this Notion, that passage which our Saviour inculcates, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.35. is very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, viz. <hi>Let your Loyns be girded about, and your Candles</hi> (so the Greek) <hi>burning,</hi> by which phrase the serious study of Watchfulness and Holiness is commanded, in pursuance to Gods prescriptions.</p>
                        <p>[<hi>Burning Coals</hi>] sometimes denote Calamities, and grievous punishments, <hi>Psal.</hi> 140.10. See <hi>Esa.</hi> 47.14. Sometimes they signifie <hi>Lightning, Psal.</hi> 18.8. An only Son is called a <hi>Coal,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.7. Because as Coals raked up in ashes are (as it were) a seed of Fire, so that one Son would be a means to propagate a posterity and continue a Family, so that it should not be wholly extinguished, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.21. <hi>and Rom.</hi> 12.20. It is said that when we do good to an Enemy we <hi>heap Coals of Fire upon his head,</hi> that is, it will aggravate that guilt which shall bring severer ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon him because of his causeless and ungrateful malice to such as do him good.</p>
                        <p>A [<hi>Coal</hi>] is put for the Plague or any disease, that is, fiery and inflamed like a burning Coals, Deut. 32.24. Hab. 35. For <hi>Arrows</hi> which grow hot by motion, and pierce like Fire, <hi>Psal</hi> 76.3. For <hi>Lightnings</hi> which burn like Coals, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.48. And for <hi>Love</hi> thats very fervent, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.6.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A [Fire-brand]</hi> (or burning wood taken out of the Fire that it should burn no longer) sometimes denotes contempt, because of the privation of Fire and light) as <hi>Esa.</hi> 7.4. <hi>Let not thy heart be tender</hi> (or faint) <hi>for the two tails of these smoking Fire-brands</hi>; as if he had said they are like Firebrands, which (when extinguisht) smoke but cannot burn. Neither are they barely called <hi>Fire-brands,</hi> but the <hi>tails of Fire-brands,</hi> as if he had said, they are like brands that are consum'd even to the very ends or extreams, which have nothing but smoke the remains of Fire, which shall speedily cease. So it is with Tyrants who oppose Christ and his Gospel, who seem like great Fires to us that in a moment would consume all; but to God and Faith, they are as the tails of smoking Fire-brands, who for all their threatning will in a miserable manner at length be destroyed. Yet <hi>Jerome</hi> in his Comment upon this place gives another Reason why the term <hi>tail</hi> (which is the extremest member or part of a Beast) is attributed to these two Kings; <hi>viz.</hi> that in them should be ended the Kingdom of <hi>Syria,</hi> that is, <hi>Damascus,</hi> and the Kingdom of <hi>Samaria,</hi> that is, of the ten Tribes which by another Name were called <hi>Ephraim,</hi> according to what is related 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.29. —16.7, 8, 9. —17.5. and the following verses.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes it denotes divine <hi>deliverance</hi> from evil, as it were from Fire, <hi>Zach.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Is not this a Brand pluckt out of the Fire?</hi> He speaks of <hi>Joshua</hi> the High Priest, who by the Favour and Grace of God was delivered from the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity, came to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> restored the Temple, and exercised the Priesthood. See <hi>Amos</hi> 4.11. <hi>Jude ver.</hi> 23. &amp;c. <hi>Job</hi> 12.5. <hi>Esa.</hi> 42.3.</p>
                        <p>[<hi>Smoke</hi>] The excrement of Fire, and a sign of it is <hi>metaphorically</hi> put for punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inflicted by God, and Calamities, <hi>Esa.</hi> 14.31. <hi>There shall come from the North a smoke</hi>— the <hi>Chald.</hi> renders it vengeance, Revenge— some understand this speech of <hi>

But <hi>Jerome</hi> in his Comment upon the place by smoke understands the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Assyria,</hi> who amongst other Nations destroyed the <hi>Philistines,</hi> and he quotes, <hi>Jer.</hi> 47.2.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Smoke</hi> is used to signifie any Enemy, because it is very swift in invading, very pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating and searching, and can by none be resisted, and being a certain token of Fire —So the <hi>Fire</hi> of Gods Wrath once kindled smokes after the same manner. See <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.20. <hi>Esa.</hi> 65.5. —34.10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.11. <hi>Joel</hi> 3.3. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.19.

                        <p>Some <hi>Verbs</hi> belong to this head <hi>as to be hot,</hi> which is an effect of Anger, which (as <hi>Fire</hi>) inflames the heart, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.6. <hi>Psal.</hi> 39.5. <hi>and</hi> 57.4. The Anger of a Godly man, proceeding from an holy zeal against sin is said <hi>to burn,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29. The like is said of lustful and depraved affections, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9.

                        <p>[<hi>Clouds</hi>] because of their Diverse attributes, have also different metaphorical no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Calamities</hi> and Ruine, because men are deprived of the light and spendor of the Sun and Firmament by them, and Cloudy days make men dull and Melancholy, <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.1. <hi>How hath the Lord covered the Daughter of Sion with a Cloud in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>? Some think that by a tacit <hi>Antithesis,</hi> allusion is made to the Cloud of Glory which first appeared in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> at the Dedication of the Temple, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.10. to which this Cloud and Fog of present Calamity is plainly contrary. Hence a day of Clouds, or a cloudy day, is put for times of calamity, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 30.3. <hi>and</hi> 34.12. <hi>Joel</hi> 2.2. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.15. By which <hi>metaphor</hi> the Poet said, <hi>Tempora si fuerint nubila, solus eris,</hi> that is, if times be Cloudy, thou shalt be alone; because seeming Friends will then forsake the distressed.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Because of the <hi>Number</hi> and multitude of the <hi>Clouds,</hi> for in tempestuous weather a great plenty of thick Clouds appear, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. <hi>VVherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a Cloud of Witnesses,</hi> &amp;c. that is, so numerous a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Witnesses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which are like a thick Cloud. He speaks of those Holy men of God mentioned particularly, chap. 11. who by their own example are Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that we are justifyed, and please God by Faith. Clouds are likewise used in Comparison, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Behold he shall come as Clouds</hi>; that is, his Army will make a vast appearance. The <hi>targum,</hi> says, as a Cloud which comes up and covers the Earth. See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38.9. In the same sense the <hi>Chaldee</hi> interprets that passage, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 30.18. <hi>A Cloud shall cover her,</hi> (viz. Egypt) thus it renders it— A King with his Hosts shall cover her, as a Cloud which comes up and covers the Earth: This may be also referred to the first signification: For by Clouds and darkness calamity is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted, whence it is said before at <hi>Tehaphnehes also the day shall be restrained,</hi> that is, his light.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Because of their <hi>vanity</hi> and <hi>inconstancy,</hi> as some Clouds seem to promise Rain, but being chased away by the Wind, give none, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.17. These are— <hi>Clouds that are carryed away with a tempest.</hi> He speaks of False-Teachers, who fluctuate or are uncertain in their Preachings and Confessions, not affording the Rain of saving Doctrine and Consolation, <hi>Jude</hi> ver. 12. Such are called <hi>Clouds without Water</hi>: The Apostle therefore has respect to those Clouds which seem to us to be Rainy, but are condensed exhalations without water, as <hi>chap.</hi> 4. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. before: For False-teachers seem to be Orthodox to many, &amp;c.

Their <hi>Celerity</hi> or <hi>Swiftness,</hi> because we see the Clouds to be carryed under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with very quick speed, as if they did fly, being hurryed on by the impetuosity of the Wind, <hi>Esa.</hi> 19.1. <hi>Behold the Lord rideth upon a swift Cloud, and shall come into Egypt,</hi> that is, he will speedily and unexpectedly punish the <hi>Egyptians</hi> as if he did fly upon the Clouds. See <hi>Esa.</hi> 60.8. <hi>Psal.</hi> 104.3. <hi>Nahum.</hi> 1.3.

                        </p>
                        <p>First, Their <hi>Plenty,</hi> Multitude, and Depth, in which respect they are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times prejudicial and hurtful.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Their Profit and Usefulness. So that the metaphors deduced from Water signifie sometimes good, and sometimes hurt or evil.</p>
                        <p>In the latter sence, (1.) It signifies a strong and numerous People, especially such as invade a Country in an hostile manner, ravaging and spoiling it, <hi>Esa.</hi> 8.7. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Lord bringeth up upon them the Waters of the River strong and many.</hi> The <hi>Chald. An host of many people like a rapid and strong River</hi>— The interpretation fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>even the King of Assyria and all his power</hi>— The Allegory is continued, <hi>And he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks,</hi> ver. 8. <hi>And he shall pass through all Judah, he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach even to the neck.</hi> that is, the King of <hi>Assyria</hi> with his numerous Armies, like swelling and strong wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters shall over-run and destroy all; first the land of <hi>Israel,</hi> and afterwards the Land of <hi>Judah,</hi> in which those waters are said to overflow even to the Neck; that is, even to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> wherein was the head of the Kingdom, by a <hi>Prosopopoeia,</hi> whereby a Kingdom is compared to a humane body, &amp;c. <hi>Jer.</hi> 47.2. Thus saith the Lord, <hi>Behold waters shall arise up out of the North, and shall be an overflowing flood, and shall overflow the Land and the fulness thereof. Chald.</hi> Behold a people shall come from the North, and shall be as a strong flood, and shall prey upon the Earth. The Hosts of the <hi>Babylonians</hi> are meant. See <hi>Esa.</hi> 17.12, 13. <hi>Ezek</hi> 26.3, 19. Where an Hostile people are expresly compared with <hi>Water.</hi> Also <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.1, 15. The Vision of a <hi>multitude of waters</hi> signifies <hi>many people.</hi>

                        <p>We are also to note, that the most bitter and exquisite passions of our Saviour are <hi>metaphorically</hi> compared to Deep and overflowing Waters, Psal. 69.2, 3, 14, 15. See Psal. 40.2. See also Psal. 73.10. Some by the Waters of a full Cup would have the same thing understood; but the usual exposition is, that it rather gives a description of the wicked, who enjoy Prosperity and Plenty. And this leads us to the acceptation of <hi>water</hi> wherein it signifies <hi>good,</hi> in which as in the foregoing particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar we must consider it,

                        <p n="1">(1.) Water <hi>metaphorically</hi> signifies <hi>posterity,</hi> which is propagated from its own stock or head, as water flows from a Fountain, <hi>Num.</hi> 24, 7. <hi>He shall pour the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of his Buckets,</hi> that is, God shall so bless the people of <hi>Israel</hi> (represented by
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41512:74"/>
                           <hi>Jacob</hi>) that they shall have a numerous off-spring, and increase into a great posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty— Another <hi>metaphor</hi> taken from water follows— And his Seed shall be in many waters, which the <hi>Chaldee</hi> expounds of peoples (according to the above signicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) thus he paraphrases, a King shall spring up who shall be magnifyed by his Sons, and he shall rule over many people. But <hi>R. Salomo</hi> says, that this signifies prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as Seed (increases best) that's sown besides the waters.</p>
                        <p>To this sence we are to refer, <hi>Esa.</hi> 48.1. <hi>Hear ye this O house of Jacob? called by the Name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah,</hi> that is, such as are descended of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> as from a Fountain; as <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.28. <hi>and Psal.</hi> 68.26.</p>
                        <p n="2">(2.) By the <hi>metaphor</hi> of waters the blessings of God and our Saviour are often not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as in the chapter of an <hi>Anthropopathy.</hi>

                        <p n="2">2. [<hi>The Subjects,</hi>] or things containing Waters are various. The chief is the [<hi>Sea,</hi>] which for the plenty of waters,<note place="margin">The Sea.</note> the violence or impetuosity of its VVaves and Storms, <hi>metaphorically</hi> denotes a multitude of Enemies, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.4. <hi>The Sea is come up upon Babylon: She is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof. Chald.</hi> The King with his numerous Hosts in plenty like the Sea came up against <hi>Babylon</hi>— So it is to be understood, <hi>Psal.</hi> 65.7. <hi>and</hi> 89.9. <hi>and</hi> 93.3, 4. See also <hi>Esa.</hi> 17.12, 13. <hi>and</hi> 57.20. <hi>Jer.</hi> 6, 23. <hi>and</hi> 50.42. Where there is an expresse comparison.</p>
                        <p>When our <hi>iniquities</hi> are said <hi>to be cast into the depths of the Sea, Micah</hi> 7.19. It signifies a total remission and utter oblivion of them.</p>
                        <p>[<hi>Waves</hi>] of the Sea denote Calamities and Punishments, because they rush upon us and are noxious, as the Waves are troublesome to Ships and Seamen, <hi>Psal.</hi> 42.7. <hi>and</hi> 88.7.

And the Prophet says that <hi>Christ</hi> should drink [in the way] by which the course of this Earthly Life is signified, which is called the <hi>day of the Flesh, Heb.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Elias</hi> when banished and persecuted, and dwelling in a Desart drank of the Brook by the Command of God, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.4.6.

                        <p>Sometimes a <hi>Stream</hi> or <hi>Brook</hi> is taken <hi>metaphorically</hi> in a good sence, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the abundance of VVaters, which are transferred to plenty of good things, <hi>Job</hi> 20.17. By the <hi>brooks</hi> of <hi>Honey</hi> and <hi>Butter</hi> (to which Rivers and Floods are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) is signifyed a confluence of prosperous, pleasant, and desireable things, even to full satisfaction, <hi>Psal.</hi> 36.8. <hi>God is said to make Believers drink of the Rivers</hi> (or Brooks) <hi>of his pleasures,</hi> that is, to bestow a plenty of blessed, sweet, and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good upon them, which is that life and overplus (or more than abundance) which Christ promised to his Sheep, <hi>John</hi> 10.10.</p>

                        <p>Or else the Reason of their being taken in a good sence is because in dry and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watered Countries, the inundation of <hi>Brooks</hi> are very seasonable and profitable, <hi>Esa.</hi> 35.6. <hi>In the wilderness waters shall break out, and streams in the Desart.</hi> He adds ver. 7. <hi>And the parched ground shall become a Pool and the thirsty Land-springs of water.</hi> This is a <hi>metaphorical</hi> description of the blessings of Christs Kingdom, and with respect to their sweetness and abundance.</p>
                        <p>A [<hi>River</hi>] if taken in an evil sence, signifies the frequent irruptions and invasions of Enemies, <hi>Esa.</hi> 18.2. <hi>A Nation whose Land the Rivers have spoiled.</hi> Here is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine vengeance foretold upon the wicked <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> by armed Enemies, who (like mighty currents which none can resist) were to overwhelm their Land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Some take this properly because there are frequent inundations in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> a Country full of Rivers— Others <hi>Metonymically</hi> understand it of Enemies, who by the Rivers would invade the Country, as the <hi>Turks</hi> often do <hi>Hungary</hi> upon the River <hi>Danubius.</hi> See <hi>Esa.</hi> 8.7.</p>
                        <p>If it be taken in a good sence, it denotes the favour and blessing of God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 46.4. <hi>There is a River; the streams whereof shall make glad the City of God.</hi> The Holy habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which God placed in that City, is intimated to be like a most sweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant River, whose Rivulets or Streams exhilarate and rejoyce in the whole City; and therefore it is added, <hi>The holy of the Tabernacles of the most High.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>By <hi>[River] Jehovah</hi> himself (by his Grace and protection inhabiting there) may aptly be understood; and his streams are the special blessings or benefits we receive from his Divine protection, which flow from his Grace as Rivulets from a River. Neither would it be any error, if it should be referred to the <hi>Word of God,</hi> for where that is purely taught and flourishes, God himself cannot but be graciously pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent there, &amp;c.</p>

                           <hi>Esa.</hi> 41.18. <hi>I will open Rivers in High Places, and Fountains in the midst of the Vallies, I will make the wilderness a Pool of water, and the dry Land-springs of water.</hi> This is a <hi>metaphorical</hi> description of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Christ. <hi>Brentius</hi> upon the place: By this <hi>metaphor</hi> of the Desert waters, Fountains and Trees (ver. 19.) is understood; That God was to give the Gentiles, who are called by the name of dry ground and Desert, a most large and capacious Fountain, that is, the Preaching of his VVord in great plenty, that they that are thirsty may drink of the Fountain, that is, Christ and Eternal blessedness.</p>

And although there be a great unlikeness between the Kings of</hi> Judah, <hi>one being more merciful, more clement, and more godly then another, yet they were tolerable Kings, neither were they hitherto over grievous to the people, but behav'd themselves in the administration of the Government modestly and temperately. Yet the common people in Cities and Country desirous of novelty, would rather have strange Kings, though Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss, then the poor Family of</hi> David <hi>which was ordained by God himself to rule that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> &amp;c. It appears in that VVar, that some would willingly be disingaged from danger, and others resolved to repell it any way, but the Commonalty especially the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Juda</hi> would have the Family of <hi>David</hi> dethron'd, and that the King of <hi>Israel</hi> or the King of <hi>Syria</hi> should Rule, &amp;c.

                        <p>IN the <hi>Globe</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> two things are to be considered, which afford as many <hi>metaphorical</hi> acceptations.</p>
                        <p n="1">(1.) That it is <hi>opposite</hi> to Heaven with respect to quantity and qualities. Hence as <hi>Heaven</hi> denotes the spiritual Kingdom of God, and the state of eternal felicity; so on the contrary the <hi>Earth</hi> denotes the state of Corruption and Sin in which man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fall was involved, John 3.31. <gap reason="foreign">

The first phrase [<hi>of the Earth</hi>] is properly taken and denotes an Earthly original, that is, to be begotten by a natural man in a natural way (to which is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed that Christ is <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>come from above and from heaven.</hi> See 1 Cor. 15.47.)</p>
                        <p>The second phrase <hi>[of the Earth] metaphorically</hi> taken, is to be carnally wise, ignorant of Divine things, lost in sin, and an absolute stranger to heaven and the spiritual Kingdom of God, which elsewhere is phras'd, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <p>The last phrase [<hi>to speak of the Earth</hi>] is conformable to the first and is to speak those things which are contrary to the Kingdom of God, erroneous and lying. See 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.3, 5. (To which is opposed that Christ testifies that which he saw and heard, and speaks the words of God, which whosoever receives, he Seals or Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses that God is true) the like opposition Christ uses speaking to the carnal Jews, <hi>John</hi> 8.23.</p>

Because the Earth affords men <hi>Houses</hi> and convenient <hi>Habitations,</hi> in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect Eternal Life, and the heaven of the blessed is called a <hi>new Earth</hi> or <hi>Land, Esa.</hi> 65.17.22. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.1.

But others think, that by the vast circuit and thickness of its Walls it rise like a Mountain; for <hi>Herodotus, Strabo, Pliny,</hi> and <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> affirm that the Walls of <hi>Babylon</hi> were 50 Cubits thick and 200 Royal Cubits high. And that which is added in the same place, that <hi>Babylon should be made a burning Mountain,</hi> is to be understood of the rubbish and ruinous heap which was left like a Mountain after the burning of that great City. —<hi>Hab.</hi> 3.6. <hi>The Everlasting Mountains were scatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the perpetual Hills did bow,</hi> that is, the Kingdoms of the peoples were sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly shaken and overthrown: He speaks of the blessing of God, which expelled the <hi>Canaanites</hi> and distributed their Lands to his people by his Ministers <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Joshua.</hi> See <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.14. &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>More especially there is mention of <hi>Bashan, Psal.</hi> 68.15. which was a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous Country, famous for excellent pasture, the Beasts that fed there being very fat, strong, and great— hence the <hi>Bulls, Rams,</hi> or <hi>Heifers</hi> of <hi>Bashan</hi> are <hi>metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically</hi> put for fat, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.14. which is also transferr'd to <hi>Men, Psal.</hi> 22.12. <hi>Strong</hi> (Bulls) <hi>of Bashan have beset me round,</hi> that is, the Enemies of Christ who were strong and fierce, &amp;c.

                        <p>[<hi>Hill</hi>] if added to <hi>Mountains</hi> is sometimes taken <hi>metaphorically</hi> in the sence given before. Some by <hi>Everlasting Hills, Gen.</hi> 49.26.

                        <p>It is said <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.3.

                        <p>From [<hi>Quarries</hi>] of stone an elegant <hi>Metaphor</hi> is taken, <hi>Esa.</hi> 51.1. <hi>Look into the Rock whence ye are hewen, and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged.</hi> He speaks of the Godly <hi>Israelites</hi> sprung from <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> as <hi>ver.</hi> 2. The Reason of this metaphorical phrase <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Tremellius</hi> fairly deduce from the Argument of this chapter— <hi>Thus Christ argues, I promise that I will comfort and restore the Church, although it be wasted and almost nothing, ver.</hi> 3. <hi>and that you may the easilier beleive this, remember that you are come of Parents, that had never begot Children, if God by his powerful Word (as a hammer break Stones out of a Rock,) had not done it: And therefore you who are in the same Covenant, are to experience the same vertue and power of God.</hi> See Ezek. 4.1. Exod. 24.10. Prov. 17.8.23.</p>
                        <p>More specially there is a <hi>metaphorical</hi> mention of <hi>gems</hi> in the description of the Glory and the inward splendor of the Church of Christ, <hi>Esa.</hi> 54.11. <hi>Behold I will lay thy Stones with fair colours, and lay thy Foundations with Saphires</hi>— And <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>I will make thy Windows of Chrystal, and thy gates of Carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant Stones</hi>— that this relates to the New Testament times, appears by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>And all thy Children shall be taught of the Lord,</hi> which words, John 6.44, 45. are cited by Christ, application being made to his Church.

For as Salt applyed to meat consumes the depraved or corrupt humors, and so preserves from putrefaction; so the Ministers of the Gospel by sound Doctrines, and by a prudent application of legal reprehension preserve men from being putrified in sin, and are instruments to make them savoury, that is, that they may please God, and so obtain (through his mercy in Christ) eternal blessedness.</p>

But that sown in the good ground, are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the Word, keep it, and bring forth with patience.

                        <p>When the Verb [<hi>To Sow</hi>] is attributed to God,<note place="margin">To Sow.</note> it denotes a multiplication of blessings to men, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.27. <hi>Hos.</hi> 2.25.

                        <p>When attributed to <hi>men,</hi> it signifies such things as are done in our life time, from which good or evil is to be expected.

                           <hi>To be Rooted</hi> is spoke of the Mystery of our Regeneration, and a corroboration or strengthning in Faith and Piety is signifyed thereby, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.7.

                        <p>A [<hi>Vine</hi>] sometimes signifies good, sometimes evil. Examples of the former are to be read, Psal. 80.9. &amp;c. Esa. 5.2, 7. Jer. 2.21. Where the People of <hi>Israel</hi> introduced into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> received as the people of God that they may serve him constantly in Righteousness and Piety, is understood. But this becomes degenerate, offending God with foul Idolatry and impiety; all which by the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor of a <hi>Vine,</hi> well planted, but much corrupted, is expressed in the two last places.</p>
                        <p>It is taken in an <hi>Ill sence,</hi> Deut. 32.32, 33. where mention is made of a <hi>Vine, Grapes, Clusters,</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> expressing the cruel and abominable wickedness of sinners.</p>
                        <p>Expositors are not agreed in what sence to take a Vine, <hi>Hosea</hi> 10.1. But the most proper interpretation seems to be this <note n="*" place="margin">

                        <p>[<hi>Wine and New Wine</hi>] signifie as well the effects of divine Mercy and Grace, as of Wrath and Vengeance. Examples of the former are to be read, Prov. 9.5. Cant. 2.4.

In which places by the Metaphor of Wine, the blessings or benefits of the Kingdom of Christ are expressed; which are Righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.

See Jer. 6.9. In that <hi>symbolical</hi> Vision, the Vineyard denotes the Judgement of God against the Churches enemies, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.18.19. The reason of this Metaphor is, because in a Vintage or Wine Harvest the Vineyard together with its fruit is stripped of all, and left as it were desolate. Hence it is that little <hi>gleanings (small clusters</hi> remaining on the Vine,<note place="margin">Glean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</note> after the Vintage is over, because hid behind the leave) denote a small remnant of people after war or other publique calamity.

Lam. 3.52. and 4.18. Ezek. 13.18, 20. Micah 7.2.

Therefore when <hi>Nimrod</hi> is said to be a <hi>Mighty Hunter,</hi> it is to be interpreted a VVarriour, which appears from the Text it self, for it is applyed in this place to the principal Cities of that Kingdom, which may not be properly said of a <hi>Hunter,</hi> but of a King or General of an host, who built strong Cities when he subdued the Countries. The <hi>Chaldee</hi> plainly renders it, <hi>a strong Hero. Aben Ezra</hi> takes it properly of the Hunting of Beasts which <hi>Nimrod</hi> offered in sacrifices to the Lord, from the phrase be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord. But <hi>Mercer</hi> notes, that all the Hebrews esteemed <hi>Nimrod</hi> as a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and that <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> should be rebuk't for that he alone would justifie an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious man. But more rightly the phrase [<hi>before the Lord</hi>] is to be understood, to denote an aggravation of his Tyranny, because he did not act obscurely or privately, but openly and in the face of the Sun, imposing his Government without respect to men, or dread of the all seeing Divinity. See Gen. 6.11. and 13.13. &amp;c. Lastly it is to be observed that 1 Chron. 1.10.<note place="margin">

                           <hi>Nimrod</hi> is said plainly to be <hi>Mighty</hi> upon the Earth, which is by any means to be understood of his Rule over men.</p>
                        <p>The Term [<hi>Hunting</hi>] is attributed to God, when he requites the persecutors of the Godly, with those punishments they designed or inflicted upon others, <hi>Psal.</hi> 140.11. <hi>The man of Tongue</hi> (that is one that Curses or Blasphemes) <hi>shall not be established in the Earth, he</hi> (viz.

                        <p n="1">(1.) As a <hi>Wolf</hi> is apt and willing to execute mischief against Man and Beast; so the <hi>Devil</hi> is the common Enemy of mankind.</p>
                        <p n="2">(2) As the <hi>Wolf</hi> is greedy and unsatiable; so the cruelty and rapacity of the Devil is not to be satisfied.</p>
                        <p n="3">(3.) As the <hi>Wolf</hi> is so sharp sighted, that he can see even in the darkest night, and when hungry, smell his Prey at the distance of half a <hi>German</hi> mile, (that is, an <hi>English</hi> mile and half;) so the <hi>Devil</hi> by long experience and use is become still more wicked and cruel; and well vers'd in the scent of his prey, that is, of such as are apt to be tempted to sin.</p>
                        <p n="4">(4.) As <hi>Wolves</hi> sometimes devour whole Sheep, sometimes only the Flesh; so the Devil sometimes hurts the corporal faculties, sometimes destroys Life, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (when God permits) health; and sometimes hurryes the wicked soul and body to destruction.</p>
                        <p n="5">(5.) As the <hi>Wolf</hi> is most crafty; so the <hi>Devil</hi> wholly consists of deceit. The <hi>Wolf</hi> invades the flock in a dark or cloudy time, the better to make his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches undiscovered: So the <hi>Devil</hi> sets upon men commonly in times of Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and Affliction, that by the advantage of their troubles, he may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter exercise his tempting power. The <hi>Wolf</hi> uses baits and stratagems to allure a <hi>Herd</hi> to come within the danger of his Fellows, inticing Goats, with green boughs, and playing with young Pigs, casting them with his Tail, making them run along, till he seduces them to the Ambush; so the <hi>Devil</hi> presents false pleasures to bewitch the senses of men, till they fall headlong into his snare. The <hi>Wolf</hi> uses much Policy when he sets upon <hi>Bulls</hi> and Horned Beasts, and assaults them behind, where they are unprovided for defence; so the <hi>Devil</hi> has peculiar slights and devices to intrap the strongest and more experienced Christians, seeming to retreat when he cannot prevail, but quickly returning (when he thinks they are secure) with a new strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:41512:90"/>
to undo them. (6.) It is said of a <hi>Wolf</hi> that if he first sees a man, the man loses his voice and cannot cry out: So the <hi>Devil</hi> when he has set upon an unwary man that fear'd no danger, and resisted not, makes an easie conquest and triumph.</p>
                        <p n="7">(7.) But if a man sees a <hi>Wolf</hi> first, the Beast loses both voice and courage: So Godly Men, who fear devilish Temptations, and prepare themselves for resistance, can easily by Prayer and Divine cryes put that malignant Enemy to flight.</p>
                        <p n="8">(8.) The <hi>Wolf</hi> mightily dreads Fire and—Swords: So the <hi>Devil</hi> fears the light of Gods word and Prayer, &amp;c. which are the Churches weapons. Hence <hi>Chrysostom</hi> said, that <hi>Swords are not so terrible to Wolves, as the prayers of the godly are to the Devil.</hi>

                        <p n="1">1. As <hi>Wolves</hi> are said to take away a mans voice: So false Teachers take away the purity of the heavenly Doctrine and Worship of God.</p>

                        <p n="3">3. As the <hi>Wolf</hi> is most crafty, and silently approaches the Sheepfold to know whether the Dogs be asleep, or the Shepherd wanting, or whether they are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and negligent, and so watches a fit occasion to destroy the flock, and suck their blood: So Hereticks before they propose their manifest and apparent errors, slily insinuate themselves into the good opinion of men, and with wretched hypocrisie and sophistry counterfeit much piety, humility and Angelical sanctimony, boasting of peculiar Illuminations and Communion with God; thus when they have purchased a good repute they instill their venome into the minds of their unwary Proselytes, till they wholly corrupt them.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It is said that even after death there remains a natural Antipathy between a <hi>Wolf</hi> and <hi>a Sheep,</hi> insomuch that if the skin of each be made into a Drum,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Hist. Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal. pag.</hi> 213.</note> (as a Learned Naturalist observes) the very sound of the Wolves skin breaks the other, and that if their Guts be made into <hi>Vyol</hi> (or <hi>Lute</hi>) Strings it is impossible to tune them to <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nisons</hi> or one sound: So the perverse Doctrine of Hereticks does mischief in the Church, even when the Hereticks themselves are dead.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. As the <hi>Wolf</hi> at the approach of peril betakes himself to flight privately; So Hereticks skulk in time of persecution, and withdraw most cowardly.</p>
                        <p n="6">6.

Eph. 1.23. —2.16. —4.4, 12, 16.—5.23. Col. 1.8, 24. —2.19. —3.15. The Explication of which <hi>Trope</hi> is easie. And to speake concisely, we shall shew it.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. With respect to Christ the Head of the Church, and whose Body the Church is called.</p>
                        <p n="1">(1.) As the Head is not at a distance from a living body, but most closely joyned to it: so there is a sacred and most Mystical Union betwixt Christ and his Church, or Believers.</p>
                        <p n="2">(2.) As the Head Rules the whole body, and influences it with a vital power: So Christ wisely directs, and moderates, strongly preserves, quickens, by Counsel instructs, and eternally saves his Church, Eph. 1.23. and 2.16. and 4.16. and 5.23. &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. With respect to true Christians who are spiritual Members of that Body.</p>
                        <p>Of these the Metaphor of a Body signifies many things, chiefly these three.</p>
                        <p n="1">(1.) The various <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Offices</hi> of Christians, especially the Preachers of the Gospel. For,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. As one <hi>Body</hi> has divers <hi>Members,</hi> which have their particular and distinct Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices: So there are peculiar Gifts and Offices in the Church, which particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons fitted for their exercise, are chosen for.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As the Members of a Humane body differ among themselves with respect to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excellency and operation; yet those of an inferior office, do not envy the superior, neither does the superior despise the inferior: So among true Christians there is a Society and Conversation without envy in the lowest, or scorn in the highest Rank, to each other; Rom. 12.4, 5. 1 Cor. 12.12. &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="2">(2.) Of the bond of perfection, which is Love with its Fruits and Vertues. The Members of a humane body have a natural instinct of love and sympathy, one to another, if one be in pain, the rest are unquiet and ill at ease: If one be well, the rest rejoyce, and each contributes to supply the necessity of the other of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, neither will one willingly part with the other: So true Believers sincerely love each other, and by tender, sympathizing, compassionate, fellow feeling love, and mutual aid of each other, declare themselves to be living Members of the Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal body of Christ, Rom. 12.5. 1 Cor. 12.21. Eph. 4.3, 4, 16.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. With respect to the spiritual knowledge of Faith and increase of Godliness, from the similitude of a humane body, which increases and grows greater and stronger, &amp;c. Eph. 4.13. Col. 2.19.</p>

                     <p>ΑΛΛΗΓΟΡΙΑ, an <hi>Allegory,</hi> with respect to its <hi>Etymology</hi> or derivation, signifies that, <hi>when one thing is said, another thing is understood.</hi> It is the <hi>Continuation</hi> of a <hi>Trope,</hi> especially of a <hi>metaphor,</hi> and although <hi>Metony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Ironies</hi> and <hi>Synecdoches</hi> are likewise continued, yet not so frequently nor with that <hi>Emphasis,</hi> as in the other florid <hi>Tropes,</hi> therefore we will in a particular chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter treat of this continued <hi>Metaphor,</hi> not so much to shew the Fountains whence <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories</hi> are taken, (for that I presume is abundantly shewn where we have treated of <hi>Metaphors</hi>) but to discover and explain some difficulties in it, and shew its peculiar nature.</p>
                     <p>These <hi>Allegories</hi> we will distinguish into <hi>Simple,</hi> and <hi>Allusive.</hi> The <hi>Simple</hi> we call such as are taken from any natural things. The <hi>Allusive</hi> we call such as respect other things, whether Words or Facts, and are from thence deduced into a transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted description.</p>

And so made abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the race of man, and so bore the figure of the Devil, whence the Devil is called a <hi>Serpent</hi> and <hi>Dragon</hi>; Rev. 12.7, 8. &amp;c.

But more particularly,</p>
                        <p>By the <hi>head</hi> of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> is meant <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> for as the Serpents <hi>Poyson</hi> and Power of <hi>biting</hi> lies in his head: so the Devils <hi>poyson</hi> is <hi>sin,</hi> which infects and destroys the wole man; hence it is deservedly called <hi>the poyson of Dragons, and the cruel venom of Asps,</hi> Deut. 32.33. where <hi>note,</hi> that in the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>Head</hi> is put for <hi>Venom,</hi> and the <hi>Epithete, Cruel,</hi> is added, as if there were a perfect al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion to the <hi>head</hi> of that most cruel Serpent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. Therefore when <hi>Christ</hi> takes away <hi>sin,</hi> he breaks the <hi>head</hi> of that infernal Serpent: See <hi>John</hi> 3.8. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Serpents life, and strength lies in his <hi>head,</hi> and because the <hi>head</hi> is the supreme and most noble Member in a Creature, by whose vertue and influence the whole body is governed, it is put for <hi>Power, Dominion,</hi> and <hi>Superiority,</hi> Deut. 28.13, 44. Lam. 1.5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Power, Strength,</hi> and Dominion of the <hi>Devil</hi> against men, consists in death or killing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. Therefore when <hi>Christ</hi> abolishes <hi>spiritual</hi> death, he breaks the <hi>serpents head,</hi> (viz. his power to destroy men spiritually.) See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.54. The other phrase (<hi>and thou shalt bruise his heel</hi>) denotes the manner and <hi>medium</hi> of effecting mens Salvation, viz. his <hi>passion,</hi> and most bitter Death. <hi>Christ</hi> is proposed as a magnificent <hi>Hero,</hi> who (as it were) with his feet tramples on the Serpent, and breaks his head. And as a Serpent when trampled upon, resists with all his strength, while he has any life, wresting and winding himself, spitting <hi>poyson,</hi> and <hi>biting</hi> his Enemy; so <hi>Jehova</hi> intimates, that the Devil would do so, by this <hi>phrase</hi>; As if he had said, thou shalt defend thy self with all thy might, and use all endeavours to destroy thine Enemy, the <hi>Messiah,</hi> (whilst I indulge thee for fallen mans sake to use thy worst) neither shall he escape unhurt, for he shall suffer a most ignominious <hi>Death,</hi> by thine Instruments: But this will not profit thee, for thou shalt not be able to touch his <hi>head,</hi> but only <hi>one</hi> of his <hi>heels,</hi> that is, the <hi>less</hi> principal part, will in some Measure be hurted by thee, but my Divine omnipotence shall cure that wound, by giving him a glorious <hi>Resurrection</hi> from Death, and by my Gospel, declaring him to the whole world to be <hi>Conquerour</hi> of <hi>Hell,</hi> and all its powers: whereas thou shalt <hi>utterly</hi> perish; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thy <hi>heel,</hi> but thy very <hi>head</hi> shall be broken.</p>
                        <p>We have Insisted the larger upon this great <hi>Oracle</hi> of Divine Truth, because it is the Foundation of the Prophecies concerning the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and all our Hope and Comfort, which we hope shall not seem tedious to the <hi>Pious</hi> Reader.</p>

                           <hi>and his Asses Colt unto the choice Vine; he washed his garments in Wine, and his Cloaths in the blood of grapes, —his Eyes shall be red with wine, and his Teeth white with milk—.</hi> In the last words of the <hi>Patriarch Jacob,</hi> there are many things spoken <hi>Allegorically</hi> in this Chapter—, of which these words are most <hi>Emphatical,</hi> which are spoke in the Blessing of <hi>Judah</hi>; which the <hi>Rabbies</hi> and some <hi>Christians</hi> understand by an <hi>hyperbole</hi> of an <hi>Earthly</hi> Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, and the great plenty and faecundity thereof, but <hi>ver.</hi> 10. shews this to be a clear Prophecy of <hi>Shiloh</hi> or the <hi>Messiah</hi> to come of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> —, and sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Patriarch</hi> from so <hi>excellent</hi> a subject would not slip into the mention of those vain, earthly things—, and what he says of <hi>the redness of eyes with wine,</hi> it is reckon'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst <hi>wickednesses, Prov.</hi> 23.24. because a sign of <hi>drunkenness,</hi> which the <hi>Patriarch</hi> (who severely taxt his sons sins, <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5.) would not reckon among his Blessings.</p>
                        <p>This is therefore An <hi>Allegory,</hi> and is to this effect expounded by the Learned <hi>Bren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius—. Binding his Fole to a Vine</hi>] this is a desciption of Peace and tranquility in the Kingdom of Christ. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.7. and <hi>Zach.</hi> 3.10. for in Wars, they do not
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:41512:115"/>
bind <hi>Foles</hi> or Asses to the <hi>Vines,</hi> when men cannot dwell under their own Vine and Figtree, which are destroyed, which denotes the peaceable administration of Christ in his Kingdom. See <hi>Isa.</hi> 9.5. This is not to be understood of <hi>external</hi> Tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but partly because Christ establishes his Kingdom without warlike Arms, by the Preaching of the Gospel; and partly because it brings Peace and Tranquillity of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. <hi>He shall wash in Wine</hi>] this is a description of <hi>abundance,</hi> and the <hi>vile</hi> esteem of worldly things in the Kingdom of <hi>Christ.</hi> But we are to understand it of the <hi>abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance</hi> of <hi>spiritual</hi> things, as <hi>Remission</hi> of sins, <hi>Righteousness,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.33. <hi>Psal.</hi> 45.2. &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Some Expound this of the <hi>Passion of Christ</hi> —; The <hi>Vineyard</hi> of Christ is his <hi>Church,</hi> Isa. 5.1. and 27.2. and 65.21. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.1. and <hi>Christ</hi> is the <hi>Vine</hi> into which the branches are grafted, <hi>John</hi> 15.1, 4, 5. and the meaning (say they) is, Christ compares his Church (because of its simplicity, humility, and the burdens of trouble which it is forc'd to bear in the World) to an <hi>Ass,</hi> which he will feed with most sweet grapes and spiritual Joy, or inebriate it, that being render'd couragious, it should despise death, Devils, Hell, and Persecutions—, and so Christ <hi>will wash his garment in wine, and his Cloaths in the blood of grapes</hi>—, that is, will pour his most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood upon his garments, <hi>viz.</hi> his Flesh, which his <hi>Deity</hi> puts on as a Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which will afterwards be excellent spiritual Wine to comfort and refresh the faithful. <hi>His eyes will be red with wine</hi>] that is, in his Passion, for then <hi>he had no form nor Comeliness,</hi> Isa. 53.2. viz. when Whipped, Spit upon, and Crowned with thorns, and carried about in disgrace by <hi>Pilate</hi>'s Order—; so he was deform'd, for others sins. But inasmuch as <hi>in him was found no spot, nor was guile found in his mouth,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.22. <hi>His Teeth</hi> are said to be <hi>white with milk, ver.</hi> 12. <hi>Whiteness</hi> signifies purity and Innocence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Isa.</hi> 63.1, 2, 3, &amp;c.</p>

                  <head>TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>HAving spent many Years in a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial Capacity, and having the Charge of a particular Flock com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to me, (altho in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects unfit for the Management of so <hi>great</hi> a Trust) partly, a particular Inclination, but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally the Edification of my Hearers, drew out my Heart to study the Nature of Scripture <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors,</hi> and other <hi>Tropes</hi> and figurative Speeches there used; and finding the Scriptures abounding with <hi>Metaphors, Allegories,</hi> &amp;c. and that those Divine Matters which the Holy Spirit dictates, are represented by Similitudes borrowed from earthly Things; yea, that they are often called by the very Names that material or earthly Things are; God, by a gracious Condescension, convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the knowledg of spiritual Things by preaching them by their respective earthly <hi>Parallels:</hi> I betook my self to preach upon some <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors,</hi> which, by the Aid of Divine Goodness, wanted neither Success, nor the general Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my Auditory: And having many brief Heads of my Notes, respecting some principal <hi>Metaphors,</hi> by me, it was judged by divers worthy Men, worth my Time and Pains to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pile an entire Work upon this Subject, for Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good. And altho I knew the Work to be <hi>too</hi> heavy for a single Undertaker, yet I have adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this <hi>Essay.</hi> And that there might be no Defect,
<pb facs="tcp:41512:120"/>
for want of any humane Literature needful, I have procured such Helps, as I hope (to speak mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly) have given sufficient proof, that they want neither Learning nor Languages; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, the Help of the Gentleman that translated our <hi>Philologia Sacra,</hi> he being my Friend, and one that had leisure, and a willing mind to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute his Assistance. After much Labour and Pains, it is brought so far as thou seest; and if thou reapest any Benefit by it, give God the Praise.</p>
                  <p>As to the Work it self, we have had it recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by several learned and judicious Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters to their Christian Friends, in order to its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing encouraged. The <hi>Matter</hi> of it is Divine, but the <hi>Manner</hi> of handling possibly will not please all. I must confess my own Defects and Disabilities for the undertaking of so great a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and am assured, the Christian and candid Peruser will overlook Frailties, and take that in good part, which was design'd for the Publick Good. As for Carpers and Censurers, that like nothing but what they do themselves, they are below regard. I have met with an Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst my Method, <hi>viz.</hi> That no Parallels are to be drawn beyond the Scope of the Text, answering the Intention of the Spirit there. To which I say,</p>
                  <p>First; That I have endeavoured with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to conform all my Parallels to plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Analogy of the Orthodox Faith; and if I go beyond what the Scope of a particular Text is, yet I agree with the general Tenor of God's Word.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; Metaphors being Terms borrowed from Things that have divers Properties, as far as they yield Parities or Disparities (with the Object
<pb facs="tcp:41512:120"/>
represented) agreeable to the Word of God, if they tend to Edification, may be safely used: As for example; God (in a Metaphorical Notion) is called a <hi>Father</hi>; how can a Parallel be limited, till you apply all the good Properties of a natural Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Him? So of <hi>Christ a Shepherd,</hi> &amp;c. See our <hi>Sacred Philology,</hi> pag. 67, &amp; 171. The like may be said of many other general Terms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly; If our Method is not useful to criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Objectors, yet 'tis hoped it will be so to the plain serious Reader; and the other may furnish himself with what he likes, or let alone what he wants not.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly; If Example be any Warrant, I have the Precedents of the learned <hi>Glassius, Illyricus,</hi> Dr. <hi>Franzius,</hi> and our own <hi>Caryl, Burroughs, Blackwood,</hi> and divers others, who have parallel'd divers Metaphors in the same nature as I have done. All which, I presume, will satisfy such as can be satisfied, with respect to this Objection.</p>
                  <p>I can truly say, that we have spared no Cost or Pains, to consult the best Authors extant, whether Divines, Naturalists, Philosophers, Philologists, or Criticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in order to make this Essay useful for the end intended; and have carefully labour'd to avoid any Notion of Things, that may offend such as are sound in the Faith; but have kept all along within the Bounds of that Gravity, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxy of Matter, which the Christian Religion requires, and the Reformed Protestants profess.</p>
                  <p>The Helps I have had from others, whether dead or alive, I readily acknowledg; for I would not own that for mine which is not; and to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate the Work the better, I have, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, expressed some Things in the very Words
<pb facs="tcp:41512:121"/>
of divers worthy and learned Divines.</p>
                  <p>As to the Work in general, and the Use of it, read the Epistle to the First Book. Only this let me add here: Such who would see what Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement may be fairly made of a Metaphor, may read <hi>Light,</hi> (Book 3. p. 1, to 40.) which contains the Substance of several Sermons, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched upon 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. with good Acceptance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reader,</hi> This I must say, (what Profit it may yield thee I know not) yet when the Second Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume is finished, thou wilt have the Fruit of near twenty Years Study, in which time (divers that know me can say) I have not been idle. And thou mayest perceive, that what I have received I am willing to communicate to others; Talents must not be hid in Napkins. And that it may bring Glory to God, Advantage to Thee, and to the Church of Christ in general, is, and shall be the constant Prayer of him, who is willing to serve thee in the Work of the Gospel, for Christ's sake,</p>

Act. 5.32. 2 Pet. 1.4.</note> being <hi>comprehensive of all spiritual good,</hi> is the best gift that can be received; and when he becomes a Portion to good men, he makes <hi>them partakers of his Divine Nature,</hi> gives them his <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> even the <hi>wisdom that is above.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="3">III. God in giving himself unto his people, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances their honour and interest, and makes them no less than Kings and Princes; for when he makes them <hi>Heirs of God,</hi>

                                    <p n="4">IV. God who is the <hi>greatest,</hi> the <hi>richest,</hi> and most <hi>liberal</hi> Predecessor, Father, or Benefactor, always gives <hi>like himself</hi> in quantity and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—<hi>Open thy mouth wide, and</hi> I <hi>will fill it— Ask,</hi>

                                       <hi>and you shall receive, that your joy may be full— Ask what ye will, and it shall be done for you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven above what you can ask or think</hi>— He doth not only make them to <hi>inherit substance,</hi> but he fills their Treasury, makes <hi>all grace to abound towards them, and with-holds no good thing from them that walk uprightly.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="5">V. God is not the Portion of <hi>Devils</hi> or <hi>wicked men,</hi> who are <hi>Enemies</hi> and <hi>Aliens,</hi>
                                       <note place="margin">Rom. 8.16, 17. Gal. 3.26.</note>

God when he becometh the portion of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man, it is <hi>out of love,</hi> the <hi>greatest love</hi> and good will that ever was exprest:<note place="margin">Deut. 7.7.

                                       <pb n="7" facs="tcp:41512:125"/>VII. So God in becoming the Portion and Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Saints, doth design thereby to fix them in a future settlement of Eternal Happiness and Felicity. <hi>The pure in Heart shall see God,</hi>
                                       <note place="margin">Mat. 5.8. Isa. 61.7. &amp; 45.17.</note>

                                    </p>
                                    <p n="8">VIII. So Saints in having God to be their Portion, are delivered from that Reproach and Contempt the Holy Scriptures cast upon others (<hi>viz.</hi>) on the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly of the Earth,<note place="margin">Rev. 3.</note> who because they have no Part nor Portion in God, are called poor, blind, and misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; whereas the Saints are called honourable,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.9. Ps 16.3. Mal. 3.17</note> and excellent ones, <hi>Jabez</hi> was more honourable than his Brethren; they are Men of Name, Princes, God's Treasure, his beloved Ones, his Jewels.</p>
                                    <p n="9">IX. So the Saints having God to be theirs, are not only freed from the greatest Contempt, and made Honourable Ones,<note place="margin">Psal. 99.11. &amp; 34.7. Heb. 1.14 Pro. 16.7</note> but thereby come to have many Friends, all the Angels of Heaven are in perfect Bonds of Peace and true Friendship with them, as well as all Saints on Earth, who bless and pray for them; nay, many times God makes their very Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to be at Peace with them.</p>
                                    <p n="10">X. So God being a Saint's Portion, it makes him value himself upon the best and most worthy grounds in the World. (1.) Because he is rich. (2.) Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveably rich. (3.) Really rich; other Men, great Men of the World are but seemlying rich<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (4.) His Riches and Portion make him really Honourable,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.2 Prov. 8.</note> truly Noble and renow'd in the sight of God, Angels, and Saints. (5.) Because God hath made him so rich and illustrious. (6) Because he cannot be made poor by Men nor Devils; His Riches are durable.</p>
                                    <p n="11">XI. So when a Saint comes to know that God is his Portion, how doth it free him from fear of want; others have cause to fear they shall beg at Harvest and have nothing, when he knows what Mines of Treasures are laid up for him against that day:<note place="margin">Psal. 23.1 Hab. 3.17 Lam. 3.24.</note> 
                                       <hi>The Lord is my Shepherd, therefore I shall not want; yet will I rejoyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my Salvation; the Lord is my Portion, saith my Soul, therefore will I hope in him.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="12">XII. So a Saint knowing God is his Portion, will not change his Estate with Kings, and mighty Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates of the Earth, who are ungodly;<note place="margin">Psal. 84.10. Heb. 11.</note> 
                                       <hi>I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be a Door-keeper in the House of God, than to dwell in the Tents of Wickedness. Moses</hi> contemned the Glory of <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s Court, by seeing him who is invisible to be his Portion.</p>
                                    <p n="13">XIII. So he that hath God to be his Portion, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steems highly of him;<note place="margin">Psal. 18.1</note> 
                                       <hi>He loves the Lord with all his Heart, with all his Soul, and with all his Strength; I will love the Lord as long as I live.</hi>
                                       <note place="margin">Psal. 73.25.</note> 
                                       <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee, and there is none upon Earth that I desire besides thee?</hi> God runs continually in his Mind.</p>
                                    <p n="14">XIV. A Saint having God to his Portion (<hi>viz.</hi>) having obtained an Interest in God through Christ, comes thereby to have Right to Baptism, that initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Ordinance into the Church; when he comes,<note place="margin">Eph. 1.3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; 2.19.</note> the Door is opened immediately to him into the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Family and Houshold of God.</p>
                                    <p n="15">XV. So a Saint having Interest in God, he is made capable of helping and doing much Good to others. (1.) By his Prayers;<note place="margin">Heb. 13. Acts 11.23. 2 Cor. 1.4. Jam. 5.16. Gen. 39.3 &amp; 30.27. Isa. 1.9.</note> for the Ears of God are open to his Crys, they are his Delight. What Good did <hi>Israel</hi> receive by <hi>Moses</hi>'s Prayer? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (2.) By good Counsel. (3.) By comforting others that are cast down, with the same Comfort where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they themselves are comforted of God. (4.) By helping against Satan, by shewing his Devices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (5.) And by their holy Example and Conversation. The wicked also receive great Advantage by them, they are the Light of the World, the Salt of the Earth; how was <hi>Laban</hi> blest for <hi>Jacob</hi>'s sake, and the House of <hi>Potephar</hi> for <hi>Joseph</hi>'s sake? and what said the Inhabitants of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in <hi>Isaiah</hi>'s time, Except the Lord of Host had left us a very small Remnant, we should have been as <hi>Sodom,</hi> and we should been like unto <hi>Gomorah.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="16">XVI. So a Saint having God to be his Portion, is furnished with whatsoever is truly good and desirable, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Heavenly or divine Life to quicken him; <hi>He is our Life.</hi> The Man who hath not received the Spirit,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41512:126"/>
lies dead in Sins and Trespasses. 2. Light to direct them. 3. Wisdom to Counsel them. 4. Power to aid and assist them. 5. Spiritual Joy to cheer them. 6. Heavenly Bread to feed them. 7. Glorious Robes to cloath them. 8. Excellent Graces to adorn them. 9. The Angels to guard and protect them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A Saint lives upon God; he receives so much of that spiritual Good, Profit, and Delight here from his Portion, that he is able to take in all that Good God sees necessary for him.</p>

                                    <p n="3">III. Other Portions, tho great, yet not infinite, immense, and unsearchable, the Worth of the greatest earthly Portion may be computed or reckon'd up.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV. Other Portions may be great, and yet not Alsufficient, it cannot supply the Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor with whatsoever good thing he needeth.</p>

                                    <p n="6">VI. All other Portions have their mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they are, as one observes, a bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweet: many Snares and Evils attend a Man that has a great Portion of worldly things.</p>
                                    <p n="7">VII. Other Portions are common to Men, to the vilest of Men; in every Nation Riches are often given without distinction, Saints and Sinners have them alike.</p>
                                    <p n="8">VIII. Another Portion is not universal, it doth not comprehend all good things; it may lie in Gold, in Silver, in Land, Houses, but not comprehend all Portions, or all good things whatsoever.</p>
                                    <p n="9">IX. Other Portions may be taken away by Thieves, wasted or consumed by Fire.</p>
                                    <p n="10">X. Other Portions may be great, and yet not suitable in all respects to all Persons, and at all times; what will Gold or Silver signify to the Soul? what help can it administer at Death?</p>
                                    <p n="11">XI. Other Portions cannot satisfy the Man that enjoys them, all the World cannot fill the Soul, nor give full Satisfaction to it.</p>
                                    <p n="12">XII. Other Portions may be spent, a Man by living upon them, may waste them; the Prodigal Son wasted all his Portion.</p>
                                    <p n="13">XIII. Other Portions are but for a time, they pass away, and Riches are uncertain things, they are upon the wing, they will not abide for ever.</p>

                                    <p n="3">III. God is an immense, infinite, and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible Portion, none is able to account or compute how rich a Saint is; what are all Nations of the World to him? even less than nothing, and Vanity.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV. But God is an Allsufficient Portion, in him is a sufficiency of all good Things a Saint can need;<note place="margin">Psal. 84.11.</note> no Good will he with-hold from him that walketh uprightly.</p>
                                    <p n="5">V. But God is a Portion that is absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; he that hath all other good things and not God, no Interest in him, is miserable, and shall be damn'd.</p>
                                    <p n="6">VI. But God is a pure unmixt Portion, there is nothing in him but Goodness, Light, and no Darkness, Joy, and no Sadness, Life, and no Death; and this they will find when they come to the full Possession and Injoyment of Him.</p>
                                    <p n="7">VII. But God is a peculiar Portion; he gives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self only to his own People, to his own Elect;<note place="margin">Psal. 77.26. Lam. 3.24.</note> 
                                       <hi>He is,</hi> (saith <hi>David) the Strength of my Heart, and my Portion for ever; this God is our God.</hi> The Lord, saith a gracious Soul, is my Portion; there is not a wicked Man in the World can say so.</p>
                                    <p n="8">VIII. But God is an universal Portion, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is good it is to be had in him, whether for Profit or Delight, he comprehends all Portions, all things that are desirable; so he that has God hath all, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, is good without him, nothing can be evil that fals upon a Saint that hath him; God is good in every thing, and he is good of himself alone, when every thing else is gone; <hi>Having nothing,</hi>

                                    <p n="9">IX. God is a Portion that none can rob the Soul of, no Fire can destroy the Soul's Inheritance.</p>
                                    <p n="10">X. But God is a sutable Portion to all Persons, in all things, and at all times; this Portion suits the condition of the Soul, the necessities of the Soul, the wants and desires of the Soul.

                                    <p n="12">XII. But God is a Portion that can never be spent: tho the more a Saint lives upon his Portion, the more rich he is, the more comes in upon him, God is an unexhaustible Portion.</p>

This shews the <hi>great difference between the godly and ungodly,</hi> the one are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>rich</hi> in the midst of <hi>poverty,</hi> and the other miserably <hi>poor</hi> in the midst of <hi>riches</hi>; as in the Case of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and the <hi>Rich Man.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Luk. 16.</note>
                           </p>
                           <p n="3">3. It shews how grosly <hi>the World is abused by Satan,</hi> in esteeming <hi>good</hi> men to be poor and miserable; since the <hi>meanest</hi> of them is born to a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and Heir-Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to a <hi>Crown,</hi> which is but the least part of their Portion neither; for the height of their Inheritance is the <hi>God</hi> of the Kingdom.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. From hence we see the reason <hi>why wise and good men slighted the World</hi>; for they had <hi>piercing</hi> judgments, and could see beyond it, and take a view of that more <hi>exceeding and eternal weight of glory,</hi> that an interest in this <hi>Portion</hi> shall invest them in.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. From hence we may be informed <hi>why God is so much slighted in the World,</hi> not because he is <hi>unworthy</hi> of chief regard, for he is <hi>all excellent</hi>: (2.) Not because he is <hi>not sufficiently discovered to be so; for the Heavens declare his glory</hi>: And if a rare piece of Art and Curiosity in a Royal Palace will lead us to judge it the Product of a brave mind; much more the view of the stately <hi>Canopy</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels</hi> of the Creation, will carry our minds to the Contemplation of the great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: But (3.) 'Tis because of <hi>affected and chosen ignorance,</hi> with which <hi>Satan</hi> strikes; so that mens <hi>Damnation</hi> is of themselves.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. This shews the <hi>infinite reasons that sway with good men for the choice of this Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> because if they have him, all that's good and desirable is theirs, and <hi>all</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without him.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. This may lead us to enquire <hi>who have this God for their Portion.</hi> (1.) They are such as <hi>set light by the World,</hi> and all things short of him. (2.) Their <hi>thoughts</hi> are upon him, and <hi>hunger</hi> and <hi>thirst</hi> after him, cleaving to him as the <hi>highest</hi> Object. (3.) They make their boast of him, <hi>I will make my boast of God.</hi> (4.) They take care to keep him. And (5.) Are resolved to exalt him: <hi>O God, thou art my God, I will exalt thee.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="8">8. This leads us to an useful enquiry after the <hi>best way to get this God to be our Portion,</hi> which may be reduced to the following Heads: (1.) 'Tis <hi>necessary</hi> to know <hi>how we lost him, viz.</hi> by <hi>sin.</hi> (2.) To remove that that separated from him— <hi>Let the wicked forsake his way,</hi> &amp;c. (3.) By confession and acknowledgment to sue to him, as the <hi>Prodigal</hi> did; for <hi>he that confesses and forsakes sin, shall find mercy.</hi> (4.) To draw our hearts from <hi>Earthly</hi> Objects, which may be evils (though not in themselves, yet) by accident, because <hi>we cannot serve God and Mammon.</hi> (5.) We must <hi>believe on Christ,</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> him.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. This should teach us <hi>Contentment,</hi> since this Portion is <hi>enough</hi> (2.) Not to fear Death, because it is but the <hi>entrance</hi> to a <hi>fuller</hi> enjoyment. (3.) Not to repine at others large share of the World, because this Portion <hi>infinitely</hi> excels it. (4.) We ought to <hi>live upon it,</hi> as our proper and peculiar Inheritance.</p>

                                    <p n="1">I. A <hi>Habitation,</hi> or House, is a secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity against extream and intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate heat.</p>
                                    <p n="2">II. It is a place of <hi>shelter</hi> in a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuous or stormy season; for when <hi>Wind, Rain, Hail, Snow, Thunder,</hi> &amp;c. are like to annoy us, that's a safe retiring place.</p>
                                    <p n="3">III. It preserves the body from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of excessive cold: 'Tis a lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing to be housless and harbourless in a sharp Winter; many have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed, yea frozen to death that way: Our house is the proper place where fire is made to warm us.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV. Our Habitation is the place where our choicest comforts remain; as our dearest Relations, Company, chief Riches, or Treasure.</p>
                                    <p n="5">V. A Habitation is a place of rest; for there our bodies (when tired by watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, journeying, or labour) are sweetly reposed.</p>
                                    <p n="6">

                                    <p n="7">VII. There must be some certain <hi>known way,</hi> or passage leading to a Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or house, by which Enquirers may come to it.</p>
                                    <p n="8">VIII. A Habitation or house is a <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary</hi> and safeguard against <hi>Thieves, Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> and <hi>Murderers</hi>; it is a mans Castle to secure him and his.</p>

                                    <p n="12">XII. A house or Habitation is a place of <hi>Hospitality,</hi> there <hi>Friends</hi> are invited, <hi>Strangers</hi> entertained, and <hi>Beggars</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. FRom the foregoing particulars we may infer <hi>the necessity of self-examination, viz.</hi> whether we have any <hi>Interest</hi> in this Heavenly Habitation; in order to which, the particulars following are presented as the proper Notes and Marks of a Dweller in God.</p>
                           <p n="1">(1.) Hereby know we <hi>that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his spirit,</hi> 1 John 4.13. <hi>which makes men and women heavenly,</hi> and <hi>spiritual,</hi> and so, <hi>fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                                    <desc>••</desc>
                                 </gap> Inhabitants to dwell there.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">(2.) If we <hi>dwell in love to God,</hi> 1 John 4.16. Deut. 11.1. then <hi>we dwell in God</hi>; for to love him is to keep his Commandments: This love must be with all our hearts, and to him above all others, for he will have no <hi>Competitor.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="3">(3.) If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.12. and his love is perfected in us; if Brotherly love continues among us each to other, it is a very certain mark that we dwell in this Habitation.</p>
                           <p n="4">(4.) Sincere confession, and sound belief that Jesus is the Christ, or the Anointed of God, argues a <hi>Child of God,</hi> 1 John 5.1. to such this Habitation is open— We must believe that he is our Saviour, and our Soveraign, a Priest to <hi>attone,</hi> a Prince to <hi>rule,</hi> and a <hi>Prophet to teach us,</hi> 1 John 4.15. <hi>Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, dwelleth in God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                           <p n="5">(5.) A life of <hi>Divine Communion and Contemplation</hi> is an evident sign of dwelling in God; such are <hi>with him in the Mount,</hi> and partake of his blessings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="6">(6.) A serious return from wandering, and a hearty Renuntiation of all resting places short of this, denotes an Interest in this Habitation.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. From hence we may infer the absolute necessity of a diligent Inquisition, <hi>how we may obtain this Eternal Habitation for our Inheritance,</hi> considering how many Beasts of Prey are watching to devour us, and the impending Storms that threaten us, in such a day as this is.</p>
                           <p n="3">
                              <pb n="13" facs="tcp:41512:128"/>3. We may infer the <hi>folly and madness</hi> of such as take up their rest in the base and contemptible <hi>dwellings</hi> of this world, that bid their Souls <hi>take their ease, wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in brutish sensuality,</hi> and neglecting this <hi>holy Habitation.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="4">4. It concerns us to be very <hi>circumspect</hi> in our walks, that we <hi>be not turned out of Possession,</hi> nor lose our hopes and assurance of it. Men are very careful that the Deeds and Evidences relating to their Earthly Possessions be Authentick, and safely kept, much more should Christians be so of this Eternal Mansion.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. This should keep us from <hi>murmuring,</hi> if we have not such <hi>stately</hi> Fabricks as others to dwell in <hi>here,</hi> because this Heavenly Habitation (that infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels all Earthly Structures, though never so glorious) is ours.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Let not God lose the glory of so gracious a <hi>condescention,</hi> in becoming a Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation for us— Let us not slight his infinite love, that provided this shelter for us, from the danger of the open and unguarded Fields.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Let it be an encouragement against slavish fear; <hi>to be afraid of Man (who is a Worm) is to forget where you are.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="5">5. Let sinners be advised to <hi>hasten to this resting place,</hi> and get an Interest in this <hi>Habitation,</hi> else their <hi>security</hi> is a certain <hi>fore-runner</hi> of destruction. For,

                                    <p n="1">I. A Rich Husbandman has not only fruitful Fields, Vineyards, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, Orchards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But also some bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Heaths, Commons, and Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</p>
                                    <p n="2">II. A rich Husbandman has many Beasts, some of which are of a hurtful and mischievous nature, which he fetters or ties up, restraining them by some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention or other from doing injury to his other Cattle, and breaking into his Gardens or Orchards to spoil his precious flowers and tender plants.</p>
                                    <p n="3">
                                       <pb n="15" facs="tcp:41512:129"/>III. A Husbandman puts some of his Cattle into fat pastures to feed and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them against the day of slaughter.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV. A husbandman expects not that return and increase of precious and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable fruit from the dry heath and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Wilderness, as from the rich Valleys, Gardens, Fields, Vineyards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he hath bestowed much cost and labour upon in manuring, sowing, planting, watering, dressing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="5">V. A husbandman divides and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates his land,<note place="margin">Deu. 27.17 Pr. 22.28</note> (especially that which he designs for tillage and principal use) from other mens. Every one knows his own land, and to this end they have landmarks and the like, by which propriety is preserv'd.</p>
                                    <p n="6">VI. A husbandman doth not only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide and separate the land that he designs for special use, whether Orchard, Field, or Vineyard,<note place="margin">
                                          <hi>Non minor est virtus quam que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere, parta tueri.</hi>
                                       </note> from all other; but also makes a Fence or Wall about it, especially if it be taken out of a waste Wilderness or a barren and common Heath or Field, otherwise the fruit might soon be eaten up or trod down by the Beasts of the Field.</p>
                                    <p n="7">VII. When a Husbandman hath Fenced or Walled in his ground, he digs or plows it up, in order to the manuring of it, and making it good soyl, fit for the use intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether for choice grain, plants, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things.</p>
                                    <p n="8">VIII. A husbandman finds some ground more hard, stony and barren than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and what the Plow cannot break up, the Spade and Mattock must; If it be very rocky, a Hammer is used to break it in pieces.</p>
                                    <p n="9">IX. A husbandman finds by experience that no ground till it be well manured and Planted, brings forth any thing but what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally grows of it self. Choice plants must be set, and seed must be sowen if we will expect fruit.</p>
                                    <p n="10">X. When a Husbandman has ploughed or digged up his Field, he discovers the nature and quality of the ground; and finds much Filth, Worms, Weeds, and loathsome trash are turned up, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lay hid; so that we many times won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that land so fair in appearance should prove so naught.</p>
                                    <p n="11">XI. The husbandman takes much pains and bestows great Cost to make his barren ground fruitful, and destroy those hurtful Weeds which would Choak the seed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive it of nourishment, and so spoil its growth— He also lays on much Dung to fertilize it and make it yield the greater Crop.</p>
                                    <p n="12">
                                       <pb facs="tcp:41512:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>XII. Though the husbandman doth not find his ground immediately so good and fruitful, as to Answer his just expectation considering his labour and cost about it; yet for all that he gives not over, nor slacks his hand, as if it would never be good; but on the contrary pursues his endeavour, in hopes that what fails in one year, may be effectual in another.</p>
                                    <p n="13">XIII. The husbandman grudges not at the cost he is at, to make his ground fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but does it with a willing mind and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry chearfully.</p>
                                    <p n="14">XIV. A husbandman sees when his field is plowed and sowed, that it must be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd with the dew of Heaven, or it will not thrive. The Earth cannot bring forth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the Heavens distil their precious drops, and refreshing showers upon it— therefore he prays for rain, and if it rains not, he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens his sluices to water his Meadows and other low Ground to make it fructifie.</p>
                                    <p n="15">XV. The husbandman finds that low Grounds, Valleys and Meadows by Rivers sides are most fruitful; whereas Mountains, Heaths and Hilly grounds, how lofty soever they seem, are commonly barren and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful: And though they may for a time bring forth, yet by the scorching heat of the Sun, and for want of moisture by which it should take deep root, 'tis so parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and burnt that it rarely (if at all) comes to maturity.</p>
                                    <p n="16">XVI. A husbandman takes much pains to weed his Gardens and prune his Trees, and if he finds the weeds come up thick, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially such as are of a hurtful and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous kind, he uses all ways and proper means to destroy them, lest they should spoil the fruit of his Garden, Field, or Vineyard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet notwithstanding some reliques of the old roots are left, which are apt to spring up afresh, unless continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally cropt off and kept short.</p>
                                    <p n="17">XVII. A husbandman, in consideration of all his labour and charge, expects fruit an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerably from his husbandry.<note place="margin">Jam. 5.7.</note>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="18">XVIII. A husbandman often goes to see the success of his labour and how his Corn and other Plantations thrive, and is much delighted and comforted to find a good
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41512:130"/>
increase and fair hopes of a great Crop; to reward his pains. How he rejoyces, when he finds every Vine full of thick Clusters, every Tree loaden with Fruit, and the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys covered with precious Corn?</p>
                                    <p n="19">XIX. The husbandman is exceedingly grieved, when, (on the contray,) he finds his fields barren or blasted, and his hopes of a plentiful harvest disappointed.</p>
                                    <p n="20">XX. When the husbandman finds many Trees and Branches barren, or without sap or life, after all the means he hath used, he cuts them down for fuel, because they should not cumber the ground, nor hurt others.</p>
                                    <p n="21">XXI. A husbandman hath many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants which he employs to work in his Vineyard, or as Labourers in his Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest.</p>
                                    <p n="22">XXII. A husbandman that hath in his house, a faithful, labourous, an experienced servant, highly prizes him, he is esteemed above any that are unskilful, slothful, or negligent in their business.</p>
                                    <p n="23">XXIII. The husbandman oftentimes finds his pleasant trees, choice plants, and fruitful fields annoyed and greatly damnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Catter-pillars, and other hurtful Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
                                    <p n="24">XXIV. When the husbandman finds his Fields or Vineyards quite barren, and that no manuring will help, but thorns, briars and weeds abound, he plucks up the hedges and lets it lie fallow and common to all.</p>
                                    <p n="25">XXV. A husbandman Fans or Winnows his Corn to sever the Chaff from the Wheat.</p>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41512:132"/>
who was in the Bosom of the Father, and understood all his Secrets, by whom he made the Worlds, who is called the Son, the Character, Image, or Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of God, without whom there was nothing contrived or made, that was made; either things in Heaven, or things on Earth, visible or invisible, whether Thrones, Dominions, or Principalities; all things were made by him, and he was before all things, and from him came Order and Direction to all subordinate or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary Causes.</p>
                                    <p n="3">III. God, the Builder of all things, had the Idea in his own Mind, and gave Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the bringing of them forth, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to suit his most wise and wonderful Purposes: for as <hi>known to God are all his Works from the beginning,</hi> so he said, <hi>Let the Heavens, the Earth, the Water, the Air appear</hi>; and they did so.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV. God, this great and wise Master-Builder, hath planted the Heavens above, and laid the Foundations of the Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath: which when we consider, that they have no bottom, but the Air and the Water, we must resolve it into his own Power, which can do every thing, or his Word or Son, who bears up the Pillars of the Earth, and upholds all things: <hi>He looked for a City which hath Foundations, whose Builder and Maker is God.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="5">V. The God of the whole Earth did at the first put all Materials into their proper places, and assigned all his Servants their respective Work; the Heavens above the Air, the Air above the Earth, and the Earth above the Waters. Christ is Head-Workman above Angels, Angels above Men, Men in Work and Business above the Fowls of the Air, Beasts of the Field, creeping Things of the Earth, Fishes of the Sea. Men above one another, in respect of his Church, (his spiritual Building) <hi>Moses</hi> above <hi>Joshuah,</hi> and ordinary Prophets; <hi>Aaron</hi> above other Priests; Apostles above Evangelists, and ordinary Ministers: And all to shew his wonderful Skill and Wisdom.

                                    <p n="8">VIII. God is a great Benefactor, who hath made Buildings both for Safety and Conveniency: He made the Fountains to contain the great Deeps, to keep them from breaking out upon the World; he has made Windows in Heaven, to keep the Waters above from falling down too furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, to the prejudice of Man and Beast: He hath made Chambers, to keep in the roaring Winds, from annoying Mortals with constant and impetuous Blasts: The raging Element of Fire he hath confined to its proper Region, where it cannot harm us without his permission. He hath given us a pleasant and fruitful Earth, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and refreshing Air, a beautiful and delightful Heaven, which he has placed as a Canopy over us. — He has constituted a good and holy Church, which is as a Wine-Cellar to supply all our Wants, where he has placed the Word, the Spirit, the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, good Counsel and Instructions, suitable Comforts and Consolations; there is the Wine, the Oil, the Balm, the Bread, where he feeds his Lambs, and makes his Flocks to rest at Noon, satisfying with Favour, and filling with the Blessings of his Bounty: <hi>He will abundantly bless</hi> Sion's <hi>Provision,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

His Wisdom and Counsel is such, that by one Act he knows the Strength of all his Enemies, and the Counsel they take in their Bed-Chamber, the Thoughts they have on their Couches: He always catches the Wise in their own Craftiness, and brings their Devices to naught: He scatters them with the Imagination of their own Heart, and then laughs them to scorn: He knows the right Season to fall upon them, and makes them like Dust before the Whirlwind; and in all things wherein they deal proudly, shews himself still above them: <hi>Has subdued mighty and great Kings, for his Mercy endureth for ever.</hi> Challenges the Force of all his Foes, <hi>If their Hearts can endure, or their Hands be strong, in the Day that he shall deal with them.</hi> Requires <hi>Babylon</hi> it self, that mighty Queen of Nations, to <hi>stand with her Inchantments, Astrologers, and Magicians, and monthly Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosticators.</hi> He is cloathed with such Armor, that none can hurt him; he is mounted on such a Steed, that none by Flight can escape him; for he <hi>rides upon the Wings of the Wind:</hi> He makes his Angels <hi>swift to pursue,</hi> and his Ministers <hi>Flames of Fire.</hi> He sends forth his Arrows in the Dark, that none can escape them, nor yet discern them.</p>

                                    <p n="3">III. A strong Tower is furnished with a resolute couragious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, and well disciplined Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, whom the Captain animates and arms, receiving his flying Friends into Protection.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV. A strong Tower, with respect to Scituation, is usually built upon a rocky or most firm Foundation, to prevent Undermining.</p>
                                    <p n="5">V. A strong Tower is environed with thick and lofty Walls, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Batteries of the Enemy, and overtop their Scaling-Ladders. It also gives a fair and full Prospect of things below, discovering the Motions and Approaches of the Enemy.</p>
                                    <p n="6">VI. A strong Tower is fortified with Out-works, as Moats, Plat-Forms, Palisadoes, Counterscarps, Half-Moons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are often stormed and taken; the Souldiers therefore do not put their chief con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in them, but when they find them not tenable, they wisely retire to the Tower, or main Strength, or they are certainly lost.</p>
                                    <p n="7">
                                       <pb n="31" facs="tcp:41512:139"/>VII. In a strong Tower the Walls and Bulwarks are furnished with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, and other Military Engines, to keep off and destroy the Assai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants.</p>
                                    <p n="8">VIII. In a strong Tower they have Countermines, and other Devices to defeat the Besiegers Mines, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground Workings.</p>
                                    <p n="9">IX. A strong Tower is a Place of Security; there (as in a safe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat) Men trust their Lives, Estates, Families, choice Treasures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'Tis a Refuge, and sure Receptacle, when Enemies invade, or Tyrants oppress us.</p>
                                    <p n="10">X. Sometimes from a strong Tower, a Party is commanded to make brave Sallies and Onsets on the Enemy.</p>
                                    <p n="11">XI. A strong Tower only saves and protects those that are got into it. — Others are exposed to the Fury of the Enemy. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of its impregnable Strength, gives Courage and Resolution to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41512:140"/>
such as are in it, to bid defiance to the Rage and Malice of all Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                                    <p n="12">XII. As a strong Tower gives Courage and Spirit to those that are in it; so it dispirits and dishear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens the Besiegers, who after long and succesless Assaults, are defeated, or beaten quite off.</p>

He rode upon a Cherub, and did flie; yea, he did flie upon the Wings of the Wind. He made Darkness his secret Place; his Pavilion round about him were dark Waters, and thick Clouds of the Skies. At the Brightness that was before him, his thick Clouds passed, Hailstones, and Coals of Fire. The Lord also thundred in the Heavens, and the Highest gave his Voice, Hail-stones, and Coals of Fire: Yea, he sent out his Arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and discomfited them.</hi>

                                    <p n="2">II. A Giant is not only said to be strong, but fierce and terrible; and his running upon one like a Giant, denotes Courage, Fierceness, and Fearlesness, therefore called <hi>Horim.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Ans.</hi> Sometimes, because he is greatly offended and provoked so to do by their Sins: <hi>You have I known above all the Families of the Earth, therefore
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41512:142"/>
will I punish you for your Iniquities.</hi> God's People sin sometimes with a high hand,<note place="margin">Amos 3.2. Psal. 38.3.</note> therefore God punisheth them with a high hand: <hi>Thine Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows stick fast in me, and thine Hand presseth me sore,</hi> saith that good Man, <hi>David:</hi> And again, <hi>There is no soundness in my Flesh, because of thine An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; neither is there any Rest in my Bones, because of my Sin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Quest.</hi> But why did God run like a Giant upon so upright and holy a Man as <hi>Job</hi> was? Doth it stand with the Justice and Righteousness of God, thus to break forth upon a holy Person?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ans.</hi> Before I speak to the Solution of this Question, it will be necessary to premise six or seven things.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Tho it may not be immediatly for this or that Sin, that the Almighty afflicts his <hi>Jobs</hi>; yet Sin is the Original Cause of all their Afflictions: If <hi>Job</hi> had not been polluted and defiled with Sin, he had never known Sorrow or Affliction.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Tho <hi>Job</hi> might not be afflicted for Sin, yet <hi>Job</hi>'s Sins (tho a very holy Man) deserved greater Punishment than that which God brought upon him: <hi>He hath visited thee little or nothing,</hi> saith <hi>Elihu</hi>; so the word will bear it. The least Mercy is more than we deserve, and the greatest Affliction is less than we deserve. He hath not dealt with us after our Sins, nor rewarded us according to our Iniquities.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Tho God came forth fiercely upon <hi>Job,</hi> yet it was not in a way of Wrath, to destroy him; nay, God did not design any Injury or Wrong to him, but contrariwise his great Good and Advantage. <hi>You have heard of the Patience of</hi> Job,<note place="margin">James 5.1.</note> 
                           <hi>and of the End of the Lord; that he is very pitiful, and of tender Mercy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. We must always imprint this, as an undoubted Truth, and sure Maxim, in our Minds; That tho God sometimes afflicts, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> may afflict his Children, as a bare Act of his Sovereignty, Sin being not directly the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion thereof; yet nothing God doth or can do is unjust. <hi>I know, O Lord,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Psal. 119.75. Deut 32.4.</note> 
                           <hi>that thy Judgments are right, and that thou in Faithfulness hast afflicted me. All his Ways are Judgment, a God of Truth, and without Iniquity, just and righteous in all his Ways:</hi> That is, his Administrations, or his Doings, as Mr. <hi>Ainsworth</hi> note<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>, are Judgment, that is, judicious, equal: <hi>A God of Truth,</hi> or Faithful; <hi>without Iniquity,</hi> or there is in him no Iniquity, no injurious Evil: <hi>Right or righteous is he.</hi> Consider further,</p>
                        <p n="5">5. That the greatest and sorest Afflictions that godly Men may meet with, are no sufficient Ground to conclude they are cast out of God's Favour: For the best of Saints, and dearest Servants of God, have been from the beginning under the greatest Exercise of Affliction. <hi>As many as he loves,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Rev. 3.19.</note> 
                           <hi>he rebukes and chastens.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. Another thing that we should premise, is, That the Afflictions which we meet with in this World, come not by chance. They are all measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out by God's ordering Providence, in matter and manner, for kind and quality. And tho the Judgments and Dealings of God are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very secret, and hard to be understood at first, we ought with Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to bear them, and humbly wait, till God is pleased to shew us his Mind and Pleasure in them.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. We must consider, that it is our Duty to acknowledg all our Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Afflictions, and whatever they be, as coming from God; and look beyond Instruments and secondary Causes: <hi>Is there any Evil in the City, and I have not done it? He breaketh me with Breach upon Breach, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth upon me like a Giant. He</hi>; Why some may say, It was the Devil and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41512:142"/>
his Agents, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Sabeans,</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Job</hi> knew that no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil or wicked Man could hurt or touch him, if God did not give them leave, and open the Door for them.</p>
                        <p>These things being premised, I now shall give you five or six Reasons, why God ran thus upon <hi>Job,</hi> or breaks forth after this manner upon sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Persons, when Sin is not the Cause.</p>
                        <p>It is necessary to note this by the way, That God doth frequently single out the most eminent and choicest of his Children, to undergo the sharpest and sorest Affliction, because they have the greatest Strength. <hi>Joseph</hi> excelled for Grace and Vertue, and therefore he is singled out from all his Brethren to hard Works and Sufferings. No Man like <hi>Job</hi> in all the Earth, in his Day, for a perfect and upright Man; and what a Man of Sorrows and Afflictions was he?<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Caryl,</hi> lib. 7. p. 701.</note> Those that have received most Grace from God, are able to bear most Afflictions from God. A General of an Army chuseth out the most valiant and experienced Souldiers, to put them upon hard Adventures. It is not prudent to put a Fresh-water Souldier upon difficult Service. As Christ saith, <hi>I have many things to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now</hi>; and therefore deferred, till they had got more Strength: So God saith of a young Christian, one that is newly converted, Thou hast great Afflictions to undergo before thou diest, but thou art not fit to bear them yet, I will defer thy Trial, till thou art grown more hardy, and fit for that Encounter; as our Saviour told <hi>Peter,</hi> John 21.18.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 <hi>Reason.</hi> One Reason why God ran thus upon <hi>Job</hi> like a Giant, or brings sore and severe Trials upon his dearest Servants, is, That he may fit them for eminent Work and Service. Hereby they learn Experience and Knowledg, not only how to carry themselves in dark and dismal Days, but to teach others also, how to behave themselves under Trials.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That God might crucify them unto all the things of this World: They do not only this way come to see the Vanity and Emptiness of them, but to be dead unto them. In Prosperity the Hearts of the best of Men are ready to be ensnared with the World, therefore God brings Adversity upon them. And indeed it is every way as good and useful for a Saint, as Winter and sharp Frosts are to the Fruits of the Earth, which kills the Worms and Weeds, that otherwise would greatly hurt and injure them. God's <hi>Jobs</hi> have a Body of Sin and Death in them, as well as others, and nothing like Affliction tends to destroy it. The Corruptions of our Hearts are compared to Chaff and Dross, which the Furnace of Affliction burns up, and purges away. No Man is so pure and clean, but he needs to be made more pure, and more holy. <hi>Job</hi> was very good before, but God made him much better by the Rod, before he had done with him: He was Gold before his Trial, but afterwards refined Gold: <hi>When I am tried, I shall come forth as Gold,</hi> (to wit, refined Gold.<note place="margin">Job 23.10.</note>)</p>
                        <p n="3">3. God brings his <hi>Jobs</hi> under great Exercises and Afflictions for the Trial of their Graces. Grace never shines forth in its real Splendor and Glory, until it comes to be tried. A Saint knows not what his Faith can do, until it is brought under Exercise. <hi>Abraham</hi> knew not the Strength of his Faith and Love, until he was called to offer up his Son <hi>Isaac:</hi> He with-held not his Son, his only Son <hi>Isaac,</hi> whom he loved; such was his Love to God: And if we respect his Faith, 'tis said, <hi>He believed in Hope against Hope, that he might become the Father of many Nations.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Rom. 4.18, 19, 20.</note> — <hi>According to that which was spoken, so shall thy Seed be. He being not weak in Faith,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41512:143"/>
considered not his own Body being now dead, when he was about an hundred Years old, neither the deadness of</hi> Sarah's <hi>Womb: He staggered not through <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Gen. 15.5.</note> 
                           <hi>but was strong in Faith, giving Glory to God. By Faith he offered him up,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Heb. 11.19.</note> 
                           <hi>accounting that God was able to raise him up even from the Dead: From whence also he received him in a Figure.</hi> How did <hi>Job</hi>'s Patience shine forth, when it came under Exercise, by all those sore and bitter Afflictions he met withal. The greater the Temptation or Trial is, if the Soul can resist it, and bear up under it, the greater Demonstration there is of the Strength and Power of that Grace the Soul possesseth. The Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty shews hereby the Strength and Unmoveableness of Faith, how unconquerable it is, what kind of Omnipotency there is in Grace. He would have all the World know, that a godly Person is in vain assaulted by Friends or Enemies,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Caryl.</hi>
                           </note> by Men or Devils, by Wants and Wounds, tho he be even benighted in his Spirit, tho God himself takes away the Light of his Countenance from him, and runs upon him like a Giant; yet that over all these things God's Grace can make him stand, and cause him to be more than a Conqueror: For in the Book of <hi>Job,</hi> we may say, is an Account given of one of the greatest Battles fought, that ever was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Man and Man, between Man and Hell, between God and Man; yet <hi>Job</hi> went away with Victory. True Grace is often assaulted, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was, nor ever shall be overthrown or conquered.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. God brings his <hi>Jobs</hi> under this severe Dispensation, and then runs upon them like a Giant, that he might convince and reprove Satan, and all wicked Men, that continually slander, vilify, and reproach the Godly, saying, They serve the Lord for their own Ends, and follow him for Loaves; that they attend upon him for an Estate, or for vain Glory, the pleasant and good Things of this World:<note place="margin">Job 1.9.</note> 
                           <hi>Doth</hi> Job <hi>serve God</hi> (saith Satan) <hi>for nought?</hi> He is a very Hypocrite, tho he now seem so godly: No such Zealot as he, but he hath a base and selfish End and Design in all he doth: If God do but run upon him like a Giant, and strip him of all these worldly Comforts which he enjoys, you will then see what becomes of his Religion: <hi>He will curse God to his face.</hi> The Lord did on purpose cause these things to be acted,<note place="margin">Job 2.5.</note> and to come upon <hi>Job,</hi> for ever to stop the Mouth of Satan and his Servants; to shew, that his Children follow him for the Love they bear to him, and for the Excellency they find in him, and in his Ways, and from that Bond and Duty that is incumbent upon them. — Tho he strip them naked of all they have, yet they will cleave to him.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. God ran thus upon his Servant <hi>Job,</hi> that he might become an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Patience and Sufferings to future Generations; and that God's People might hence have wherewith to sustain themselves under killing, severe Dispensations, and not faint when they are rebuked of God: For if God thus deals with his beloved <hi>Jobs,</hi> let no Soul give up their Hope, or utterly despair, who are under the sorest and most amazing Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations of the Almighty.<note place="margin">Rom. 15 4</note> 
                           <hi>Whatsoever was written afore-time, was written for our Instruction, that we through Patience, and Comfort of the Scriptures, might have Hope.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Jam. 5.10.</note> 
                           <hi>Take, my Brethren, the Prophets,</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>who have spoken unto you in the Name of the Lord, for an Example of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Affliction, and of Patience.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. God thus deals with his dear Children in this World, to increase and add to their Glory in the World to come. Afflictions here will not go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Reward hereafter. No Believer shall lose by suffering hard things according to the Will of God. He doth it not simply for his own Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, but for our Profit, that we might be Partakers of his Holiness.

                           <hi>Though at present no Affliction seemeth joyous, but grievous, nevertheless after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it yieldeth the peaceable Fruit of Righteousness to them that are exercised thereby.</hi> And hence <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Our light Affliction,</hi>

                                    </p>
                                    <p n="2">II. God, when he comes forth to spoil a People or Nation for their Sins, will not spare the Rich more than the Poor, the King more than the Peasant: All must expect to taste alike of the same Cup. As they have sinned together, they must all suffer together.</p>
                                    <p n="3">III. God will not come upon a holy and godly People and Nation, to spoil and destroy like a Moth, those that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to keep themselves pure and clean from the Dust and Filth of Sin, and the Corruptions of this World; such need not fear, that God will be as a Moth to them.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV. God sometimes comes secretly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a People, in a way of Wrath; he sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes them on a sudden, comes on them,

as Travail upon a Woman with Child. They have thought themselves safe from Danger, and suddenly dreadful Confusion breaketh out against them: Peace may be on the Night, but Horror in the Morning.</p>

But this would not do neither; he therefore goes on with another Gradation: <hi>I have smitten you with Blasting and Mildew: When your Gardens, Vineyards, and your Fig-Trees, and your Olive-Trees encreased, the Palmer-Worm devoured them: Yet have you not returned unto me, saith the Lord.</hi> Therefore he brought upon them <hi>the Pestilence, after the manner of</hi> Egypt; <hi>and overthrew some of them, as God overthrew</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah.

God lets out his Wrath and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure so insensibly, that Sinners per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it not a long time; yet they decay, and grow weak, and their Beauty, Strength, and Glory falls off: They seem outwardly amiable and in a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and say with <hi>Sampson,</hi> (when his Locks were cut off, and his Strength gone) <hi>I will rise up as at other times</hi>; but quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find themselves another People, and that God has forsaken them.

                           <p>First, God is a <hi>Moth</hi> in the Spirits of a People: There is a secret way of God's Wrath upon their Spirits, which is not perceived.<note place="margin">

                              </note> a Sordidness of Spirit, minding low things, not regarding any worthy or honourable Atchievement. When People are thus, God is a <hi>Moth</hi> unto them.</p>

                              <pb n="48" facs="tcp:41512:148"/>
3. When <hi>Jealousies</hi> rise in the Spirits of a People one against another, then God is as a <hi>Moth to them.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">3. <hi>Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies &amp; Divisions</hi>
                              </note> As we know, a Moth in a Garment makes the Thread not hang firm and close together, but divides them one from another, by making Holes in the Cloth: Even thus secret Jealousies and Divisions in a Kingdom consume and destroy them.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. <hi>Base Compliance</hi> in Men for their own Ends, and Falseness of Spirits in the Trust committed to them,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Self-Love.</hi>
                              </note> especially those that are put in publick Places. When these things appear among a People, God may be said to be as a Moth unto them in their Spirits.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, God may be as a <hi>Moth</hi> in Mens Councels.</p>
                           <p>As first, in their Blindness, that they may not see the Plots of their Enemies. They know not their own Advantages, nor how to improve the Opportunity they have in their Hands. They shall not hit upon right Ways and Means, to secure themselves from their impending Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. There shall be Perplexities and Contradictions in their Councels, one counselling one way, others another way. They shall ensnare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and be blasted in their own Councels. And all this while God doth not appear in an outward and hostile way against them, but there is a Curse upon them; and thus the Lord is as a <hi>Moth</hi> unto them.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly; God is as a Moth to a People in their Estates and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce one with another. There shall be a Decay of Trade amongst them; they shall grow poorer and poorer, and no Man knows how. They sow much, and bring in little; they earn Wages, and put it into a Bag with Holes. There shall be a secret Curse upon their Tradings and Estates, that no Man can give a Reason of it.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly; God is a <hi>Moth</hi> in the chief Instruments made use of for publick Good. He takes away chief and worthy Persons, and few take notice of it. One is removed one way, and some in another; and those that remain, either want Abilities, or else they are treacherous. And if there be any wise and honest left, they are either blasted, or by one way or another, not in a capacity to do any Good. And when 'tis thus with a Kingdom, God may be said to be as a <hi>Moth</hi> unto them.</p>
                           <p>Fifthly; God may be said to be a <hi>Moth</hi> in the Treasure and Strength of a Nation. There shall be a great Charge upon the People, and much shall be gathered together, but none shall know how 'tis spent, it shall moulder away: So that every one shall complain of the Burden, and what goeth from him; but no Body almost can see what it comes to.</p>
                           <p>Sixthly; God is a Moth unto a People in their Religion, (I mean, by suffering a <hi>secret Curse</hi> to be upon them) so that their Religion should be corrupted, and their Wine mix'd with Water, their Silver with Dross.</p>
                           <p>That whilst they hoped to see Religion more pure, and refined from Popish Mixtures, and other Errors and Corruptions, they shall in a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual way be invaded with greater Darkness and Confusion, and not well perceive the Wrath and Curse of God that is upon them, by being as a Moth in this respect unto them.</p>

                        <div type="inferences">
                           <head>Inferences.</head>
                           <p n="1">1. NO People ought to think themselves secure, because God appears not presently in the height of his Displeasure against them. He may let out his Wrath in little things, (a Moth is a small thing) and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds but a little way; takes a Step or two with them in a way of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and then waits a while, to see what the Effects are. He can by
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41512:148"/>
little things, in a secret and insensible way, spoil and utterly undo a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or a particular Soul. There may be much Poison in little Drops; so the Wrath of God may be upon thee like a Moth, in things that thou mindest not; for small and contemptible Things, as Lice and Flies, proved a great Plague unto the <hi>Egyptians.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">2. Our own Filth and Corruption within us breeds our Trouble, and is the Cause of our Undoing. What is it that makes way for the Moth and Rottenness to seize on Wooll or Garments? Is it not the Carelesness and Negligence of Persons, in not looking after them, and not making use of fit things to keep them clean, and prevent the Danger that arises from this Worm? The Moth (as Naturalists tell us) breeds in the Cloth; take heed of inward Filth and Pollution: If you keep not your Hearts by fit means clean, the Moth will come, and Rottenness take hold on you.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. God is slow in Wrath, he punishes by degrees; he exercises much Patience, ere he destroys a People utterly; before he breaks forth as a Lion or Bear upon them, he is as a Moth.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. God hath secret Judgments to execute upon a People, or particular Person: If this was not so, why should he speak of his being <hi>as a Moth</hi> unto <hi>Ephraim?</hi> Let us take heed of secret Sins, lest God consume us by secret Judgments.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. What a mean and inconsiderable Creature is a Man, yea, a Kingdom, that so small a thing as a Moth is said to destroy and consume them? God in expressing himself thus to be as a Moth and Rottenness, speaks with a kind of Contempt against the Pride of <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Judah:</hi>
                              <note place="margin">☜</note> 
                              <hi>They were haughty and proud</hi>; but God, to abase and humble them, tells them,<note place="margin">Job 4.19.</note> a Worm as it were should spoil their Beauty, and destroy them. 'Tis said of Man, <hi>His Foundation is in the Dust, and he is crushed before the Moth.</hi> Indeed, to be crushed before a Lion is not so much; but that he should be eat up and devoured by a Moth, this shews what poor, weak, and feeble things, Men and Kingdoms are. What little reason is there for Men to swell in Pride, and high aspiring Thoughts of themselves, when alas! God is able to cause Lice or Worms to destroy them in a Moment? yea, by as weak and contemptible a thing as a Moth, God can externally or actually make use of to destroy (if he please) the greatest People in the World: be they never so proud and haughty, they are not able to defend themselves from the smallest Creature; a Worm or Moth may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume them.</p>

                        <p>BY the Scope and Meaning of this Parable, it appears, that GOD the Father is that Housholder intended in this Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Because it was he that planted the Vineyard. We take Vineyard for the World, or the State of the Jews in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>

                        <p n="4">4. It was God who sent the Prophets, Judges, Apostles, Priests, and Kings to receive the Fruits of them.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. It appears evidently, that it was God who sent his Son to the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-Men, who killed him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>The Word <hi>Housholder</hi> imports three things:

A good and wise Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, when any are obstinate, withdraws the Manifestation of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Goodness, Favour, and Delight; for if after all good Means used fruitlesly, they will not be reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, then he frowns on them, and cannot shew his Countenance as at other Times.</p>

                                    <p n="1">I. THat God is the first Author, that gives Being to Matter, Form, and Order, is so great and evident a Truth, evinced by Scripture and Reason, that none can deny it without shaking the very Foundation of Heaven and Earth, and of all true Piety and Religion: For all things that do appear, were produced by some Cause pre-existent, or else they did cause themselves; which last cannot be, because then they must be before themselves, which is a monstrous Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. See the ancient Records of the World, and all things therein, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.</p>
                                    <p n="2">II. God, the most great and good Housholder, seeing it very needful and convenient, hath built a House for the Commodity of his Family, yea, many Houses, suitable to the distinct Parts of his Family, which is very great: One House fit for Angels, and the Souls of Saints, that is, Heaven; one for Men, even the Earth; one for a Nursing-House to the Off-spring of his Family, and that is his Church, which is the <hi>House of the Living God,</hi>
                                       <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.15.</note> the Nursing-House for his Heirs and eldest Sons. These things have his Hands begun and finished. <hi>He that built all things is God.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="3">III. God did not think it meet to be alone, in the Enjoiment of perfect Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness in himself, and therefore hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into Covenant with himself, Angels and Men; and for this end was Jesus Christ set up from everlasting, to <hi>gather together in himself, both things in Heaven, and things on Earth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV. Thus God, the great and good Housholder hath done. He hath made nothing in vain, but hath fitted each Creature with Natures, to do Work suitable to their proper Station: The Angels to dwell in Heaven, to praise in Heaven, to flie through Heaven, to come down into the Air, to visit the Earth, and view the Sons of Men: Men are fitted to look up to Heaven, to pray, to reade, to contemplate, to reverence God, to propagate, to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41512:153"/>
replenish the Earth: Beasts are fitted for Labour and Service, as the Horse, the Mule, the Ox, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Sheep, with all other Creatures, receive Influence from his great and good Spirit, so as to come to the Place where their Prey is, and where they are to be taken for assigned Use.</p>
                                    <p n="5">V. God, the great and good Houshol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, hath set all things in Order, both in the upper and lower World; who is not a <hi>God of Confusion, but of Order, in all the People of his Family.</hi>
                                       <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.33. 1 Col. 1.16. Eph. 1.20, 21.</note> Christ his First-born is not only King, even the King of the Earth, but the King of Angels; he is the Head of all Principalities and Powers; Angels next to him, above Men; Men, God's Representatives and Vicegerents, above Women: The Man is the Head of the Woman, Parents the Head of their Off-spring, and Children above Servants, and all these above the Beasts of the Field, or creeping Things of the Earth.</p>
                                    <p n="6">VI. Even thus hath God, the great and good Housholder, done to all his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. He hath appointed his First-born to be a Mediator, a Priest, an Advocate, to influence the Gospel and Word; his Angels, to protect; his People in Love to serve one another, and bear one anothers Burthens; Women to bear Children, and nurse them, and to be meet Helps to their Husbands; Parents to love their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Children to honour their Parents; Servants and Subjects to obey their Supreme; and all these to adore God, and obey the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
                                    <p n="7">VII. God, this great Housholder, hath made Provision for his great and large Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily: <hi>The Eyes of all things look up and trust in him, he gives them their Meat in due season: In my Fathers House is Meat enough, and to spare.</hi> Heavenly <hi>Manna,</hi> as Meat and Food for Angels; heavenly Food, as the Bread of Life for the Saints; earthly Food, as Corn, Wine and Oil, for Men; Grass and Herbs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as Meat for Beasts, <hi>&amp;c. His Hand gives all things needful.</hi> If in the House, he feeds them; if in the Field, he feeds them, and fills them with good things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="8">VIII. God keeps his Place in Heaven: Tho Angels fall out, and go to War; tho Men differ, the Heavens shake, the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains remove, the Winds bluster, the Waves of the Sea roar and rage; yet the Lord is in Heaven, and he beholds all Disorders of Men, and still keeps his Place in perfect Tranquillity, and moves not; for the Good of his whole Houshold depends upon it; for if it were possible for the immoveable God to leave his Place, all would become a Piece of Confusion.</p>
                                    <p n="9">IX. God, the wise Housholder, hath set out the Church for a Vineyard and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, digg'd a Wine-Press,<note place="margin">Isa. 5.1.</note> and built a Tower; the World for a plowed Field;

God, the great and wise Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, teacheth, instructeth, gives forth his Law, shews them what is good, and required of them; charges his Family to walk by the Examples of the Best, to walk in Wisdom, to give no Offence, to hold fast that which is good. God is troubled (as it were) and angry at great Miscarriages, and unseemly Actions, grieved (if I may with Reverence so speak) at his very Heart, with particular Instruments, angry with not only some, but even the whole Houshold, when the Offenders will not reform.</p>
                                    <p n="12">XII. God loved all his Creation; when he looked upon it, and saw all to be good, he could do no otherwise, Angels, Men, Beasts, creeping Things, Fowls, and all inanimate Things. The Church he loves on new Terms: <hi>The Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and believed that I came forth from God.</hi>

                                    <p n="14">XIV. God hath to Admiration shew'd his Patience and Long-suffering to his Church, to the whole World, to the whole Families of the Earth: He gave the old World one hundred and twenty Years, bore long with the Murmurers of <hi>Israel</hi> in the Wilderness, was forty Years grieved, suffered <hi>Jerusalem</hi> long before the first Captivity, longer before the last by the <hi>Romans</hi>; gives <hi>Jezebel,</hi> and Mystery <hi>Babylon,</hi> Time and Space; spared a sinful World in general, above five thousand Years.</p>

A Consuming Fire is very dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal; when it breaks out in a Town or City, what a frightful Cry it causeth! what wringing of the Hands! Men tremble, Women miscarry, Children screech out: It frightens the Fowls of the Air, the Beasts of the Earth; it turns all Faces into Paleness, and makes the Inhabitants to run together in Heaps, in Confusion. How amazing were the Flames of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and how ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible is the Burning of Mount <hi>Aetna!</hi>

but Horror and Amazement is in the Streets.</p>

                                    <p n="4">IV. A consuming Fire destroys exceedingly, it overthrows famous Cities, burns down Houses; it makes your Marbles, and other curious wrought Stones and Bricks, to flie; it lays all desolate before it, and makes a fenced City become as a ruinous Heap. What Ruin did it make on <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and the Cities about them?

                                    <p n="8">VIII. Fire, of all Elements, doth most cruelly and dreadfully torment. If a Man or Woman be cast into a Fire, what intolerable Pain and Anguish doth it put them to! Hence the bloody Persecutors have found out, by their Diabolical Art, those Cruelties, to burn in dreadful Fires the Bodies of God's Children, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they could not put them to more exquisite Pain and Torment: Yea, and the Punishment of the Damned is set forth by <hi>Fire,</hi> because nothing is more terrible to think upon, than to be cast into a Furnace of Fire; tho natural Fire be so dreadful, yet Hell-Fire is much more dreadful and tormenting.</p>

                           <p n="6">6.

Again, the Will is aimed

at, some Temptations are laid to catch that: Some Commands of God cannot be obeyed without much Self-denial, because they cross us in that which our own Wills are naturally carried out very strongly to desire; so that we must deny our Wills be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can do the Will of God. A Temptation comes very forcibly, when it runs with the Tide of our own Wills, when 'tis to save our Estates, Children, or Lives, from the Danger of Enemies. What? saith the Devil, wilt thou serve God, when he thwarts thee in every thing that thou takest delight in? If thou lovest any one thing more than another, presently he must have it from thee: No Lamb in all the Flock will serve for a Sacrifice, but <hi>Isaac, Abraham</hi>'s only Child, must be offered up:<note place="margin">Gen. 22.2.</note> No Place will content God, that <hi>Abraham</hi> should serve him in, but where he must live in Banishment from his Father's House, and all his dear Relations: Wilt thou, saith Satan, stoop to these low and contemptible Ordinances, be a Companion to these base, despised, and persecuted People? What? follow God, and yield to such hard Terms as these be? Now God directs himself strait-way by his Word and Spirit, to preserve the Soul from this terrible Arrow, shewing what reason there is that his VVill should be done rather than ours,<note place="margin">Mat. 19.29.</note> and that we shall lose nothing by suffering for his sake; and so makes the Soul willing to yield to all his Pleasure, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did. And this indeed of God's being a <hi>Shield</hi> unto him, was the Motive that induced him not to fear: <hi>After these things the Word of God came unto</hi> Abraham <hi>in a Vision, saying,</hi>

                                       <hi>Fear not,</hi> Abraham, <hi>I am thy Shield</hi>; as much as if he should say, I will defend and save thee from all the Darts and Arrows of thine Enemies. By this <hi>Shield,</hi> every Faculty of the Soul, and Grace of the Spirit is preserved.</p>

                                    <p n="4">IV. God is a Defence to his Church, and 'tis He who offends and discomfits their Enemies: <hi>I will undo them that afflict thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                                    <p n="5">V. God, in being a Defence, or Wall of Fire to his People, greatly amazeth and terrifieth the ungodly and brutish Persecutors; how terrible was God to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when he was a Wall of Fire to <hi>Israel!</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="6">VI. It is a very dangerous thing for any to make Attempts upon God. Who is able to stand before such a Wall of fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and devouring Fire? Wicked Men

                                    <p n="8">VIII. Nothing can keep off cruel and merciless Men, from making a Spoil of God's Church, but God himself: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science cannot, the Cry of the Widow and fatherless Children, no, nor the Fear of Hell. Therefore God walls his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple round about in a wonderful manner, that Men cannot find, nor come at them.</p>
                                    <p n="9">IX. Those that have God for a Wall of Fire, are secured from all the cold Blasts of Sin and Temptation, are sweetly refreshed and comforted; for such is the property of this Wall of Fire also unto them.</p>
                                    <p n="10">X. Those that see they have God as a Wall of Fire round about them, are thereby made very valiant and couragious, saying, <hi>I will not fear what Man can do unto me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>GOD is really and properly a Judg, for he is the Judg of all the World, and therefore he is not brought here under the Notion of a <hi>Metaphorical Judg:</hi> But in regard this Term seems to be allusive to <hi>Earthly Judges,</hi> we think it may not be unprofitable to draw a Parallel, for the Edification of the Reader.</p>
                        <p>As there is nothing more frequently attributed to Almighty God in the Holy Scriptures, than the Title of <hi>Judg</hi>; so there is scarce any Attribute or Action of the Most High grounded upon more Reason: Of which take this following Account.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. There is in the World, <hi>viz.</hi> on the whole Earth, a great and mighty People, for Number like to the Stars of Heaven, or Sands by the Sea-Shore.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. There this numerous People are almost as various in their Humors, as they are in their Numbers, Ages, Sizes, and Complections: 'Tis very rare, if not impossible, to find two that in all Points do exactly accord.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That this numberless Multitude are all addicted to run byass to a particular thing call'd Self-love; and this too from an indissoluble Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple or Impression of Nature: 'Tis natural for all Men to love them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                        <p n="4">
                           <pb n="79" facs="tcp:41512:164"/>4. That after they are grown up to some degree of Ripeness and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, they have ready prepared to their Eyes the bad Examples of ill-living Souls, which too often have too great an Influence upon green and tender Plants, to winde them into extreme and irregular Designs and Motions.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. There is, by Divine permission, a most troublesom and pernicious Adversary, suffered to range up and down the whole Earth, to try his Art and Skill, how far he can prevail to bring this vast Body into Tumult and Disorder; and 'tis not seldom that he doth prevail, to divide not only Emperors, Kings, Princes, Judges, Nobles, and Peasants; but Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, Principalities, Cities, Corporations, Villages, Families, Brothers, Sisters, Husbands, Wives, Fathers, and their own Children.</p>
                        <p>Now these things being premised, what unspeakable need is there of one supreme and universal Judg, to curb Exorbitancies, to umpire, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, and put a period to Dissentions! Without whose Moderation, the World would be intolerably perplexed, harrassed and plagued with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual and endless Wars, Broils, Disorders and Confusions; and would hardly keep its station for any long Period of Time. For the moderating and preventing of all which, the God of the whole Earth hath underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to <hi>associate with the Rulers,</hi> and to <hi>judg amongst the Gods:</hi> In which Passage he is represented to us by the Similitude of a <hi>Judg,</hi> which carries a lively Figure and Resemblance of the Supreme Lord of the whole Earth, and that in these divers respects following.</p>

                                    <p n="4">
                                       <pb n="80" facs="tcp:41512:165"/>IV. In this the Lord, the great Judg, is beyond comparison; for he <hi>dwells with Prudence, and finds out Knowledg of witty Inventions</hi>; his Ways are perfect altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. His Actions are so fitly timed, that he doth nothing out of season: 'Tis in due season he delivers the Needy, aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the Cause of his Elect, and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully rewards the proud Doers.</p>
                                    <p n="5">V. The chief Judg of all the Earth hath an ancient Statute-Book, that is sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to all Times and Seasons, to all Ages, Sexes, Conditions, and Constitutions of Men whatever: Every part of it is tried and proved, and found to be a <hi>perfect Law,</hi> in which are contained <hi>wondrous Things,</hi>
                                       <note place="margin">Psal. 19.7. Psal. 119.1 Psal. 119.142.</note> ever free from Deceit and Falshood. 'Tis marvellous pleasant and refreshing, sweeter than Honey, or the Honey-Comb; the Delight of good Men; a sure Guide to them in all their Ways; and none of its Commands are grievous, but all Duties required by it are reasonable.</p>
                                    <p n="6">VI. In this there is none so holy and upright as the Lord, who is no Respecter of Persons, hates flattering Words, and giving of Bribes; will spare none for the Dignity of their Birth, or Antiquity of their Lineage; but will do Justice accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Right and Law, whether it be upon Angels, Emperors, Kings, Princes, Priests, Prophets; his Church, that are his professed Friends, as well as upon the World, his professed Enemies. He will destroy his own anointed Ones, if they stand in opposition to Justice and Equity. Cities, Kingdoms, Towers, Temples, all shall fall, rather than Law and Justice be justled out of place. He spared not Angels, overthrew Kings, mighty Kings, with Kingdoms and Nations, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt, Og</hi> King of <hi>Bashan, Nebuchadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Babylon, Darius</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> King of <hi>Greece; Herod</hi> King of <hi>Judea; Jerusalem and Samaria,</hi> with both their Kings. When once they come to be laid in the Ballance, and the Lord en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Judgment with them; when he <hi>ties Judgment to the Line, and Righteousness to the Plummet: Noah, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> shall not save, when Truth, Law, and Justice calls for a cutting off. He will by no means spare the Guilty, when the Time of Forbearance is expired.</p>
                                    <p n="7">VII. Of this no Man shall have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to accuse God, for he will not do more than is right, that Man should enter into Judgment with his Maker; nay, he will rather make abatement, than over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do. And this hath been owned in his Act of Judgment: <hi>Thou hast not dealt with us according to our Iniquities.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="7">VII. In this case the Lord our Judg hath sufficiently approved himself; first, in respect of the Old World; secondly, in respect of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> where he would take nothing upon Trust, but

                                       <hi>I will destroy Man from the Face of the Earth</hi>; and 'twas done. <hi>Pharaoh and his Host, that thou hast seen this day, thou shalt see no more for ever. Because thou didst not restrain thy Sons, I have rejected thee from being a Priest. Because thou hast caused my Name to be blasphemed, the Sword shall not depart from thy House.</hi> Because <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was <hi>lifted up with Pride,</hi> he shall be <hi>driven from his Throne.</hi>

                                    </p>
                                    <p n="10">X. As for God, his Way is not only perfect, and his Word tried; but he is of one Mind, and there is none can turn him, in a Case of Right, Truth, and Justice. His Councel shall stand; for he <hi>is not as the Son of Man, that he should repent. With him is no variableness,</hi>

                                    <p n="11">XI. In this <hi>Jehovah</hi> is not behind-hand, for he is a God with whom the Fatherless find Mercy,<note place="margin">Hos. 14.3.</note> pities the Poor when he sees they have no Helper, breaks the Teeth of the old and young Lion, smites the Enemy upon the Cheek-Bone,<note place="margin">Psal. 4.7.</note> avengeth their Cause when they crie to him, and hath destroyed them, and their Posterity, who made long Prayers to devour Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows Houses.</p>
                                    <p n="12">XII. The Almighty hath a great and mighty People under him, even all the Inhabitants of the World, <hi>Europe, Asia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>America.</hi> He is God of all the Kingdoms of the World,<note place="margin">Psal. 24.1.

                                    <p n="13">XIII. In this our high and mighty Judg doth overmatch all other Judges; for he is provided with Legions of Angels, all ready to observe his Dictates, and obey his Commands. The Devils are all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to him; so that if he say, <hi>Go,</hi> they go; <hi>Do this,</hi> and they do it. Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Men are under his Influence; and as many Fowls of the Air, Beasts of the Field, and creeping Things of the Earth, to do his Will, to execute his Judgments; when he speaks the word, or lifts up his hand to them. They shall invade the Courts of Kings, enter the Chambers of Princes, fetch Emperors off their Thrones, bring them to Chains, Blocks, and Gibbets, when he passes Sentence, and gives Orders to do it.</p>

                                       <pb n="82" facs="tcp:41512:166"/>XIV. God is to be feared, not only as a Creator, who can annihilate and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve, make Men cease to be; as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who can love and rebuke; as a Lord, who can command, and give Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: but as a Judg, who can punish in this World,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.24.</note> and bring Mens Sins before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand to Judgment.</p>
                                    <p n="15">XV. With God is terrible Majesty,<note place="margin">Job 37.22.</note> and he rideth upon the high Places of the Earth.</p>
                                    <p n="16">XVI. God doth often reprieve and put off the Execution of Sentence, so that Delinquents are not speedily executed, but a Time given them to consider their ways.<note place="margin">Gen. 6.3.</note> The old World had one hundred and twenty years given them, before Judgment was executed. <hi>Judea, Jerusalem,</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> continued a long time, before the Fury of the Almighty broke out upon them.</p>
                                    <p n="17">XVII. God sometimes gives Orders to Angels to punish, and execute his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, when Men are out of the reach of human Hands; as in the case of <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi> the Host of the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> the King. Tho great Men join hand in hand for Wickedness,<note place="margin">Act. 12.23</note> yet shall they not go unpunished.</p>
                                    <p n="18">XVIII. God will punish those that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self employs, in case they exceed their Commission in any case that concerns his Act of Justice. He punished <hi>Assyria</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi>
                                       <note place="margin">Isa. 47.6.</note> for going beyond their Bounds in his own Works of Judgment against the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="19">XIX. God, the great Judg, doth vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate his own Honour, and the Justice of the Laws he executes, by giving Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the People to testify against him,<note place="margin">Jer. 2.5. Ezek 18.25.</note> if they have wherewith to accuse; and demands of them what Evil their Fathers have seen in him; requires them to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy to his Face, if his Ways are in any point unequal.</p>
                                    <p n="20">XX. God, when he comes forth in a way of Judgment, doth not execute the fierceness of his Wrath; he is far from rendring to Men more than they deserve; he doth not reward according to their full demerit,<note place="margin">Hab. 3.2.</note> but in the midst of Judgment remembers Mercy.</p>
                                    <p n="21">XXI. God hath assigned an Advocate to plead, before he proceeds to Judgment. <hi>If any Man sin,</hi>

                                       <pb n="83" facs="tcp:41512:166"/>XXII. God hath not only made Laws, and published them, and will judg Men for wilful and reiterated Rebellions; but keeps a Register for the great Day, to be then opened; as it is written, <hi>Some Mens Sins go before-hand to Judgment, and they that are otherwise cannot be hid. The Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall sit, and the Books shall be opened, and the Dead shall be judged out of those things which are written in the Books.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="23">XXIII. God never judges alone: The Son is with him, the holy Spirit is with him; the Angels, and whole Court of Heaven do acquiesce in the Judgments that he executes.</p>
                                    <p n="24">XXIV. God, when he peremptorily pronounces Judgment, without reserve, it stands, and must abide. If he say, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Host shall be seen no more for ever; <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Glory of the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dean</hi> Kingdom, shall be overthrown; <hi>Israel</hi> shall be removed; the Land shall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken of both her Kings: If he publish the Decree, there is no changing his Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations; his Judgment is like the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians.

                                    <p n="6">VI. A Mediator ought to be a Well-wisher to Peace, a Person that loves it, and longs after it; nothing being more acceptable to him, than to be a Peace-maker.</p>
                                    <p n="7">VII. A Mediator must have the great Transaction of making Peace committed to him, or be invested with full Power and Authority to do it.</p>
                                    <p n="8">VIII. A Mediator ought to be a condescending Person, not to have his own Will to be done in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, further than the Nature of the Cause will require it.</p>

                                    <p n="13">XIII. A Mediator ought to be endued with much Patience, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Long-suffering; not only bearing Frowns from one Party, or the other, but also in his long wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon either of them, to yield to Terms of Peace offered to them.</p>
                                    <p n="14">XIV. A Mediator must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted and couragious, unweari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not tired out, nor let the Work fall.</p>

                                    <p n="16">XVI. A Mediator hath usually a set Time prefixed, finally to finish and accomplish his Work.</p>

                                    <p n="19">XIX. A Mediator is made sole Judg in those great Matters he is chosen about, and is to make righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Decision between Party and Party, and to give the definitive Sentence at last.</p>

In this the infinite Grace and Mercy of God was manifest to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; for among Men, the Creditor is not concerned to seek out a Security from the Debtor: But should a Creditor do so, all must confess, 'tis in his Choice to propound when, how, and upon what Terms the Debtor should be discharged; and it would be thought very reasonable, (especially if he hath wronged or abused the good Name of his Creditor) that before he be acquitted, he should be brought upon his Knees, and humbly confess his Fault, and beg Forgiveness, in regard, tho a Compensation was made (according to the Demands of Law and Justice for the Debt) yet the Surety being of the Creditor's own procurement, and indeed his own Son, who having vast Riches and Abilities, (and likewise equal Love with the Father to the poor Debtor, knowing the Law was such, that Satisfaction must of necessity be made) offered freely to lay down the Price or full Sum. Even so God and Christ, in making of this Covenant in behalf of Sinners, agreed (that upon Christ's laying down his Life as a satisfactory Price) when, and upon what Conditions, we should be
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41512:172"/>
discharged of the Guilt of Sin, which binds us over to eternal Wrath: And these Conditions are expressed in the Word of God, <hi>viz.</hi> Faith and Humiliation; for 'tis certain that no Man is actually acquitted before he believes, and takes hold of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction purchased by Christ, applying his Merits, and the Virtue of his Blood, unto his own Soul, by the help of the Spirit, which Christ (the Surety) hath promised to give to all sincere Ones, that he might thereby make his Death effectual to them, and so compleat his Work and Office of Suretiship.</p>
                                    <p n="2">II. Christ engaged as our Surety with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us. Our Bonds and Obligations sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify nothing, by reason of our utter Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; Christ hath therefore changed our Name, and in the room and place of it put his own, so that Death and the Curse fall upon him:<note place="margin">Isa. 53.6. Isa. 63.5.</note> 
                                       <hi>He was wounded for our Transgressions. He looked, and there was none to help; therefore, his own Arm brought Salvation.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="3">III. Christ, the Surety of the Covenant of Grace, makes full Compensation for Sin, and yet the Sinner receives his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease in a way of Grace; which may be thus demonstrated: <hi>First,</hi> God, as was said, and not the Sinner, found or provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Surety, which his own Sovereign Grace and Goodness moved him to, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly at his own choice whether he would save Man or no, having cause enough to cast him off for his Disobedience, as he did the Angels that sinned: So that whatever Relief or Discharge Sinners receive, it is of Grace, being wholly the Contrivance of the Creditor, to find out the way which best comported (in his Wisdom) to the satisfying of Law and Justice, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Criminal; had the Debtor found the Surety, as 'tis among Men, the Case had been otherwise. <hi>Secondly</hi>; The Suretiship of Christ holds forth abundant Grace, yea, the greatest demonstration of the Love and Goodness of God to Sinners, in that he was pleased to dispence with his own Law, as to the rigorous exaction of it from Sinners, and to take satisfaction from another, which he might have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted from them. <hi>Thirdly</hi>; That he might bring about Redemption and Pardon for Man, he parted with his own dear Son, who laid down his Life, to atone, and make Reconciliation between him and Sinners. <hi>Fourthly</hi>; In that the Blessing and Benefit of Christ's Undertaking as our Surety, is given and bestowed freely upon us, so that we have no more to do, but to fall down on our Knees, and humbly acknowledg our Offences, and accept of a Pardon through Christ's Mediation, and own him to be our Prince and Saviour. <hi>Fifthly</hi>; In that he, as our Surety, gives to us a broken Heart, and renews a right Spirit in us; gives us the Grace of Believing, whereby we come to have an Interest in him, through the Atonement made by his Blood; from whence it appears, 'tis not our Faith, nor our Acceptance of Christ and the Gospel, that makes his Satisfaction so to God, tho it is hereby made effectual unto us.</p>
                                    <p>The Sum of all is this, that Christ did not die only <hi>nostro bono,</hi> for our Good and Profit, as <hi>Socinians</hi> affirm; but in our Stead and Rome; for where one is said to die for another, 'tis always thus taken. Moreover, where 'tis said, Christ bore our Sins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'tis to be understood of the Punishment due to them; for in all places of the Old Testament, where 'tis said, <hi>Thou shalt,</hi> or, <hi>they shall bear their own Sins,</hi> 'tis meant of the Punishment of them. So that if we would be pardoned, we must accept it as God is pleased to offer it to us, tho a compleat Satisfaction be made for Sin, in our Nature, to the Father. And shall we dislike that way of Forgiveness, that God is so much pleased with, wherein he doth not only magnify his own Free-Grace and Goodness, but his own Justice and Holiness also?</p>

                                       <pb n="95" facs="tcp:41512:172"/>IV. Christ became Security for his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Debts, before ever they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, or they themselves born; yea, he was bound to satisfy for all the Debts (of such who do believe in him) that at any time of their Lives should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted; that is to say,<note place="margin">Heb 8.

                                    <p n="5">V. Christ never repented his Surety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; instead of its being a Trouble to his Mind, he delighted in it. <hi>I have a Baptism to be baptized with, and how am I straitned till it be accomplished?</hi>

                                    <p n="6">VI. Christ, tho he suffered hard things for his People, in becoming their Surety, yet was not undone, or brought to utter Beggary thereby; for tho for a time he became poor to make us rich, yet by suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Death he was crowned with Glory and Honour; his Abasement was for his Exaltation; he expended not all his Riches in satisfying for our Sins: Tho he was cast into Prison, (<hi>viz.</hi> brought to the Grave) yet he quickly delivered himself out, by the Powerfulness of the Godhead which dwelt bodily in him.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. FRom hence we may perceive what a miserable Condition Mankind had involv'd themselves in by reason of Sin, utterly impoverish'd, and brought to Beggary, Debtors to God's Justice for the Breach of the Law, owing ten thousand Talents, and not a Farthing to pay;<note place="margin">Mat. 18.24</note> and had been cast into the eternal Prison of Darkness, had not Jesus stept in and become our Surety.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. What Grace and unspeakable Favour is here! How much hath God out-done Mortals! He sought out a Surety to satisfy for our Sins, who were not only ill-natured Debtors, but cursed and most guilty Rebels, who deserved nothing but Death, and Chains of Darkness. Tho he doth not pardon us without a Price, yet rather than we should be without Remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his own Son shall be the Ransom.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Moreover, we may admire the great Mystery of our Redemption! Let Men take heed how they contemn any part of the Depths of God, because they seem to overtop and outdo their depraved Reason.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Here are Tidings of great Joy to broken and undone Sinners. There is a way open for free Commerce and Trading with God again: Tho he did not regard us whilst we stood under the old Covenant, being miserable Beggars and Bankrupts; yet he delights to have Commerce and

Dealing with us in a way of Grace, through the Compact made with Christ our Surety.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Let Saints hold up their drooping Heads and Hearts, their Debts are paid:<note place="margin">Isa. 53.6. Rom. 8.1.</note> 
                              <hi>The Lord hath laid on him the Iniquity of us all. There is now no Condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.</hi>

                           <p n="6">6. Why should any think the Conditions of the Gospel are hard, or Christ's Commands grievous?

                              <hi>First</hi>; By this means we are delivered from the hands of Justice, and Curse of the Law, and Wrath of God: Christ hath redeemed us from the Curse,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.13.</note> being made a Curse for us.</p>

                              <hi>Secondly</hi>; We owe our Covenant-Relation, first, unto God's Grace; and secondly, to Jesus, our blessed Surety and Mediator's undertaking: <hi>I have manifested thy Name to the Men which thou gavest me,</hi>

                                    <p n="2">II. An obedient and wise Son takes advice, and consults with his Father, being fully resolved to change his Condition, and enter into a Contract of Love, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-Union; and then fixes upon a particular Object.</p>

When a Man hath fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Object that he intends to espouse unto himself, he contrives the way and method of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, in making known his Mind, and to bring about his Design; and many times will chuse to send Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers, to treat with the Person about the Business, and discover his Affection, before he goes himself in Person.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV. After this, a Lover usually (his Heart being enflamed with Love and ardent Affection to the Person, tho she be in another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, very far off) takes a Journey, resolving to give her a Visit; and in order thereunto he suits himself in a fit Garb and Cloathing, that so he might every way render himself a Person acceptable, and meet, likely, and capable of winning and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her.</p>
                                    <p n="5">V. If the Person or Suitor be a Prince, and known, commonly at his Arrival he is much congratulated and welcomed, by the Nobility, and Persons of Honour.</p>

                                    <p n="7">VII. A Man propounds Questions to the Person he loves, to discover whether she be preingaged to any

                                    <p n="8">VIII. A Lover makes Offers of Love unto the Person he has fixed his Eye upon, and uses divers Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, to persuade her to yield or consent unto his Request.</p>

One that intends to make a Person his Bride, and only Consort, expresses great Love; his Love is sometimes much more than he can well express; 'tis very strong, as strong as Death; many Waters can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not quench it, nor can the Floods drown it. There is an unsatisfied Desire in the Person, until the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject beloved be enjoyed.</p>
                                    <p n="13">XIII. Such an one is greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned and grieved at the Unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of his Friend, and ungrateful Repulses, and many times from hence doth withdraw himself, and carry it as a Stranger.</p>
                                    <p n="14">XIV. A Suitor nevertheless (such is the Nature of his Affection) knows not how to give her up; he therefore sends Letters, thereby further expressing the Ardency of his Desire, and how loth he is to take his final Farewel.</p>

Jesus Christ having fixed his Eye upon lost and perishing Man, agreed with the Father upon the way and method of Proceeding, what he must do and become, in order to the accomplishment of this glorious Enterprize: And accordingly the Father was pleased, out of his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Grace, in a fit season, to make known his eternal Counsel, and proposed Jesus Christ, the Seed of the Woman, to the Sinner, as an Object of Love; and not only so, but also before he came him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he sent his Messengers, the Prophets, <hi>rising up early, and sending them,</hi> to offer Terms of Love and Friendship,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 36.15.</note> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal his Purpose to them.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV. Jesus Christ after this, such was the greatness of his Love, and strength of his Affection, resolved to take a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to give poor Sinners a most gracious Visit; the Journey he took was long, as far as it is from Heaven to Earth. And that he might accomplish his blessed Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, he fits himself with a Garb accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, laying aside his heavenly Robes, he cloathed himself with our Flesh, or did assume Man's Nature, that so he might every way become a meet Object for the Sinner, and likely to come and enjoy him at last.</p>
                                    <p n="5">V. When the Lord Jesus came into the World, the Angels of God, who had knowledg of him, in an heavenly way of Congratulation, magnified the Most High: <hi>And suddenly there was with the Angel a Multitude of the Heavenly Host,</hi>

                                    <p n="6">VI.

                                    <p n="9">IX. Jesus Christ loves poor Sinners, not for any thing he sees in them, not for Beauty, Riches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For naturally Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind hath nothing that may render them any way desirable in Christ's eye; he might see enough in them to loath them, but nothing to love them.</p>

Jesus Christ sues hard, is very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate, uses many powerful and weighty Arguments to prevail with Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to accept of the Terms of Grace, and join in an holy Contract of Love with him. 1. One is taken from the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his Person, being the <hi>Root and Off-spring of David; David's Lord,</hi> as well as <hi>David's Son.

His great Abasement and Condescension. 5. From his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering: <hi>I lay down my Life for my Sheep.</hi> Can there be a greater Argument than this? 6.

Iniquities. How long did infinite Patience wait upon the old World? was it not one hundred and twenty Years? and forty Years upon <hi>Israel</hi> in the Wilderness: <hi>I have</hi> (saith he) <hi>spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious People.</hi>
                                       <note place="margin">Isa. 65.2.</note> But if he prevails at last, he thinks nothing too much that he has suffered for Sinners. He waits at the Door of his Spouse, <hi>until his Head is wet with Dew, and his Locks with the Drops of the Night</hi>;<note place="margin">Cant. 5.2.</note> yet does he not think all too much.</p>
                                    <p n="12">XII. Jesus Christ doth express and manifest great Love to Sinners, which he intends to take into Covenant-Relation with himself. His Love, like <hi>Nilus,</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flows all Banks and Bounds; his Grace is without Limits, beyond the Love of <hi>Jonathan</hi> to <hi>David.</hi> What doth the Gospel shew or express more plainly, than the Strength of Christ's Love to Sinners?

                                    <p n="13">XIII. Jesus Christ is greatly troubled at the ungrateful Repulses he meets with from Sinners; which appears, 1. By his being grieved: <hi>He was grieved because of the Hardness of their Hearts. When he drew near to</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>he wept over it,</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving how basely they had slighted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected him. 2.

By hiding of his Face, and bringing Afflictions upon them: <hi>I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledg their Offences, and seek my Face:</hi>

                                    <p n="14">XIV.

                           <p n="1">I. WE may infer from hence, how infinitely Sinners are obliged and beholden unto God, in providing such a great and good Match for them. Did ever any King manifest such Kindness to vile and wicked Traytors, as to send his own Son to die for them, that they might be interested in all the Blessings of his Court and Kingdom? God propounds Christ to us as a Spouse and Bridegroom.</p>
                           <p n="2">II. Moreover, how infinitely are we obliged to Jesus Christ, for bearing such good-will unto us, to pass by the fallen Angels, and fix his Eye upon poor fallen Man; to come into the World, and expose himself to all those base Affronts, Shame, Sorrow, and Death it self, that he might accomplish this glorious Design of Love and Marriage-Union with us!</p>
                           <p n="3">III. It shews what great Folly, and horrid Ingratitude, those Sinners are guilty of, that slight and contemn this Offer. Which may lead you to consider:</p>
                           <p n="1">1. What is your State without Christ? If you have not Christ, what have you? No Life, no Light, no Pardon, no Peace, no God, no Glory. You are without all true Good, if you are without God and Christ. <hi>Sine summo bono, nihil bonum.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="1">
                              <pb n="106" facs="tcp:41512:178"/>(1.) Is it not Folly to prefer Bondage to Sin and Satan, before a Marriage-State with Jesus Christ? rather be the Devil's Slave and Vassal, than Jesus Christ's dearest Consort?</p>
                           <p n="2">(2.) Is it not great Folly to refuse such an Offer, that will make you happy for ever, if embraced, and when there is no other way of being happy? If this Offer be rejected, thou art undone, and must be damned.</p>
                           <p n="3">(3.) Is it not great Folly to value the Lusts of the Flesh, and Pleasures of this World, above Christ? to value the greatest Evil above the chiefest Good?</p>
                           <p n="2">2. 'Tis great Ingratitude. Hath Christ done all this, and wilt thou slight him at last? Shall he come to thy Door, and wilt thou shut him out? Is there no room for him in the Inn? shall he lie in the Stable? Shall Satan command the Heart, and Christ only have the Lip?</p>
                           <p n="1">(1.) Is it not great Ingratitude to pour such contempt upon Christ? Do not they that refuse him, and slight the Offers of his Grace, derogate from him? Do not such vilify his Person? Do you not say in your Hearts,<note place="margin">Isa. 53.2.</note> 
                              <hi>There is no Beauty in him, Form, nor Comeliness?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">(2.) Do you not pour contempt upon his Undertaking, and undervalue his Blood and Suffering? We read of some that tread under foot the Blood of the Son of God,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.29.</note> and judg it to be a thing of no worth nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency; and what dost thou less, who dost not believe in him, embrace him, and apply his precious Blood and Grace for Help and Healing?</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Exhort.</hi> If this be so, then labour, whoever thou art, to accept of Christ. Dost think to do better? what Object canst thou find, that more deserves thy Affection?</p>
                           <p n="1">1. He is great, honourable, a King, the King of Kings; all other Kings are his Subjects; he is King of Heaven, Earth, Hell.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Great in Power: He has led captive the King of Darkness, has spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Principalities of Sin, that so long tyrannized over Thousands, yea, Millions of Thousands; has overcome Death, the King of Terrors, that none of the Mighty could ever encounter with.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. He is the amiablest Object in the World, his Beauty far exceeds the Beauty of the Luminaries, much fairer than the Children of Men.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. He is rich, unsearchable in Riches. What wouldst thou have, or canst thou desire, but 'tis in him?</p>
                           <p>Wouldst thou know the ready way to be espoused unto him? Then,</p>
                           <p n="1">1. First of all, break off that Affinity thou holdest with Sin, and get thy Heart off from the inordinate Love of this World.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Thou must become dead to the Law, and thine own Righteousness.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Labour to see an absolute Necessity of marrying with him.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Get thy Judgment well enlightned in the Mysteries of Grace and Glory, that come by Jesus Christ.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Hearken to the Motions of thy own Conscience; for Conscience is employed, when throughly awakened, and rightly informed, as a Spokes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for Christ.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. Take heed of a divided Heart; never rest till thy Will is brought over to accept of Christ, and the Offers of Grace.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. Labour to chuse Christ singly, a naked Christ. Christ is able every way to make thee happy, and fully answer all thy Desires; take heed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of going after other Lovers, give not his <hi>Headship</hi> and <hi>Sovereignty</hi> away.</p>
                           <p n="4">IV. This shews what a happy State the Godly are in. Can the Soul be poor, that has such a Friend and Husband as Christ is? If <hi>David</hi> concluded he should not want,<note place="margin">Psal. 13.1.</note> because the Lord was his Shepherd; be sure thou shalt not, because Christ is thy Husband: The Bridegroom takes more care, and is more tender of his Bride, than any Shepherd of his Sheep or Lambs.</p>
                           <p n="5">
                              <pb n="107" facs="tcp:41512:178"/>V. This speaks great Terror to the Wicked, that oppress and misuse God's People, and make a Spoil of his Church. What will they do, when the Bridegroom rises up to plead the Cause of his Darling? He will not spare his Arrows, but tread them down in his Fury.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Lastly</hi>; Be prepared, you that are Virgins; the Bridegroom is coming, the Midnight-Cry will soon be heard; get your Lamps trimmed, and Oil in your Vessels.</p>

WE may from hence perceive the wonderful Love, Goodness, and Condescension of God Almighty to Mankind, who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how unable we are to understand, comprehend, conceive, or take in the knowledg of Himself, (who is so infinite and inaccessible in his Being, Glory, and Majesty) is pleased to stoop so low, as to afford us a Figure, Image, and lively Representation of Himself, that so we might not frame false <hi>Ideas</hi> of God, or entertain any vain or unworthy Apprehensions of him in our Minds.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. This also abundantly demonstrates, how exceeding willing the Blessed God is to reveal or make known himself unto his Creatures.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. This discovers the Necessity of coming unto God by Christ, and what Advantage the Christian World have above the Heathen Nations: For tho he hath in the visible Creation implanted some Resemblances or Characters of his Excellencies, and left some Footsteps of his blessed and sacred Properties, that by the contemplation of them Men might come to have some Acquaintance with him, as Creator, which might encourage them to fear and love Him, and make Him their last End; yet all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of God, besides this of Christ Jesus, are partial, short, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient to discover all that is necessary to be known, that we may live to him here, and enjoy him hereafter.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. It may caution all Men, to take heed they do not imagine to come to the true Knowledg of God any other way but by the Lord Jesus: <hi>For no Man knoweth the Father but the Son,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Mat. 11.27</note> 
                              <hi>and he to whom the Son will reveal him.</hi> All miss of Happiness, that seek it not by Jesus Christ. We must seek the Father in the Son, and by him; labour to believe in, or come to God by Jesus Christ. This is for Direction to us in all Religious Worship.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. The Godly may from hence also see, what reason they have to love and delight themselves in Jesus Christ. Brethren, study the Knowledg of Christ, look often upon this glorious and blessed Image. Many are taken with Pictures and Representations of Things and Persons; but how vain is that? Here is the Image you should delight your selves in; look to Jesus; much Profit, as well as Joy and Comfort, will redound to you hereby. This is an Image that abides for ever, which God allows you to worship and adore him by.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. Prize Christ, value him above all things in this World; can you too highly esteem him, who is the express Image of the Father's Person?</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Lastly</hi>; Let all take heed how they slight Jesus Christ, or contemn the Knowledg of him; because this Mystery is above their Reach, and shallow Apprehensions; and indeed it may caution all not to seek too curiously into these great Mysteries and Depths, lest they be drowned: the best of Men know but in part.</p>

                                    <p n="4">IV. A <hi>Physician</hi> ought to shew and produce his Authority or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to practise Physick, to such as have Power to require it, that so it may be the better known, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be what he says or not, there being many counterfeit Physicians.</p>

                                    <p n="6">VI. A Physician, as he ought to know the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> of the Disease, so he must know the <hi>Cause</hi> of the Disease. The Cure is found, saith one, in the Cause; to discover whence the Distemper grew, and what the Occasion of it was, directs unto the Remedy.</p>

A <hi>Physician</hi> ought to be an <hi>experienced</hi> Man; that greatly tends to his more necessary Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for if he be one that hath not seen the Effect of his Medicines in his own Body, nor in others, 'tis hard venturing to have to do with him.</p>
                                    <p n="10">X. A <hi>Physician</hi> useth proper and suitable Preparatives to dispose his Patient's Body to a Cure.</p>

                                    <p n="12">XII. A Physician doth not only know what Medicines are good for his Patient, but also takes care to apply them at a right Time; if those things that are proper for the Disease be not rightly and wisely applied, the Effects are lost. A Man may do as much hurt by giving a good Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, as by giving an ill one. Hence it is vulgarly said, That that which is one Man's Help, is another Man's Death; one Man's Meat is another Man's Poyson.</p>
                                    <p n="13">XIII. A <hi>Physician</hi> is very diligent and careful of his Patient he hath in Cure, looks with a quick Eye, tries the Pulse, and gives great charge to all that attend upon him.</p>

                                    <p n="17">XVII. A Physician deals very tenderly in binding up the Wounds of his Patient; tho he hath a Lion's Heart, when he hath to do with some in dangerous cases, yet he hath a Lady's Hand, when he comes to others.</p>
                                    <p n="18">XVIII. A Physician gives Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes to preserve from Distempers, and save from Infection.</p>

                           <head>Cautions.</head>
                           <p n="1">I. Take heed you do not delay seeking out for Help. Some, when they are sick, never mind going to a Physician, till Nature is decayed, and the Disease has seized on them in such sort, that 'tis too late, there is no help; so do some Sinners: did not <hi>Jerusalem</hi> do thus?</p>
                           <p n="2">II. Take heed you make use of no other Physician. There are many that boast of their Skill, how good they are at curing of Souls; beware of them,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.1.</note> they privily bring in damnable Errors, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift Destruction. These are like deceitful Quacks, and Impostors, that design to make Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize of you. Remember, their Medicines are poysonous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive.</p>
                           <p n="3">III. Value not Womens Advice too high. <hi>Eve</hi> lost her Skill in the Garden, and learned little afterwards. The Apocalyptical Woman of <hi>Rome,</hi> like many old Wives, would fain be tampering with the Sick; but
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41512:184"/>
above all take heed of her, for she (like the adulterous Woman <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks of) hath <hi>slain and killed many, yea,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Prov. 7.</note> 
                              <hi>many a strong Man hath been cast down by her: Her way is the way to Hell, tending down to the Chambers of Death.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="4">IV. Take heed you rob not Christ of the Honour which is due to him as a Physician; which may be done two ways:</p>
                           <p n="1">1. When we attribute the Cure to our own Industry, to Skill and Power of our own, or to Duties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                           <p n="2">2. When we attribute our Help and Cure to Instruments, to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="5">V. If thou art made whole by Christ, take heed of a Relapse. <hi>Sin no more,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>lest a worse thing come upon thee.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But for <hi>Comfort:</hi> If by the power of Temptation thou hast fallen and backslidden from God, he can heal thee again.<note place="margin">Joh. 5.12. Hos. 14.4. 1 John 2.1, 2.</note> 
                              <hi>I will heal their Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slidings, and love them freely. If any Man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous.</hi>

                           <p n="1">1. THis exceedingly shews forth the Grace and Love of Christ to Sinners, in that he should assume Man's Nature, and become lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Death and Mortality; what marvellous Condescension is here, that he should act or do any thing in contemplation of Death, and be a Testator, and yet could not see Corruption, the Grave could not keep him; and yet refused not to submit unto Death, that thereby through the Spirit he might convey a legal Right and Possession to us of eternal Life.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. From hence we may also see, how firm and sure the Covenant of Grace is made to all the true Seed, and faithful Children of God.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. And let all the Friends and Legatees of Jesus Christ know, that their Right and Title to spiritual and eternal Blessedness is of absolute Grace, and meer Pleasure of the Testator.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. And what cause have we to praise the Name of God in Christ, who hath published and made known his last Will and Testament unto the Sons of Men? We have the Mind of Christ.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. And in that he hath left one to execute his Will, and that it is put into the hands of the holy Spirit in Christ's absence,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.16.

                           <p n="6">6. Moreover, let all such tremble, that adventure to alter, add to, or diminish from, any thing that is left in Christ's last Will and Testament;<note place="margin">Rev. 22.18, 19.</note> the Plagues of God, without Repentance, are like to be their Portion for ever.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. Furthermore, from hence you may see what reason we have to examin what is preached for Doctrine, or published by any Man as the Mind of Christ;<note place="margin">Gal. 1.8.</note> for if it be not written or found in his last Will and Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we ought utterly to reject it, tho an Angel from Heaven should preach it. — Whatever is affirmed to be an Ordinance of Christ's, if it be not, nor cannot be naturally inferred, without Abuse or Wrong to the Text, let it be abhorred and contemned by us.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. This affords much Comfort to the Godly, whose Names are written in this Testament, and in the Lamb's Book of Life. You will there find exceeding great and glorious things bequeathed to you, and let it be your care to sue for them, according to the Will and Directions of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stator.</p>

Jesus Christ greatly delights in the Melody of the Souls of sincere Christians, in the well-tuned Instruments of their Hearts, who by fervent Prayer can open their Case, and send forth the Desires and Breathings of their Souls to him; such make sweet Musick in his Ear: When they sing spiritual Songs, and Hymns of Praise to him, with Grace in the Heart, he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly delighted. <hi>Sing Praise unto the Lord, sing Praises.</hi>

                                    <p n="10">X. A Lion marks those that have injured him, or abused or wrong'd his young Ones, and will revenge it; as appears by divers Passages mentioned by Naturalists, one of which take as followeth:</p>
                                    <p>In <hi>Bangius,</hi> a Mountain of <hi>Thracia,</hi> there was a Lioness which had Whelps in her Den, the which Den was observed by a Bear. The Bear one day finding the Den unfortified, by the absence both of the Lion and Lioness, entred into the same, and slew the Lions Whelps, afterwards went away, and fearing Revenge, for better security against the Lion's Rage, climbed up into a Tree, and there sate as in a sure Castle of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. At length the Lion and the Lioness returned both home, and finding their little Ones dead in their Blood, according to natural Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, became both exceeding sorrowful, to see them so slaughtered, whom they loved; but searching out the Murtherer by the foot, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great Rage up and down, until they came to the Tree whereon the Bear was ascended; and seeing her, looked both of them ghastly upon her, oftentimes assaying to get up into the Tree, but in vain, being not
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:41512:193"/>
endued with the Power of climbing. Then the Male forsook the Female, leaving her to watch the Tree, and he, like a mournful Father for the loss of his Children, wandred up and down the Mountains, making great Moan and Sorrow, till at last he saw a Carpenter hewing Wood, who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lion coming towards him, let fall his Ax for fear; but the Lion came very lovingly towards him, fawning gently upon his Breast with his Fore-feet, licking his Face with his Tongue. Which Gentleness of the Lion the Man perceiving, he was astonished; and being more and more embraced and fawned upon by the Lion, he followed him, leaving his Ax behind; which the Lion perceiving, he went back, and made Signs with his foot to the Carpenter, that he should take it up. But the Lion seeing the Man did not take it up, he brought it himself in his Mouth, and delivered it unto him, and then led him into his own Cave, where the young Whelps lay all imbrued in their own Blood; and from thence to the Place where the Lioness did watch the Bear. They making Signs, and looking up into the Tree where the Bear was, the Man conjectured that that Bear had done this grievous Injury unto them; he thereupon took his Ax, and hewed down the Tree near the Root, which being done, the Bear tumbled down headlong, and the furious Beasts tore her all to pieces. After this, the Lion conducted the Man to the Place and Work where he first found him, without doing him the least violence or harm.</p>
                                    <p>The Truth of this, and of the following Story, is not imposed upon the Reader; yet finding it recorded by such credible and eminent Authors, (and in it self probable) we thought fit to transcribe it, as serving to divert the Reader, and illustrate the insensible Wisdom of God in his Works.</p>
                                    <p n="11">XI. As a Lion will revenge the Hurt and Injury done to him, and to his young Ones, so he is ready to requite Kindnesses done to him; as appears by another Passage, thus recorded by Historians:</p>
                                    <p>One <hi>Andradus,</hi> having fled from his Master by reason of some hard Usage received at his hands, by chance happened to take up his Lodging in a Cave, which (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to him) was a Lions's Den; where when he had been a while, not long before Night, the Lion came from Hunting, and having gotten a Hurt upon his foot, he no sooner espied the trembling Man in this fearful Place, but he cometh gently unto him, stretching forth his foot, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Moan, as tho he desired Help. The Man took the Lion by the Paw, searched the Wound, pull'd out a Thorn, bound up his Foot, and gave him ease; which kind Office being performed, was first of all requited with a daily portion of Provision, which the poor Slave roasted in the Sun. After this the Man escaped, and got away; and the Lion missing him made great Lamentation. But so it happened, he was no sooner gone, but he was taken by some whom his Master had sent out to search
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:41512:194"/>
for him; and then, alas! there was no other way but Death, and no other Death but to be torn in pieces by wild Beasts; for the <hi>Romans</hi> kept Beasts on purpose upon that account. But it so fell out, that this Lion was took up before the time came, and put into the Theater, who greedily rent in pieces such as were thrown unto him; yet when this poor Slave, his old Friend, was cast in, he forgot his Fury, and turned it into Fawning; by which the por Soul perceived what Lion it was, and thereupon renewed his Acquaintance with him, to the Admiration of all. The Matter being known, and related to them that that were concerned, he had not only his Life,<note place="margin">

                           <p n="2">2. To obey and keep his Law.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. To trust in Him only for Defence and Protection.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. To pray, that He would take to him his great Power, and reign.

                           <p n="1">I. FRom hence we may learn, that without the Blood of Christ offered up as a propitiatory Sacrifice to God, there is no Remission of Sin, nor eternal Life. God's Wrath is only appeased by a Sacrifice; and this was clearly hinted from the beginning.</p>
                           <p n="2">II. From hence we may learn, how far the Priesthood of Christ, and the Gospel-Covenant, doth excell that of the Law; moreover, the End and Design of God in the one, and in the other. Many things have been briefly touched, wherein the great Differences do consist; some of which, for the sake of the Weak, I shall reiterate in this place. The Priest under the Law was a mortal Man; Christ God-Man. Those Priests were Sinners themselves, and needed a Sacrifice for their own Sins; Christ was without Sin, and needed no Offering for himself, Christ offered up his own Body on the Tree. Those Sacrifices were the Shadow; the Sacrifice of Christ is the Substance of them. The Priest and Sacrifice is the Type, Christ the Antitype. Those Sacrifices could not take away Sin, nor purge the Conscience; Christ's Sacrifice doth both.</p>
                           <p n="3">III. Moreover, this reprehends such as slight and invalidate the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Sacrifice of Christ,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> and account his Blood to have no more virtue nor efficacy in it to Justification, than the Blood of any godly Man.</p>
                           <p n="4">IV. It also calls upon all faithful Christians, to study the Nature of Christ's Priesthood more and more; much of the Mystery of the two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants consisteth in Priesthood and Sacrifice, there is something in it hard to be understood.</p>
                           <p n="5">V. This greatly detects the Ignorance and abominable Error of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Church, that continues to offer up fresh Sacrifices for Sin; as if Christ had not offered up a sufficient Sacrifice once for all, or that he needeth Competitors, and Help, to atone and make Peace between God and Sinners.</p>
                           <p n="6">VI. It may also confute their blasphemous Notion concerning Christ's Priesthood, as if it passed from him unto them; whereas nothing can be more plainly asserted, than his <hi>continuing a Priest for ever.</hi> His Priesthood is unchangeable, exercised in his own Person, as a principal part of the Glory of his Office; and on the discharge of it, depends the Churches Preservation and Stability: <hi>He ever lives to make Intercession for us.</hi> And every Believer may from hence go with confidence unto Him in all their Concerns,<note place="margin">Heb. 7 25. chap. 2 17. chap. 4.15. chap. 5.2.</note> for Relief and Succour, who Himself is said to be <hi>touched with the feeling of our Infirmities.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But this of Christ's offering once for all, and continuing a Priest for ever, the <hi>Rhemist</hi> Annotators are greatly at a loss about, concluding, that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:41512:202"/>
it makes against the Jews and <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Priesthood; which worthy <hi>Cartwright</hi> learnedly answers, to whom we refer you. For clear it is, that what the Papists affirm concerning their Priest and Mass to be a propitiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the Quick and the Dead, is detected from hence to be a blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, execrable, and pestilent Error; and by no means are they able to make the Offerings and Sacrifices made by their Priests, as Christ's Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, to hold good in any case, or consonant to God's Word. Which further to evince, we shall here cite a Page of Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s, on <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.24. and so conclude this of Christ's Priesthood.</p>
                           <q>
                              <p>The Expositors of the Roman Church are greatly perplexed in the reconciling of this Passage of the Apostle unto the present Priesthood of their Church; and they may well be so,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Owen.</hi>
                                 </note> seeing undoubtedly they are ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable. Some of them say, That <hi>Peter</hi> succeeded unto Christ in his Priesthood, as <hi>Eleazar</hi> did unto <hi>Aaron</hi>; so <hi>Ribera.</hi> Some of them deny that he hath any Successor, properly so called: <hi>Successorem non habet, nec ità quisquam Catholicus loquitur, si benè &amp; circumspectè loqui velit,</hi> saith <hi>Aestius.</hi> But it is openly evident, that some of them are not so circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect as <hi>Aestius</hi> would have them, but do plainly affirm, that <hi>Peter</hi> was Christ's Successor. <hi>A Lapide</hi> indeed affirms, that <hi>Peter</hi> did not succeed unto Christ, as <hi>Eleazar</hi> did unto <hi>Aaron,</hi> because <hi>Eleazar</hi> had the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in the same degree and dignity with <hi>Aaron,</hi> and so had not <hi>Peter</hi> with Christ; but yet that he had the same Priesthood with him, a Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the same kind, he doth not deny.</p>
                              <p>That which they generally six upon is, That their Priests have not another Priesthood, or offer another Sacrifice, but are Partakers of his Priesthood, and minister under him, and so are not his Successors, but his Vicars; which I think is the worst Composure of this Difficulty they could have thought upon: For,</p>
                              <p n="1">1. This is contrary unto the Words and Design of the Apostle; for the Reason he assigns, why the Priesthood of Christ doth not pass from him to any other, is, because he abides himself for ever to discharge the Office of it. Now this excludes all Subordination and Conjunction, all Vicars, as well as Successors; unless we shall suppose, that although he doth thus abide, yet he is one way or other disabled to discharge his Office.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. The Successors of <hi>Aaron</hi> had no more another Priesthood, but what he had, nor did they offer any other Sacrifice than what he offered, as these Priests pretend to offer the same Sacrifice that Christ did: So that still the case is the same between <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Successors, and Christ and his Substitutes.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. They say, That Christ may have Substitutes in his Office, tho he abide a Priest still, and altho the Office still continue the same unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: So God, in the Government of the World, makes use of Judges and Magistrates, yet is himself the supreme Rector of all. But this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is vain also: For they do not substitute their Priests unto him, in that which he continueth to do himself, but in that which he doth not, which he did indeed, as a Priest ought to do, but now ceaseth to do for ever in his own Person; for the principal Act of the Sacerdotal Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Christ consisted in his Oblation, or his offering himself a Sacrifice of a sweet-smelling savour unto God. This he did once, and ceaseth for ever from doing so any more; but these Priests are assigned to offer him
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:41512:203"/>
in Sacrifice every day, as Partakers of the same Priesthood with him, which is indeed not to be his Substitutes, but his Successors, and to take his Office out of his hand, as if he were dead, and could henceforth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it no more: For they do not appoint Priests to intercede in his Room, because they grant he continueth himself so to do, but to offer Sacrifice in his stead, because he doth so no more. Wherefore if that be an Act of Priesthood, and of their Priesthood, as is pretended, 'tis unavoidable that his Priesthood is passed from him unto them. Now this is a blasphemous Imagination, and directly contrary both unto the Words of the Apostle, and the whole Design of his Argument; nay, it would lay the Advantage on the other side.: For the Priests of the Order of <hi>Aaron</hi> had that Privilege, that none could take their Office upon them, nor officiate in it, whilst they were alive; but altho Christ abideth for ever, yet according to the Sence of these Men, and their Practice thereon, he stands in need of others to officiate for him, and that in the principal part of his Duty and Office. For to offer himself in Sacrifice unto God, he neither now doth, nor can, seeing henceforth he dieth no more. This is the Work of the Mass-Priests alone, who must therefore be honoured as the Successors of Christ, or else be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred as his Murtherers; for the Sacrifice of Him must be by Blood and Death.</p>
                              <p>The Argument of the Apostle, as it is exclusive of this Imagination, so it is cogent unto this purpose; for so he proceedeth: That Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood which changeth not, but is always vested in the same Person, and in him alone, is more excellent than that which was subject to change continually from one hand to another; for that Transmission of it from one unto another, was an Effect of Weakness and Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. And the Jews grant, that the Frequency of their Change un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the second Temple was a Token of God's Displeasure. But thus it was not with the Priesthood of Christ, which never changeth, and that of <hi>Aaron,</hi> which was always in a transient Succession. And the Reasons he gives of this contrary State of these two Priesthoods, do greatly enforce the Argument: For the first Priesthood was so succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, because the Priests themselves were obnoxious unto Death, the Sum and Issue of all Weaknesses and Infirmities. But as to the Lord Jesus Christ, his Priesthood is perpetual and unchangeable, because he abideth personally for ever: <hi>Being made a Priest according to the Power of an endless Life,</hi> which is the Sum of all Perfection that our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is capable of.</p>

                           <p n="3">III. Moreover, you may seee the absolute Necessity the Church has of such a Prophet, without whom the People would have sate in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and in the Shadow of Death, and have been left to stumble upon the dark Mountains.</p>
                           <p n="4">IV. From hence we infer the infallible Certainty of what he has decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for it could not be that such a Prophet should deceive the World: <hi>These things are true and faithful.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Way</hi> is a common Word or Phrase, taken for the chief Means and <hi>Medium</hi> for the Attainment or Accomplishment of a Thing, and so is very comprehensive. As for example: The way to gain Honour, is to do some worthy and honourable Action; Honour is the End, the Person that seeks it is the Subject, the doing the worthy Action is the Way to attain it. Again, If a Man would go to such or such a City, he must travel that Road that leads thither; here also you have the End, the Subject, and the Means or Way of obtaining the End. So in like manner, if a Man would come to God, which is Happiness, his chief End, the Way is Jesus Christ: <hi>No Man can come unto the Father, but by me.</hi> Here Man is the Subject, God or Happiness the End, Christ the Way.</p>

Great Care was to be taken under the Law, that the Ways to the Cities of Refuge should be made smooth and plain; all Stumbling-Blocks and Impediments were to be removed, and they were to be thirty two Cubits broad.

                        <p n="1">1. As a Priest, he aton'd and made Peace by his own Blood, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is a blessed Way for us to the Father, and as he is a Priest to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for us in Heaven. <hi>See <hi>Advocate.</hi>

                        <p n="8">8. He is a <hi>holy Way,</hi> all other Ways are unclean and filthy; none but holy Persons can walk in this Way.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. There is abundance of Filth in thy Heart and Life, which must be purged and washed away, or thou must perish.</p>
                           <p n="2">
                              <note place="margin">Heb. 1.3. Joh. 17. Rev. 15.</note>2. There is no <hi>Fountain</hi> can wash away thy Sin but this; all Soul-cleansing is by Christ's Blood. All the Legal Purifications pointed to the spiritual Purgation by Christ's Blood: the like does Baptismal Washing; the outward Washing of the Body, signifies the inward Washing by Faith in this Fountain.</p>
                           <p n="3">
                              <note place="margin">Isa. 53.4, 5. Rom. 3.24 1 Cor. 1.2.</note>3. This Fountain can wash and heal thee, whatever thy Uncleanness and Sickness is; it cleanses from the Guilt of Sin, and from the Filth of Sin also.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. This Fountain is opened; which Expression signifies, (1.) The Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness of Christ to accept and embrace poor Sinners. (2.) It shews the Clearness of Gospel-Revelation, above the Legal. <hi>Non dubito, &amp;c.</hi> saith <hi>Calvin:</hi> I do not doubt but by this word he shews the Differences between Law and Gospel: Christ was a Fountain for Sin under the Law; but he was as it were a sealed Fountain, or hid and vailed under many Types, Shadows, and Ceremonial Washings; the Stone is now removed, that lay upon the Mouth of the Well. (3.) It shews the Readiness and Easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Access, which is afforded to poor Sinners to come to Christ.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Consider the Multitude of Sinners that have been cleansed by Christ.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. Consider the Multitude of Sins in every one Sinner washed away.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. Consider the happy State of all such as are made clean.</p>

                              <hi>Caution.</hi> Take heed of slighting and undervaluing of the Fountain of Christ's Blood. What do they less than slight it, who think they can get cleansing from Sin by the Light within? What do the Papists less, who have other Purgations, who go to their Mass, and call that a propitiatory Sacrifice; who go to the Merits of their own Works, thinking thereby to expiate Sin, and purchase God's Favour? What do all such else, that rely upon the Mercy of God without having an eye and respect to Christ's Blood? What do all those less, that never come, tho very guilty and unclean, and often invited to this Fountain? Let the opening of this Fountain move thee to open thy Heart.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Exhort.</hi> To love him who hath washed thee, to be thankful, to believe, to be humble, and deny thy self. When ever thou seest a Fountain of Water, think upon Christ, the spiritual Fountain.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Consolat.</hi> Here is Comfort, a Fountain of Comfort for poor Saints: Thou hast a bitter Fountain in thee; here is a sweet one to cleanse thee: Thou hast a filthy Fountain; here is a clear and chrystal one, to bathe and wash thee. Christ is more able to cleanse, than Sin is to defile. Darest thou say, that thy Filth is greater than this Fountain can wash away? O Soul, Christ can wash the Black-Moor white. Remember, whatever Satan says, this Fountain is open.</p>

Christ wept, when the Jews rejected him to their own Destruction; and,<note place="margin">Luk. 19.41</note> as <hi>Publius Lettius</hi> saith of him, he was never seen to laugh, but often to weep. The Devil, <hi>Herod, Pontius Pilate,</hi> with the Jews, were not content to persecute and drive the Son of God to Corners; but after they had agreed with <hi>Judas</hi> to betray him, they endeavoured, as much as lay in them, to take this blessed Head off from his Mystical Body; nothing would satisfy them, till they had slain the Lord of Life and Glory.</p>

                        <p>CHrist is the Churches Friend, and consequently the Friend of every gracious Soul; a Friend that sticks closer than a Brother; not only compared to a Friend, but he is really so: the Believer can bear Testimony of it by Experince. This shews the happy State of the Church, and of all true Christians, Christ is their Friend.

                                    <p>There are four things to be considered, requisite to true Friendship</p>
                                    <p n="1">I. KNowledg, amongst Men, true Friendship cannot be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested, and maintained without it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'Tis more than common,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:41512:222"/>
'tis peculiar: speculative Knowledg doth not always bespeak Friendship, for true Friendship repuires peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar Knowledg.</p>
                                    <p n="2">II. Union is also requisite; here can be no true Friendship till the Enmity amongst Men be removed. What Friends were <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> they loved one another as their own Soul! <hi>Can two walk toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther except they be agreed?</hi> Amos 3.3.</p>
                                    <p n="3">III. Intimacy and true Friendship, causeth frequent Access one to the other; this tends to make People to be of one Heart and one Mind.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV. Love and Affection, this layeth the surest Foundation for Friendship.</p>
                                    <p>Now to speak to the Nature and Property of a true Friend.</p>
                                    <p n="1">I. A true Friend loves heartily; cold Friendship, is the Daughter of feigned Affection; Love is the abundant overflowing of Desire, which cometh to the Party beloved, swiftly and joyfully, but departs slowly and sorrowfully.</p>
                                    <p n="2">II. A true Friend is very needful: what Man living, tho never so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous, but sometimes he wants a Friend? <hi>David,</hi> tho a great Man and a good Man,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 15.37. 2 Kings 4.5.</note> yet his Condition required Friends, and he had them, and prized them, <hi>viz.

He that's a Friend indeed, will make his Friends Case his own; This did <hi>Job,</hi> if afflicted, he's afflicted with him; if prosperous, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth.<note place="margin">Job 16.17.</note> Where Friends are kind in Love, there Sorrow is easily shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV. A true Friend, doth what he can to keep up the Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of his Friend; he speaks for him, and acts for him, where, and when he cannot for himself.</p>
                                    <p n="5">

                                    <p n="6">VI. A Friend indeed will give Demonstration of his Love and Friendship. 1. He'll study his Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. 2. He'll speak to promote it. 3. He'll act to effect it.</p>
                                    <p n="7">VII. A Friend indeed gives his Friend a room in his Heart; the sight of him is pleasing to the Eye, and the Thoughts of him delightful to the Heart.</p>
                                    <p n="8">VIII. A true Friend is always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to impart his Secrets to those that are his Friends. This is a great reason why Men do so prize Friendship, that they may freely disclose their Secrets, and their Hearts one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; 'tis a certain note of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to impart Secrets.</p>
                                    <p n="9">IX. A Friend will not spare Pains nor Cost, nay, will adventure upon great Hazards, to help him whom he loves. Others may promise what they intend not to perform; but a true Friend if able, will surely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all, or more than he promises.</p>
                                    <p n="10">X. He will not do any thing to the Wrong of his Friend, or justly to purchase his Displeasure, because he prizeth the Love of him whom his Affection runs out after.</p>

                                    <p n="15">XV. It is the Property of a true Friend, to be much troubled and concerned at the Absence of such whom he loves, and nothing more sweet than the meeting of Friends after long Absence; as appears by <hi>Joseph</hi> and his Brethren at their meeting,<note place="margin">Gen. 45.</note> when they knew one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                                    <p n="16">XVI. 'Tis a great Trouble to a true Friend to see his Love and Friendship slighted; yet it will not easily withdraw his Love, but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to pass by many Offences, and Unkindnesses.</p>
                                    <p n="17">XVII. A true Friend will not suddenly or easily hear any evil Report against his Friend.</p>
                                    <p n="18">XVIII. If he be sensible of any Combinations against him he will speedily disclose it, as <hi>Paul</hi>'s Friends did, touching the Combination of the Jews.<note place="margin">Acts 23.14, 20, &amp;c.</note>

                                    <p n="4">IV. There's true Love between Christ and his People, which makes those Acts of Friendship very cordial and desirable.</p>
                                    <p n="1">I. Jesus Christ is a cordial Lover; as he loves so he speaks, and as he speaks, so he loves; Christ's Love is an abounding and abundant Love to his, he loves freely and heartily, and hath given Evidence of it; and though his Love be sometimes eclipsed, yet 'tis not wholly removed: <hi>He having loved, loves to the End.</hi>

                                    <p n="4">IV. Such and much better Friend is Christ. The Members of Christ's Spouse have been stigmatized by the Enemy, for Hereticks, and many other ways; but Christ hath stood up to vindicate their Wrongs and Innocency; he hath spoken for them, where, and when they could not speak for themseves; he had his <hi>Gamaliel</hi> in the Council.</p>

                                    <p n="9">IX. Herein Christ doth also perform the part of a Friend; for he will neither spare Pains nor Cost, and hath adventured upon the greatest Hazards, and all for the Love he bears to his People; nay he has not put them off with bare Promises, but will perform them to the utmost; he usually out does his Promises.</p>
                                    <p n="10">X. Even so Christ doth nothing to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure his, nor justly to provoke them, or purchase their Displeasure; the poor Soul is ready sometimes to think such and such things are against him, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did in the Case of <hi>Joseph</hi> and <hi>Benjamin.</hi> All his actings and out-goings towards his People speaks forth his desire of their Love: hence he greatly praises and commends the Love of his Church;<note place="margin">Cant. 4.10.</note>

Even so Christ will not suffer his People to lie under Sin, he knows 'twill turn to their Disadvantage; O how is he concerned when they are ensnared! which doth signifie his great Trouble, and therefore gives friendly Reproofs and Admonitions in order to reclaim them; and Believers have found his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs to be peculiar Acts of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:<note place="margin">Psal. 119.67, 71.

Even so Christ loves to hear from his People, and is concerned at their Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, they are always welcome to him, he takes their Absence unkindly: and afterwards when they come to visit him again with the Acknowledgment of their Miscarriages; O how welcome are they! such a Meeting is on both sides very sweet and pleasant.</p>
                                    <p n="16">XVI. Even so it is with Christ, to see his precious Love slighted. Ingratitude is a Sin which is very offensive, it being a Sin against Truth and Justice. Against Tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

So Christ; he doth not (as I may say) take up every evil Report the Devil, Sin, or wicked Men bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them: Christ will not take Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures by their Information, but by that perfect Knowledg he hath of them,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.8.</note> and if they have done amiss, he will reprove them, but gently, for their Profit.</p>

FRiendship amongst Men is usually occasioned from the Suitableness of the Object: Man with Man is suitable for Association, and this is the great moving Cause of their Friendship; not Man with another Creature, or rarely a King with a Beggar, or a Courtier or Statesman with an illiterate Country-Man, as the Subject of his Blessing, or Object of his Delight.</p>

Usually they apprehend some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Desert in the Person on whom they bestow their Friendship: Either it is deserved by the Good they see in him, or may be requited by the Help they may receive from him; for 'tis possible and usual, for a poor Man to be useful to a rich Man, and the weakest to him that is strong.</p>
                                    <p n="3">III. No such Friend hath done so much, but it is known, and may be declared. Christ saith, <hi>Greater Love hath no Man than this, that he lays down his Life for his Friend</hi>; wherein their Love is plainly seen, and may be comprehended.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV. The best natural Man may sometimes forget his Friend, either through a multitude of Business, Incumbrance, or weakness of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, during which time he may suffer much.</p>
                                    <p n="5">V. Such a Friend knows no more of his Friend's Condition than is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to him, neither is he able to pass right Judgment respecting him,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:41512:224"/>
as in <hi>Job's</hi> case, therefore cannot reach the Heart with Comfort.</p>
                                    <p n="6">VI. Such may be thy Condition, that thy best Friend may not know how to help thee, tho willing, such may be the Affairs thou art to manage.</p>
                                    <p n="7">VII. Tho a natural Friend may know what will help thee, yet it may not be in his Power to help thee. The tender Mothers in <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> their Bowels moved for the starved and languishing Babes of their own Bodies; and they knew that Food would have succoured them, but 'twas not in their power to procure it.</p>
                                    <p n="8">VIII. These natural Friends may be removed from thee, or thou from them, and so thou mayest be left destitute, and this Friendship come to an end. Many have been clapp'd up in a Dungeon, and sequestrated from their dearest worldly Friends, therefore they are uncertain at best; however, if no Dungeon, yet Death will separate them.</p>
                                    <p n="9">IX. Natural Friends may be made unable to perform their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises. A real Friend, through an over-heated Zeal, doth sometimes out-bid himself, and is not able to make good his Word; which lays a Man under great Disappointments. I relied on my Friend's Promise, but he hath failed me. Nay, a Friend, when he promises, may at that time be able to make good his Promise, but some strange Providence may suddenly disable him.</p>

                                    <p n="1">I. BUt <hi>Christ</hi> grounds not his Friendship here, there being in fallen Man no <hi>Suitableness</hi> of Association; Man being pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted, <hi>Angels</hi> might be thought much more suitable: But 'tis Love and free Grace, that notwithstanding there was nothing desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in fallen Man, he being altogether sinful, and so not suitable for Association<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet Jesus Christ hath made choice of Man,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.16.</note> and is become his true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Friend.</p>
                                    <p n="2">II. But Jesus Christ grounds not his Friendship on this Bottom; for fallen Man is altogether undeserving; nothing that was in them could be the Cause of his Friendship, but meerly his own good Will and Pleasure, Man being utterly unable to requite his Love and Kindness, or to give any thing to him in requital; so that it is undeserved Friendship.</p>
                                    <p n="3">III. But Christ hath done so much for his People, as is not known,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.1. 1 Cor. 2.10 Rom. 5.5, 6.</note> nor can be conceived; and all this when they were Enemies. If it be considered what he did for them before Time, what he hath done in Time, and what he hath prepared for them in after-Times, it will appear that there is no such Friend as Christ, who entertains all his with eternal Mansions Glory.</p>

What God said concerning the Temple that <hi>Solomon</hi> built, Christ saith the same to his People: <hi>Mine Eye and my Heart shall be on them perpetually:</hi>

                                    <p n="5">V. But Christ knows our Conditions, and can pass right Judgment concerning us, and can reach our Hearts to comfort and support them. <hi>He knows the Ways I take,</hi> saith <hi>Job.</hi> He is a Soul-Friend,<note place="margin">Job 23.10</note> he

                                    <p n="8">VIII.

O how sweet is the presence of a dear Friend in Trouble! Alas! Walls and Guards may keep off other Friends, but nothing can keep or hinder Jesus Christ from coming unto his People.</p>
                                    <p n="9">IX. But Christ is able to make good his Word to the utmost; he never out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids himself. Who was ever laid under any Discouragement or Disappointment, that trusted in Him? In all Changes, in all Providences, Christ is the same. Thou mayest commit great Concerns into the hands of thy supposed Friend, and he may fail thee; nay, into the hand of thy real Friend, and yet be uncertain of Security; Fire may destroy, or Thieves may rob him, so that being empoverished, he cannot make good what he received: But Christ cannot, nay, will not disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point thee.</p>

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:41512:226"/>
your Lives; none so sweet, nor yields such a fragrant and odoriferous Smell as Christ doth: Nay, and more than that, 'twill be a glorious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament unto you, 'twill make all good and gracious Ones in love with you.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Moreover, this shews us, that most of the Men and Women in the World have lost their Smell, their spiritual Senses are gone; they can find no such Savour in Religion, no Sweetness in a reproached, persecuted, and crucified Jesus; no Delight in Ordinances, Prayer, hearing the Word, nor in Sacraments.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Labor to be stored with the Conserves, and precious Vertues of this Divine Rose; prize the Distillation of it. You love to wash in Rose-Water, 'tis very grateful and pleasing to you; come then and wash in the sweet and fragrant Water of the <hi>Rose of Sharon</hi>; let Heart and Hands be washed in it. It will not only cleanse away the Filth, but will supple and heal all the Wounds and Bruises of your diseased Souls. If you wash in the Water of the Spirit, that flows from a crucified Christ, it will make you a sweet Savour in the World, your Conversations will be of a fragrant Scent.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Besides, it shews how happy they are that have got Jesus Christ; and what Fools Men of the World are, who slight and dis-esteem him. They prize the Thorn and Briar, the pricking Pleasures and Profits of the World, above the Rose, the lovely <hi>Rose of Sharon.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="5">5. You that are God's Children, that have had the sweet Scent of the <hi>Rose of Sharon,</hi> value him above your chiefest Joy; account him (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he is) the Rose and Diadem of your Souls; bear him not only by an outward Profession in your Breast, but take down the sweet-smelling Savour of his Grace into your Hearts. Ye can never overvalue Christ.</p>

An Advocate undertakes high and desperate Causes, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth not to speak for Men greatly obnoxious to the Law, he sticks not sometimes to plead the Cause of Traitours, where the Law admits of a legal Plea, tho in very great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of their Lives, by reason of the greivous Crimes wherewith they stand charged against their Prince.</p>

But Christ this great Advocate of Souls, who appertaineth to the high Court of Heaven, is of long standing and great Experience, possessed the Place of an Advocate from the Fall; nothing can surpass his Cognizance, he stood before the Antient of days, in the days of <hi>Noah, Daniel, Job,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

But Christ, this high and holy, this great and good, this wise and just, this true and righteous Advocate, carries every Cause he undertakes. He will not undertake any Cause, to plead effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but the Believer's: He will not speak a word for the Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> that will not submit to his Laws: <hi>I pray not for the World, but for those thou hast given me.</hi>

                                    <p n="5">V. But the Lord Jesus, the Churches Advocate, makes sure Work; when He carrieth a Cause, it's done in the highest Court it self, from whence there is no Appeal. Every Cause that Christ carrieth, is, like the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> unalterable, and like the Covenant,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 25.4, 5. Luk. 10.42</note> ordered in all things, and sure; it is as the good Part <hi>Mary</hi> chose, that shall never be taken from her; neither Men nor Devils shall be able, by Fraud nor Force, to take it away from them. <hi>'Tis God that justifieth, who is he that condemneth?</hi>

                           <p n="1">I. BEhold the marvellous Goodness of God, that he should (in meer Mercy to us) appoint such an able Advocate, to whom the very Angels themselves are inferior, in point of Wisdom, Power, Office, and Honour.<note place="margin">Job 38.7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 Pet. 1.12</note> Those Sons of the Morning shout for Joy at his Appearance as an <hi>Advocate,</hi> and pry into the Mystery of his honourable Work.</p>
                           <p n="2">II. There is great Encouragement to come to this <hi>Advocate:</hi> God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites Men to come to Christ for advice, and to take his Counsel:<note place="margin">Mat. 3.17.</note> 
                              <hi>This is my beloved Son, hear Him.</hi> He is not concealed in some secret Chamber, where he cannot be found, but stands at the <hi>opening of the Gates,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Prov. 1.20, 21, 22. Isa. 49.6.</note> 
                              <hi>at the Place of the chiefest Concourse. God hath given him to be a Light to the Gentiles, and his Salvation to the ends of the Earth.</hi> Whoever believingly and in truth desires to have him for their Advocate, my have access unto him, and have their Cause undertaken, pleaded, and effectually mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by him, who is the Judge's own Son. The Motives to this Duty are many.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. When poor Sinners come to this holy Advocate, they are kindly embraced.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. They have their Work readily undertaken, they are not tired out with Delays.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. They have it very carefully managed; the Cause is not lost, nor suffered to fall to the Ground, for want of prudent and careful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="4">
                              <pb n="208" facs="tcp:41512:229"/>4. It is a great Case, that cannot safely be trust in any other hand, it is about a Title to an Inheritance, wherein if a Man miscarry, he is utterly undone, yea, utterly undone to Eternity.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Their Cause is admitted of, and undertaken, without Fees or any kind of Charges; He will do all freely without Money.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. There is much Peace, Satisfaction, and Security in it. A Man that hath committed his Cause to this Advocate, may sleep in Peace, go about his Business in Comfort; neither need he in the least doubt or fear of what will follow, for there was never any one that trusted in him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded or put to shame. There was never a Cause left by any Man, to the wise Counsel and Management of this most powerful and holy Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, but it carried the Day. He is not only able to save, but <hi>able to save to the utmost,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Heb. 7.25.</note> not only some, but <hi>all those that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make Intercession for them.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="3">III. Who then would refuse coming to Jesus Christ, or neglect to make use of this Advocate?</p>
                           <p n="4">IV. It also shews us the Cause why Men perish, and miss of God's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and lose eternal Life: It is not for want of free Tenders of Grace, or because there is no Advocate to plead for them; but it is because they will not open at his Knock, nor take his Counsel, <hi>&amp;c. They will not come unto him,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Joh. 5.40.</note>

                           <p>
                              <hi>Lastly</hi>; Let all Saints, who through Satan's Temptations have been overcome, and have sinned, and wounded their Consciences, remember, that <hi>there is an Advocate for them with the Father,</hi>

                        <p>AN <hi>Apostle</hi> signifies in the Greek <hi>one sent</hi>; and it hath something peculiar to it, to distinguish the Office from other Offices, apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the Gospel, and the Church: for tho <hi>John Baptist</hi> was one sent, with many others, yet were they not called <hi>Apostles,</hi> but dignified by some other Names, Titles, or Epithets; as <hi>Fore-runner, Disciple,</hi> and <hi>Servant of the Church,</hi> &amp;c. Now inasmuch as one Rank and Order of Men have this Title given them, and by it are distinguished from others concerned in Divine Service, we may suppose it to signify their Commission and Qualification for their designed Work; which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, Qualification, and designed Work, seems to be comprehensive of these three things, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Immediatly sent; 2. Marvellously inspired; 3. The Master-Builders of the Gospel-Foundation for the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.

                                    <p n="4">IV. The Sun hath his Orb, his Tent, or as the Scripture speaks, his <hi>Tabernacle.</hi>

                                    <p n="7">VII. The Sun sends forth his Light universally to all the World; it shines upon the Just, and upon the Unjust; 'tis not confined to one Nation or People, or to this or that Man, but 'tis free to all.</p>
                                    <p n="8">VIII. The Sun is the Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent over the World, the chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, as it were, and Head of Influences, called the <hi>Queen of Heaven.</hi>

                                    <p n="10">X. The Sun communicates his Light to the Celestial Bodies, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Firmament, Moon, and Stars, who have no other Light but what they derive from it.</p>

                                    <p n="12">XII. The Sun is a wonderful and amazing Creature, all gaze on it with admiration. The <hi>Persians</hi> and others ignorantly adored it as a God. Some insensible Creatures, as the Marygold and Tulip, open their Leaves at its approach, to receive its reviving Influence, and shut up at its departure, as if mourning for its absence. Others bow and hang down their Heads, and wrap up themselves, when he withdraws his Beams, in a seeming Sympathy, that shews an unwillingness in them to be seen by any eye but his.</p>

                                       </note>XIII. The Sun in its Motions and Operations is very strong, and Giant-like; he goes forth like a strong Man in his Might; who can stay the Sun in his Course?</p>
                                    <p n="14">XIV. The Sun in his Motion is very swift; he makes haste, as one who runs a long Race, even the whole Circuit of Heaven.</p>
                                    <p n="15">XV. His Motions are constant, he is ever in motion, he always keeps the same Pace; if he ever stood still, it was not to ease himself, it was not for his own, but his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's pleasure.</p>
                                    <p n="16">XVI. The Sun's Motion is regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; he never goeth without his Bounds, keeps always in the Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack, moving in the Ecliptick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two Tropicks.</p>
                                    <p n="17">XVII. The Sun is never weary, tho in a continual Journey; the Swiftness of his Course does not tire him, nor is he spent by his rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Motion, but is still as glorious as ever.</p>

                                       </note>XVIII. The Sun is powerful in its Operation, in expelling Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; the Night vanisheth at its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; the Clouds, and dark Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors of the Morning, are also scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and dispersed by the Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its powerful Beams.</p>
                                    <p n="19">XIX. When the Sun hath chased away the thick Vapours and dark Fogs of the Morning, it causes a very sweet and lovely Day, shining forth with great Splendor and Brightness.</p>
                                    <p n="20">XX. The Influence of the Sun is very extensive, it reacheth to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Creature, it penetrates into the Bowels of the Earth, and dives as deep as the Bottom of the Sea; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is hid from his Heat. He shoots forth his Beams like so many Darts, to pierce the Body of the Earth, and with his light-giving Rays, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth search into the lowest and dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest Dungeons. His Remoteness from the Earth impedes not his Operation.</p>
                                    <p n="21">XXI. The Sun dries up and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hales the gross and filthy Vapors of the Earth, which otherwise would corrupt the Air, and render it pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and infectious, and is therefore of a healing quality.</p>
                                    <p n="22">XXII. The Sun is useful to Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Production; many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Fruits are brought forth by it. It makes the Plants, which were laid (as it were) in the Grave, to rise and spring up again. Hence the Sun is called by some, <hi>Anima Mundi,</hi> the Soul of the World, because it animates the Creatures.</p>
                                    <p n="23">XXIII. The Sun visits not every Hemisphere, nor shines in every Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon at the same time; and it differs in the degrees of Heat, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Latitudes, according as they are nearer to, or more remote from the Equinoctial. Some Places
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:41512:234"/>
beyond the Tropicks, as <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> &amp;c. see it not in many Months. And it is well known, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Scituation of Places, as they bear from each other, East and West, the Sun rises sooner or later, proportionable to the Difference of Longitude of each Parallel.</p>
                                    <p n="24">XXIV. The Sun is of a more healing, warming, refreshing, and reviving quality, than any Creature in Nature. It is also of a burning quality, for by a Burning-Glass it will set combustible things on fire.</p>
                                    <p n="25">XXV. The Sun is of an illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating and discovering quality, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses to view what the Night hides, which the Moon (tho unclouded, and at Full) cannot so well do. It shews things as they are. In the Dark we may stumble and fall, yea, handle venemous Creatures, or fall into Dens, and tumble from Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that by its Light we are guided in all the Actions of our natural Life.</p>
                                    <p n="26">XXVI. The Sun is of a very pleasing and rejoycing quality: as Darkness and Sadness are Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">Job 30.11</note> so are Light and Joy. When
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:41512:234"/>
the Heavens are obscured with black Clouds, the whole Creation sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thizes, and looks sadly; but when the Clouds are scattered, and the Sun appears in its native Brightness, its Light is sweet, and (as <hi>Solomon</hi> says) <hi>'Tis a pleasant thing for the Eyes to behold the Sun.</hi>

                                    <p n="27">XXVII. The Sun makes the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Seasons of the Year, Winter and Summer, Spring and Autumn, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its access and recess to and from the several and respective Climates. When it rises higher in our Horizon, it makes the Spring, cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every Bush with Leaves, and crowning the Gardens and Fields with Flowers; but when the Sun re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires, every thing hangs down its Head, the Grass and Flowers wither, and all their Beauty and verdant Fragrancy vanish.</p>
                                    <p n="28">XXVIII. The Sun operates ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Matter it shines upon. It softens Wax, melts Snow and Ice, but hardens Clay. It causes a Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil to send forth a more corrupt and unsavoury Scent; but makes Roses, and other Blossoms yield a more fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant and delightful Odour.</p>
                                    <p n="29">XXIX. The Sun is often covered with Clouds, and even in its Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian Altitude or Exaltation 'tis sometimes hid from our Eyes; yet nevertheless its powerful Influence and Efficacy is not then gone.</p>
                                    <p n="30">XXX. Some cannot bear the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and scorching Heat of the Sun.</p>
                                    <p n="31">XXXI. The Sun drowns and swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows up the Glory of the lesser Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries, as the Moon and Stars.</p>
                                    <p n="32">XXXII. When the gross Body of the Moon interposes betwixt us and the Sun, it becomes eclipsed, either wholly or in part, in our Horizon.</p>

How insignificant the World, with all its outward Pomp and imaginary Glory, is to release him, and afford any solid Content or Satisfaction. 4.

HEnce we may learn to know the Worth and Excellency of Christ, as also the indispensible and absolute Necessity every Soul lies under of receiving Divine Illuminations from this everlasting Sun: for as natural Bodies perish without the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the natural Sun; so will Souls, if the Sun of Righteousness give not his Life-cherishing Efficacy.</p>

                                    <p n="1">I. THe Vine seems not so lovely, stately and amiable to look upon as some other Trees; 'tis not so high and lofty as the Cedar, nor to be compared for strength to the Oak; nor for Beauty to the Palm or Firr-Tree.</p>
                                    <p n="2">II. The Vine nevertheless hath a more honourable Name given to it than other Trees. The Lord's choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest Plantation (the Church) is exprest by it; and therefore 'tis dignified with the Title of <hi>Goodly</hi> and <hi>Noble.</hi>

                                    <p n="3">III. The Vine gives large Shoots, grows much in its young and tender Age, and brings forth Fruit in a short time after it is planted.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV. The Vine wonderfully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with Sap, and inward Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, bearing and nourishing many large Branches, which spread ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly; yet all partake of its Root and Fatness (as it is said of the Olive-Tree) where there is enough to feed all,<note place="margin">Rom. 17.17.</note> and make them flourish and bear Fruit abundantly.</p>

                                    <p n="7">VII. The Vine yields profitable Fruit; <hi>The Blood of the Grape</hi> (as 'tis called, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.14.) is a great Strengthener and Supporter of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>Paul</hi> advises <hi>Timothy</hi> to <hi>drink a little Wine</hi> for his Stomacks sake,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.23.</note> and often-infirmity.

The great and incomparable Virtue that is in the Lord Jesus Christ, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently good to cure all the Diseases and Maladies of the Soul; it cures Spiritual Blindness, it softens an hard Heart, it cures Stubbornness and Obstinacy, by his blessed Infusion of Grace; in a word, there is no Malady too hard for this Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Physician.

                                    <p n="1">I. AN Embassador or Messenger of Peace is an honourable Person, and usually a great Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite to the King.</p>
                                    <p n="2">II. An Embassador is a wise Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, skilled in State-Affairs, and knows how to adjust National Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, or to make up a Breach or Breaches that may be between one Kingdom and another.</p>
                                    <p n="3">III. An Embassador must be of known Integrity and Faithfulness, as well as of Ability, great Trust being reposed in him.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV. An Embassador is appointed and made choice of to this great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and Place of Trust, by the determination and decree of the King.</p>
                                    <p n="5">
                                       <pb n="231" facs="tcp:41512:241"/>V. A Person that is chosen to go an Embassador, must accept of the Place and Work, before he takes his leave of the Court.</p>
                                    <p n="6">VI. An Embassador is entrusted with Matters of great weight and moment, things that concern Peace and War, the Weal and Wo of Kingdoms and Nations.</p>
                                    <p n="7">VII. An Embassador, as he is chosen, and entrusted with Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of great consequence; so likewise, that he might be invested with a Legal Power, he receives a special Commission from the Prince or State he represents, which does authorize him to that Work and Office.</p>
                                    <p n="8">VIII. An Embassador, having received his Commission, leaves his own Kingdom, and goes into that Country, to which his Prince hath ordered him, there to negotiate the Affairs that are committed unto him.</p>
                                    <p n="9">IX. An <hi>Embassador of Peace</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents the Person of the Prince or State that sent him; so that the same Honour and Dignity, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity, that is shewed to him, is shewed thereby to the Sovereign whom he represents: And it is easy to guess how much they esteem the Prince, by the Respects they pay to his Embassador.</p>
                                    <p n="10">X. An <hi>Embassador</hi> is strictly tied to the prescribed Rules, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and Directions, which are delivered to him, and doth not, must not proceed contrary unto them.</p>
                                    <p n="11">
                                       <pb n="232" facs="tcp:41512:242"/>XI. An Embassador is oftentimes sent to prevent or put an end to War, that thereby great Effusion of Blood, Ruin, and Desolation might be stopp'd and prevented.</p>
                                    <p n="12">XII. An Embassador offers Terms, or makes Proposals to the adverse Party, thereby finally to conclude and make a lasting Peace.</p>
                                    <p n="13">XIII. An Embassador that hath a tender Heart, is greatly grieved when he sees his Mediation and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Terms of Peace to be slighted and rejected; and from the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the woful Misery and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity that is like to follow, he is the more importunate, using many Arguments to cause Compliance.</p>
                                    <p n="14">XIV. An Embassador hath many Servants, or a great Retinue waiting upon him, and is a Person deserving much Honour, in discharging his Trust with very much Awe and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to his Prince.</p>
                                    <p n="15">XV. An Embassador hath Power given him to ratify and confirm Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Peace between Kingdoms and Nations, who are at variance, that so there may be Commerce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them in future Times.</p>
                                    <p n="16">XVI. A faithful Embassador is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with abundance of Joy at his return home, and is highly preferr'd, as a Testimony of great Favour, for his Works sake.</p>
                                    <p n="17">
                                       <pb n="233" facs="tcp:41512:242"/>XVII. An Embassador not having success in his Business, in bringing the Adversary to amicable Terms of Peace and Reconciliation, many times against those Nations or Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that refuse, bloody War is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, and great Desolation fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
                                    <p n="18">XVIII. An Embassador is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an Instrument to save Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, and Ten Thousands of Souls from Death, and Kingdoms from Fire, Sword, and Destruction; and thereby he raises Trophies to his Fame and Glory.</p>

                        <p>As Witnesses amongst Men are absolutely necessary to the keeping up of Justice, and deciding all matters of moment between Man and Man: Even so Almighty God, intending to deal with Men according to this Rule, hath in Wisdom thought fit to provide Himself with a Witness for the keeping up of Justice, and deciding of all matters between Himself and Mankind; and according to his own rich and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired Grace, he hath provided a Witness, who is free from all exception, both in respect of his Faithfulness and Knowledge of things, and that is Jesus Christ himself, who is set forth to be the true and faithful Witness, the beginning of the Creation of God, who in point of Antiquity is very capable to set forth and attest whatsoever is necessary to be known of God, and in whatsoever a faithful and true Witness (in point of usefulness) can be unto Men, that and much more is Jesus Christ between God and Mankind. For the illustration whereof take these following Considerations.</p>

                           <p n="1">I. THis informs us of the great Wisdom and Condescension of God, in contriving such a blessed Foundation for the Church and all true Believers to build upon; it was the purpose of God to found his Temple upon a sure Basis, even the Rock Christ Jesus.</p>
                           <p n="2">II. It also sets forth the happy and glorious State of the House of God; what can add greater Glory to it, than to have a Foundation so precious, lasting, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent!</p>
                           <p n="3">III. It shews the Honour and Excellency of Gospel-Ministration; Ministers do not only propound Christ, but in a subordinate sence, in the Ministry of the Word may be said to lay Christ as a Foundation; Hence <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>I have laid the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for we are Labourers together with God:</hi> 1 Cor. 3.9, 10.</p>
                           <p n="4">IV. It reproves those that lay aside and reject this Foundation, and build upon others; as,</p>
                           <p n="1">1. The <hi>Papists,</hi> that build upon <hi>Peter,</hi> and on their own Merits; and what their Merits are, <hi>England</hi> and other Nations can soon resolve.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The <hi>Quakers,</hi> who build upon the Light of Natural Conscience; they refuse the Person of Christ, and the valuable Price of his Blood, and introduce in his room an inward Quality, <hi>viz.</hi> that Beam of Light that shines in Men from Jesus Christ,<note place="margin">Joh. 1.9.</note> considered as Creator.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Such as build but in part on Christ, come justly under the verge of this use of Reprehension, because they do not lay all the stress and hope of their Salvation upon this Foundation.</p>

                           <p n="9">9. Do you not build upon present Purposes and Resolutions to change your ways and course of Life hereafter: is not this that which supports and stays your Minds?</p>

                           <p n="6">VI. This may caution all Preachers of the Gospel, to take heed how, and what they build. Upon this Foundation if they build Wood, Hay, or Stubble they will suffer Loss. Let them be very careful they preach nothing for Doctrine but what Christ hath given in Commission, and receive none, lay none into the Building but living Stones, such as are well hew'd and squar'd, and fitted by the Spirit and Word for the Spiritual Building: for God's Temple must be built with Gold, Silver, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones.</p>
                           <p n="7">VII. Let all such that are not built upon this sure Foundation, be exhorted with all speed to get an Interest in this Rock: for otherwise your Building will be on the Sand, and you will fall into the lowest Hell at last.</p>
                           <p n="8">VIII. It demonstrates the happy State of those that are built upon this sure Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Prophets and Apostles, <hi>Jesus Christ himself being the chief Corner-Stone, in whom all the Building,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Col 2.9. Eph. 2.21, 22.</note> &amp;c. And let all those that speak the Truth grow up in Love unto him in all things, who is the Head Labour, to be well fixed, cemented and united to this Foundation, that you may be established in the Faith.</p>
                           <p n="9">IX. And lastly, This may comfort the Godly in the worst of Times; for as it is a Foundation of God's laying, and of so excellent a nature in its self, you may be sure 'tis not in the Power of Men nor Devils to raze or destroy it; be sure you shall be saved, whoever you are, that build in a right manner on the Rock of Ages, the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

                                    <p n="5">V. Other Buildings must have many Stones for one Corner, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and joyned together to compleat and finish the Superstruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and those Stones that are laid for one Corner, will not serve for every Corner of the same House.</p>

                                    <p n="2">2. He is so, it appears, in that he is the choice Diamond, the Delight and Jewel of his Father's Heart, his only begotten Son, who lay in his Bosome.</p>
                                    <p n="3">3. He is most precious, in that he is preferred so much above Angels, and in his being able to undertake the Work of our Redemption, which none in Heaven or Earth had Worth enough in them to do. Nothing less than this choice and valuable Jewel or precious Stone would be received, as a sufficient Price to satisfy the Justice of God, or make full Compensation for Sin, the Breach of God's holy Law.</p>
                                    <p n="4">4. He is most precious in respect of his Qualifications; He hath the fulness of the Godhead in him. <hi>It pleased the Father that in him, all Fulness should dwell:</hi>
                                       <note place="margin">Joh. 1.14, 16. Heb. 1.9.</note> hence said to be <hi>full of Grace and Truth. God, even thy God hath anointed thee with the Oil of Gladness above thy Fellows.</hi> He hath not, say Divines, the Fulness of Parts, but the Fulness of Degrees: There may be some Addition made to that Fulness that is in Believers; but there can be no Addition made to his. There is in Christ, not only enough, the Fulness of Sufficiency, but also the Fulness of Redundancy. Angels may have no want, but in Christ is an Overplus to redound to others. He hath enough to fill thousands, and millions of thousands. <hi>Of his Fulness we have all received, and Grace for Grace.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="5">5. Christ is precious in the esteem of the holy Angels, the Angelical Host, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and shew their high esteem and awful respects to him, at his Birth sang with a loud voice, <hi>Glory to God in the Highest.</hi> They adore and worship him continually. All the Godly accounted, and will for ever account of Him as the most precious and inestimable Jewel in Heaven or Earth. The Saints in Heaven for ever proclaim his

glorious Worth and Praise; they cry, <hi>Power, Riches, Wisdom, Strength, Honour,</hi>
                                       <note place="margin">Rev. 5.11, 12. Phil. 3.8, 9, 10. Cant. 5.10</note> 
                                       <hi>Glory and Blessing to the Lamb for ever and ever.</hi> To all the Saints on Earth he is precious. <hi>Paul</hi> accounted all things as dung, that he might win Christ; The Spouse crys out, <hi>He is white and ruddy, the chiefest amongst ten thousand.</hi> Believers have parted with all things in this World freely for his sake; Nay, in love to him, and to shew how they did adore and honour him, have been made Sacrifices in dreadful Flames, rather than they would undervalue or deny his holy Name. Christ is precious, very precious, most precious, always precious, altogether precious; Precious in his Nature, precious in his Name, that is as precious Ointment poured forth; precious in all his Offices; his Spirit, Grace, Word, Ordinances and Promises are precious. Can Believers value him enough, who is their Life, Life External, Life Internal, and Life Eternal? Christ is their Light, he is their Mediator, Surety, Friend, Food, Clothing, Ornaments, Portion, &amp;c. in a word, He is All in All to them.</p>
                                    <p n="7">VII. Christ being a precious Stone, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver loses his Strength or Beauty, as he cannot be defaced by Men nor Devils; Eternity it self cannot dissolve this Stone, nor diminish its brightness. Christ is du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: Heaven and Earth shall fade away, and wax old, like a Garment, but Jesus Christ is still the same, and his years fail not, he is the same yesterday, to day,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.8.</note> and for ever.</p>

                                    <p n="9">IX.

                           <p n="1">I. FRom hence we may infer, That the Church of God is a very rich and glorious Building, as 'twas foretold it should be: <hi>O thou afflicted, tossed with Tempests,</hi>

                           <p n="4">IV. For Trial. Is Christ precious to you? I shall lay down a few Rules, whereby you may try your selves.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Dost thou own Christ to be very God? He cannot be valued nor esteemed by any, as he is in himself, till they thus account of him, and believe in him.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Dost thou honour, adore, and obey Him, as thou dost honour, adore, and obey the Father? <hi>All Men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Joh. 5.23.</note>
                           </p>
                           <p n="3">3. Is there nothing here below, which thou valuest and prizest above Christ? An Hypocrite hath always something that lies in his Bosom, which he esteems and prizes more than Christ: <hi>Their Hearts go after their Covetousness.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Ezek. 33.31.</note> The young Man went

                           <p n="4">4. If God should bid thee ask what thou wilt, as he did <hi>Solomon,</hi> what wouldest thou request of him? Would it be (thinkest thou) this precious Stone, this Christ, this Pearl of great price, to have a Right to him, to be like him, to enjoy him, to be with him for ever?</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Is Christ much in your Thoughts? <hi>Where your Treasure is, there your Hearts will be also.</hi>

                           <p n="7">7. Canst thou not be satisfied with any thing thou dost enjoy without him? Canst thou say, with one in another Case, <hi>Yet all this availeth me nothing,</hi> so long as I see not, or have not a clear Evidence of my Interest in Jesus Christ.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. Dost thou build wholly upon Him? Is He All to thee? Dost thou see him all in Pacification? 'Twas he that appeased the Wrath of the Father, satisfied both Law and Justice. He is All in Justification: <hi>Who is the Lord, our Righteousness.</hi> He is All in Election, the first and chief of his Father's Choice, the way of it: <hi>He hath chosen us in him.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Eph. 1.4. &amp; 5.11.</note> Is He All to thee for Acceptation: <hi>Who hath made us accepted in the Beloved.</hi> He is All in Conversion?

'Tis by his own Blood, <hi>viz.</hi> that Atonement which he hath made, we come to have our Sins forgiven; 'tis he that gives us a Heart to ask it, and a Hand to receive it. Is Christ All to thee in respect of every Grace? He gives Faith; 'tis he that is the Author and Finisher of it; 'tis he that <hi>sheds Love abroad in our Hearts,</hi>

                              <hi>by the Holy-Ghost.</hi> All Grace is treasured up in him all Grace is communicated to us through him. Is he all to thee in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry of the Word? 'tis Christ that is preached, 'tis he that gives Grace to preach, and opens the Ear to hear the Word preached, and helps the Soul to receive the Word. Is Christ all to thee in Ordinances? The Lord's Supper holds forth his Death, his Body broken, and his Blood shed. He is the sum and substance of it. Baptism shews his Burial, and his Resurrection. In Ordinances or Duties, art thou not satisfied un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less thou meetest with Christ Jesus?</p>
                           <p n="9">9. Art thou willing to accept of Christ as the Father offers him? Art thou willing to have him to be thy Prince, as well as thy Saviour? to destroy thy Sin, as well as to save thy Soul?</p>
                           <p n="10">10. Dost thou long to be like him? art thou willing and desirous to be holy, as to be happy? to live to him here, as well as to live with him hereafter? Is every thing in Christ, or that belongs to Christ, precious to thee?</p>
                           <p n="5">V. Reproof; This reprehends those that lay aside, and would build without this precious Corner-Stone. Who they are, see Metaphor, <hi>Christ the Foundation.</hi>

                           <p>Qu. <hi>Some may say,</hi> What shall we do to get Christ, to obtain him who is so precious?</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Let thy Sins go. 2. Let all thy Righteousness go in point of dependence, do not trust to that. 3.

                           <p n="4">IV. Of what amazing nature was the great Condescension of the Blessed JESUS,<note place="margin">Gen. 49.10.</note> who made <hi>himself of no Reputation!</hi> became <hi>weak, poor,</hi> and sensible of our <hi>Infirmities</hi> (touching the Flesh,) that we might be <hi>strong, rich,</hi> and partake of his <hi>Perfections,</hi>

                           <p n="5">V. Here is also very much Comfort to all true Believers, whoever they be, that are gathered by the Word and Spirit unto Christ: He will succour, guide, revive, and defend them for ever. He infinitely out-doth the Hen; his Bowels exceed the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of the tenderest Mother to her sucking Child. He is strong enough also, as well as tender, not only willing but able. Fear not Satan, he hath swallowed up Death in Victory. The Kite hath (as one observes) as it were an aking tooth at the Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, fain would he make a prey of them: so would the Devil of Believers. Christ knows how to preserve them, by gathering them all under his Wings. Soul, fear not, if thou art under the Protection of the Lord Jesus Christ, thou art in safety from all temporal and spiritual dangers.</p>
                           <p n="6">VI. If Christ be so tender and compassionate unto Sinners, and seeks to gather them unto him; who will pity them if they perish at last and are damned, when all is from their own vile stubborn and wilfull Obstinacy?</p>
                           <p n="7">VII. If the Lord Jesus Christ be so tender of, and kind to his Saints which he hath gathered to himself, and sheltered under his Wings; Then let this Doctrine teach Christians in an especial manner to be kind one to another, and tender one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to do their utmost endeavour to defend one another in this evil day, from the common Enemy both of Body and Soul.</p>
                           <p n="8">VIII. This may serve for seasonable Reproof to all those, who profess the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and hope for Preservation by him, and Shelter under his Wings, yet (instead of endeavouring to the utmost to help one another, revile, backbite and persecute one another) for small and circumstantial Differences in Profession, and thereby give the common Enemy Advantage upon them both; <hi>A divided House cannot stand.</hi>

The Contempts of his Enemies, nor Perswasion of his Friends, could not at all abate his Valor, he knew he must, and resolved he would be <hi>about his Father's Business.</hi> Luk. 2.49. 4.

Sometimes you have Christ commending his Spouse, sometimes the Spouse speaking in the praise of Christ, as she doth here, <hi>A Bundle of Myrrh, a Cluster of Camphire, is my Beloved unto me.</hi> A Soul espoused to Jesus Christ hath a great Love to him, and an high Esteem of him, knows not how to set out that excellent Worth and Beauty it beholds in him.</p>

THe Lord Jesus is a very solid Light, whose Glory is not like others who have their Intermissions; but he abides steady, his Glory and Bright-shining is always alike, his whole course of Life was as if it had been but one continued Act of Goodness; He is the same in the Morning, Noon and Night; <hi>Yesterday, to day and for ever.</hi> Heb. 13.8.</p>

His coming was the fulfilling of God's gracious Promise unto the Fathers, and as the blessed manifestation of God's rich Favour and good Will to Man; he is also the Fore-runner or the Harbinger of that Dominion that the Just shall have in the Resurrection, the morning of the longed-for Day. <hi>The path of the Just is as a shining Light, that shineth more and more to the perfect day.</hi> Prov. 4.18. <hi>The upright shall have Dominion over them in the Morning.

                                    <p n="3">III. Jesus Christ is not only an Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Christian Church and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, far beyond what <hi>Moses</hi> was to the <hi>Jews</hi>; but even to Heaven it self, and the Holy Angels, who did not a little rejoyce at his ascending into Heaven. <hi>God is gone up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a Trumpet; sing Praises to our God, sing Praises.</hi> Psal. 47.5.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV.

Psal. 17.15. <hi>I have a desire</hi> (saith Paul) <hi>to depart and to be with Christ,</hi> &amp;c. Phil. 1.23. Those that look for him do also cry, <hi>Come Lord Jesus, come quickly.</hi>

                                    <p n="1">I. A Judg necessarily supposes a People under a Law to be judged by; for there can be no Action where there is no Object, nor any Exercise of Power, or Judicial Proceeding, without a Subject.</p>
                                    <p n="2">II. A Judg is, or ought to be a Person fit for the Place and Office whereto he is called.</p>
                                    <p n="1">1. A Judg ought to be a Man of great Wisdom and Prudence.</p>
                                    <p n="2">2. A Judg is a Man of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg; 'tis necessary that he should be well acquainted with all the Laws of his Sovereign.</p>
                                    <p n="3">3. A Judg is, or ought to be, a Man of Goodness, not subject to Anger, Malice, or Revenge; and it is very requisite it should be so, otherwise great Dammage might ensue, upon the ill disposition of the Judg.</p>
                                    <p n="4">4. A Judg is, or ought to be, a Man of Justice and Impartiality, that will not respect Persons in Judgment, take Bribes, or know the Faces of any, tho never so great among Men. <hi>Aaron</hi> was not to know his Father nor Mother in Judgment.</p>
                                    <p n="5">5. A good and upright Judg is a Man of Courage and Boldness, will not <hi>say to the Wicked, Thou art righteous</hi>; nor excuse the Faults of great Men through fear.</p>
                                    <p n="3">III. The Place and Work of a Judg is grounded upon good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: 1. The Honour of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign. 2. The Reasonableness of Sovereignty or Authority. 3. The
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:41512:267"/>
Justness of the Laws. 4. In respect of the Subject.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV. A Judg is appointed to his Place and Office; he acts not of himself, but by Commission.</p>
                                    <p n="5">V. A Judg hath his set Time or Days limited, wherein to keep a general Sessions, or hold a solemn Assize, for the Honour of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Lord the King.</p>
                                    <p n="6">VI. A Judg, when he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Commission, and the set Day is come, hath power to summon all Parties concerned, and order all Offenders to appear before him in Judgment.</p>
                                    <p n="7">VII. A Judg, after this great Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance upon his Summons, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters upon his Work, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists chiefly in three great Points:
<list>
                                          <item>1. To open the Law.</item>
                                          <item>2. To examine Witnesses.</item>
                                          <item>3. To arraign the Offenders.</item>

                                    <p n="8">VIII. A Judg charges Matter of Fact in Judgment, and proceeds to clear Proof and Evidence, by a

sufficient Number of proper Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses touching the same.</p>
                                    <p n="9">IX. A Judg, by this Order and Method of Proceeding, keeps up the Honour of the Law, which he makes his Rule in all his Acts of Judgment.</p>
                                    <p n="10">X. A Judg is very terrible upon the Seat of Judgment, in three respects: 1. He is cloathed with Majesty. 2. He hath very great Attendants; as the Sheriffs, Justices of the Peace, and the Gentry of the County about him. 3. He passeth a solemn and fatal Sentence upon guilty Criminals.</p>
                                    <p n="11">
                                       <pb n="284" facs="tcp:41512:268"/>XI. A Judg hath the Command of Officers to see Sentence executed and pronounced, as Sheriffs, depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Sheriffs, with Keepers of Prisons, and the like.</p>

                                    <p n="2">II. Jesus Christ infinitely excells all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Judges in respect of Fitness to this Office, or Excellency of Qualifications, as will appear by what follows.</p>
                                    <p n="1">1. Christ is wise, not only far beyond <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> but all the Angels in Heaven; the Learned amongst the Jews admired his Wisdom: He is called (as hath been often hinted) the <hi>Wisdom of God.</hi>

                                    <p n="2">2. The Lord Jesus Christ is full of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, full Proofs of which he gave before his advancement to his Dignity. He is not forward to accuse, is free from Anger, not subject to take advantage by the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of an Offender, but ready to pity and forgive, if the Circumstances of the Cause will bear it: An Instance of which we have in what Christ said to the Woman taken in Adultery: <hi>He that is without Sin, let him cast the first Stone,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Joh. 8.7.</note>

                                    <p n="7">VII. The Lord Christ, immediatly after Summons, upon this great Appearance before his dread Tribunal, enters upon his last and great Work. First, to open the three great Law-Books,<note place="margin">Rev. 20.12</note> that Men have lived under, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The Law of Nature, 2. The Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> 3. The Gospel-Law. The Judg being set, the Books are opened; next in Order the Witnesses appear, and first those that gave the Laws; and they are of three sorts: 1. God, that wrote the Law of Nature after an invisible manner on the Hearts of Men: <hi>I will come near you to Judgment, and be a swift Witness against you, saith the Lord.</hi> 2. <hi>Moses,</hi> that delivered the Law to <hi>Israel: There is one that accuses you,</hi>
                                       <note place="margin">Mal. 3.5. Joh. 5.45.</note> 
                                       <hi>even</hi> Moses, <hi>in whom you trust.</hi> 3. The Apostles, that published the Gospel-Law, not to Jews only, but to the Gentile World: These will appear not only to judg the twelve Tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> but the Gentiles, whose Persons and Works also must be tried by Christ, as well as the Jews: <hi>He shall judg the Secrets of all Men.</hi>
                                       <note place="margin">Rom. 2.16</note>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="8">VIII. Jesus Christ will judg the World, <hi>viz.</hi> all Men, both Jews and Gentiles, according to their Works: <hi>God shall bring every Work into Judgment,</hi>

thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</hi> The Necessity of which appears in these four Cases: 1. The Scripture will not else be fulfilled, and made good, which doth fully assert the bringing to Light the <hi>hidden things of Darkness,</hi> and <hi>making manifest the Counsels of the Heart.</hi> 2. The Ungodly will not otherwise be convinced of all their ungodly Deeds,<note place="margin">Jude 15.</note> and all their hard Speeches, which ungodly Sinners have spoken against the Lord. 3. The Judgment will not otherwise appear just, upon which the Glory of the Judg doth so much depend: <hi>'Tis for his Glory, to overcome when he judgeth.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>And unless Matter of Fact be charged, due Proportions will not be weighed out and awarded according to Desert, with clearness and satisfaction, either in a way of Mercy or just Severity, to all Spectators. Therefore the Gentiles shall be charged with Matter of Fact against the Law of Nature: <hi>Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                                    </p>
                                    <p>The fore-mentioned Witnesses are sufficient to prove Matter of Fact, both in point of Number and Capacity. The first and chief Witness will be God himself, who knew all things, and there can be nothing hid from him. The second Witness will be Conscience, which was and is with Men in all Places and Actions, which Man could never leave at home, nor shun his Company, when he went out, or when he came in.<note place="margin">Rom. 2.15</note> He is with him in his most secret Retirements, and has often told him, that there was one above (even God) that seeth all things.</p>
                                    <p>Besides these two Witnesses that are of such mighty Credit, there may be three more added, namely, 1. The good Angels, which are much busied in this World to watch Men, and inspect their Ways. 2. The evil Angels, who are never out of Mens Company, and have voluntarily of their own accord been Accusers of the Brethren, who will give Testimony at the Bar of Christ against their own Proselites, if God calls for it. 3. The ordinary Companions of Transgressors, with whom Counsel was held about evil Projects, Designs, and Actions of Murder, Theft, Drunkenness, and Adultery, whose Tongues shall (no doubt) be as ready to accuse their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades, as to confess their own Faults, concerning whom we are inform'd, that not only <hi>every Knee shall bow,</hi> but <hi>every Tongue shall confess,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                                    <p n="9">IX. Jesus Christ will magnify the Law, and make it honourable, in that the Word or Law spoken by Angels, by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> by Himself, and his holy Apostles, shall be the Rule of Judgment at the last Day.</p>
                                    <p n="10">X. Jesus Christ, the high and great Judg of Heaven and Earth, at the end of the World, on his Judgment-Seat, will be very terrible in three respects. 1.

The same regard is to be had to him in Faith, Worship, and Obedience, as unto the Persons of the Father and the Son; for our being baptized in his Name, is our solemn Engagement to believe in him, yield obedience to him, and worship him, as it puts the same Obligation upon us to the Father and Son.</p>

                                    <p>THe Wind is invisible; no Man ever saw it, nor is the way of it known; it passeth the Skill of Man,<note place="margin">Joh. 3.8.</note> to find out from whence it cometh, and whither it goeth.</p>
                                    <p n="2">II. The Wind blows at God's Command; He is said to <hi>hold the Wind in his Fist.</hi>

                                    <p n="3">III. The Wind has a purging quality in it; it cleanseth and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth the Air, which otherwise would be hurtful and prejudicial to Man; it drives away those ill Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors and Stinks that arise from the Earth.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV. The Wind hath a cooling Property; how much do People in hot Countries desire to have the Wind blow, to lay the Extremity of Heat?</p>
                                    <p n="5">V. The Wind hath a clearing quality, dispersing Clouds, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Serenity, expelling all Mists and Foggs which darken the Air.</p>

                                       <pb n="298" facs="tcp:41512:275"/>VI. The South Wind, as Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralists observe, is of a thawing qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which Experience oft-times shews to be true.</p>
                                    <p n="7">VII. The Wind is of a searching quality; it finds out the most hidden Places, it passes through the most private Corners, and undiscernible Crannies.</p>

                                    <p n="9">IX. The Motions of the Wind are various; sometimes it blows one way, and sometimes another; when it blows on high in one part of the Kingdom, it is low, or hardly blows at all in another part: Its several Motions also have various Effects and Properties.</p>
                                    <p n="10">X. The Wind blows freely where it lists; we cannot command the Wind to blow when<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and how we would.</p>
                                    <p n="11">XI. The Wind blows and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth sometimes powerfully, strongly, and irresistibly; it hath a mighty force in it, bearing down all that stands in its way; it turns up the Cedars of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> rends the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and breaks Rocks in pieces.</p>
                                    <p n="12">XII. The Winds many times by their blowing cause Rain, by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving the Clouds.</p>

                                       <pb n="299" facs="tcp:41512:275"/>XIII. Men observe or take good notice of the blowing of the Wind, and by certain Signs, <hi>viz.</hi> by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the Clouds, Vanes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they know which way it blows.</p>
                                    <p n="14">XIV. The Wind, Naturalists ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, causes some Flowers to wither, and hang down their Heads.</p>
                                    <p n="15">XV. The Wind, tho it be invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and cannot be seen, yet it may be heard, and its Effects are seen, and its Influences evidently felt and experienced by all.</p>
                                    <p n="16">XVI. The Wind cherishes, and causes Plants and Grass to grow and thrive; as 'tis observed by some, that nothing will grow and thrive without it. 'Tis thought, that the Roots of Things being moved by the Wind, it causes them to root the more, making the Ground to give way unto them, by which means they take the faster hold.</p>
                                    <p n="17">XVII. The Wind is useful for Navigation, to carry a Ship from one Port unto another; for if
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:41512:276"/>
the Wind does not blow, they are becalm'd; nor can they sail at all without it.</p>
                                    <p n="18">XVIII. The Wind is very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to fan or winnow Wheat, to sever the Chaff or light Seed from the good Corn or Grain.</p>
                                    <p n="19">XIX. The Wind rises high, and blows powerfully; sometimes it riseth on a sudden, and at other times gradually.</p>
                                    <p n="20">XX. Naturalists tell us, that an Earthquake is occasioned by the Wind;<note place="margin">See <hi>Pliny</hi>; also <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum Mundi,</hi> p. 173.</note> certain Exhalations (or Wind) being got into the Earth, shake it.</p>

                                    <p>THe holy Spirit is invisible, and works invisibly; none of the Ways and Operations thereof can be perceived or seen by mortal Eyes: <hi>Neither doth the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Man understand the things of the Spirit,</hi>
                                       <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.14.</note> 
                                       <hi>nor can he.</hi> The Workings and Operations thereof are of a hidden and mysterious Nature, hardly to be found out by the Godly themselves.</p>
                                    <p n="2">II. The Operations of the Spirit are from God; 'tis He that causes or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Spiritual Winds to blow upon the Souls of Men and Women.</p>
                                    <p n="3">III. The holy Spirit cleanseth the Soul of a Sinner, purging out all those hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fumes, that arise from the inward Corruption of the Heart; it expells and works out Deadness and Indisposedness to Good, and removes those things that cause a Man to be unsavoury in his Place and Generation, and which indeed makes him not to savour of the things of God.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV. The Spirit also is of a cooling na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which abates the burning Lust of Concupiscence, and the scorching of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's fiery Darts and Temptations,<note place="margin">Eph. 6.16.</note> (as is further open'd in the Metaphor of <hi>Water.</hi>) How comfortable is it in time of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to have the Wind of the Spirit blow upon the Soul? the Desire after Evil is presently allayed thereby.</p>
                                    <p n="5">V. The holy Spirit disperseth the Clouds of Ignorance and Darkness in the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,<note place="margin">Eph. 1.18.</note> and drives away those Mists of Temptation, which cause Men to lose their way, and by its powerful Influence makes fair Weather in the Soul.</p>
                                    <p n="6">
                                       <pb n="298" facs="tcp:41512:275"/>VI. The holy Spirit melts or thaws the cold and frozen Heart of a Sinner. The Hearts of Men are naturally congealed, like Ice, hard and obdurate; but no sooner doth the Spirit come to blow upon it, but this hardness thaws and dissolves into a Flood of Tears.<note place="margin">Acts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2.36, 37.</note>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="7">VII. The Holy Spirit tries the Heart and Reins, and finds out the very Thoughts of Men; 'tis said, <hi>to search all things, yea, the deep things of God;</hi>

The Spirit dries up the filthy Issue of our sinful Humors, which makes our way to Heaven very hard and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult; and also ripens us (like Wheat) for the Lord's Harvest.

                                    <p n="9">IX. The Spirit moves and operates va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously; sometimes it blows upon one People, and sometimes upon another; sometimes upon one Church it blows powerfully, when upon another at that time its Operations are hardly discernible. Again, sometimes the North Wind of the Spirit blows, which is sharp, cold, and nipping, (Rebukes and Reproofs of the Spirit, and Afflictions, are like the blowing of the North Wind) which tends to kill the Weeds and Worms of our Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions. And then again, at another time the South Wind blows, which is warm,<note place="margin">See <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi>
                                       </note> comfortable, and refreshing; Peace, inward Joy, and Consolation of the Spirit, are signified thereby, as the Learned observe.</p>
                                    <p n="10">X. The Spirit of God is a free Agent; it moves, blows, and operates as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth; 'tis not at our Command. <hi>But all these things worketh the one and the same Spirit,</hi>
                                       <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 11.</note>

                                    </p>
                                    <p n="11">XI. The holy Spirit is powerful in its Operations, there is no standing before it. It brings down and levels all high, mighty, lofty, and towering Thoughts of Men; when in good earnest it begins to work upon the Heart, no Opposition that is made against it is able to stand. Tho Satan, and evil Relations, may endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to obstruct its workings, and hinder the Soul in its Purposes and Resolutions Heavenwards; yet nothing is effectual to impede the powerful Influences of the Spirit, and Grace of God; Mountains of Sin and Opposition are broken in pieces by it. When it once blows briskly upon the Soul, it presently cries out, <hi>Lord, what wouldest thou have me to do? Immediatly,</hi> saith Saul, <hi>I conferred not with Flesh and Blood.</hi>

                                    <p n="12">XII. The Spirit dissolving the Clouds of Iniquity, waters the Heart with Tears of Repentance and Godly Sorrow.</p>

                                       <pb n="299" facs="tcp:41512:275"/>XIII. The Blowings or Operations of the holy Spirit ought carefully to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, with the access and recess there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for a Christian can make no Earnest of the Duties of Religion, unless these Winds blow. Moreover, there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Signs, whereby a Man may know which way the Spirit blows. 1. If the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of the Soul are after God and Holiness, it is one sign the Wind is in a right Point. 2. If the Understanding be enlightned, and Clouds of Ignorance scattered, the Affections changed, so that heavenly Objects are principally delighted in; if the Will is brought to yield, and readily to submit to the Will of God, the <hi>Spirit</hi> blows the right way. 3. If a Man leaves his old and evil Courses and Company; if that which was once pleasant to him, is now become grievous to him; if his Discourse be savoury, and his Life holy, you may know which way the Wind blows: <hi>They that are after the Spirit, do mind the things of the Spirit.</hi>
                                       <note place="margin">Rom. 8.5.</note> 4. If there be new Habits wrought in the Soul, so that altho a Man may sometimes be obstructed in his way, and hindred in his course Heaven-ward, yet immediatly, as it were by a natural or divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct, he falls into his former Way and Course of Grace and Holiness again; 'tis a sign which way the Wind blows. You know the Wind is sometimes obstructed or stopped in its usual course, by Houses or Trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so that you can hardly discern by Vanes or Smoak, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which way it is; so it may be with a Christian. Besides, sometimes you can scarcely perceive any Wind to blow at all, no more can you the Operations of the Spirit.</p>
                                    <p n="14">XIV. The Spirit of God blowing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Soul of a Sinner, causes his Pride and external Glory to fade away, which is compared to the Flower of the Field. <hi>The Rod hath blossomed. Pride hath budded. All Flesh is Grass,</hi>
                                       <note place="margin">Ezek. 7.10 Isa. 40.6, 7.</note> 
                                       <hi>and the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness thereof is as the Flower of the Field: The Grass withereth, the Flower fadeth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="15">XV. The holy <hi>Spirit,</hi> tho it be invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and its Operations mysterious, and not to be discern'd by many Men; yet they may see and hear the Effects of it, they may perceive what Alteration and Changes it makes in this and that Man: such as were very vicious and ungodly, are by the Workings of the <hi>Spirit</hi> formed into another likeness, and become pious, and truly religious; that Tongue that was wont to blaspheme God, they now hear to praise and admire him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And Believers themselves clearly feel and experience the blessed Effects and Operations thereof in their own Souls.</p>
                                    <p n="16">XVI. The <hi>Spirit</hi> of God causes the Saints to grow in Grace, and in the Knowledg of our Lord Jesus Christ. The Spirit moves upon the Affections, and every other Faculty of the Heart, and by that means causes the Seed of Grace to take the deeper Root. The Ground or Spirit of a Christian must be broken, and loosened from the World, and from the Love of sensual things more and more, by the Wind of the Spirit, or he will not be fruitful in Grace and good Works.</p>
                                    <p n="17">XVII. Unless the Spirit blows upon the Soul, or upon the Church, they lie becalmed, and cannot sail towards the Haven of eternal Happiness; no Duty or
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:41512:276"/>
Service, performed in publick or private, can avail any thing; we get not a Bit of Ground, nor any real Advantage by them, unless they are performed by the Help and Influence of the Spirit: <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi>
                                       <note place="margin">Joh. 4.24.</note> 
                                       <hi>and they that worship him must worship him in Spirit and in Truth.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="18">XVIII. The holy Spirit winnows and fans God's People, who are compared to Wheat and good Grain. 'Tis said of Christ, <hi>His Fan is in his Hand,</hi>
                                       <note place="margin">Mat. 3.12.</note> 
                                       <hi>and he will throughly purge his Floor.</hi> How doth Christ fan and purge his People, but by his Word and Spirit? 'tis that which clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and makes them pure from the Dross and Pollutions of Sin and Wickedness, as the Apostle observes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11.</p>
                                    <p n="19">XIX. The Spirit of God sometimes comes on a sudden upon a Soul, and by its powerful Operation, in a short space makes a great and wonderful Change; as appears in the Case of <hi>Saul</hi>: but at other times it riseth and worketh upon some Mens Hearts gradually.</p>
                                    <p n="20">XX. The holy Spirit, when it gets in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Heart of a Man, by its powerful Operation it makes him tremble, and shakes him to pieces, as it were, causing strange, tho glorious Workings in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man. This he doth by setting the Evil of Sin before his Eyes, and his woful Condition thereby.

                                    <p n="3">III. The Spirit is contrary to Satan that old Serpent, and all the cursed and killing Venom and Poison of Sin, and doth wonderfully expel and purge it out of the Soul, when God is pleased to give a suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able measure thereof; it secureth from the Insinuations of Sin, and 'twill cause a Man to vomit it up by unfeigned Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, by which means, the Life of the Soul is preserved: for if by the Operation of the Spirit, Sin is not vomited up, Death will certainly follow. <hi>Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.</hi> Luk. 13.3. <hi>For the Flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the Flesh, and these are contrary the one to the other.</hi> Gal. 5.17.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV. The Spirit of God will never min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, nor become one with the Flesh; the Spirit is from above, and ever endeavours to be uppermost, in what Heart soever it is, 'twill not be under the command of Sin nor Satan. <hi>Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the Lusts of the Flesh.</hi>

                                    <p n="9">IX. The Spirit feeds the Soul, yea it makes it fat and well liking; nothing nourishes comparable to the Spirit; the Word and Ordnances of God, are but dry Bread to it:<note place="margin">Isa. 25.6.</note> this is the chief of those fat things full of Marrow, by which God feasts,<note place="margin">Isa. 58.11.</note> and makes fat the Bones of his Saints.</p>

The Spirit of God being received and lived upon, the Abundance of the things of this World, that have in them by means of Sin, some hurtful and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting Quality, are made hereby very good and profitable to Believers; but for want of the Spirit's seasoning and sanctifying, they become deadly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to wicked Men, their Table, Bed, and all they enjoy, are made Snares to them. <hi>Take heed to your selves, lest at any time your Hearts be over-charged with surfeiting, and Drunkenness, and the Cares of this World,</hi> &amp;c.

The Holy Spirit is of exceeding great use against all Tremblings and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsions of the Soul in evil Times, it frees the Godly from all slavish Fears, which shake some Men for want of it, out of their Faith, Honesty, and Religion; and it keeps sincere ones stedfast, and imova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, from being shaken by false Doctrine and lying Spirits; which have troubled many with strange Convulsions, Shakings and Tremblings in this Nation; so that (as my Author saith) they have even foamed at the Mouth, when Quakerism first came up amongst us.</p>

                                    <p>AN Earnest is usually part of the best things which are in common Use and Estimation among Men; as Gold, Silver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="2">II. An Earnest imports some thing bought or sold, as also an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, or Consent between two Parties, for the confirming of some Contract or Promise, which before was not settled.</p>
                                    <p n="3">III. An Earnest is given as a Pledg of some future good thing, purchased or promised to a Person.</p>

<pb n="306" facs="tcp:41512:279"/>
Sum, twenty or thirty Pounds, sometimes more hath been given in earnest of an Inheritance: an Earnest is commonly proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned according to the worth or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of the Purchase.</p>
                                    <p n="5">V. An Earnest is that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms or makes sure a Bargain or Contract between two Parties, by the means of which each claims his own Interest and Property.</p>
                                    <p n="6">VI. An Earnest puts a Bar to any who would unjustly stop, disanul, or make void the Covenant agreed upon.</p>
                                    <p n="7">VII. An Earnest confirms a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, so that it gives assurance to him, that receives it, of the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or Purchase of whatsoever it is the Earnest.</p>

An Earnest as it is something given of a valuable consideration, to confirm a Bargain so; the Person that receives it, immediately enjoys it, he hath it in hand for his present Profit and Advantage; and many times a Man hath nothing else to live upon till he receives the whole Sum, but the Earnest-Mony.</p>

                                    <p n="2">II. The Earnest of the Spirit doth also denote (as 'tis observed by some) that spiritual Bargain which is made between God and a Believer. The Lord in a solemn Contract, requires of us our whole Soul, Life, Strength, the best we are, and are capable to perform for the Glory of his holy Name, and to the end he might have (as I may say) the Bargain punctually observed, hath given us an Earnest,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.2. 1 Cor. 6.19, 20.</note> to wit, his Spirit, and we in receiving of it, shew our Assent and Consent to the Contract, to serve the Lord and become his for ever.</p>
                                    <p n="3">III. The Spirit is given by the Father to Believers as a Pledg or Earnest of the blessed Inheritance, which Christ purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by his Blood for them, and upon the account of his own free Grace is promised to them. <hi>Who hath also sealed us, and given us the Earnest of the Spirit in our Hearts.</hi> 2 Cor. 1.22.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV. The Spirit which God giveth to Believers, as the Earnest of Eternal Life,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:41512:279"/>
is a great Sum, or that which is of consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Value; the Purchase being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite or invaluable, 'tis meet the Earnest should bear some Proportion to it; who is able to account or reckon up the worth of the Spirit of God, which is the Earnest of the Saints Inheritance?

                                    <p n="5">V. The Earnest of the Spirit which God hath given to his People, confirms that mutual Contract and Agreement which is between him and them: God hereby claims a new Covenant-Right to Believers, and Believers claim Interest and Property in God. <hi>Hereby we know that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.</hi> 1 Joh. 4.13.</p>
                                    <p n="6">VI. The Earnest of the Spirit prevents Satan from steping in to break and make void the Spiritual Bargain, or Contract between the Soul and the Lord Jesus Christ. A Saint can by this means say, I have received Earnest of God, I am not mine own, I have agreed, covenanted, and sold my self to him. <hi>Depart from me, ye evil doers;</hi>

                           <p>WHat admirable Grace and Favour is here! Did God give Christ to die for us, to redeem us from Sin and Wrath to come? and did he receive the holy Spirit, as Mediator, to give it unto us, the Earnest of that purchased Possession? Let this be to the Praise of his Glory, Christ purchases that we might possess. Others purchase that they might inherit themselves, and give Earnest to make sure the Estate to themselves; but the Lord Jesus needed not to do so, he was Heir from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:41512:280"/>
and all that he did as Mediator was for us, to enrich and make us happy and blessed for ever.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. If God hath given to Believers the Holy Spirit, as the Earnest of their Inheritance, let them take heed they do not go about to defraud him of his Bargain: They are not their own, they are <hi>bought with a Price,</hi> and they have consented to this holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.19, 20.</note> by taking an Earnest from his hand. 'Tis great Injustice to deprive or keep back any part of a lawful Bargain from the Buyer, especially when he hath given Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest for it.</p>
                           <p n="3">3.

What little ground is there then for any Soul to despond, or doubt of the eternal Inheritance? The holy God deals with us after the manner of Men, about the great Concerns of another World; the bare Promise of God would be Security enough, we need not require a Seal and an Earnest of him. O how doth Divine Goodness condescend to poor Creatures,<note place="margin">H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           <p n="5">5. And let Sinners, who would have an Interest in God, and enjoy this eternal Inheritance, learn from hence the ready way to come to it.</p>
                           <p>First; They must believe: The Saints that are sealed with the Spirit, which is the Earnest of the purchased Inheritance, are said to <hi>trust in God, after they heard the Word of Truth, the Gospel of their Salvation: In whom</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>after that ye believed,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Eph. 1.13.</note> 
                              <hi>ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of Promise, which is the Earnest of our Inheritance, until the Redemption of the purchased Possession, to the Praise of his Glory.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Secondly; As they must hear, attend upon the Word, go out of themselves to Christ, rely upon him, and trust in him, believe and receive the Record God hath given of his Son; so they must submit to his Ordinances. The Spirit is promised to those that keep his Commandments, <hi>John</hi> 14.15, 16. If this be done in Truth and Sincerity, you shall certainly receive the Earnest of future Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as well as others.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. Those that would have a Trial of their Estates and Conditions, who desire to know whether they have received the Spirit of God or not, may read the <hi>Metaphor</hi> where the holy Spirit is compared to a <hi>Seal.</hi> Nothing is more needful; all may see from hence to make sure of the Spirit; take heed you be not mistaken about it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And let them that have received it, live upon it. Such need not fear wanting any good thing; this Earnest-Penny will (as hath been shewn already) defray all their Charge whilst they are in this World. 'Tis a great Sum; God gives like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and answerable to that Inheritance prepared and purchased for Believers.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. What Fools are they that slight and despise this Earnest? God offers Men in the Gospel everlasting Life, and, to assure them of it, promises them, if they will come to his Terms, to give them his Spirit as the Earnest thereof: <hi>Turn you at my Reproof;</hi>

If an honest Man makes a Promise of such and such things to his Friend, he thinks he hath ground to hope those good things, so promised him, are his own; but if he gives it under his Hand in Writing, he concludes he is more sure; but if the Writing, Covenant, or Promise be sealed, 'tis as firm and as sure as he can desire to have it.</p>
                                    <p n="6">VI. A Seal is used to distinguish or differ things one from another, whereby Property is known and secured; a Merchant knows his Goods from other Mens by the Seal or Mark he sets upon them.</p>
                                    <p n="7">VII. A Seal is used to confirm and make Laws Authentick; till they have the King's Seal stamp'd upon them, they oblige not the Subject to Obedience.</p>
                                    <p n="8">VIII. A Seal is used to secure, preserve or keep safe several things, which otherwise might be spoiled, run out, and become good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Things that we would not have any to touch, nor meddle with, we set a Seal upon.</p>
                                    <p n="9">IX. A Seal many times is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited by ill Men, they indeavour to imitate it as nigh as they can, to cheat poor ignorant People thereby.</p>
                                    <p n="10">X. A Seal is used to hide or keep back others from the Knowledg of things; if a Man have any thing to write unto his Friend that he would not have others know, he seals up his Letter, upon the account of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy, tho 'tis like afterwards, in convenient time, those things so conceal'd are discovered.</p>

                                    <p>THe holy Spirit is the King's Seal, the glorious King of Heaven and Earth, and therefore is highly valued and prized by every true Christian.</p>
                                    <p n="2">II. The holy Spirit makes an Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the Heart, there is in a Believer a Similitude, a Likeness or Resemblance of God; every Saint hath the Image of the Spirit upon him, he is holy, harmless, heavenly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                                    <p n="3">III. Before the holy Spirit seals any Person to the Day of Redemption, the Heart is broken, softned, and made plia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the Word, and powerful Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Grace, and so made fit to take that heavenly Impression. And thus you have <hi>David</hi> speaking, <hi>I am poured out like Water, and all my Bones are out of Joint: My Heart is like Wax, it is melted in the midst of my Bowels.</hi>

                                    <p n="4">IV. The Spirit makes a change upon the Soul of a Man or Woman that receives the Impression of it, it alters every Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and puts a new Form or Figure (as it were) upon it. Man naturally is a rude Lump, a gross and confused Piece, by reason of Sin, till the Spirit stamps upon him, or infuses into him new Habits.</p>

                                    <p n="6">VI. The Holy Spirit distinguishes or differs one Man from another; God hath set his Seal or Mark upon all his People. <hi>The Foundation of God remaineth sure, having this Seal,</hi>

                                    <p n="7">VII. The Holy Spirit is the broad Seal of Heaven,<note place="margin">Mark 16.20.

                                    <p n="8">VIII. The Spirit secures, preserves, and keeps safe all true Believers from the Danger they continually are exposed to, from Sin, Satan, and the Insnarements and Mischiefs of this evil World. Satan, nor wicked Men must not, cannot destroy the Servants of God, because of the Mark or Seal he hath set upon them. <hi>Set a Mark upon the Men that mourn,</hi> &amp;c. saying, <hi>Hurt not the Earth,</hi>

                                    <p n="9">IX. The Spirit is oftimes counterfeited by Satan, who transforms himself into an Angel of Light, as do his Ministers, as if they were the Ministers of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness; hence they pretend to Light, Spirit and Holiness, and beguile the ignorant and unwary Souls to their Eternal Ruine.</p>

                           <p>FRom hence, we may perceive by whom the Change or Difference is made, which is in any Person. Man is born in Sin, and rather resembles Satan, bears his Image, than the Character and Likeness of God Almighty, till the Holy Spirit stamps a new and heavenly Character upon them, or infuses a spiritual Habit into him. <hi>Who makes thee to differ from another, or what hast thou, which thou hast not received,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                           <p n="2">II. It may serve to stir every one up, to examine their Hearts, whether they have received the Impression of this Spiritual Seal: as is the Seal, such is the Impression it makes. <hi>They that are after the Spirit, mind the things of the Spirit: But we all with open Face, beholding as in a Glass, the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the same Image,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Rom. 8.5. 2 Co. 3 18</note> 
                              <hi>from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="3">III. For further Trial take these few brief Notes following.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Were your Hearts ever humbled in the sence of Sin, broken in pieces, melted, made soft, and pliable to receive the Seal? The Heart of Man naturally is hard and obdurate, and will not take this spiritual Impression.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Did the Spirit ever set home, and seal any Promise in particular, or Promises in general upon your Hearts? so that you can say with the Prophet <hi>David, Lord remember the word unto thy Servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope.</hi> Psal. 119.49. The <hi>Ephesians</hi> are said <hi>to be sealed with the Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</hi> Eph. 1.13.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Are you formed into the Likeness and Image of the Spirit? There is in that Soul that is sealed by the Spirit, a certain Impression of Divine Light; former Darkness flies away, and the Eyes of the Understanding are enlightned, the Soul sees an Excellency in God, and in Jesus Christ,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.9, 10, 11, 12.</note> a transcendent Beauty in divine Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and values the Knowledg of Jesus Christ and him crucified, above all the things in this World.</p>
                           <p n="4">
                              <pb n="312" facs="tcp:41512:282"/>4. Are you holy, heavenly, spiritual? are there Principles of true Piety and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness wrought in you? Do you love God because he is holy, and love his Word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the purity of it? Do you breath and pant after a further Conformity and Likeness to him?</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Is thy Heart washed from its Filthiness? If thou art not cleansed from thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Wickedness, and swinish Nature, thou mayest assure thy self thou hast not the Spirit of God in thee, thou art far from being sealed therewith. 'Tis by the virtue of those Promises that are imprinted upon the Soul by the Holy-Gost, that a Man comes to <hi>cleanse himself from all Filthiness of the Flesh and Spirit,</hi> and to <hi>perfect Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness in the Fear of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. Doth not thy Heart condemn thee, for allowing thy self in any known Sin, or for living in the continual neglect of any one known Duty? <hi>The Spirit witnesseth with our Spirits, that we are the Children of God.</hi> Where it is a sealing Spirit, it is a witnessing Spirit. It compares the Heart and Life of a Man with the Rule of the Word: and if the Bent and Stream of the Soul be Heaven-ward, and his sincere Design is after God, and to live to him in this World, as well as to live with him in the World to come; to be holy here, as well as to be happy hereafter; then the Spirit witnesses for him: But if otherwise, it witnesses against him, and his own Spirit condemns him.</p>
                           <p n="4">IV. Moreover, this may inform sincere Christians to their unspeakable Joy, how firm and sure the Covenant of Grace is to them. They are <hi>sealed with the holy Spirit unto the Day of Redemption</hi>; they are mark'd for Heaven, and cannot lose their Title to the eternal Inheritance, because they cannot lose the Seal of it: As they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Earnest of it, so they have the Witness and Seal of it, that it might be every way firm and sure to them.</p>
                           <p n="5">V. Let all who profess the Gospel, and pretend to the Spirit, strive to get this Seal. 'Tis not enough to read of the Covenant of God, and to have some external knowledg of it, and dispute about it; but labour to get it sealed to you by the holy Spirit.</p>
                           <p n="6">VI. If the Spirit be the Earnest and Seal of this blessed Inheritance, do not grieve it; this is the Counsel the Apostle gave to the <hi>Ephesians.</hi> Do not quench the Motions of it, nor turn a deaf Ear to the tender and gracious Reproofs it daily gives you. Do not give way to Sin or Satan; neglect not your Duties; pray often, and hear the Word, and be found in your places where the Word and Spirit hath directed you: Live in Love, and let all Bitterness, Wrath, Anger, Clamor, and Evil-speaking be put away from you, with all Malice; and be kind one to another, and tender-hearted, <hi>forgiving one another, as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you:</hi> And hereby you will not grieve the holy Spirit, whereby you are sealed unto the Day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Lastly</hi>; Take heed Satan does not deceive thee with a counterfeit Seal. Many are confident they have the Spirit, Light, and Power, when 'tis all meer Delusion. The Spirit always leads and directs according to the written Word: <hi>He shall bring my Word,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>to your remembrance.</hi> Some Men boast of the Spirit, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude they have the Spirit, and none but they, and yet at the same time cry down and vilify his blessed Ordinances and Institutions, which he hath left in his Word, carefully to be observed and kept, till he comes the second time without Sin unto Salvation.</p>

Altho in some places they may be so shallow, as that a Man may wade in them; yet in some other places they are mighty deep and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, so that none dare adventure into them: Hence Marks and Bounds are many times set up to give notice.</p>
                                    <p n="5">V. A River is the proper Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Fishes, and many living Creatures; they are produced by it, and live in it.</p>

                                       <pb n="314" facs="tcp:41512:283"/>VI. A River is good to wash in, to cleanse, purge, and carry away Filth, and noxious Pollution.</p>
                                    <p n="7">VII. A River hath its Banks to keep it in its proper Bounds, and make it run in its own Chanel, by which means People know whither to go, if they would partake of the Benefit of its Waters.</p>
                                    <p n="8">VIII. Some Rivers overflow their Banks at some certain times, and greatly enrich the Soil, and make it fruitful; as particularly, the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Nilus</hi> in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="9">IX. A River is profitable for Commerce, Traffick, and Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it is the means of Conveyance of the rich Commodities of one Kingdom to another, and of one City to another; by which means, People, Cities, and Nations are greatly enriched. What a great Conveniency is the River of <hi>Thames</hi> to the City of <hi>London!</hi> By this means also one Friend can soon go to another, and often hear each from the other.</p>
                                    <p n="10">
                                       <pb n="315" facs="tcp:41512:283"/>X. Some Rivers run very swiftly, bear all down before them, are so impetuous, as they cannot be stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in their Course and Chanel. A swift Stream washes away Filth best.</p>
                                    <p n="11">XI. Some Rivers environ Towns, and are instead of other Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to them, making them strong, and hard to be taken.</p>
                                    <p n="12">XII. A River causes those Trees that are planted by the side of it, to thrive and grow exceedingly. The Waters softening the Ground, their Roots spread forth, they flourish; when those that are planted on Heaths, and barren Mountains, wither and fade away in a Time of Drought.</p>
                                    <p n="13">XIII. A River is very pleasant and delightful, as well as profitable to them that dwell by it; and they can take their Walks by the sides thereof.</p>
                                    <p n="14">XIV. A River carries, or conveys, by the help of Boats, and other Vessels, many Things and Persons, (whose Purposes and Intentions are that way steer'd) into the Ocean.</p>
                                    <p n="15">XV. Sometimes a River is so still, calm, and quiet, that you cannot discern any Motion; and then without meer human artificial

                                    <p n="16">XVI. Some Rivers divide one Country or Nation from another.</p>
                                    <p n="17">XVII. After a great Rain, a River rises higher, runs more swift, by reason of the Land-Floods that come down, and run into it.</p>
                                    <p n="18">XVIII. A River will carry and bear up a Ship of a great Burthen, and many other heavy things; and according as its Waters run, either more slowly or swiftly, so do those things which sail or swim along in it.</p>
                                    <p n="19">XIX. The Water of a River, and running Streams, is usually more clear and savoury, than Pools or standing Waters. A River pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth it self; and if a Branch or small Stream runs through a loathsom Ditch, it carries away the Pollution of it.</p>

The holy Spirit is called a River, (not a Cistern, not a Vessel) to denote that Fulness of the Water of Life which is in it, the Abundance of heavenly Blessings that flow from it; all the Godly in all Ages, from the beginning of the World, have been supplied from this River: Thousands, and Ten Thousands, have drawn out of it, have been filled with it, have had their measures of it, as God in his Wisdom saw good to communicate it to them; yea, and our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our received it without measure: And yet the River is as full as ever, in it self, there is no emptying of it.</p>

                                    <p n="7">VII.

                                    <p n="8">VIII. This spiritual River hath several times overflowed, there being a Redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy of Water in it. Great Multitudes have been marvellously watered, and made fat and fruitful on a sudden, and shall again when the time is come. God sometimes extends Mercies and Gospel-Blessings beyond his usual method; being a free Agent, may, if he pleaseth, anticipate his own Order. He hath promised to open Rivers in the Desert: <hi>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall bear off from the Chanel of the River, unto the Stream of</hi> Egypt.

                                    <p n="9">IX. The holy Spirit is gloriously ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious for spiritual Commerce and Traffick.

There is no Trading to Heaven, but by sailing in this River; Faith can do nothing without it.

This spiritual River, as 'tis deep, so 'tis very swift, tho 'tis not always dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to be so by us, nor doth the Stream indeed seem to us to run always with a like Motion. But when God doth (as it were) open the Flood-Gates, then it runs very swift, and is so impetuous, that it drives all down before it: <hi>Lord,</hi>

'Tis not in the Skill of Men or Devils to stop this River, even the strong Operations of the Spirit, in a Person, Church, or Nation, when God opens the Sluces for it.</p>

                           <p>WE may perceive from hence the Excellency and Necessity of the holy Spirit: He is much more useful and necessary to the Church, than Rivers of Waters are to the World: For our Hearts are naturally dry and parched, like the Heath in the Wilderness, and it is the Spirit that moistneth them; our Hearts are hard, and the Spirit mollifieth them; they are naturally filthy, and he washeth and cleanseth them; yea, our Hearts are barren, and the Waters of this River make them fruitful.</p>

                                    <p n="3">III. The Spirit hath a cooling Virtue in it. The Heart of a Man, is subject to great Heats, sometimes its sweltered with Temptation. Satan by shooting his fiery Darts, puts a Believer into vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Heats.<note place="margin">Psal. 42.1, 7.</note> 
                                       <hi>As the Hart is by the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter put in a foaming Sweat, and brays after the Water-brook; so Satan, that Blood-Hound, makes the Soul thirst after the Water of Life.</hi> Sometimes Men are put into great Heats by prevailing and raging Corruptions; <hi>They are</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>as an Oven heated by the Baker.</hi>
                                       <note place="margin">Hos. 7.6, 7</note> The Spirit cools this Heat, partly by subduing the lustings of the Flesh, and partly by strengthning the renewed part. Jesus Christ opens the Oven of a distempered Heart; and by casting the Water of the Spirit upon it, brings it into a cooler Temper.<note place="margin">Acts 9.</note> When <hi>Saul</hi> was in that hot and raging Heat, to shed the Blood of the Saints, the Spirit quickly allays his Rage and Fury.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV. The Spirit where e're it falls, makes the Soul fruitful. Men's Hearts naturally are barren, and like the parched Heath in the Desert; but when this sacred Rain comes down upon them, they quickly look green, and in a glorious manner fructifie and bring forth the Fruits of Righteousness; as appears in the Case of <hi>Zacheus,</hi> no sooner did he receive of this divine Water, and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was come to his House, but he crys out, <hi>Half my Goods I give to the Poor.</hi>

No sooner doth the Water of the Spirit come down upon a stubborn and rocky-hearted Sinner, but he is made tender and pliable thereby. <hi>Lord,</hi> (saith <hi>Soul) what wilt thou have me do?</hi>
                                       <note place="margin">Acts 9.6.</note> He was soft, mollified, and melted, willing to do what ever the Will and Pleasure of God was.</p>
                                    <p n="6">VI. The Spirit heals all the Wounds and Diseases of the Soul. <hi>Lord,</hi>

                                       <hi>He sent forth his Word and healed them.</hi> No Soul that ever took down one draught of these Waters, but was cured of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Disease he had. It searches to the bottom of every Sore, and purges out the Corruption, and then by applying the Blood of Christ it heals the Soul of all its Wounds perfectly.</p>
                                    <p n="7">VII. The spirit is of absolute necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without it we cannot live to God, can't live the Life of Faith, the Life of Holiness; many perish and are utterly lost for want of the Spirit, for not coming to these Waters.</p>
                                    <p n="8">VIII. The Spirit of God allays that great Drought that is in Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men naturally after perishing things.<note place="margin">Joh. 4.14.</note>

                                    <p n="5">V. A Witness is highly esteemed, and his Testimony prized by a Man falsely accused, when his Life lies at stake thereby; especially when such clear Evidence is given in for the Defendant, that tends to the clearing up his Innocency and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to acquit him, and to his great Honour, set him at liberty, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding those cruel and false Accusations of his Enemy.</p>

                                    <p>THere is somthing done by Christ for us, and in us, which it is needful there be a Witness of, to confirm and establish both. (1.) Whatever the Lord Jesus did in the days of his Flesh, as the sent one of the Father, was born witness to by the Holy Spirit, by those mighty Works which were done by the means and power thereof. (2.) The Lord Jesus hath also done great things in those who do believe the Truth, of which the Holy Spirit beareth Witness.</p>

                                       <pb n="322" facs="tcp:41512:287"/>II. The Holy Spirit is a just and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Witness.<note place="margin">1 Joh 3.6.</note>

                                    <p n="3">III. So the Holy Spirit decides and ends the great doubt that arises in the Heart about the work of Grace the right way; will not speak Peace to him to whom it doth not appertain; will not clear the Guilty, (<hi>viz.</hi>) him that believeth not, notwithstanding his seeming Zeal, Holiness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor condemn the holy and sincere Person, notwithstanding the Weaknesses and Infirmities of his Life.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV. So in the great case of Interest or no Interest in Jesus Christ, or about Faith and Regeneration, there must be two or three Witnesses, no more is required. First, The Spirit of God. And secondly, Our Spirit, or the Testimony of our own Conscience. <hi>The Spirit it self beareth Witness with our Spirits,</hi>
                                       <note place="margin">Rom. 8.16</note> 
                                       <hi>that we are the Children of God.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="5">V. When the Spirit of God, with a Man's own Conscience, gives in Evidence for him touching his Sincerity, when accused by Satan and by wicked Men, and rendered as a vile Hypocrite, as <hi>Job</hi> was, it doth clear him and makes his Heart light; and how doth he prize and esteem of such a Friend? Alas! had not a Christian the Witness in himself, to clear and bear up his Soul, he would sink down many times into utter Despon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency: but this made holy <hi>Job</hi> to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over all his Enemies; <hi>Behold,</hi>
                                       <note place="margin">Job 16.19</note> 
                                       <hi>my Witness is in Heaven, and my Record is on high.</hi> As much as if he should say, though many Witnesses are against me, yet I will keep my Conscience clear, I will not have my own Heart to charge me, or witness against me as long as I live.</p>
                                    <p n="6">VI. So the Holy Ghost gives in such clear Demonstration and Proof to the clearing up of a Man's Evidence for Heaven, that when all Cases are clearly considered, a poor Saint, though doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful before, comes to a good and full Satisfaction therein, God's Spirit and Conscience compares a Man's State with the Word of God; and if upon Trial, it appears that those Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications are wrought in his Heart, that the Word expresly mentions, concerning the Truth of Grace, he then finds he hath no more cause to doubt of the goodness of his Condition.</p>

                                    <p n="5">V. The Holy Ghost inspiring, and teaching the Prophets and Apostles (who were the holy Pen-men of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scripture) hath greatly inlightned the Inhabitants of the Earth, where
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:41512:288"/>
their Record is known, and also when he hath opened the Eyes of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings of Men in those profound and glorious Mysteries contained in the holy Scripture, how are their minds inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Knowledg of divine Truths?</p>
                                    <p n="6">VI. The Holy Ghost teacheth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structeth poor Sinners gradually, first the <hi>a, b, c,</hi> of Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> the Knowledg of Sin, and their lost and undone Condition thereby; the Vanities of this World, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the necessity of a Saviour: and then in the second Place, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structeth them in higher Mysteries, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and explaining the Covenant of Grace, as also the glorious Mystery of Union and Communion with God, the Mystery of the Trinity, the Incarnation of Christ, his Priesthood, and other things relating to him as Mediator; together with many dark Sayings and Prophecies of the Scripture, which those who are unlearned,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.16.</note> (<hi>viz.</hi> who have not the Spirit's teachings) wrest unto their own Destruction: <hi>I have many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.</hi>

                                    <p n="7">VII. So the Holy Ghost teacheth Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners the Knowledg of the Scriptures: for as the Spirit gave them forth so he is the best Interpreter of them:<note place="margin">Luk. 24.45</note> 
                                       <hi>Then opened be their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstandings, that they might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Scriptures. He shall teach you all things,</hi>

How ignorant are some Men of the Scriptures, and of those glorious Mysteries contained therein? notwithstanding all their humane Learning (or that Knowledg they have of Hebrew, Greek, and Latine) for want of the Spirit's Teaching.</p>
                                    <p n="8">VIII. So the Holy Ghost exerciseth much Patience towards Sinners, whom he comes to teach and instruct in the way of Salvation; Mankind being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally very dull and unapt to learn the Knowledg of themselves, Sin, Christ, and Salvation; therefore he drops now a Word, and then a Word for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction.</p>
                                    <p n="9">IX. So many Men that the Holy Ghost hath shewed much Love unto, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured greatly with, have notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing slighted and disregarded all his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel and Instruction; like as <hi>Israel</hi> did of old: <hi>Thou gavest them thy good Spirit to instruct them,</hi>

                                    <p n="10">X. So the Holy Ghost, who laboured to instruct the old World, finding they were grown to a fearful degree of Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Rebellion, and Obstinacy, utterly refusing to return or be reformed, after he had waited many Years upon them, left them to perish in their Sins God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring sometimes before the Flood came upon them,<note place="margin">Gen. 6.3.</note>

                           <p>
                              <hi>Quest.</hi> But doth not the Apostle say, <hi>We have an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction from the holy One,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">1 Joh, 2.20, 27.</note> 
                              <hi>and know all things, and need not that any Man teach us?</hi> We need no other Teacher there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but the Spirit.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Answ.</hi> That is a great Mistake, and apparent wresting of the Text; for the Spirit of God, that holy Unction, was in the Primitive Saints in a more glorious measure than he is in any now; and yet Christ called forth and ordained divers other Teachers for them, who were to build them up in their most holy Faith;<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.2.</note> 
                              <hi>And the things</hi> (saith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy) that thou hast heard of me, among many Witnesses, the same commit thou to Faithful Men, who shall be able to teach others also?</hi> A Gospel-Ministry is to abide till Christ's second Coming, they are appointed for the gathering together, building up and perfecting of the Saints, <hi>until we all come into the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Faith,</hi>

                              <hi>and of the Knowledg of the Son of God, unto a perfect Man,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore the meaning of the Holy Ghost in that Place is this, We need not that any Man teach us, but as that Anointing teacheth; if any Man teach us such and such things that are not written; things that the Spirit never taught, in the Word of God, we ought not to hearken to them; we need no Teaching but that which is according to the Spirit's Teachings, and agreeable to its Blessed Rule, left upon Record, <hi>viz.</hi> the Holy Scriptures of Truth.</p>

<q>So now (saith he) at the Entrance of the new Creation, the Spirit comes as a Dove upon Christ, who was the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Author of it, and virtually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized it in himself, carrying it on by virtue of his Presence with him; and so this is applyed in the Syriack Ritual of Baptism, composed by <hi>Severinus; And the Spirit of Holiness descended, flying in the likeness of a Dove, and rested upon him, and moved on the Waters.</hi>

                                    <p>A Guide is very necessary for Strangers in a Wilderness, where there are many ways and turnings.</p>
                                    <p n="2">II. An eminent and able Guide is well skill'd in all ways, and able to give Directions in the most diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Cases that are very hard to find out.</p>
                                    <p n="3">III. A faithful Guide gives notice of all the Dangers that are in the way, and shews also how a poor Travellor may escape them, and so go safe unto his desired Place.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV. An able Guide frees a Man, that commits himself to his Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, from many Cares and Fears that attend such who have lost their Way, and have no Guide.</p>
                                    <p n="5">V. An able and faithful Guide gives plain and full Direction to the ignorant, so that they cannot well miss the way, if so be they exactly follow his Directions.</p>

                                    <p n="2">II. So the Holy Spirit is able to guide poor Sinners in all the ways of God; he led <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets under the Law, and led the Apostles and all the Primitive Christians, under the Gospel-Ministration. Holy Men of God spake as they were moved and guided by the Holy Spirit.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.21</note> There is no Precept nor Promise of God needful for the Children of Men to be instructed in, but the Spirit in the holy Scripture hath left it upon Record for our Direction and Consolation; and whatsoever is hard to be understood, that is contained therein; <hi>The Spirit that searcheth all things,</hi> can open and explain it to a gracious Soul: the Spirit guides in the way of Morality, in the way of Faith and Gospel-Obedience, in the way of Church-Constitution and Discipline, and in Gospel-Holiness and Conversation.</p>
                                    <p n="3">III. The Holy Spirit hath in the Holy Scripture (for in that is contained all the Directions of the Spirit, touching all matters and cases necessary to alvation) given notice to all Spiritual Travellors of all the Dangers that may attend them in the way to Heaven. First, the Danger of Unregeneracy, the common Road that most Men and Women walk in; the Spirit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Thirdly, The Danger of Despair. Fourthly, The Danger of Idolatry, Heresy, and Error. Fifthly, The Danger of Disobedience to Christ's Commands, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22.23. Sixthly, The Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of loving or liking of any one Sin. Seventhly, The Danger of Hypocrisy. Eighthly, The Danger of Apostacy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                                    <p n="4">IV. So the Holy Spirit frees a poor Saint from many Fears and Cares (which attend others) whilst he wholly commits himself to the Guidance of God's Word, and to the Directions of the Spirit: many are at a loss, and know not what to do, nor which way to go, whilst he rests satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, resolving to go wholly by this Guide.</p>
                                    <p n="5">V. So the Holy Spirit in the Scripture of Truth, hath given such plain and clear Directions in all Cases of moment about Faith and Holiness, that the ignorant and unlearned cannot miss the way to Heaven, if they carefully observe the Rules laid down therein.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. The Gospel excels the Law in respect of the names of the one and the names of the other.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Law is called the Letter; the Gospel, the Ministration of the Spirit.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Law is called a Ministration of death, the Gospel a Ministrator of life.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. The gospel excels in glory above the law.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In regard of the light and perspicuity of it, the law was full of obscurity clothed with many Ceremonies and mysterious Sacrifices.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. They were at a great loss touching the main drift and end thereof, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13. God spake as it were under a Vail.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. The gospel is clear and plain; Christ beheld, heard, handled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries long hid, open'd and explained fully: we behold with open face, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17, 18.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">IV. The law was appointed to be but a leading Ministration, and in subserviency to the gospel, our Schoolmaster to bring us to Christ.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.24.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">V. The gospel more glorious, or excels the law in respect of the strength of the one and weakness of the other; what the law could not do,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3.</note> in that it was weak through the Flesh, God sent forth his Son, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The law wounds, but can't heal; it shews a man he is dead, but it can't give him life; it shews man he is naked, but it cannot cloth him.</p>
                        <p>The gospel gives life, heals, clothes and comforts; the one shews we are in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the other brings us out, no Salvation by the one, and none without the other.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. The gospel excels in glory above the law in regard of the discovery there is made therein of the Mercy and Grace of God; the one shews God is just and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, and will not clear the guilty; the other shews he is not only just, but also gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. If any grace shone forth under the law, it was only beams of gospel light darting forth darkly in it.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. The gospel is more glorious in regard of the chief Administrators of the one and of the other. The one were, (1) Angels,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1, 2 <hi>Act.</hi> 7.53.</note> if the VVord spoken by Angels were stedfast, <hi>who have received the law by the disposition of Angels and have not kept it.</hi> (2.) <hi>Moses,</hi> a Servant, one that spake on earth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.25. The other Christ, the Lord of life and glory who speaks from heaven. <hi>How shall we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from Heaven.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">

                        </p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. The gospel excels the law in respect of Preisthood, <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons were Priests of the law, Christ is the only Priest of the gospel.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Priests of the law were Men, no more than Men; Christ, God-Man.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. They had infirmities, sin and guilt in their hearts and lives as well as others, Christ had none, in his Mouth was found no guile.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. They were made Priests without an Oath, but Christ with an Oath; <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.21. so greater solemnity at his instalment into Office.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. They could not continue by reason of Death, <hi>and they truly were many because shey were not suffered to continue, by reason of death</hi>; but Christ dieth not,<note place="margin">

                           <hi>he ever liveth to make intercession for us, but this man because he continueth for ever hath an unchangeable Priesthood.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. Christ was more merciful and filled with greater bowels than they, <hi>he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way,</hi> Heb. 5.2.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Christ as Priest, was the substance, the Antitype of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Priest-hood.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. There is compleatness and perfection in Christs Priesthood; but it was not so touching <hi>Aarons. If therefore perfection were by the Levitical Priest,</hi>

                        <p n="9">IX. The gospel excels the law in respect of Sacrifices.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Those Sacrifices under the law were not so Excellent, there was not that worth in them as is in the Sacrifices of the gospel. What was the blood of Bulls, Bullocks, and Lambs? these were part of those Legal Sacrifices.</p>
                        <p>Christ offered up his own Body, poured forth his precious Blood to take away our sins.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. They were offered often to Atone for Iniquity dayly, every year;</p>

                              <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14.</note>But Christ hath offered up himself in Sacrifices once for all, <hi>by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are Sanctified,</hi> that which they were alwayes or continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a doing and yet could not accomplish, he did by one single Sacrifice and that for ever.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. The law required perfect righteousness, and nothing less would be accepted, and so consequently no soul could thereby be delivered from terror and bondage; but the gospel (through Christs perfect righteousness acted in his own Person for us) accepts of Sincerity in the room and stead of the perfect keeping the whole Law.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. In respect of the extent of the one and of the other.</p>
                        <p>The law was only given to <hi>Israel,</hi> or unto the lineal Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> and to the Proselyte Stranger; he dealt his Laws and Statutes to <hi>Israel,</hi> he did not so to any Nation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The gospel is extended to all People and Nations under the whole Heavens: <hi>Go into all the World and preach the Gospel to every Creature,</hi> Mar. 16.15. <hi>VVhosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have eternal Life.</hi>

                        <p n="12">XII. The gospel excels the law in the easiness and sweetness of it; the precepts of the law were many more in number, and hard to learn and remember, and very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult and painful some of them to do (particularly Circumcision) and also very chargeable beyond what the Gospel is:<note place="margin">

                           <pb n="7" facs="tcp:41512:293"/>1. Some Persons delight to Read and hear Histories that treat of Love, and amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous stories.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Some are more affected with such that treat of Martial-Exploits or Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Wars, of the conquering of Kingdoms and Nations, and overcoming mighty Champions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Some rather Commend such Histories that treat of those great rarities which are in many Nations and Kingdoms of the world, and of the Cities, Lawes, Customes and other things of the like nature that are in some Countries.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Others are more pleased with such Histories that treat of things different to all these.</p>
                        <p>Now the Gospel of Christ contains variety of matter upon every Respect what is there Famous, Rare, Delightful, or Marvelous, but 'tis out done here.</p>
                        <p>First concerning Love, what history may Compare with the Gospel in this respect, here you have an account of a mighty King whose Dominions, Power and Glory was Infinite, who was higher than the highest, and Rul'd over all, who had but one Son and he most Dear to him and lay in his Bosom, the Joy and Delight of his heart, the very express Image of the Father; whose Beauty, Lovelyness of his Person, and other Personal Excellencies and Perfections had we the tongue of Men and Angels, we could not set forth the Thousandth part thereof. This Glorious King had a mind to dispose of his Son in Marriage, and to this end very early pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the matter to him, and whom he had Chose for him. As also the way, means and manner how or what he must do in order to obtain her for himself. To which the Son with abundance of Joy consented to. And so it had fell out, that the Person agreed upon to be the Intended Spouse, was once in great favour with this mighty King, and a near dweller to him in <hi>Eden:</hi> but for horrid Rebellion and Treason was banished his presence and was fled into a far Country. And now there was no ways for the glorious Prince to accomplish his business but he must suit himself in a fit Equipage, and take a Journey into that Country where this Creature was astrayed away.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Now were the nature and glory of the Kingdom considered, which Jesus Christ left, or the place from whence he came.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The greatness of his glory there, and excellency of his Person.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The length of that Journey he undertook.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The nature of the Doleful and Miserable place or Countrey into which he came.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. His great abasement or manner of his coming.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. What he met with, or how entertained at his first Arrival.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. VVhat the quality and condition of the Creature was, for whose sake he came.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. VVhat he suffered and underwent from the greatness of that precious Love he bore to the said Creature.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. And how after all this he was slighted and rejected by this Rebellious one, and of his much Patience and Long-suffering before he took his last Denial, together with the powerful arguments and wayes he used, and doth use to obtain the Souls affection. If these things I say were Considered, this history will appear to every Discerning Person the most pleasantest and glorious for Love that ever Mortal heard. <hi>See Metaphor Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, Should we speak of warlike Atchievements, what history in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect can compare with the history of the gospel, was there ever such a Champion as Jesus Christ, or such terrible Battles fought as were fought by him? as witness that glorious battle of his with Satan the mighty King of the bottomless Pit;<note place="margin">

                        <p>Thirdly, As touching great Rarities and wonderful things, which some histories abound withal; none afford such wonders as doth the gospel, is it not marvellous that a VVoman should compass a Man? that he that made the world should be born of a VVoman? that the Ancient of Dayes should become a Child? that Death should be destroyed by Death? and many other like Mysteries the Gospel abounds with.</p>

                           <note place="margin">4. <hi>The Gospel glorious in respect of the time when it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived.</hi>
                           </note>Thirdly, To come more directly unto the thing it self to set forth and further illustrate the glory and splendour of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. 'Tis glorious in respect of the time and contrivance of it. It was found out or contrived before the world began. Hence Christ is said to be a Lamb slain before the foundation of the world.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It is brought in as the result of that great and glorious Council which was held in Eternity. Hence Jesus Christ our Mediator is said to be delivered up by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Counsel and fore-knowledge of God.— God, that is Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, all agreed that the second Person should assume Mans nature, and by shedding of his blood proclaim Peace and reconciliation to sinners. <hi>The Counsel of Peace</hi> [saith the Prophet] <hi>shall be between them both.</hi> Zech. 6.13.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It may not be unnecessary to note here the matter this great Council had before them, and did then debate about, and that was how a way might be found out that God might display his own Glory and magnifie himself in every one of his glorious Attributes, particularly how the two great Attributes of Justice and Mercy might meet together in sweet harmony and shine in equal glory, that God who is Just might appear so, and yet exceeding gracious.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It was to find out a way how in a glorious manner God might destroy the works and designs of the Devil:<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.26.</note> 
                           <note place="margin">1 <hi>Joh</hi> 3.8.</note> for to this purpose (we Read) the Son of God was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. It was a Council held upon the account of sinful man, lost man, (whom God then saw dead and fallen) how he might be delivered from sin and eternal wrath,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41512:295" rendition="simple:additions"/>
'twas not a Council held to ruine and destroy men, but to save and make them happy. This is the third thing to illustrate this Great truth that the gospel or word of Christ is a glorious Gospel.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, The gospel is glorious upon the consideration of that Revelation there is in it of God (personally considered) or the Persons of the Blessed Trinity, or Gods manner of being.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Though God is often called a Father in the old Testament, yet how hard is it without help of the gospel to find out where he is so called or taken in distinction from the Son, and holy Spirit, sith Father (as many Divines observe) in some places of Scripture respects all the three Persons, and hence the <hi>Jewish</hi> Rabbies (who allow not of the new Testament) manifestly declare their Ignorance touching this Great Truth of the Trinity, tho' that may in part be imputed to that Judicial blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness they are left under, yet it must be granted there is in the gospel a more clear and full discovery of this glorious Mystery then in the Law or old Testament, how plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and by manifest testimony is this bore witness to.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. By the Angels, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.32.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. By that Voice from the Excellent glory. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. By the testimony of Christ himself. <hi>I thank thee Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth— even so Father— the Father that sent me is with me— the Father loveth the Son— the Father hath not left me alone— I and my Father are one</hi>; and 'tis observed that he calls God Father near an hundred times in the gospel of <hi>John.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. By the Testimony of the holy Apostles how clearly is this witnessed by them especially by the Blessed beloved Apostle, and <hi>Paul</hi> the great Apostle of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>

                           </note>Fifthly, The gospel appears yet to be more glorious upon the Consideration of the glory of every one of the Persons in the blessed Trinity which shine forth most excellently therein.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. In respect of the Father who did not design to vail his own glory, but to greaten and magnifie it by the gospel. For tho' the Lord Jesus is held forth in the gospel touching his Deity to be Equal with the Father, yet this doth not, must not lessen or diminish the Fathers glory; all are to honour the Son as they honour the Father, but not above the Father, nay what can or ever did demonstrate or greaten the honour which is due to God the Father, like the honour and adoration ascribed and given to him by the Lord Jesus as Mediator, O how did he strain to set out and promote the Glory of God the Father! <hi>My Doctrine is not mine but the fathers that sent me.

                           </note>1. Whatever Relief succour and saving Benefit any sinners do Receive in this world, or have the promise of Receiving in the world to come: the Gospel wholly ascribes it in the first place to God the Father, his Compassion, his Bowels and his Love and Bounty is set forth in the gospel to be such to his poor Creatures, that no tongue is able to Express it. He is great and glorious; <hi>Alexander</hi> is said to give like himself, be sure the Father hath hath out done him and <hi>Araunah</hi> too. He gives not to Kings, but like a King, yea like the King of Kings, he is wonderful, in grace and rich boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he is wonderful.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Consider what it is he hath given, what he hath parted with for and to poor sinners, has he not parted with his Choicest Jewel, his best and Choicest treasure: <hi>God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him might not perish but have everlasting life.</hi>

                        <p>If it had been a Servant, his <hi>Noah,</hi> his <hi>Abraham,</hi> his <hi>Moses,</hi> his <hi>David,</hi> his grace and bounty had been great: but alas they could not Redeem us, none were found worthy to open the Book nor loose the Seals thereof amongst all the Children of men or Saints of God that ever lived.</p>
                        <p>Or had it been an Angel, one of the glorious Seraphims or Cherubims, the favour had been unspeakable, considering what we were: but to think it was and must be his Son; his only begotten Son that lay in his Bosom, his dearly and welbeloved Son

in whom he was well pleased, a Son that never offended, a glorious Son the Joy and Delight of his heart.</p>

                        <p>And thus the glorious Mercy of God the Father shines forth in the gospel: for these things fully set forth that the Father is gracious. And in the next place let me speak a little of his Justice also, for his glorious Justice as well as Mercy shines forth in the Gospel.</p>
                        <p>First, It must be considered that Justice as well as Mercy is in God, as his Mercy is Infinite so is his Justice.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.7.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, It must be granted also that Justice was injured by the Fall and Sin of Man, and called for Satisfaction which was signified 1. By the Execution of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence pronounced upon the account of Mans Disobedience. 2. By turning him out of the Garden. 3. By the flaming Sword. 4. By the Law upon Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> 5. By many severe expressions and fearful Threatnings mentioned in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>God is angry with the wicked every day,</hi> his Soul lothed them,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ps.</hi> 7.11. <hi>Zech.</hi> 11.8</note> 
                           <hi>he has whet his Sword,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, In the next place consider Justice must be satisfied or we must be Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that God will not save in a way of Mercy to the wronging of his Justice.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, It behoveth us therefore to know what will satisfie Gods Justice and appease his wrath. And indeed nothing less will do this than perfect and compleat Obedience to the Law for the time to come, and a plenary compensation for the wrong done in time past. Thou must be holy, pure, without sin in thine own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or have such a Righteousness by Faith imputed to thee.</p>
                        <p>What will the sinner now do? may be he will say, I will cast my self upon the Mercy of God, that is thy only way, but if thou hast not an eye to the Attonement and Satisfaction made by Christ Jesus, thou wilt Perish notwithstanding;<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.7, 8.</note> for he that said he was Gracious, Merciful, abundant in Goodness and Truth, said also he would by no means acquit the Guilty.</p>
                        <p>The gospel shews Gods Wrath must be appeased, and that it must be appeased by Sacrifices, but if we should Sacrifice a 1000 Rams or 10000 Rivers of Oyl; nay, do as the Gentiles did, Sacrifice our Children, or cause them to pass through the fire as the <hi>Jews</hi> did to <hi>Moloch,</hi> and give the fruit of our Body for the Sin of our Soul, it will not be accepted.</p>
                        <p>And as a Child cannot [by being Sacrificed] make an attonement for Sin, neither can
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41512:296"/>
any mans Brother do it for him,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 49.7, 8.</note> 
                           <hi>they that trust in their wealth and boast themselves in the multitude of their Riches: none of them can by any means Redeem his Brother, nor give to God a Ransom for him; for the Redemption of their soul is precious,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>What will the sinner now say, or what course take, that he may please God, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie his wrath and be saved. May be he will say I will reform, I will amend my Life: this is Good, but alas 'twill not do: because thou owest ten thousand Talents. Will promising [nay indeavouring] to run no more in Debt pay off the old Score? Well saith the sinner, if it be so, I will repent and mourn for my sin and pour forth tears before God, and see if that will do. Alas! shouldst thou weep Rivers of Tears, nay couldst thou weep Rivers of blood and nothing but weep as long as thou livest on earth: yet this will not satisfie the Justice of God nor make a compensation for thy Iniquity, this shews God is just indeed: and thus Glorious Justice shines forth in the Gospel.</p>
                        <p>And now to satisfie Divine Justice, Jesus Christ as the act of Mercy is constituted and appointed by the Great God to be our surety who entered into a Covenant to pay all and discharge such sinners who shall believe on him: and that there is no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don nor Salvation but by this way (<hi>viz.</hi>) by Christ

                        <p>Secondly, The gospel declares that he made the world, this proves that Christ is God and greatly magnifies his glory, he that made the world must needs be God Eternal, for none could do that but the glorious <hi>Jehovah</hi> 'tis ridiculous and most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd to think that the Creature could make it self before it self was. God in respect of his Infinite glory and wisdom upon this account expostulateth and reasoneth with his People (glorying if I may so say) in the Greatness of his Power and Majesty and thereby proving his unwordable Essence and dreadful Godhead, <hi>Isa.</hi> 40. and all the Gods of these Nations to be but Idols, and that the same power in respect to creating,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16.</note> which is ascribed to the Father, is attributed to Jesus Christ. See <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1, 2. <hi>for by him were all things created that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible,</hi> &amp;c. Compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, The gospel shews that Jesus Christ did not only create, but also doth uphold all things that are created,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3.</note> 
                           <hi>who being the brightness of his glory, and the express Image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self purged our sins,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Col.</hi> 1.17.</note> 
                           <hi>sat down on the Right-hand of the Majesty on high, &amp;c. he is before all things, and by him all things consist.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fourthly, The gospel shews that Jesus Christ knows all things, such Knowledge is too wonderful for Men or Angels. In several places of Scripture, the blessed God doth prove his glorious Being by his Omnisciency,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ps.</hi> 139.6.</note> and that the like in respect of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is said of Christ, is evident, <hi>and he said unto him, Lord thou knowest all things,</hi> Joh. 21.17. Compared with <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.24, 25. but Jesus did not commit himself unto them because he knew all men and needed not that any should testifie of him, for he knew what was in man, in another place 'tis said he knew from the beginning who they were that believed not and who should betray him.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, The gospel declares that Jesus Christ searches the heart; (tho' this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment depends upon the last, yet for Illustration sake I make another of it) he that searches the heart, ought to be acknowledged and owned to be the Almighty and Eternal God, for who can find out the depths and deceits thereof but the Infinite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty? <hi>the Heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked, who can know it? I the Lord search the heart and try the Reins,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9, 10.</note> as if he should say there is none save my self alone knoweth or can know it, but that the Lord Jesus who died for our sins searcheth the Heart and the Reins, he himself positively asserts it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.23. I will kill her Children with Death (speaking of the woman <hi>Jezebel</hi>) and all the Churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the Reins and the Heart, and I will give unto every one according as his work shall be.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, The gospel shews that Jesus Christ is the First and the Last, and he that is the First and the Last, must of necessity be acknowledged to be the everlasting and eternal God, for from this very ground and consideration the Almighty argues and reasons with his people of old to convince them of his Deity, and that there is no

other God besides himself, <hi>I AM the first, and I am the last,</hi>

And that the same is spoken of the Lord Jesus Christ; See <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.8. <hi>I am Alpha and Omega,</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>Seventhly, The gospel declares that Spiritual Worship or Divine Adoration, doth appertain or belong to Jesus Christ, which proves undeniably he is God Eternal and from Everlasting, for that 'tis Idolatry spiritually, to adore and worship a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. That Christ was and ought to be worshipped with the same worship that is due to the Father; see <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.2. <hi>chap.</hi> 28.17. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.52. <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.38. <hi>chap.</hi> 5.23. <hi>And again, when he bringeth his first begotten into the world, he saith and let all the Angels of God worship him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Eighthly, The gospel shews Jesus Christ hath power to forgive Sins;<note place="margin">

                        <p>Ninthly, He to whom the Saints ought and do Pray, is the most high God; but the gospel shews the Saints do and ought to pray to the Lord Jesus Christ, therefore he is the most high God.</p>
                        <p>Tenthly, The gospel shews that Jesus Christ had not only power to lay down his own life, but also to take it up again, <hi>destroy this Temple and in three dayes I will raise it up again, but he spake of the Temple of his body.</hi> This proves clearly his Divinity, for who besides him that was God could give Resurrection to himself.</p>
                        <p>Eleventhly, He that was in the form of God, and thought it no Robbery to be equal with God, and whom the Scripture calls Gods Fellow, must needs be God blessed for ever: but Jesus Christ was in the form of God and thought it no Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery to be equal with God, and is called Gods Fellow, therefore he is God.</p>
                        <p>Twelfthly, He that is the Object, Author and Finisher of the true Believers Faith,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2.</note> is God Eternal, Blessed for ever Amen. But Christ is the Object, Author and Finisher of true Believers Faith, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirteenthly, He that hath Power to Baptize with, and give the holy Spirit,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11 <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8, 9, 10, 11.</note> and the saving graces thereof, is God. But the Lord Jesus Christ hath power to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize with and give the holy Spirit, <hi>Ergo, He shall baptize you with the holy Spirit and Fire: when he ascended up on high he gave gifts to men,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Fourteenthly, He who can in his own Name, and by his own Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, give power or priviledge to others to become the Sons of God, must needs be God. But the gospel shews that this power the Lord Jesus Christ hath, <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.11, 12.</note>

                        <p>Fifteenth, He that is the Believers life is God;<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.20. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.4.</note> but Jesus Christ is the Believers Life: therefore God.</p>
                        <p>Sixteen, He that is Omnipresent must be God: but the gospel shews the Lord Jesus is Omnipresent, who, can go out of Christs Presence? <hi>Lo,</hi>

                        <p n="3">3. 'Tis holy and chast beauty, there is no snare nor pollution in it; <hi>Joseph</hi> was a beautiful Person, but it was attended with a Snare, here you may look and love and fear no danger.</p>

                        <p n="7">7. It is satisfying and delighting beauty, it fills and contents each Soul to the full who beholds it.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. It is a mystical and hidden beauty, carnal eyes can't see it, they behold no beauty nor comliness in him to desire him.<note place="margin">

                        <p>Secondly, Christ is glorious in respect of his Offices as Mediator. See <hi>Mediator</hi>; also <hi>King, Priest and Prophet.</hi>

                        <p n="2">2. Christs Love is a glorious Love upon the account of the freeness of it, there was no constraint laid upon him to fix his eye upon fallen man,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Hos.</hi> 14.4.</note> the Soul is Christs own free and voluntary Choice, and he doth not grutch us his Love, he doth not think he is too High, too Rich, too Honourable or too good for poor sinners.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Christs Love held forth in the gospel is a glorious Love, in that it is a drawing,<note place="margin">

                        <p n="4">4. Christs Love held forth in the gospel is a glorious Love, in that it is an undeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved love, an unmerited love.

                        <p n="5">5. Christ's Love held forth in the gospel is glorious Love in respect of the strength of it; what <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks of Love, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.6. is true in respect of Christ, <hi>his love is stronger than death.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">

                        <p n="4">4. Consider what he endured and underwent, as the Effect of his great Love and Affection.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Christs Love held forth in the gospel is glorious Love, because 'tis a matchless Love, 'tis wonderful, 'tis so deep no finding of a bottom, so long no measuring of it, none never loved as Christ loved us,<note place="margin">

                        <p n="7">7. Christs Love is a glorious Love in that 'tis a conjugal or an espousal Love, Christ loves not as the Master loves his Servant, nor (only) as the Father loves his dear Child, but as a Bridegroom his Spouse, the choice and delight of his heart, or as a man loves his dear VVife.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p n="9">9. Christs love is glorious love, because it is a love of complacency, he takes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in his love, and in the soul beloved. Christ loves all men with a love of pity, but he loveth his Elect with a love of Complacency.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. Christs love held forth in the gospel is glorious love, because it draws forth or doth beget glorious love in the Soul to him; the love which is in us to him, is but the glorious Effects of his love to us. It makes us to love him so as to admire him, not being able to set his worth and excellency forth: Glorious love causeth a longing and languishing till the soul enjoys Christ,<note place="margin">

Christ runs much in the Mind and Thought of such; yea, and it makes them willing to go through hardships and difficulties for him as <hi>Jacob</hi> did for <hi>Rachel,</hi> such will abide with Christ in Adversity as <hi>Jonathan</hi> did with <hi>David,</hi> it carries the Soul to love Christ above all other things.</p>
                        <p>Glorious love is attended with fruit, <hi>Simon son of</hi> Jonah <hi>lovest thou me more than these?</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>Such delight in Christs Presence, and greatly prize every token of his Divine love and grace, and mourn at Christs absence, nothing will comfort if Christ be gone. Glorious love leads the Soul to visit Christ often, and to love them that he loves, and and long to look for his appearing.</p>

Because his Riches are of such an Excellent Nature that they enrich the Soul of Man; other Men may have vast Riches, may have store of gold and silver, and other good things, and yet none of these Riches can enrich their Souls, spiritually they may be poor and miserable notwithstanding their great abundance.</p>

The riches of the World have undone many, they have been as Thornes to them, by which they have been peirced through with many sorrows. Many will one day curse the Day that ever they had such store of earthly riches; Riches are a snare to the Possessors, hence Christ saith, 'tis hard for a Rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>

                           </note>Thirdly, Why is Christ held forth in the Gospel to be thus gloriously Rich?</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <note place="margin">

                           </note>1. That the Doubts and Scruples that are in sinner hearts might be removed, is there enough in Christ, is there enough Grace, enough Pardon, enough Strength, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Because the Gospel holds Christ forth to be the store house of all Divine grace and blessings, he is ordained to convey all spiritual Riches to his Church and to every Member thereof.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. To allure and engage souls to love him and close in with him, how can any refuse such a friend, reject such a Saviour, that is so beautiful to look upon and also so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Rich.</p>

                           </note>Fourthly, The gospel is glorious in respect of Christ the glorious Object of it, as it reveals his glorious Power.</p>
                        <p>Power in Scripture is taken two manner of ways, or it shews a twofold power in Christ.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. A Commanding Power, his power of Soveraignty, or Regal power, that which we call Authority.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The power of working or effecting that which he would have done. Some have power to command, but want a power to Effect that which they command; cannot accomplish what they would have done, but what Christ commands he can do or cause to be done at his Pleasure.</p>

                           <p>'Tis evident upon consideration that there is not any thing which we believe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the holy Ghost, but that it is plainly revealed and declared in these Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</p>
                           <p>He is directly called God, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.3. which the <hi>Socinians</hi> will not say is by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of an exaltation unto an Office or Authority (as they say of the Son;) that he is an Intelligent voluntary Divine Person, he knoweth, he worketh as he will, which things if in their frequent repetition they are not sufficient to evince an Intelligent Agent, a Personal subsistance, that hath Being, Life, Will, We must confess that the Scripture was written on purpose to lead us into mistakes, and misappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of that we are under penalty of eternal Ruine, rightly to apprehend and believe. It declareth also, that he is the Author &amp; worker of all sorts of Divine opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions requiring Immensity, Omnipotency, Omnisciency and all other Divine excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies unto their working and effecting. Moreover it is <hi>revealed</hi> that he is peculiarly to <hi>be believed</hi> in, and may be sinned against. Also that he together with the Father and the Son created the World,<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Joh.</hi> 33 4.</note> 
                              <hi>the spirit of God hath made me,</hi> that he is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all grace in Believers and order in the Churches. The sum is, that the holy Ghost is a Divine Distinct Person, and neither meerly the power or vertue of God, nor any created Spirit whatsoever. This plainly appears from what is Revealed concerning him, for he who is placed in the same series or order with Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons without the least note of difference, or distinction from them as to an Interest in Personality; who hath the names proper to a Divine Person only, and is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and directly called by them, who also hath Personal Properties, and is the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Author of Personal Divine Properties and the proper Object of Divine VVorship, he is a Distinct Divine Person. And if these things be not a sufficient Evidence and Demonstration of a Divine Intelligent Substance, I shall as was said before, despair to understand any thing that is expressed and declared by words. But now thus 'tis with the Holy spirit according to the Revelation made thereof in the word and gospel of God.</p>
                        </q>
                        <p>One Consideration which hath in part been before proposed, I shall premise, to free the subject of our Argument from ambiguity. And this is that, this word or name Spirit is used sometimes to denote the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> himself, and sometimes his gifts and graces, the <hi>Effects</hi> of his operation on the Souls of men, and this our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in this cause are forced to confess, and thereon in all their writings distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>holy spirit</hi> and his <hi>Effects.</hi> This alone being supposed, I say it is impossible to prove the Father to be a Person, or the Son to be so, both which are not acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any other way, (than we may and do prove the holy Ghost) to be so. For he to whom all Personal Properties, Attributes, Adjuncts, Acts and Operations are ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and unto whom they do belong, and to whom nothing is or can be truly and properly ascribed, but what may and doth belong unto a Person, he is a Person, and him are we taught to believe so to be. So know we the Father to be a Person; as also the Son. For our knowledge of things is more by their properties and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then by their Essential forms, especially is this so with respect to the Nature, Being and Existence of God which are in themselves absolutely incomprehensible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now I shall not confirm the Assumption of this Argument with reference unto the holy Ghost from this or that particular Testimony nor from the assignation of any single Personal property unto him, but from the constant uniform tenor of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in ascribing all those properties unto him. And we may add hereunto that things are so ordered in the wisdom of God, that there is <hi>no personal property</hi> that may be found in an Infinite Divine Nature, but it is in one place or other ascribed unto him.</p>
                        <p>First, He is placed in the same rank and order without any note of Difference or Distinction as to a distinct Interest in the Divine Nature, that is as we shall see, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonality, with other Divine Persons, Mat. 28.19. <hi>Baptizing them in the name of the Father, and the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</hi> 1 Joh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5.7. <hi>There be three that bear witness in Heaven, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, and these three are one.</hi> 1 Cor. 12.3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>No man can say the Lord Jesus Christ is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost; Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit, and there are differences of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41512:301"/>
but the same Lord, and there are diversities of operation but it is the same God which worketh all in all.</hi> Neither doth a denial of his Divine Being and distinct Existence, leave any tolerable sence unto these expressions. For read the words of the first place from the Mind of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and see what it is can be gathered from them; <hi>Baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the vertue or efficacy of the Father.</hi> Can any thing be more absonant from Faith and Reason, than this absurd expression? and yet is it the direct sence, if it be any, that those Men put upon the words. To joyn a <hi>quality</hi> with acknowledged Persons and that in such things and cases, as wherein they are proposed under a Personal Consideration, is a strange kind of Mystery, and the like may be manifested concerning the other places.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, He also hath the <hi>Names</hi> proper to a Divine Person only. For he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly called <hi>God,</hi> Act. 5. He who is termed the holy Ghost, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. and the <hi>Spirit of the Lord,</hi> ver. 9. is called also <hi>God,</hi> ver. 4. Now this is the name of a Divine Person, on one account or other. The <hi>Socinians</hi> would not allow <hi>Christ</hi> to be called <hi>God,</hi> were he not a Divine Person, though not by <hi>Nature,</hi> yet by <hi>Office</hi> and <hi>Authority.</hi> And I suppose they will not find out an <hi>Office</hi> for the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> whereunto he might be exalted on the account whereof he might become <hi>God,</hi> seeing this would acknowledge him to be a <hi>Person</hi> which they deny. So he is called the Comforter, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16 7. <hi>A Personal Appellation</hi> this is also, and because he is the Comforter of all Gods People it can be the name of none but a Divine Person. In the same place also it is frequently affirmed that <hi>He shall come, that he shall and will do such and such things,</hi> all of them declare him to be a Person.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, He hath <hi>Personal properties</hi> assigned unto him, as a VVill.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.11. <hi>Ch.</hi> 2.10.</note> 
                           <hi>He divideth to every man severally as he will, and understanding the spirit searcheth all things, yea the deep things of God.</hi> As also the actings that are ascribed unto him are all of them such, as undeniably affirm Personal Properties in their Principle and Agent. For</p>
                        <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.3.</note> He is the <hi>voluntary</hi> Author of Divine operations he of old <hi>cherished the Creation, the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</hi> He formed and <hi>garnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Heavens,</hi> he Inspired, Acted and Spake in and by the Prophets, <hi>well spake the holy Ghost by</hi> Isaiah <hi>the Prophet unto our Fathers.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Act.</hi> 28.25, 26. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21.</note> 
                           <hi>The Prophecy came not in old time by the will of man. But holy men of God spake as they were moved by the holy Ghost</hi>: He Regenerateth, Enlighteneth, Sanctifieth, Comforteth, Instructeth, Leadeth, Guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all the Disciples of <hi>Christ,</hi> as the Scriptures every where testifie. Now all these are <hi>Personal Operations,</hi> and cannot with any pretence of Sobriety or consistency with Reason be constantly and uniformly assigned unto a <hi>quality</hi> or <hi>vertue.</hi> He is as the Father and Son, <hi>God</hi> with the Properties of Omniscience and Omnipotence, of Life, Understanding and VVill; and by these Properties, workes, acts, and produceth effects according to VVisdom, Choice, and Power.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, The same regard is had to him in Faith, VVorship, and Obedience, as unto the other Persons of the Father and Son. For our being <hi>Baptized</hi> into his name is our solemn engagement to believe in him, to yield obedience to him, and to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him, as it puts the same obligation upon us to the Father and the Son. So also in reference unto the worship of the Church, he Commands that the <hi>Ministers of it be separated unto himself. The holy Ghost said, separate me</hi> Barnabas <hi>and</hi> Saul <hi>for the work whereunto I have called them,</hi> Acts 13.2. ver. 4. <hi>So they being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed.</hi> VVhich is comprehensive of all Religious VVorship of the Church.</p>
                        <p>And on the same account is he sinned against as <hi>Act.</hi> 5.3, 4, 9. for there is the same Reason of Sin and Obedience. Against whom a man may sin formally and ultimately, him he is bound to <hi>Obey,</hi> VVorship and believe in. And this can be no quality, but God himself, for what may be the sence of this expression, <hi>thou hast lyed to the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God in his operations</hi>? or how can we be formally obliged unto Obedience to a quality? There must then an antecedent unto Faith, Trust and Religious Obedience be supposed as the ground of rendering a Person capable of being guilty of Sin to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards any. For Sin is but a failure in Faith, Obedience or VVorship. These there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are due unto the holy Ghost; or a man could not sin against him so signally and fatally as some are said to do in the foregoing Testimonies.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="24" facs="tcp:41512:302"/>I say therefore unto this part of our Cause, as unto the other, that unless we will cast off all Reverence of God, and in a kind of <hi>Atheism,</hi> (which as I suppose, the prevailing wickedness of this Age hath not yet arrived unto) say that the Scriptures were written on purpose to decieve us, and to lead us into mistakes about and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehensions of what it proposeth unto us, we must acknowledge the holy Ghost to be a Substance, a Person, God. yet distinct from the Father, and the Son. For to tell us, that he will be our Comforter, that he will Teach us, Lead us, Guide us, that he spoke of old, in and by the Prophets, that they were moved by him, acted by him,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10</note> that he <hi>searcheth the deep things of God,</hi> works as he will, that he appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to himself Ministers in the Church.

                           </note> Womb of the Blessed Virgin was the peculiar and special work of the Holy Ghost. This work I acknowledge in respect of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation and the Athoritative disposal of things is ascribed unto the Father, for so the Lord Christ speaketh unto him, <hi>A body hast thou prepared me,</hi> Heb. 10.6. but this <hi>prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> doth not signifie the <hi>Actual, Forming</hi> and making Ready of that body, but the eternal designation of it, was prepared in the Council and Love of the Father.

Heb. 2.14. <hi>For as much as the Children were parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of flesh and blood he himself partook of the same.</hi> He took unto him a Body and Soul, entire humane nature, as the Children or all Believers the same <hi>Synedochically</hi> expressed by flesh and blood, ver. 16. <hi>He took on him the Seed of Abraham.</hi> But im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Divine Efficiency in this matter was the peculiar work of the Holy Ghost. <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.18. VVhen his Mother <hi>Mary</hi> was Espoused to <hi>Joseph,</hi> before they came together she was found to be with Child of the holy Ghost: Luk. 1.35. <hi>The Angel answered and said unto her, the holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee, therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">(1.) The Person working is the holy Ghost, he is the wonderful Operator in this glorious work, and therein the power of the most high was exerted. For the Power of the most High is neither explicatory of the former expression, the holy Ghost: as though he were only the power of the most High. Nor is it adjoyning of a distinct Agent or Cause unto him, as tho' the holy Spirit and the power of the most High were distinct Agents in this matter. Only the manner of his effecting this wonderful matter, concerning which the Blessed Virgin had made that enquiry, how can this thing be seeing I know not a man.</p>

                           <hi>The holy Ghost</hi> (saith the Angel) acting in the power of the most high, or in the Infinite power of God shall accomplish it.</p>

                        <p>That we say is this (<hi>viz.</hi>) that meer Moral swasion without powerful Influences and Divine Operations of the holy Ghost, will not bring a Person effectually to Believe and Close in with Jesus Christ, or work true Conversion in the Soul, tho' we always say the power which the holy Ghost puts forth in Regeneration is such in its acting or exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, as our Minds, Wills and Affections are suited to be wrought upon and to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by it according to their nature and natural Operations, <hi>Turn thou me, and I shall be turned.

                        <p>But whereas the will in the depraved condition of fallen nature, is not only habitually filled and possessed with an aversation from that which is good spiritually (<hi>Alienated from the life of God.</hi>) but also continually acts an oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto it, as being under the power of the carnal Mind, which is <hi>Enmity against God,</hi> and whereas this grace of the Spirit in Conversion doth prevail against all this opposition, and is effectual and victorious over it; it will be inquired how this can any otherwise be done but by a kind of <hi>violence</hi> and compulsion, seeing that we have evinced already that Moral perswasion and objective allurement is not sufficient thereunto.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. The opposition is not <hi>ad idem.</hi> The <hi>Enmity and Opposition</hi> that is acted by the Will against Grace, is against it as <hi>objectively proposed</hi> unto it.

                           <pb n="27" facs="tcp:41512:303"/>The VVill therefore is not forced by any Power put forth in Grace in that way wherein it is capable of making opposition unto it, but the prevalency of Grace is of it as it is <hi>internal,</hi> working <hi>really</hi> and <hi>physically,</hi> which is not the VVills Opposition, for it is not proposed unto it, as that which it may <hi>accept or refuse,</hi> but worketh ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually in it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The will in the first act of Conversion (as even sundry of the Schoolmen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge) acts not but as it is acted, moves not but as it is moved, and therefore is passive therein in the sence immediately to be explained. And if this be not so, it cannot be avoided, but that the act of our turning unto God is a meer natural act, and not spiritual or gracious. For it is an act of the VVill not enabled thereunto <hi>antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently</hi> by Grace. VVherefore it must be granted, and it shall be proved, that in <hi>order of Nature,</hi> the acting of Grace in the will in our Conversion is <hi>Antecedent</hi> unto its own acting, though in the same Instant of time, wherein the will is <hi>moved</hi> it moves; and when it is acted it acts it self, and preserves its own Liberty in its exercise. There is therefore herein an inward Almighty <hi>secret act</hi> of the power of the holy Ghost pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing or effecting in us the <hi>Will of Conversion</hi> unto God, so acting our wills, as that they also act themselves and that freely, so <hi>Austin. cont. duas epistol.

                        </p>
                        <p>The holy Spirit who in his power and operation is more intimate, as it were to the Principles of our Souls than they are to themselves, doth with the preservation, and in the exercise of the <hi>liberty of our Wills,</hi> effectually work our Regeneration and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version unto God. This is the substance of what we plead for in this <hi>Cause,</hi> and which declares the Nature of this work of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> as it is an Inward spiritual work, I shall therefore confirm the Truth proposed with <hi>Evident testimonies</hi> of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Reasons contained in them or deduced from them.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Because the work of Grace in Conversion is expressed by words denoting a real internal efficiency, such as creating, quickening, forming, giving a new heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. It is attributed to be wholly of Grace to the end God might have all the glory, and all boasting might be excluded.</p>
                        <p>But (1.) The Doctrine of these men as the <hi>Doctor</hi> observes, ascribe the whole glory of our Regeneration and Conversion <hi>unto our Selves,</hi> and not to the grace of God, for that act of our wills on this supposition, whereby we Convert unto God is meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an act of our own, and not of the Grace of God, this is evident, for if the Act it self were of Grace, then would it not be in the power of the will to hinder it.</p>
                        <p n="2">(2.) This would leave it absolutely uncertain notwithstanding the Purpose of God, and the Purchase of Christ whether ever <hi>any one in the world</hi> should be converted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God or no. For when the whole work of Grace is over, it is absolutely in the power of the will of Man whether it shall be effectual or no. And so absolutely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, which is contrary to the Covenant, Promise and Oath of God, unto and with <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">(3.) It is contrary to express Testimonies of Scripture innumerable. Wherein Actual Conversion unto God is ascribed unto Grace as the immediate effect thereof. This will further appear afterwards. <hi>God worketh in us to will and to do,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13</note> the Act therefore it self of <hi>willing</hi> in our Conversion, is of Gods operation, and although we will our <hi>selves,</hi> yet it is he who causeth us to will, by working in us to <hi>will and to do.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And if the Act of our will in Believing and Obedience, in our Conversion to God, be not the effect of his Grace in us, he doth <hi>not work in us both to will and to do of his own good pleasure.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. The work of Conversion it self, and in especial the act of Believing or Faith it self is expresly said to be of God, to be wrought in us by him, to be freely given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us from him; the Scriptures saith not that God gives us ability or power to believe only. Namely, such a power as we may make use of, if we will or do otherwise, but Faith and Conversion themselves are said to be the work and effect of God.</p>

                        <p>The Act of God working Faith in us, is a creating work, <hi>for we are his workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship created in Christ Jesus.</hi>

Effects of creating acts are not <hi>in potentia</hi> any where but in the active Power of God, so was the World it self before its actual existence. This is termed <hi>potentia logica</hi>; which is no more but a <hi>Negation</hi> of any Contradiction to existence; not <hi>potentia phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sica</hi> which includes a disposition unto actual existence. Notwithstanding therefore all these preparatory works of the Spirit of God which we allow in this matter, there is not by them wrought in the Mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Wills of men such a next power (as they call it) as should enable them to believe without further actual grace working Faith it self. Wherefore with respect to believing the first act of God is to work in us to will; So Phil. 1.13. <hi>he worketh in us to will.</hi> This God worketh in us by that grace which <hi>Austin</hi> and other Learned men call <hi>gratia operans.</hi>

'Tis said to be given of God. <hi>Him hath God exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour to give Repentance unto Israel and remission of sin to you it is given in behalf of Christ not only to believe but to suffer for his sake By Grace ye are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved through faith, and that not of your selves, it is gift of God.</hi> Our own ability, be it what it will, however assisted and excited, and Gods gift are contra-distinguished. If it be of our selves it is not the gift of God, if it be the gift of God it is not of our selves, and the manner how God bestows this gift upon us is declared, ver. 10. <hi>For we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good work.</hi> And from hence Faith is called the Faith of the operation of God.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Love, that precious prevailing Grace is planted in the Soul by the Spirit, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Soul with Delight and Complacency to cleave unto God and his wayes, <hi>the Lord God will Circumcise thine heart to love the Lord,</hi> Deut. 30.6. <hi>Hope maketh not ashamed because the Love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy Ghost,</hi> Rom. 5.5. <hi>The fruit of the spirit is love,</hi> Gal. 5.22.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It might be further demonstrated by considering how Conversion with the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how it is effected,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6.</note> is set forth in the holy Scripture; <hi>The Lord thy God will cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcise thine heart and the heart of thy seed, to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart,</hi> &amp;c. What is this but the putting off the Body of Sin? <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11. This is the mediate work of the Spirit of God, no man ever Circumcised his own heart. <hi>A new heart also will I give you,</hi>

                        <p n="5">5. The work of grace upon the Soul is called a <hi>vivisication,</hi> we are by nature dead in Sins and Trespasses; in our Deliverance from thence we are said to be quickened. <hi>The Dead shall hear the voice of the son of God and Live,</hi> being made alive, now no such work can be wrought in us but by an Effectual Communication of a Principle of Spiritual Life and nothing else will deliver us. Some think to evade the power of this Argument by saying that all these Expressions are metaphorical and arguing from them are but fulsome Metaphors. And 'tis well if the whole Gospel be not a Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor unto them.<note place="margin">

                        <p>But if there be not an Impotency in us by nature unto all Acts of spiritual Life, like that which is in a Dead man unto acts of Life natural, if there be not an alike Power of God required unto our deliverance from that Condition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the working in us a Principle of spiritual Obedience as is required unto the Raising of him that is dead: they may as well say that the Scripture speaks not truly, as that it speaks metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Believers are said to be begotten and born again of the Spirit, by which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that our Regeneration is not an Act of our own. I mean not so our own as by outward helps and assistance to be educed out of the Principles of our nature. <hi>Of his own will begot he us by the word of truth,</hi>

                           </note>1. Gospel grace is glorious, because, when received in Truth, it delivers the Soul from Bondage, it breaks the bonds. For the Soul is not set at liberty by the bare shedding of Christs blood, without the application of it by the spirit or infusion of grace into the heart.</p>
                        <p n="2">2.

                        <p n="3">3. The gospel through the grace of it, when received in Truth raises the dead Soul to Life.

                        <p n="5">5. The grace of the gospel works Regeneration, makes the sinner another Man, a new Man. It forms the new Creature in the Soul.</p>

                        <p n="6">6. The gospel in the grace of it, brings the Soul into Union with God. No Grace, no Christ. God is the Fountain of this Union, Christ is the Conduit-pipe as Mediator, the Spirit and the grace thereof is the stream.

It finds it Condemned, and justifies it. It finds it Dead, and gives it Life.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. The grace of the gospel adornes the Soul, it puts Ornaments upon the head, and Chains (beyond those of Gold) upon the Neck. It decks it with Jewels,<note place="margin">

                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. Considering the Parties that were at Variance, who by the gospel are Reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. God and Man, the infinite God, the holy God and Man, these were at Enmity, 'tis sad when a difference rises in a Family, in a Congregation, in a City, in a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or between one Kingdom and another: but much more sad is it to have God and sinners at Enmity, <hi>Adam</hi> runs from God, hides himself, he knew God was now become his Enemy, the word declares the Creature to be Gods Enemy, whilst he stands in old <hi>Adam</hi> in the state of nature, <hi>and you that were sometimes alienated and

                           </note>Secondly, Gospel reconciliation appears to be glorious reconciliation if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the nature of the breach that was between them.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It was an old breach, no sooner was man made but straitway he became an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to God; nay, every Soul that comes into the world, comes into it an enemy of God, or in a state of enmity.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. 'Tis so great a breach that all the Angels in heaven, nor all the Saints on earth could not make up.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It was such a breach that lays the Soul obnoxious to Gods fearful Curse.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It is such a breach that makes the Creatures of God at enmity one with another, and Mankind in danger of being Devoured by them; and also hath set man one against another.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. It is such a breach that sets man against himself, it hath caused his own Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be his Enemy, and to accuse, and fight against him and condemn him;<note place="margin">1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.21.</note>

                           </note>Thirdly, 'Tis glorious Reconciliation if we consider the means and manner how and by whom it is wrought about and accomplished, every Person in the glorious Trinity hath a hand in it and are eminently concerned about it. <hi>God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18.</note> 
                           <hi>All things are of God who hath reconciled us unto himself by Jesus Christ,</hi> &amp;c. The Lord Jesus the second Person is imployed, (we may see from hence,) as one fitly qualified to make up this dreadful Breach: and in order thereunto he took our Nature on him. There was a necessity of Christs coming to reconcile God and man: God, his Law and Justice was wronged, and God was resolved to have this wrong made up and his Justice satisfied, which none but Christ could do, God was willing to be reconciled, yet nevertheless he will (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was wronged) be righted, and have his Justice fully and compleatly satisfied. Christ knew what would appease and satisfie both Law and Justice, what he hath done hath infinite worth and efficacy in it, this way tends most to glorifie God the Father, the Son is glorified most this way, the Spirit is glorified most this way, and there was no way like this to melt the Sinners heart, to abase him and lay him at the feet of God. —<hi>See Christ the Mediator,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Christ doth not only reconcile God to the Creature, but also reconciles the Creature unto God; he undertakes to bring God near to Man, and Man near to God, whose heart is full of Sin and Enmity to his Maker, and not subject to his Law, he lays his hands upon both, the first is done by his death, Christ like <hi>Jonas</hi> is cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea (as it were) of wrath, to make a Calm. The second is done by the Spirit, he breaks the heart, changes the inward qualities and evil dispositions, he takes away the heart of stone, and gives a heart of flesh.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Gospel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in respect of the nature of it.</hi>
                           </note>Fourthly, Gospel Reconciliation is glorious in respect to the nature of it.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It is a free Reconciliation it is a work of free grace alone: it is not of man, <hi>not of him that willeth, or him that runneth; but of God that shewed mercy.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.16</note> Hence the Apostle saith, <hi>All things are of God</hi>; speaking of Reconciliation.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It is mysterious Reconciliation, <hi>we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world begun to our glory,</hi> the Spirit searcheth all things, yea the deep things of God; This is one of those deep things,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7.</note> which many because they cannot comprehend it in their own natural Wisdom, cavil against it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It is a certain reconciliation, God is at Peace and fully Reconciled in Jesus Christ Christ shall not, will not loss his glorious design in coming into the world, and taking our nature on him, and dying the cursed death of the Cross. Those therefore that are
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41512:306"/>
brought to accept of the terms of Peace and Reconciliation as offered in the Gospel, stand in a state of Real Peace and Friendship, neither let any once imagine that after all these glorious transactions of the blessed Trinity about this work that the issue of the whole in order to the making of it effectual, depends upon the Will and power of man.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The Soul is taken into perfect Love and Union with God, God hereby intirely loveth us, and is so for us, or on our side, that his Friends and Allies become our Friends and Allies, and all our Enemies become his Enemies, so that what is done to us, he takes as done to himself.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. It is an honourable Reconciliation, it is a Reconciliation upon honourable Terms, God suffereth not in any of his glorious Attributes: If God had passed by our offences so that we had Pardon and Reconciliation without more adoe, without a compensation for sin,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Mr.</hi> Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs.</note> the Devils perhaps (saith a Divine) might have cryed out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and have said, where is the Glory of thy justice, these have sinned against thee, as well as we, and the breach they have made upon thy justice is no wayes made up: but now their mouths are stopt for ever. This Reconciliation will be to the glory of God in the sight of Angels and Men to Eternity, and 'tis that which God Rejoyces in as being exceedingly pleased with it, seeing his honour is made up in this Reconciliation.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. It is an abiding, firm, and everlasting Reconciliation there is nothing can make a breach between God and his People any more; the Union cannot, shall not be broke, 'tis beyond the power of Devils, Men, Sufferings, nay or Sin either to do it,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.39</note> 
                           <hi>Who shall be able to seperate us from the Love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</hi>
                        </p>

Eph.</hi> 2.14, 15, 16, 17 <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.</note>Fifthly, Gospel Reconciliation is glorious in respect of the Fruits, Effects, and Consequences of it.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In that all that Enmity that was between God and the Soul comes hereby to be removed and man consequently to have peace with God. <hi>For he is our peace who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of Partition between us, having abolished in his Flesh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that he might Reconcile both unto God in one body by the Cross, having slain the Enmity thereby, and came and preached peace.

                        <p n="2">2. Peace of Conscience is another fruit and effect of this Reconciliation.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. There is also as the effects of this Reconciliation, Peace and sweet Harmony in the Soul between all the Faculties; they do not fight as formerly one against another, the Conscience drawing one way &amp; the will another, the Will opposing that which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science would have done, the Judgment may be convinced in some measure as <hi>Balaams</hi> was, who cryed out that Gods wayes were best, <hi>how Goodly are thy tents O Jacob, and thy tabernacles O Israel,</hi>

                        <p n="4">4. The next thing that I might mention is joy in the holy Ghost, when once a Soul knows he is reconciled to God then he comes not only to have Peace, but also to be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with joy in beleiving, the Kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghost.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Free access to God is another fruit and effect of Gospel reconciliation, such may go with boldness to the Throne of Grace, <hi>through him we both (i. e.</hi> Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles who believe) <hi>have access by the spirit to the Father.</hi>

                        <p>The Promises of God in the gospel given through Christ are great, glorious, and exceeding precious. The Promises may be compared to the Land of Promise, they flow with Milk and Honey, they are like a Rich Mine, abounding with precious Treasure, the further you dig, the more precious gold you will find. Or they may be compared to a lovely and choice Garden that abounds with all sorts of rare and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Flowers, but 'tis a garden alwaies green and flourishing, flowers that knows no drought nor winter, that never decays; not only for Pleasure, but for Profit. A gospel Promise is something that God hath engaged to give to Christ, or unto us through Christ, or for his sake.</p>
                        <p>And they consist either in his free bestowing of good, or his gracious removing of Evil. In his bestowing of good here, or good hereafter; or in removing of evil here, or evil hereafter. And they either are Absolute or Conditional.</p>
                        <p>Gospel Promises are glorious Promises, called precious Promises; and better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises than those of the Law or first Testament.</p>

                        <p n="5">5. And that Gospel Promises might be firm and sure to all the faithful and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant People of God, they are put into Christs hand, who having shed his Blood to procure the good Promised, hath Received the Promises for us as our Trustee; Acts 2.33. <hi>Therefore being by the Right hand of God Exalted, and having received the Promise of the holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. That the Promises might be made sure to all the seed, Christ hath brought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self under an Obligation to make them good.<note place="margin">

                        <p n="10">10. Gospel Promises are glorious promises, because they are generally and more especially Soul or spiritual promises. What is it to have a promise of such or such an Estate or Lordship, or to be blessed in the Basket and store, or with all earthly good things, these are the blessings, it is granted, that worldly men seek after; <hi>I have goods,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.19.</note> saith the Rich Glutton, <hi>laid up for many years</hi>; (blind wretch!) but how poor and miserable was his Soul! Now gospel promises are of a spiritual, heavenly, and sublime Nature, as you have heard before; soul-food, soul-strength, soul-health, soul-riches, soul-peace, soul-liberty, soul-life; a Christ, a Kingdom, and Crown that fadeth not away, for the Soul. This is the Tenth:</p>
                        <p n="11">11. Gospel promises are glorious promises, because 'tis by vertue of these thou comest to take hold of, and obtainest an interest in the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> Is not that a precious promise that will make thee sure of a Saviour, a bare Promise for (of his) Interest, is security enough, tho' he has condescended in a gracious manner to us not only to make over himself and eternal Life to our Souls by Promise; but hath given us an earnest also into our hearts; nay, more then that, Sealed us also by his Spirit unto the day of redemption.<note place="margin">

                        </p>
                        <p>The Promises are the ground of Faith and Hope, that Faith is a Fancy, and that hope will be but as a spiders Web that is not grounded upon the Promise of God.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. Gospel Promises are glorious in a comparative sence above the Promises of the Law.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Better in respect of perspicuity or clearness of them, those were Promises un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der obscure Types and shadows; Justification was held forth by several Sacrifices: burnt-offerings and sin-offerings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sanctification held forth under several Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial washings.</p>

                        <p n="3">3. In respect of the Efficacy and Power that is in these, o're what was in the other. The Law made nothing perfect;<note place="margin">

                        <p n="4">4. They are better in regard of extent and Duration.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. Gospel Promises are glorious in respect of the variety of them; there is varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all good things promised therein, answering to every condition the Creature may be under. They tend in a sweet manner to remove all objections, doubts and discouragements of the Soul whatsoever, as you may perceive by taking a brief Taste.</p>

This may Inform and fully Convince all considerate Persons, what the reason and cause is that the Devil is such an implacable Enemy to the Gospel, and uses all means immaginable to prevent it or hinder the light thereof from shining into our hearts. <hi>If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:</hi>

                           <p n="2">2. It also shews us what a great blessing God hath bestowed upon this nation.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. It may be a means to stir up all poor sinners to believe and obey it, to prize and esteem it.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. It may teach us to contend earnestly for it, and to hold it fast, in spight of all opposers whatsoever.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. VVhat Motives might hence be inferred to prevail with all sincere Believers to be earnest with God, that they may behold in this glass more of his glory, to the end it may by its reflected Rayes, change them into the same Image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. That it may shine into their Hearts.</p>
                           <p n="1">(1.) As they would be as burning and shining Lights to others.</p>
                           <p n="2">(2.) As they would live in the Joy and Comfort of it themselves.</p>
                           <p n="3">(3.) As they would approve themselves VVisdoms Children, by justifying and standing by, and for, this glorious Gospel held forth in the word of God, in the worst times.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. If the Gospel be so glorious it may put each man upon Examination, dost thou perceive and clearly behold the glory which shines forth in it? Some (it is to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) never saw the gospel in the glory of it; it is as a sealed Book to them; they see but the outsides of the book, they are not able to discern the lustre and glory which is contained in it; <hi>the God of this world hath blinded the minds</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>of them that believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3.4.</note>

                              <pb n="40" facs="tcp:41512:310"/>Some men commend the gospel only because it contains so many righteous and good Laws, and holy Rules of Justice and Morality, teaching men to live soberly, and to do as they would be done unto, but see but little more in it; which shews these men have but little of the Mystery, and Glory of the Gospel open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them; for tho' it be granted, that it is one part of the excellency of it, yet it is not the chief, as appears by what hath been said.</p>
                           <p>Again, There are others who seemingly are much affected with the Gospel (that Book of Books) and yet cry up, and magnifie the Light within above it, as if that was a more perfect Rule than the holy Gospel, and VVord of God; which shews how little of the Gospel glory appears to them.</p>
                           <p>In the last Place, if the Gospel be so glorious, O pray (whosoever thou art) that God would be pleased to open thine eyes, that thou mayst see it so to be; and cry mightily, that he would be pleased never to take it away from this poor Nation, nor suffer its Glory and Brightness to be Eclipsed by letting in Popish darkness again amongst us. If we once lose the Gospel, we may all cry <hi>Ichabod,</hi> the glory is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from <hi>England</hi>; and, with the Church of Old, say, <hi>the Crown is fallen from our heads, wo to us that we have sinned.</hi>

                           <p n="2">2. Because of that Malice he bears to the Lord Jesus, he would fain keep men ignorant of a Saviour; Not only out of hatred to man, but also out of implacable enmity to the Lord Christ, that so he may as much as ly's in him hinder our Saviours chief design and intention in coming into the VVorld; which was to bring men out of Darkness into the Light.</p>
                           <p n="3">3.

                           <p>What wonderful things hath the Gospel done in the World, and what Power is there in it, by the help of the Holy Spirit to dis-Throne Satan, and break all his Chains to pieces; therefore he bestirs himself to hinder the breaking out of Light and Knowledg in every Nation, and causes fierce opposition to be made against those, who endeavour to sup-plant him, and lay open his grand designs. This informs, us, how it comes about there is so much Ignorance and gross Darkness in the World; not only in Popish Countreys, but also where the Gospel is Preached: Though Men hear it Preached every day, yet O how Blind and Ignorant are many Sinners. Men rest satisfied with the bare notion of Things, and Name of Christians, never mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religion in good earnest, but in a most fearful manner, are grown so fool-har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and venturous, as to hazard and expose their Souls unto eternal ruine. The Devil hath blinded their minds, this also shews us from whence it is, there are, and formerly have been, so many false, and detestable Opinions, Errors, and cursed Heresies in the world. Alas, the Devil this way, endeavours to obstruct and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospel from being received, he has indeed strove a long time wholly to overthrow the very foundation of the Christian Religion, and to bring in another Gospel; he strives to cheat Men of the true Saviour, and in his stead to Preach ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of whom the Scripture is wholly ignorant, how have many Impudently assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Light in all men to be the true Christ, and Saviour of the Word? He doth not only strive to take away his glorious Soveraignity, and set up another Universal Head, who hath power to make Laws, and repeat them in matters of Religion at his pleasure, (as the Followers of the Beast affirm) But now of late endeavours to take away the very Person of the Holy Jesus. Also to change the Ordinances, or wholly to deny them, (hath been, and is another of his Stratagems) which witness to the true Christ, his Death, Burial and Resurrection. And lastly, Satan hath alwaies endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured also to bring into contempt the Ministers of the Gospel, or else raise up Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution upon them; and all these things he doth to hinder the Gospel from shining, or obstruct the promulgation thereof.</p>

                           <p>FRom hence we may perceive what a vast difference there is betwixt the Godly and the Wicked: The one have their Hearts set upon heavenly Objects, the other on carnal; the Desires of the one are holy, heavenly, and spiritual; the Desires of the other are fleshly, earthly, and sensual.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. The Father presents his Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, before your Eyes in the Gospel (as he doth the like himself) as a Person every way deserving your Love and Affection, to see whether you will respect him or not.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The Father highly honoureth the Son; he hath given all things into his hand, he is his Heir.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The Father hath sent him into the World, to seek himself a Spouse.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. He became Flesh, that he might be a fit Object for Sinners.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Christ hath a great desire to give himself unto you, and so become yours for ever.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. He hath abundance of Love, great and strong Affection.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. Christ left his Glory, and came into the World in a low and contemptible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and denied himself for thy sake; and wilt not thou accept of him?</p>
                           <p n="8">8. Shall he die, and come through a Sea of Blood to engage thy Affection? and wilt not thou yield him a Kiss of Subjection?</p>
                           <p n="9">9. Shall he send his Ministers, as Spokes-men, to entreat you? and will you say, Nay?</p>
                           <p n="10">10. Shall he move you by the Motions of his Spirit, and Checks of Conscience? and will you still refuse to close in with him?</p>
                           <p n="11">11. Shall he knock loud and long, and cry continually to you? and can you still stand it out against him?</p>
                           <p n="12">12. VVill not your Gain and Preferment be great? what Honour and Dignity, excelling Union with Christ, can you think to meet withal?</p>
                           <p n="13">13. Are not you like to be miserable at last, if you die before you have an Interest in him: <hi>If any love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be</hi> Anathema Maranatha.</p>
                           <p n="4">IV. But some may say, How comes it to pass the Spouse is so bold, and thus fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly speaks to Christ, <hi>Let him kiss me?</hi> Should not Fervor of Affection have with it Humility of Reverenee?</p>

                                    <p>A Net is made or prepared, as a convenient thing to catch Fish.</p>
                                    <p n="2">II. A Net is made use of by skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fishers; it requires Wisdom rightly to use it, to the End it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. A Fisher uses oft-times much Policy and Craft, in putting in, and drawing of his Net.</p>
                                    <p n="3">III. A Net is cast into a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Waters, at an Adventure, the Fisherman not knowing whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it may catch many, or few, or any at all.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV. A Fisherman works hard with his Net, sometimes a great while together, and catcheth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                                    <p n="5">V. A Net takes Fish of every sort, some great Ones, and some little Ones, some good, and some bad; as 'tis express'd in this Parable.</p>
                                    <p n="6">VI. A Net takes Fishes out of their own natural Element; and as soon as they are taken out of the Water they dy.</p>

                                       <pb n="46" facs="tcp:41512:313"/>VII. A Net takes or compasses sometimes a Multitude of Fishes at once.

                                    <p n="8">VIII. A Net, tho it be cast into the Sea, and has taken many Fishes, yet 'tis not known of what kind or sort they be, until the Net is drawn up.</p>

After the Fisherman hath drawn his Net about so long, that he concludes it hath taken all it is like to enclose and compass in, he then draws it to the Shore, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the Good from the Bad; the Good he puts into Vessels, and the Bad he throws away.</p>

                                    <p>THe Gospel or Word of God is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to catch or convert the Souls of Men: <hi>Fear not,</hi>

                                    <p n="2">II. The Word of God is made use of by skilful and able Ministers; and it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires much spiritual Wisdom, rightly to use it for the Conversion of Sinners. <hi>Paul</hi> being crafty, tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
                                       <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.16.</note> 
                                       <hi>He took</hi> (or catched) <hi>them with Guile.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="3">III. The Gospel is preached by a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Minister to a Multitude of People, (who are compared to Waters in many Places of Scripture) and yet he knows not, when he preaches, or casteth his Net in, whether he shall take many or few Souls, nay, whether one Sinner shall be reached or converted thereby, or not.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV. So a Minister sometimes labours a long while together, and takes much Pains in preaching the Gospel, and yet converts not one Soul;<note place="margin">Isa. 53.1.</note> 
                                       <hi>Who hath belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved our Report?</hi> &amp;c. They may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times say with <hi>Peter, We have laboured all Night, and have taken nothing.</hi>
                                       <note place="margin">Luk. 5.5.</note>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="5">V. So the Gospel-Net takes hold of some of every sort and degree of Men: Some great and honourable, rich and mighty in the World, tho not many such; some little Ones, such as are mean and poor in the World. Again, some great and notorious Sinners are taken, such as <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were, before converted; and some that are not such great and capital Offenders: For tho every Man is a great Sinner in a proper sence, yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively some are greater, or more guilty and prophane than others: <hi>And there was a Woman in the City, that was a Sinner:</hi> Not but that all the Women in the City were Sinners, but this Woman was a notorious one, or one noted and eminent for Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness. Also the Gospel and Church of God takes some bad Professors, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Christians, as well as such as are sincere.</p>
                                    <p n="6">VI. The Gospel or Word of God, the spiritual Net, takes Sinners out of their natural Element; and as soon as they are savingly taken thereby, they die to Sin, and to all sensual Objects, and carnal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of the Flesh, and this World, and to their own Righteousness, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.2, 6, 11.</p>

                                       <pb n="46" facs="tcp:41512:313"/>VII. The Gospel-Net also sometimes takes hold of, or encloseth many Sinners at one Cast. At one Sermon three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Souls were converted, by that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Preacher,<note place="margin">Acts 2.37, 40.</note> and famous Fisher of Men, the Apostle <hi>Peter.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="8">VIII. So the Gospel and Church of God, tho it takes many Souls, yet 'tis not fully known of what sort they be, until the Time comes that Christ draws the Net up.</p>
                                    <p n="9">IX. The Gospel and Church of God having taken many Sinners, or all being brought in, that are to be taken by this spiritual Net, Christ will (as it were) at the last Day draw it to Shore, and then he will sever the Good from the Bad, the Sheep from the Goats, the sincere Ones from Hypocrites; and the one shall be saved, atd the other thrown away, <hi>viz.</hi> be damned. <hi>Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a Net that is cast into the Sea, that taketh of all sorts, which when it is full,</hi>

                                       <hi>Men draw it to Land, and gather the Good into Vessels, and cast the Bad away: So shall it be at the End of the World: The Angels shall go forth, and separate the Bad from the Good, and shall cast them into the Furnace of Fire; there shall be wailing, and gnashing of Teeth.</hi>

                                    <p n="11">XI. Those People, or particular Souls, that do possess and enjoy much of the glorious Word of God, are in danger of being set upon by spiritual Thieves and Robbers; Satan, and many other his Emissaries, will be sure to assault such. What experience hath <hi>England</hi> had of this for many Years, but more especially of late? How is it beset by bold, impudent, and bloody Romish Thieves? What is the reason? Why, <hi>England</hi> is rich, it hath got much Gold in it, much of the Word of God: Here are a rich People, many rich Churches, rich Souls; and therefore this grand Thief hath consulted with many of his Company, to set upon us, and rob us of all our Treasure.

                           <p n="1">1. By a bating of the Spirit's Heat in its Operations, or by diminishing or lessening the Graces and good Motions thereof, when the Spirit loses the vigor of his Operations, as when Zeal decays, Convictions wear off, and Affections die; this is like slacking the Heat, and lessening the Burning of the Fire.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. When Men do not only diminish and lessen the Burnings and Operations of the Spirit in the Graces, Influences, and Motions thereof, but yield to Sin and the Devil, so far
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41512:317"/>
as to put the Fire quite out: The common Motions and Operations of the Spirit may be quite extinguished. <hi>Give us of your Oil, for our Lamps are gone out.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Mat. 25.8.</note> We read of some twice dead, pluck'd up by the Roots.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Quest.</hi> Which way may the Spirit and the Word of God be quenched?</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. By witholding of Fuel. <hi>Where no Wood is, the Fire goes out.</hi> We feed that Fire which we would not have extinguished, we labour to add fit matter to it,<note place="margin">Prov. 26.20.</note> that we may keep up the heat and burning of it. Persons may be said to quench the Spirit, when they neglect the Means which God hath appointed for the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing feeding and preserving of it in its full Vigor, Heat, and Operations in the Soul, when they neglect Prayer, reading, hearing of the Word, Meditations, the Fire of the Spirit, Zeal and Fervency soon decays.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The Spirit of God may be quenched, by neglecting to stir it up. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts <hi>Timothy</hi> to stir up the Gift that was in him. If Fire be not stirred and blown up, it will soon lessen its Burning, and go out. <hi>No Man stirreth up himself to take hold of thee.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Isa. 64.7.</note> 'Tis not enough to pray, read, and hear the Word; but to stir up our selves to do these Duties of Religion fervently: if there be never so much Wood on the Fire, yet, if it be not blown and stir'd up, the dead Ashes will obstruct the Burning. So in like manner, tho Men be never so much in the performance of Religious Duties, yet if they let the Ashes of Formality and Deadness remain upon their Hearts, the Fire of the Spirit decays.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Fire is quenched by opposing somewhat of a contrary Nature and Quality to it, as Water, (or the like.) Fire and Water are contrary the one to the other, by reason of their contrary Qualities; a little matter will weaken and lessen the burning of Fire, and if a Man pour in much of it, 'twill soon quite exstinguish it; so in like manner the Word and Spirit, by suffering a little Sin and Corruption to remain in the Heart or Life, will soon decay in its Operations. Sin is unto the Spirit, as Water to the Fire. <hi>The Flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the Flesh, and these two are contrary the one to the other.</hi> Gal. 3.17.</p>
                           <p>But now, if a Man yields to some Sins, to some hainous Sins, or once lay the Reins loose as it were upon the Neck of his Lusts, plotteth and premeditates Sin; regards it, likes it, and watcheth an Opportunity to sin; this will soon, like much Water, quench the Fire; also Sin reiterated and often committed, tho not so noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious or scandalous, hath the like Effect. The frequent acting of Sin, is like a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual dropping upon the Fire, nothing more dangerous than a trade in Sin.</p>
                           <p>That you may escape this great Evil, of quenching the Word and Spirit, observe these Particulars following.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Consider, 'Tis a divine Spark which is kindled in your Souls, 'tis heavenly Fire, 'tis a holy and sacred thing, Men know not what they do when they quench the Motions of the Spirit, and will not suffer the Word to kindle in them.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Consider, Who it is that hath kinled this Fire in thee, or strives to do it; is it not the Almighty, the ever blessed God? wilt thou adventure to put out the Fire which the Majesty of Heaven and Earth hath kindled in thee?</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Consider how much Pains God hath taken to kindle it; how long was it, and what means did the Lord make use of before he could cause (to speak after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Men) the Word to take hold of thee? Did he not send a Spark upon thee at one Sermon? and then blow upon it, that it might break out into a Flame? and then send another Spark, another Sermon, and then another, and another, and may be after all, he brought thee into Affliction, and used many ways to effect this great and good Work of his own Spirit and Grace upon thy Heart; and wilt thou adventure to mar and spoil this Work, and quench this Fire? which is thus of the Lord's kindling. If a Father, Mother, or any eminent Superiour should take much Pains, and be at great Charge to kindle a Fire, and a Child should know this, and yet adventure to throw Water upon it, and put it out; or yield to a cursed Foe of theirs so to do, would it not be judged a notorious Offence?</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Consider the gracious Design of God in kindling this Divine Fire in the Soul, 'tis that he might raise thee to Life, give thee Light, melt thy hard Heart, and make it fit to receive an heavenly Impression, 'tis to cement and unite thy Heart to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that thou mightest glorify him, injoy him, and be glorified with him for ever.</p>
                           <p n="5">
                              <pb n="56" facs="tcp:41512:318"/>5. Consider, If this Fire go out, thou canst never kindle it again; 'tis beyond thy Skill and Wisdom. If thou quench another Fire, it may be thou mayst kindle that again, and make it burn as before; but 'tis not in thy Power to make this Fire burn. <hi>Of his own Will begat be us, with the word of Truth. As many as received him, to them gave he Power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Jam. 1.18. Joh. 1.12, 13. Phil. 1.6. Isa. 26.12.</note> 
                              <hi>Who were born not of Blood, nor of the will of the Flesh, nor of the will of Man, but of God.</hi> He is said, to begin this <hi>good Work in us, He is the Author and Finisher of our Faith. Lord thou wilt,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>ordain Peace for us, for thou also hast wrought all our Works in us.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="6">6. Consider, Thou knowest not whether God will ever set about this Work again, or no, shouldst thou hearken to thy Lusts and Satan's Temptations, to quench the Spirit and put out those good Motions and Desires that are in thy Mind;<note place="margin">Gen. 6.</note> remember that Word, <hi>My Spirit shall not always strive with Men.</hi> And also what our Saviour in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel spake concerning <hi>Jerusalem, O that thou hadst known, even thou at least in this thy day,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Luk. 3.19, 42.</note> 
                              <hi>the things that belong to thy Peace, but now they are hid from thine Eyes.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="7">7. Consider, 'Tis grievous to the Spirit to be quenched, the Spirit is thy great Friend, thy Comforter, the Spirit helps thee at every dead Lift,<note place="margin">Joh. 16 7. Rom. 8.26</note> 
                              <hi>and maketh Intercession for thee with Groanings, which cannot be uttered.</hi> And therefore do not grieve him; Wilt thou quench and put out the Motions of such a Friend? <hi>Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed to the day of Redemption.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Eph. 4.30.</note>
                           </p>
                           <p n="8">8. Consider, The Spirit is thy Light, put out the Spirit, and thou wilt become a dead Man; or lessen his Burnings and gracious Operations, and thou wilt become a dying Man: would'st thou not have thy Eyes out of thy Head nor thy Life out of thy Body? then do not quench the Spirit, the Eye and Life of thy Soul.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. Consider what the Cause and Reason is, Men quench the Spirit.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Is it not because they would be indulged in their Sins, and lie down on the Bed of Sloath and carnal Security? Men put out their Fire when they have a mind to go to Bed.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Is it not because the Fire burns too hot for them? it hath kindled such a Fire in their Consciences, that scorcheth them so sorely, that they know not how to indure it; and from hence wickedly go about to quench the Spirit. Thus 'twas with <hi>Felix,</hi> he heard <hi>Paul</hi> preach of Righteousness, Temperance, and Judgment to come, and he trembles, his Conscience smote him; but now to quench the Spirit and allay that, Heat he might find within, he sends away <hi>Paul: When I have</hi> (saith he) <hi>a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient time, I will call for thee.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="3">3. Is it not because this Fire of the Word and Spirit is too chargeable and costly for them? they, like Men, grudg that which the Fire consumes, or will, if it be kept burning. The Young-Man in the Gospel was not willing to sell his Possession, and part with all for Christ. When Men see they must part with so much to the Minister, (<hi>God having ordained that they who preach the Gospel, should live of the Gospel</hi>) and so much to the Poor Saints, and besides all this be exposed to suffer the Prosecution of such and such Penal Laws; this great Charge they see already fall upon them, and what further they know not may fall upon them by keeping up the Fire of the Word and Spirit, the thoughts of which they cannot bear: and from hence, wickedly go about to quench the Spirit.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Do not Men quench the Fire, or lessen its Burning when it makes the Pot boil over, when they fear that all that is in the Pot or Vessel will be lost? even so some Men, when the Fire of the Word and Spirit is so hot and strong, that it is like to boil out a beloved Lust which they have prized for its Profitableness, like a Right-hand, or for Pleasures, like a Right-Eye, then they haste to lessen the Fire;<note place="margin">See <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophilus P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                                       <desc>••</desc>
                                    </gap>lwhele,</hi> of quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spirit, <hi>p.</hi> 33.</note> and like <hi>Judas,</hi> think there needs not be so much waste. Now what a vile thing (saith one) is this, to quench the Fire of the Spirit, rather than the Scum and Filthiness of Sin should be worked and boiled out thereby? See how God threatens such. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.6. <hi>Wo to the Pot whose Scum is therein, and whose Scum is not gone out of it?</hi> therefore saith God, <hi>Verse</hi> 11. <hi>Set it emptey upon the Coals, that the Brass of it may be hot and may burn, and that the Filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the Scum of it may be consumed. She hath wearied her self with Lies, her Scum shall be in the Fire. In thy Filthiness is Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> Her Obstinacy was such, that tho God had made use of means to purge her, she refused to be purged. And therefore God pronounced that dreadful Threatning against her, <hi>Thou shalt not be purged from thy Filthiness any more.</hi> Some are not willing to part with their Sins, they would keep the poisonous Liquor and Scum in the Vessel,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41512:318"/>
and for this the Vessel and Scum must be burned together, and shall never be parted.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Do not Men quench the Fire, and put out their Candle when 'tis like to expose them to danger, when Thieves and cursed Enemies are abroad, out of fear they keep all close, and are not willing any should see Fire-Light nor Candle-Light, nor any thing should discover them. So out of Fear in time of Common danger, some Men quench the Fire of the Word and Spirit; the Word like a Candle, is thrust under a Bushel or under a Bed, and the Motions of the Spirit for a publick Testimony are put out.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. Men quench the Fire, saith the same Author, when 'tis like to set the House on fire; so some Professors quench the Spirit, when they see what fiery Trials they are like to pass through, if they continue in the heat of their Zeal.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. Some Men quench the Fire when they are warm enough without it; they warm themselves by the Sparks of their own kindling, these, saith God,<note place="margin">Isa. 50.11.</note> 
                              <hi>shall lie down in sorrow</hi>; they conclude their own Righteousness, and their old Ways and Conversation will be sufficient, and so <hi>turn with the Dog to his Vomit,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">2 Pet.</note> 
                              <hi>and with the Sow that was washed, to her wallowing in the Mire.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="8">8. Some Men let the Fire go out, saith he, <hi>through a multitude of Business;</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Luk. 10.</note> 
                              <hi>their Minds being taken up with other things, they forget it:</hi> So some Men forget the Word, Spirit and Religion, being like <hi>Martha,</hi> troubled about many things. Now what a wicked thing is it from all, or any of these Causes, to quench the Spirit?</p>
                           <p n="10">10. Consider, 'Tis by the Spirit thou must <hi>mortify the Deeds of the Flesh,</hi> which thou must do or be damn'd. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. And how canst thou do that, when the Spirit is quenched; 'tis no marvel if Corruptions prevail, when the Spirit is put out that should burn them up.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. Consider, 'Tis by the Spirit and Word, which is called the Sword of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by which you should wrestle, and resist all the Temptations of Satan; but when the Fire of the Spirit is quenched, it puts an Opportunity in Satan's hand, to kindle the Fire of Pride, Malice, and Lust of Concupiscence in thy Heart; when the Spirit is quenched, and the Sword thrown away, what Execution can be done upon this spiritual Enemy?</p>
                           <p n="12">12. Consider, 'Tis by the help and influence of the Holy Spirit thou must per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all Duties of Religion, or they will never be accepted of God; and how can that be done when the Spirit is quenched, and the Motions and Operations thereof cease?</p>
                           <p>If the Word and Spirit be compared to Fire, let us bless God for kindling this Fire in our Hearts and Nation, and pray that he would be pleased to blow more and more upon it, that it may burn up all the Chaff and Dross of our Corruptions, and inflame our Souls with a greater degree of Love to God, and Zeal to Religion.</p>
                           <p>And let us take heed we do not quench the Spirit in others. Wicked Men would fain put this Fire quite out; what unwearied Attempts have they made from time to time in this and other Nations, to extinguish the Light of the Word? Ungodly Papists can't indure the heat of this Fire, they are not more ready to kindle other Fires (to the spoiling and impoverishing of the Kingdom) than they are to put out this: they will not suffer it to burn in themselves, so they, as much as in them lies, indeavour to quench it in others; like those Men whom our Saviour reprehended in the days of his Flesh, who would not go into Heaven themselves, nor suffer them, who would go thither, to enter in.</p>
                           <p>But in the last place, Let them, and all other wicked Persons, take heed how they quench this divine Fire; for if it burn not up their Sins and Corruptions, and kindle Grace and Holiness in them, they must burn one day in Hell: for either this Fire must be suffered to burn in them, or they be condemned to eternal Burning for quenching of it.</p>

                                    <p>A Sword is a Weapon generally made use of by all Souldiers of every Rank and Quality: the Captain, as well as the ordinary Souldier, hath and ought to have his Sword.</p>
                                    <p n="2">II. A Sword is a Weapon by which they do not only defend themselves, but also do great Execution upon their Enemies.</p>
                                    <p n="3">III. A Sword is a keen, sharp, piercing Weapon; it will enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Body and pierce the very Heart of a Man.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV. A Sword is an honourable Weapon, and of great Antiquity; it hath been in use from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, a Weapon that no Enemy hath any just cause to quarrel with.</p>
                                    <p n="5">V. Some Swords have two Edges, they will cut both ways, they will cut backwards and forwards, as they go in and as they come out.</p>
                                    <p n="6">
                                       <pb n="60" facs="tcp:41512:320"/>VI. A Sword will cut off a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; many a Leg and Arm have been cut off therewith.</p>
                                    <p n="7">VII. Some Wounds of a Sword are so mortal, that there is no cure for them.</p>
                                    <p n="8">VIII. A Sword is born oft-times before a Magistrate to signify Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Justice. <hi>He bears not the Sword in vain.</hi>

                                    <p>THE VVord of God, the spiritual Sword, every Christian (of what Rank or Quality soever) maketh use of, and cannot, ought not to be without it; the Captain General fought with this VVeapon himself, Ministers,<note place="margin">Mat. 4.4, 5, 6, 7, 8.</note> as well as every private Christian, ought always to be armed herewith.</p>
                                    <p n="2">II. So the VVord of God is a spiritual VVeapon, by which a Christian doth not only defend himself from the danger of Sin, and Satan, the VVorld, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but by it he offends, yea, cuts down and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes and vanquishes all these and other cruel Enemies of the Soul, (1.) The VVord is a defensive VVeapon. (Saith <hi>David.) By the Word of thy Lips, I have kept me from the Paths of the Destroyer. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nless thy Law had been my Delight,</hi>

                                    <p n="3">III. <hi>The Word of God is sharper than any Sword.</hi> If the Spirit uses it,<note place="margin">Heb. 4.12.</note> it will soon enter into and pierce the Heart of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; as appears by that notable Instance concerning those Jews that put the Lord Jesus to death; whilst <hi>Peter</hi> preached the VVord to them, it is said, <hi>they were prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Hearts.</hi>

                                    <p n="4">IV. The Word of God is an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable VVeapon, our Saviour and all holy Prophets and good Men would never else have made use of it: it is also of great Antiquity, the Writings of <hi>Moses,</hi> as it is observed by divers, were before any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Records. No Devil nor vile Heretick hath any cause to except against it, or to quarrel with the Holy Scripture.</p>
                                    <p n="5">V. The VVord of God is quicK and powerful, <hi>sharper than any two-edged Sword</hi>; it hath a twofold Operation at one time, as it is used by the Ministers of the Gospel, it wounds the Souls of the Elect in order
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41512:320"/>
to healing, and it wounds the Reprobate in order to damning, to such it may be called a killing Letter. <hi>To one we are the Savour of Life unto Life, to the other the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Death unto Death.</hi>
                                       <note place="margin">2 Cor. 2.</note>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="6">VI. The VVord of God hath cut off many a Member of the old Man, it will cut off a Right-hand lust, of Profit, or a Right-eye lust, of Pleasure.</p>
                                    <p n="7">VII. So some VVounds that many Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners receive, are such, that there is no cure for them, (<hi>viz.</hi>) such who have sinned the unpardonable Sin. <hi>There is a Sin unto death.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="8">VIII. He that bears the VVord of the Spirit,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.</note> shews he is a Man that hath great Authority for what he says, and that he is a Person for Right and Justice; it is that which decides all doubtful Cases, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="9">IX. So the VVord of God, the Sword of the Spirit, is a glorious and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious VVeapon, which will appear, If we consider how many it hath struck down dead, and sentenced unto eternal Death; how many strong Enemies have been slain and subdued by it, strong Lusts, strong Devils, strong and vile He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks; it is a victorious Sword. It is called the Sword of the Spirit;</p>
                                    <p n="1">1. Because it is a spiritual Weapon, but that is not all.</p>
                                    <p n="2">2. Because the Spirit is the Author of it, a Weapon it is, (saith <hi>Gurnal</hi>) which his Hand alone formed and fashioned,<note place="margin">Pag. 297.</note> it came not out of any Creatures Forge. <hi>Holy Men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</hi>
                                       <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.21.</note>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="3">3. The Holy Spirit is the only true Interpreter of the Word, whence we have that known Passage of <hi>Bernard; Quo Spiritu factae sunt Scripturae, eo Spiritu legi desiderant, ipso etiam intelligendae.</hi> The Scriptures must be read, and can be understood by no Spirit, but that a lone, by whom they were made.</p>
                                    <p n="4">4. Because the Spirit only can give the Word its Efficacy and Power in the Soul; it is the Office of the Spirit, <hi>Sigillare animum rerum creditarum.</hi> Except he lays his weight on the Truths we read, and hear, to apply them close, and as it were cut their very Image in our Minds and Hearts, they have no more Impression than a Seal sets upon a Stone or Rock. The Spirit will do nothing for Believers without the Word, and they can do nothing to purpose without him, the Word is the Sword, and the Holy Spirit of Christ the Arm that weilds it; So that,</p>
                                    <p n="5">5. The like use that a Sword is of to a Souldier in War; the same is the Word to the Spirit in order to the cutting down, and spoiling all his and others Enemies.</p>

                           <p n="2">2. It may inform us what the great Design of Satan is, in seeking so many man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ways to take away the Word of God from us, or in making of it of little or no use to us.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. This justly reprehends the cursed Papists and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in respect of their Cruelty to the Souls of Men, in disarming them of their Weapons; a People disarmed are soon overcome, and made a Prey to their Enemies; how can we defend our selves when our Sword is taken out of our hands? They have some Fig-leaves (saith one) to hide their shameful Practice; they endeavour to perswade Men they do them a Kindness thereby, lest they should cut their Fingers with it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How doth the Apostle
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41512:320"/>
condemn speaking in the Church in an unknow Tongue? All Men are exhorted to read the Scriptures, <hi>search the Scriptures,</hi> but the Pope makes it no less than Death, if not Damnation, for the Laity to have them in their own Language to read or search, fearing lest it should spoil his Trade.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. It reproves them for casting such Contempt upon the Scriptures, as if they were insufficient to direct us in the way of Salvation. What horrid Blasphemy and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach is this (saith the same Author) to the great God, to send his People into the Field, and put such a wooden Sword into their hands, as is not sufficient to defend themselves or vanquish their Enemies? And how much contrary is it to that of the Apostle <hi>Timothy,</hi> who saith, <hi>It is able to make us wise unto Salvation, through Faith in Christ Jesus, perfect, throughly furnished to all good Works.</hi>

                           <p n="5">5. Let us bless God and be truly thankful, we have this Weapon left us yet, this is in our hands, and that all the World may know it hath done great things in our Hearts. Let every true Christian and true English-man resolve to dy upon the Spot, rather than lose the Word, or suffer their Sword to be taken from them.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. Let it also caution all Christians to take heed how they ingage their Enemy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Sword.</p>

                                    <p>THe Word and Grace of God is of a diffusive nature, it will where it is received in a spiritual sence, leavens every Faculty of the Soul, until the whole Man, Body, and Spirit is leavened therewith.

                                    <p n="3">III. The Word of God must be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the Heart, it must be hid as it were there like Seed that is covered in the Earth, that so it may have its blessed Effect in order to leaven the Soul in a spiritual Sence the better:<note place="margin">Psal. 119.9</note>

                                    <p n="2">II. Some Glasses shew us such things, that we cannot see, nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern without them (as common Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience shews,) which are called Perspective-Glasses.</p>
                                    <p n="3">III. A Glass seems to bring such things near to us that are at a great distance. Some by looking in a Glass have discovered Things and Persons many Miles of, as if they were just by them.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV. A true Glass shews or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents unto a Man his own natural Face; by looking therein he may see what manner of Man he is, he may take a plain view of himself, whether fair or deformed.</p>
                                    <p n="5">V. A Glass is used by some as a thing to dress themselves in; by it they know how to put on their Attire, and to deck themselves with all their Ornaments: if any thing be wanting or amiss, which they would have on, they soon perceive it by looking in a Glass.</p>
                                    <p n="6">VI. A Glass is a thing that some Persons take much Delight to look into.</p>
                                    <p n="7">VII. He that would have a full or plain sight of a Person or Persons that he hath a desire to behold in a Glass, must look therein with open Face, he must not look asquint up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>

                                    <p>THe Gospel is the best <hi>Medium</hi> which represents God the Father, the Lord Jesus Christ, and holy Spirit, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saints, with things past, present, and to come, to our spiritual Sight, or to the Eyes of our Faith.</p>
                                    <p n="2">II. The Word of God shews us such things and Mysteries, that without it we could not see nor have the least Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of; as the manner of the Creation of the World in six Days; the cause why God sets his Bow in the Cloud; the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Attributes of God, together with God's manner of being, or the glorious Trinity; the Conception, Birth, Life, Death, Resurrection, and Ascension of the Lord Jesus Christ; as also God's positive Law and instituted Worship.</p>
                                    <p n="3">III. The Word and Gospel of God brings things that are afar off, very near; it represents to our Faith the Judgment-Day, and shews us how matters and things shall be managed then; who shall be cleared, and who condemned; it brings near to the Eye of our Faith, the glorious Kingdom of Jesus Christ, and many things of like Nature.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV. So the Word of God shews forth, not only the Glory of God in the Face of Jesus Christ, as also what this World is, what Sin is, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it shews what Man is before Grace, how wretched, blind, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, deformed, polluted! and also after Grace through Christ, how happy, ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, beautiful and glorious!</p>
                                    <p n="5">V. So the Word of God is absolutely needful or necessary for all Christians to look into, who would dress and deck themselves with the Ornaments of Grace, that they may be comely in the sight of God. By looking into the Word they may see what Ornaments are wanting, and how to put them on so as to be compleatly dressed, and every way ready for the Bridegroom's coming.</p>
                                    <p n="6">VI. The Word of God is a thing that all true Christians take much Delight to behold, daily pry and look into, by Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Meditation: <hi>His Delight is in the Law of the Lord,</hi>
                                       <note place="margin">Psal. 1.2.</note> 
                                       <hi>and in his Law he doth meditate both Night and Day.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="7">VII. So he that would have a clear sight of God in his glorious Attributes and Perfections, must look into the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel with open Face; he must look with a full and single Eye, as one that is resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the help of the Spirit, according to the nature of his sight, to see what may be beheld therein; and not cast a squint Look as it were upon it, seem to look towards God, when his Heart is more upon other Things and Objects: <hi>We with open Face,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If thy Eye be single, thy whole Body it full of Light.</hi>
                                    </p>

                                       <pb n="64" facs="tcp:41512:322"/>VIII. So he that doth cast but a transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Look into the Word of God, or is but a bare Hearer thereof, may, whilst the Word is a preaching, see, or have some sence of his Sin, and deplorable Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he is in by Nature, and be somewhat troubled for it a while; but not putting into practice what he hears, but turning to his former Course again, he soon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets what a deformed and miserable Wretch he is, which is the principal Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of that Text in <hi>James.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="9">IX. So a Christian that looks into the Word and Gospel to behold the Glory of God, hath but the sight of the Image, Resemblance, and Representation of God shining therein before his Eyes.</p>

                                    <p>THe Gospel or Word of God is a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Perspective-Glass, as well as a Looking-Glass.</p>
                                    <p n="2">II. A Christian cannot look too oft into God's Word, provided he do not neglect his particular Calling in so doing, or let one Duty interfere with another; neither doth his looking into the Word of God tend to lift him up, but rather to humble and abase him; for the more we see of God, the more with <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Isaiah,</hi> we shall abhor and be ashamed of our selves.</p>
                                    <p>There are divers other <hi>Disparities</hi> which we pass by; they are the Contrivance and Workmanship of Man, and brittle things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> besides many of them are false, giving not a true Representation of Persons and Things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

(See Metaphor <hi>Light.</hi>) And thereby they may learn how to make themselves ready for Christ's Coming, as also what their happy Condition is, if truly in Christ.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. When you see a Glass, or injoy the useful Benefit thereof, remember the Glass of God's Word; and as you slight not, nor throw away that Glass by which you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain your End, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Medium</hi> to behold what you desire; be perswaded never to slight or throw away the Word of God, but improve it to the Ends for which God gave it, till you come to have the Faculty so suited and fitted to behold the Object, that you shall see as you are seen, and know as you are known, which will be in a State of Glory, and not till then.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. To inform the poor, dark, and blind World, that as a Glass of what nature so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, yet it is altogether useless to a blind Man, till his Eyes are opened; so till God opens blind Eyes, poor fallen Man cannot see any of the Glory of God, nor understand this glorious Gospel or Word of God.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Let it perswade all Christians, (who do stedfastly believe that the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or Word of God, are, or may be compared to a Glass in many of the Particulars afore-going) to look more into it with earnest Prayer, that as it is a Glass as clear as <hi>Chrystal</hi>; so the Eyes of their Understandings may be opened, to the end they may, as in a Glass, <hi>Behold the Glory of the Lord, and be changed into the same Image, from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18.</p>

                                    <p>A Plough is an Instrument made fit for the Husband-man, to break up and till his Ground.</p>
                                    <p n="2">II. The Plough cannot break up the Ground of it self; it must be held and drawn, or nothing can be done by it.</p>
                                    <p n="3">III. It is a hard and difficult thing to plow up some Ground, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that which is rocky, full of Roots, or hath long lain fallow.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV. The Plough pierces deep into the Earth, makes (as it were) deep Gashes or Wounds in the Heart of it, discovering what sort of Earth it is.</p>
                                    <p n="5">V. The Work of the Pluogh is but <hi>Opus ordinabile,</hi> a preparative Work in order to sowing the Seed.</p>

                                    <p n="2">II. The Gospel must be believed and professed by us; we must lay our hand to it, and by the Power of the Spirit it must (as it were) be drawn upon our Hearts, or it can do nothing.</p>
                                    <p n="3">III. So it is a very difficult thing to convince and humble the hard and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate Heart of a Sinner, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a Stone, and as firm as a Rock:<note place="margin">Ezek. 36.26. Amos 6.12</note>

                                    <p n="5">V. So the Gospel and Word of God (as a Plough) by its powerful Convictions upon the Conscience, is but a preparative Work,<note place="margin">Hos. 10.12, 13.</note> in order to the sowing the Seed of Grace in the Heart.</p>
                                    <p n="6">VI. Never doth the Word of God so kindly work in plowing up the fallow Ground of the Heart, as when the Gospel-Clouds dissolve, and the true Grace and Love of Jesus Christ comes sweetly showering down upon it.</p>
                                    <p n="7">VII. So the Word of God, by its powerful Convictions and Operations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Heart, kills Sin at the Root, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Soul to loath what it formerly loved.</p>
                                    <p n="8">VIII. That Heart is not savingly wrought upon, where one Lust is spared, and left untouched, or when it reacheth not to the changing the evil Qualities of every Faculty. The Word must no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                                    <p n="10">X.

                                    <p>GOod Seed is prepared by the Husbandman, and is reserved out of the choicest Wheat, and principal Barley; 'tis that which the Husbandman highly esteems and values.</p>
                                    <p n="2">II. The Ground, before the Seed is sown, is plow'd up, and made fit to receive the Seed.</p>
                                    <p n="3">III. The Husbandman either sows the Seed himself, or employs a Seeds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to sow it, one that hath Skill in that Employment.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV. When Seed is cast into the Earth, it must be covered, or else the Birds may pick it up; besides, it will not otherwise so well take Root.</p>
                                    <p n="5">V. Seed lies some time in the Ground, before it springs up; Clods also oftentimes hinder it from springing up.</p>
                                    <p n="6">VI. Frost and Snow conduce very much to the well-rooting of the Seed; they tend also to kill the Weeds, which otherwise might choak it under the Clods: by which means it roots, spreads, and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes more abundantly.</p>
                                    <p n="7">VII. The earlier Seed is sown, the better it is rooted, and enabled to endure the Sharpness of the Winter.</p>
                                    <p n="8">VIII. Some Seeds which the Sower sows fall upon stony Places, and some on thorny Ground, (as Experience shews) which Seed
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41512:324"/>
brings not forth Fruit unto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and some also falls by the High-way-side, which the Birds devour.</p>
                                    <p n="9">IX. Fruitfulness of Seed depends much upon the Sun shining, and the Rain falling upon it; by this means it is quickned, and abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly springs up.</p>
                                    <p n="10">X. Weeds many times come up with the Seed, and if they are not pluck'd up, or weeded out, they will hinder the Growth of the Seed, if not quite choak it.</p>
                                    <p n="11">XI. The good Ground only brings forth Fruit unto perfection.</p>
                                    <p n="12">XII. Men are very diligent and industrious in sowing their Seed, they are up early, and labour hard, morning and evening.</p>
                                    <p n="13">XIII. Winds and Storms do not prevent Sowers in the sowing of their Seed; but let the Wind be high or low, blow from the North, or from the South, yet they do and will sow.</p>
                                    <p n="14">XIV. Men usually are not spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their Seed, but scatter it abroad so plentifully, that all and every part of the Field which they intend to sow, may be sown there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>

It is not enough to have it in our Heads, but in our Hearts: <hi>Let the Word of God dwell in you richly.</hi> We ought to labour to understand it, to love it,<note place="margin">Col. 3.16.</note> and keep it in our Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, yea, and to let it be well rooted in every Faculty.</p>
                                    <p n="5">V. The Word of God does often (like Seed) lie hid for a while in the Heart of a Sinner, before it eminently shews it self. Clods of Corruption, and Temptations, hinder its Growth and springing up.</p>
                                    <p n="6">VI. So Affliction (when sanctified to gracious Persons, which they meet with after their Conversion, and many times in their very Seed-Time) tends to kill the Weeds of Corruption, and breaks and mollifies the Heart, by which means they come to be better rooted in Grace, and strengthned in Holiness.</p>
                                    <p n="7">VII. So when the Word of God is early received in the Love of it, (when a young Person is sanctified in the Bud) Grace many times flourishes more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly. Such have treat Advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others. Long Experience tends much to the strengthning of Grace, enabling the Soul to hold out in an evil Day. It was a great Advantage to <hi>Timothy,</hi>
                                       <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.</note> that he knew the Holy Scriptures from a Child.</p>
                                    <p n="8">VIII. The Seed of God's Word, which the Son of Man by his faithful Ministers soweth in the Ministration of the Gospel, falls oftentimes upon a hard and rocky-hearted Sinner, who tho he receive the

                                       </note> yet in time of Persecution falls away: <hi>Because of the Word be is offended.</hi> Others, like thorny Ground, receive the Seed; <hi>but the Cares of this World, and the Deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Riches, choak the Word, and it becometh unfruitful. The other hear the Word, and understand it not; then cometh the Devil,</hi> (called the Fowl of the Air) <hi>and catcheth away that which was sown in the Heart: This is he that receiveth Seed by the High-way-side.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="9">IX. So the Fruitfulness of the Word in Mens Hearts, depends upon Christ's gracious blessing, and shining upon it, and the Spirits bedewing and watering it: <hi>'Tis God that gives the Increase.</hi>

So when the Word of God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in truth into the Heart, Sin and Corruption will,<note place="margin">Mat. 13.</note> if not carefully weeded out, spring up, and hinder the Growth of the spiritual Seed. Hence the Apostle gives charge to the Saints, <hi>That they should look diligently, lest any fail of the Grace of God;</hi>

                           <p>IT may inform us, that the Cause why some Persons fall away, and <hi>turn with the Dog to his Vomit, and with the Sow that was washed, to her wallowing in the Mire,</hi> is, Because they were never sincere, nor upright in Heart.

                                    <p n="2">II. Rain falls by divine Direction and Appointment; <hi>God causes it to rain upon one City,</hi>

                                       <hi>and not upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> You often see a Cloud dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve and spend it self upon one place, when there is not a drop within a few Miles of it; one Land may have Rain and a fruitful Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, when another may have none.</p>
                                    <p n="3">III. There is a great deal of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the Showers of Rain that fall upon the Earth, sometimes you have it in small Drops; a drisling Rain which comes gently, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing long, it waters the Earth and the Fruits thereof throughly, going to the very Root; at other times it comes down in a hasty and violent manner, causing the Streams to run, but it is gone presently, and doth but little good.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV. Some People in the World have no Rain, as the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> for it is said, that it seldom or never rains there.</p>
                                    <p n="5">V. Rain comes down successively and gradually, now a little and then a little; it doth not fall all at one time, before it gives over, but it comes now a Shower and then a Shower, as the Earth and Fruits thereof need it.</p>

The Rain comes down (as is noted of Dew) irresistibly; when God doth by his Word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, speak to the Clouds to distil it down upon the Earth, it is not in the power of all Creatures to hinder its falling.</p>
                                    <p n="7">VII. Rain is most beneficial to the Earth, when there comes sweet, warm Rays of the Sun with it, or as clear shining after it, then Herbs, Flowers, and Corn, as also other Fruits, grow abundantly.</p>
                                    <p n="8">VIII. Rain is necessary at Seed-time, to make the Earth ready and fit to receive the Seed; <hi>Thou visitest the Earth, and waterest it; thou greatly enrichest it with the River of God,</hi>

                                    <p n="9">IX. Rain makes the Earth soft and tender, which otherwise would be very hard and dry, and unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as we see in time, of great Drought.</p>

                                    <p n="12">XII. Rain hath been sent down from Heaven as the Answer of Prayer; Prayer hath as it were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the Windows of Heaven, that it might rain upon the Earth.</p>

The Word of God in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner sometimes comes down moderately, yet continuing long before God takes it away from a People or Soul, at length it proves effectual, and throughly waters and soaks their barren Hearts, and makes them fruitful; but at another time, the Word in a Sermon, comes like a sudden Spout of Rain, seeming to carry all before it, and startles the Sinner, but 'tis soon over, and doth but little good, it abiding not upon the Conscience.</p>
                                    <p n="4">IV. So there are some People, nay, many in the World, that never had the Gospel preached as yet to them.</p>
                                    <p n="5">V. So the Word drops and distils like Rain and Showers that water the Earth, now a little and then a little, as the Condition of the Soul requires; a drop in this Sermon, and a drop in another Sermon; <hi>Precept must be upon Precept, Line upon Line, here a little and there a little:</hi>
                                       <note place="margin">Isa. 28.10.</note> now one comforting Influence and then another; now one quickning Impulsion and then another, now one Promise is rained down and then another. 1. Christ would that his People have a constant Dependance on himself. 2. He would
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41512:325"/>
have them wait upon every Sermon, upon every Ordinance and Opportunity. 3. He would not have them surfeit upon his Word, therefore he observes a successive Distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Blessings thereof upon them. 4. He would have every Doctrine, and Precepts, and Promises soak into their Hearts. 5. Christ would indear every drop of his Grace, and morsel of his Word to his People; he would have them lose nothing he bestows, and therefore gives it them as they are able to receive it. 6. The Souls of Believers are like narrow-mouth'd Vessels, they cannot receive much at a time without spilling. 7. We are such bad Husbands, Christ will not trust us with all at once.</p>
                                    <p n="6">VI. The Word falls upon Sinners. When God gives Command with mighty Power, the Influences of the Word and Spirit work with mighty Efficacy upon the Heart; <hi>the Word is quick and powerful,</hi> it breaks the Heart in pieces; in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction it causes the Sinner to cry out, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me do?</hi> it shall accomplish that for which 'twas sent. See <hi>Light.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="7">VII. So it is in respect of the Gospel, when the Sun of Righteousness shines upon the Soul, under the Word and blessed Doctrin thereof, O this makes a Believer, and all his Graces to flourish exceedingly!</p>
                                    <p n="8">VIII. The Gospel hath a twofold Use and Benefit, it is necessary as the former Rain at the beginning or first working of Grace upon the Heart; so 'tis needful afterwards, to ripen and prepare the Soul for Heaven. <hi>Be glad then ye Children of</hi> Zion, <hi>and rejoyce in the Lord your God, for he hath given you the former Rain mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately; and he will cause the Rain to come down, the former Rain and latter Rain,</hi> &amp;c. We cannot be without either; we shall soon decay in our Spirits, if we have not spiritual Moisture of the Grace and Word of God upon our Souls: the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry of the Word is not only appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to implant Grace in us, but also to perfect Grace so rooted and implanted.</p>
                                    <p n="9">IX. So the Word of God makes the hard and flinty Hearts of Sinners very soft and tender; it is of a mollifying, fructifying Nature, it makes the Saints fruitful in Grace and Good-works.</p>
                                    <p n="10">X. So after great plenty of divine and spiritual Rain, when People are glutted with a Fulness of Gospel-Mercies, God sometimes sends a Drought, shuts up Heaven. Ministers are like Clouds with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Rain.</p>
                                    <p n="11">
                                       <pb n="72" facs="tcp:41512:326"/>XI. Ministers are the spiritual Clouds that God hath appointed to retain the Word and saving Knowledg of divine Things, so that they may also at his Command let the Water of Life down, or distil it upon Men's Souls. See <hi>Clouds.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="12">XII. Divine Rain hath been sent down as the Answer of fervent Prayer; The Prayer of the Godly hath prevailed with the Almighty, for sending of the Word and Spirit down upon the World, and Church of God: hence <hi>Paul</hi> ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly begs the Saints Prayers, <hi>That he might open his Mouth boldly,</hi>

                  <p>THere is a second Volume ready for the Press, which consisteth of two Parts.</p>
                  <p>The First opens, by way of <hi>Metaphor</hi> and <hi>Parallel, &amp;c.</hi> about One hundred sixty eight Metaphors, Similes, Allegories, and other borrowed Terms, contained in the holy Scriptures, consisting of all the principal Metaphors, Similes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors can meet with, under these ten Heads following.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Such as concern the Graces of the Spirit, and Ordinances of the Gospel.</item>

                     <item>8. Such as concern the false Church, and false Teachers. Under which Head is most evidently shewed, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is absolutely meant by the <hi>great Whore, Rev.</hi> 17. and the Papists Objections answered; which was expected in this Volume, but could not be put in without palpable Injury to both, by confounding the Heads, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  </list>
                  <p>The <hi>Second Part</hi> elegantly opens and explains most of all the Types, and many Parables in the Holy Scripture; a Work much desired.</p>
                  <p>Both Parts will contain upwards of a Hundred Sheets, and will be printed by Subscriptions, <hi>viz.</hi> Four Shillings down, and four more when the Books are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in Quires; and those that subscribe for Six (as the usual way is) shall have one <hi>gratis, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had not the Authors found it impossible to contract the Work so, as to bring the whole into the Compass of One Hundred and Fifty Sheets, they would have hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led some Things more concisely.</p>
