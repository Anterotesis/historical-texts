         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The CASE upon the Appeal.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Plaintiff Mrs. <hi>Took</hi> by her Bill in <hi>Chancery,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mrs. <hi>Took's</hi> Title.</note>
sets forth a Title to <hi>Iohn Bennet,</hi>

by a Deed made by her Husband, Mr. <hi>Took,</hi> in <hi>April</hi> 1686.</p>
            <p>And by the same Deed she claims further 300 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> clear in
like manner for her Jointure, if she outlive her Husband.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Robert</hi> (the Defendant) Lent 820 <hi>l.</hi> to the Husband,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Robert</hi>'s Title.</note> Mr. <hi>Took,</hi>
to help him out of Prison, and to pay his Debts; and took a
Mortgage of him of the same Houses, Three years after Mrs. <hi>Took</hi>'s
Deed, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>May</hi> 1689. So that Mrs. <hi>Took</hi>'s Separate Maintenance
is first in time (if it be not fraudulent).</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chancery</hi> upon hearing of the Cause <hi>Trinity Term,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Decree for a Separate Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. Perpetual Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> 1694. hath
Decreed the Separate Maintenance to be good in Law against
Sir <hi>Robert</hi>'s Mortgage; and hath granted a perpetual Injunction to
stay the Trial at the Common Law, upon an issue, whether Mr. <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>'s
Estate be Fraudulent or not. Which Issue was join'd before
Mrs. <hi>Took</hi>'s Bill was Exhibited: But the <hi>Chancery</hi> will not suffer it to
be Tried at Law, though it be matter of Fact.</p>
            <p>The ground and pretence for Equity against Sir <hi>Robert,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Equity. Sir <hi>Robert</hi>'s Notice.</note> is, That
Sir <hi>Robert</hi> had Notice of this Trust of a Separate Maintenance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he took his Mortgage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Sir <hi>Robert</hi> claims not under the Estate in Trust, nor by, nor
under Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> the Trustee; and therefore no Bill nor Equity
lies for it against him: And therefore his Notice of the Trust
(which he admits he had) is not Material.</p>
            <p>That which, probably, misleads the <hi>Chancery,</hi> (as Sir <hi>Robert</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,)
is the common Case in our Law-Books of an Use, (which
was the same thing as a Trust now is).</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Viz.</hi> If a Feoffee to an Use (before the <hi>Stat.</hi> of 27. of <hi>H.</hi> 8. for
transferring the Possession to the Use) had Enfeoffe'd <hi>I. S.</hi> of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95470:3"/>
Land, although for a Valuable Consideration; yet if <hi>I. S.</hi> had
Notice of the Use, he shall be Subject to the Use, although he
were a Purchaser, and a <hi>Subpoena</hi> lies against him by <hi>Cestuy que Use,</hi>
(the Party for whom the Use was); the true reason is, because <hi>I.
S.</hi> in this Case claims in privity of the Estate, and derives under the
first Feoffee himself, and comes into the Estate in the <hi>(per)</hi> as the
Law distinguishes, and terms it, and not in the <hi>(post)</hi> as Sir <hi>Robert</hi>
does.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And so are the Books,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant in <hi>Chancery,</hi> and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellant before the Lords, comes in not in the <hi>(per)</hi> but <hi>(post).</hi>
               </note> viz. 7. H. 7. Fitzh. Abr. tit. Sub poena, plac. 18.
<hi>and</hi> 5 E. 4. ib. placit. 2. &amp; 5. <hi>and Dame</hi> Burgh'<hi>s Case</hi> Moor'<hi>s</hi>
Rep. 602.</p>
            <p>And in this Case if <hi>I. S.</hi> were not a Purchaser, and paid no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
Consideration, it is all one whether he had Notice or not;
and if he paid a Consideration, yet if he had Notice before-hand,
he shall be subject to the Use, and liable to a <hi>Subpoena</hi> in <hi>Chancery</hi> at
the Suit of <hi>Cestuy que Use.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Note,</hi> The true reason and distinction in this Case is, <hi>I. S.</hi>
comes in under the first Feoffee himself, and under that Feoffee's
Estate; so that there is a privity of Estate between them, which
is termed (coming in the <hi>Per).</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It has been Resolv'd by a Chancellor and all the Judges, That
the Heir of such a second Feoffee is not liable to a <hi>Subpoena</hi> by <hi>Cestuy
que Use</hi> (but they must seek to the Parliament) though he be (in
the<note n="*" place="margin">22. <hi>E.</hi> 4. 6. by the Ch. Just. <hi>Hussey. Bro. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. plac.</hi> 23.</note>

8. and 22. <hi>E. 4. 6. Bro. Abr. tit. Conscience, plac.</hi> 23.</p>
            <p>But all the Books are, That no <hi>Subpoena</hi> in <hi>Chancery</hi> lies against a
Stranger, that is, who is not privy, nor comes not under the very
Estate, out of which the Use issues, or the Trust arises, (which
is all one) for a<note n="†" place="margin">Ld. <hi>Cook</hi> 4. Inst. 85. in the middle of the Fol.</note> Stranger is he that comes not in the <hi>(per)</hi> but
in the <hi>(post)</hi> and this is very Case of the Appellant Sir <hi>Robert
Atkyns;</hi> he Claims not from, nor under <hi>Mr. Bennet;</hi> and in such
Case Notice is not material.</p>
            <p>Where a Man is a meer Wrong-doer, as a Trespasser, or Disseisor,
and who hath Notice too before-hand of an Use or Trust, even in
such Case the <hi>Cestuy que Use,</hi> or <hi>Cestuy que Trust,</hi> (as Mrs. <hi>Took</hi> in this
Case is,) cannot maintain a <hi>Subpoena,</hi> nor hath any Remedy in <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery</hi>
against such Trespasser, or Disseisor; but must take his Remedy
by <hi>Sub-poena</hi> against her own Feoffee, or Trustee, (if there be Cause,)
to Compel him to enter again upon such a Disseisor,<note place="margin">

17. at the end of that <hi>placitum,</hi> and <hi>ib. placit.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Moile Finche</hi>'s Case in <hi>Chancery</hi> referr'd by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to all
the Judges of <hi>England,</hi> after hearing Councel on both Parts on se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
days, and after Conference between the Judges themselves;
it was Resolv'd, That a Disseisor is subject to no Trust, nor was a
<hi>Subpoena</hi> maintainable against him: Not only because a Disseisor
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95470:3"/>
was in the <hi>(post)</hi> but because the right of Freehold and Inheritance
was determinable at the Common Law, and not in<note n="†" place="margin">22 <hi>E. 4. 6. ut supra.</hi> by <hi>Hussey,</hi> Ch. Just.</note> 
               <hi>Chancery;</hi>
neither had <hi>Cestuy que Use</hi> (while he was in being) any Remedy in
such Case.</p>
            <p>If no <hi>Subpoena</hi> will lie against a Disseisor, <hi>(i. e.</hi> a wrong-doer,) much
less against a Purchaser, who comes in by a Legal Conveyance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Privity of Estate, as Sir <hi>Robert Atkyns</hi> doth.</p>
            <p>But, which is yet much stronger than all those Cases before-cited,
there is not only a want of Privity in this present Case of Sir <hi>Robert</hi>'s,
(which is a sufficient reason why no <hi>Subpoena,</hi> nor remedy in Equity
<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies against him by Mrs. <hi>Took,</hi> the <hi>Cestuy que Trust):</hi> But he pleaded
to her Bill in <hi>Chancery,</hi> and insisted upon it at the hearing, That he is
a Purchaser upon a Valuable Consideration, and that the Estate for
Life made by the Husband, <hi>Thomas Took,</hi> to Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> in Trust
for a Separate Maintenance for the Wife, is Fraudulent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
void by the Stat.<note place="margin">A Fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance.</note> 27 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 4. and that this ought to be

            <p>And that by their Distreining the Tenant for his Rent,<note place="margin">Triable by a Jury, not by Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses in <hi>Chancery.</hi>
               </note> who sued
a Replevin, they themselves had put the matter into a right course
at Common Law, where a matter of Fact, (Fraudulent, or not
Fraudulent,) ought to be tried by a Jury, and not by Witnesses
in <hi>Chancery,</hi> and a Fraudulent Conveyance being made void by the
Statute before mentioned: the Exposition of Statutes belongs to
the Judges of the Common Law,<note place="margin">A Statute is to be expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Judges, not in <hi>Chancery.</hi>
               </note> and not to a Court of Equity;
and especially there being Estates of Freehold and Inheritance on
both sides concern'd in this Case, which is examinable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable
by the Courts of the Common Law, and the
Rules of Law, and not in Equity by Witnesses: And they
themselves had join'd Issue upon the Fraud,<note place="margin">The <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery</hi> may not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Freehold.</note> and a Jury return'd
to try it before they Exhibited their Bill in <hi>Chancery.</hi> And
Notice of the Trust before he took the Mortgage, being also
confess'd by Sir <hi>Robert</hi> in his Answer, (if it be at all material,)
it is so upon the trial of the Issue, to prove their Deed not Fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;
so that she might take the benefit and advantage of that upon
the Trial at Law, if it be material.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert</hi> hath no way to overthrow their Deed and Title
but by making it out to be Fraudulent: If it be not Fraudulent, they are
safe, for their Deed is <hi>prior</hi> in time to Sir <hi>Robert</hi>'s Deed by Three
years; so that they had no need, if it were not Fraudulent, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
to Equity: If it be a Fraudulent Deed, Will a Court of Equity
support it? Which should rather relieve a Purchaser against frauds;
especially in the Case of such an upstart, and mischievous, and late
invention, as a Separate Maintenance is, granted by the Husband,
<hi>Thomas Took,</hi> about Ten Years after Marriage, (there being no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
Agreement before Marriage for it;) and being in Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
only of her joyning with her Husband in a Fine for the Sale of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95470:4"/>
some other Houses, wherein she was also Entituled by the Marriage
to her Thirds, and this being done in the year 1686. Whereas,</p>
            <p>1<hi>st.</hi> She had before (in the year 1684) levied a Fine with her
Husband to enable him to Mortgage, and Borrow Money to pay his
Debts, and then 100 <hi>l. per An.</hi> Separate Maintenance was settled
on her, which was large enough, considering his mean Estate; and
she parted with no Thirds in 1686; (so the Consideration was but
feigned in 1686. when the 200 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> was Settled).</p>
            <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> The Husband in 1686. was much more Indebted than in
1684. and yet the Separate Maintenance must then be doubled, <hi>viz.</hi>
from 100 <hi>l.</hi> to 200 <hi>l. per An.</hi> clear, and many of those Debts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
unpaid to this day, as is prov'd in this Case.</p>
            <p>3<hi>dly.</hi> The only consideration for the Separate Maintenance of
200 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> clear in the Deed of 1686. being her then joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a Fine, and barring of her Thirds; (all which was done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in 1684.); but by this Deed of 1686. She has 300 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi>
besides, clear above all Payments settled upon her for her Jointure,
in Lieu of her Thirds (if she survive;) which is far greater in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
too, than the whole Estate would have born, had she been
left to her Thirds.<note place="margin">300 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> Jointure besides.</note> And this is a more suitable Recompence too
for her Thirds, being in case she survive, (as the Thirds would
have been,) but she must hook in a Separate Maintenance too in
the mean time, while the Husband is alive.</p>
            <p>And there is nothing else left to maintain him, nor to pay his
Debts, but he was forced to take up Money of Sir <hi>Robert</hi> to pay
off some of his Debts, and to fit him for an Employment in the
Army; for which Money so borrowed, Mr. <hi>Took</hi> Mortgag'd these
Houses to Sir <hi>Robert</hi> Six years ago; and not a Penny, Principal or
Interest paid in Six years time, nor like to be (if this Decree stand)
while Mrs. <hi>Took</hi> lives, who is about 34 years old.</p>
            <p>4<hi>thly.</hi> A Separate Maintenance is the same thing with <hi>Alimony.</hi>
Now in the <hi>Exchequer Chamber,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Separate Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</note> 15 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. in the Case of <hi>Manby</hi>
against <hi>Scot,</hi> the then Chief Justice <hi>Bridgman,</hi> and the rest of the
Judges there, were of Opinion, That by Law the Wife shall be
maintain'd according to the present Estate, and not only according
to the Degree of the Husband. See <hi>Siderfin</hi>'s <hi>Reports,</hi> Fol. 128.
But this Separate Maintenance, and <hi>Alimony</hi> of 200 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> clear
of all Payments, swallows up all the Husband's Estate; none is
left.</p>
            <p>There are many other Badges of Fraud, which Sir <hi>Robert</hi> reserved
to be made out upon the Trial before the Jury, but held them
not proper at the Hearing; so that the Opinion of that Court for
Allowing and Confirming the Separate Maintenance, was a surprize
upon Sir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Robert.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Robert</hi> at the Hearing mov'd the Lord Keeper that he would
hear the Opinion of some of the Judges, in the Case concerning the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95470:4"/>
Jurisdiction of Courts of Law and a Court of Equity) but it would
not be granted.</p>
            <p>Yet it appears by the Cases before-cited, (and many more in the
Books,) That in Cases of Uses, the Chancellor was heretofore used
to Adjourn such Cases into the Exchequer-Chamber, and to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
himself, and to have the Cases there debated by all the Judges;
which kept a good Correspondence among the Courts, and kept
Equity within some bounds. See the before-cited Case of 8 <hi>E. 4.
Fitz. Abr. Tit. Subpoena Plac.</hi> 8. and much of that Title, to the same
purpose.</p>
            <p>It may be Observ'd out of all that hath been said, That the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Decree incroaches upon the Common-Law, in several main
points.</p>
            <p>1<hi>st.</hi> In Examining and Determining a Matter of Fact (whether
a Conveyance be Fraudulent or not Fraudulent) by Witnesses, which
ought to be Tried by a Jury of Twelve Men. And this is done
by the Chancery too, after an Issue join'd at Law, upon that very
point, before any Bill Exhibited: And Sir <hi>Robert</hi> at last must pay
the whole Charge of both, near 200 <hi>l.</hi> Costs, besides his own Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and mighty trouble.</p>
            <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> The Chancery by this Decree hath taken upon it to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
a Matter of Freehold, (which is in Question on both Sides,
and claimed by both Parties,) which is not Determinable in a Court
of Equity, but only at the Common-Law, and by Judges Sworn
to judge according to Law, and not after the Rules of Equity.</p>
            <p>3<hi>dly.</hi> By drawing in a Purchaser to answer to, and to be Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to a Trust, to which he is neither Party nor Privy: Neither
claiming under the Trustee, (Mr. <hi>Bennet,)</hi> nor under Mrs. <hi>Took,</hi> for
whom the Trust is, contrary to all the Authorities in the Books both
Ancient,<note place="margin">A Trust is the same thing as an Use was.</note> and Modern, in this very point, and against the Rules and
Precedents in Chancery: A Trust now being the same thing with an
Use, as it stood before the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. for Transferring the
Possession to the Use. As fully appears by that Statute, wherein
Use and Trust are often repeated as signifying the same.</p>
            <p>4<hi>thly.</hi> By entertaining a Suit, and Decreeing in Equity, when
there is a plain Remedy at Law,<note place="margin">Mrs. <hi>Took</hi> hath Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy at Law in the Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stee's Name.</note> (in the Name of the Trustee, Mr.
<hi>Bennet.)</hi> For if Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s Estate be good in Law, (which ought
to be determin'd at Law,) then the separate Maintenance must be
good, and cannot, nor will not be contested: And Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s
Deed and Title at Law is Prior in time to the Appellant Sir <hi>Robert</hi>'s
Mortgage: So that if it be not Fraudulent, it is not in the least
danger.</p>
            <p>1. It is supposed, that this is the first Precedent wherein a Court
of Equity hath countenanc'd that new thing, (a separate Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
or Alimony,) and that against a Purchaser.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:95470:5"/>
2. And so large a separate Maintenance as 200. <hi>per An.</hi> clear
above all Payments, out of so small an Estate as her Husbands is.</p>
            <p>3. And which was Granted by the Husband Ten years after their
Marriage, and not in performance of any Marriage-Agreement.</p>
            <p>4. And the Husband being,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at the time of Granting of it, greatly
Indebted, many of which Debts are unpaid to this Day: So that the
Husband is driven from his Wife and Home by reason of his Debts;
and the Husband hath nothing left him to live upon, but what his Wife
secretly spares him, (as he has receiv'd several Sums since the Granting
this separate Maintenance, as appears in proof,) which proves the
Fraud.</p>
            <p>5. The Husband having borrow'd the Appellant's Money to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
him to pay his Debts, and to set him at Liberty, and to procure
and fit him for an Employment in the Army.</p>
            <p>6. And where the Wife had a former separate Maintenance of 100<hi>l.
per An.</hi>
               <note place="margin">A former separate Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</note> Granted her about two Years before, upon her joining in a Fine,
and barr'd her self of her Thirds, (if she Surviv'd), in Recompence of
which Thirds too,<note place="margin">A Join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of 300<hi>l. per Annum.</hi>
               </note> she hath by this very last Settlement 300<hi>l. per
An.</hi> clear above all Payments for her Jointure, (if she Survive.)</p>
            <p>And in this Case, the Purchaser (the Apellant Sir <hi>Robert Atkyns)</hi>
hath not had one penny Principal or Interest, after Six years parting
with his Money; which Money he is still willing to have repaid
him, and to quit the benefit of the Purchase.</p>
            <p>The Appellant,<note place="margin">Note,</note> Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> hath had so great tenderness and respect
to the Respondent Mrs. <hi>Took,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Robert Atkyns</hi> lets Mrs. <hi>Took</hi> enjoy 18 of the 19 houses.</note> (that claims this present Maintenance)
as to gain to himself the Possession but of one House of nineteen Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
which he hath gained too, not against her, nor her Trustee, but
by his own Suit, and at his own charge, against one <hi>Collins,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
it from the Estate of Captain <hi>Took</hi> several years, and conceal'd
it from them: So that it was given by them for lost, and not so
much as look'd after by them, (tho it had some time paid them Rent;)
they contenting themselves all the while with the other Eighteen
Houses, and may (if they will be quiet) enjoy their eighteen Houses
for the future. Which eighteen Houses (if well look'd after, and if the
Rents of them were duly Collected) will be very sufficient to answer
Mrs. <hi>Took</hi> her full separate Maintenance of 200. <hi>per An.</hi> during her
Life, if Sir <hi>Robert</hi> might have the naming of the Collector, which
is deny'd him by the Decree.</p>
            <p>There are Two things more yet remaining in this present Case to
be remembred.—1. The now Appellant Sir <hi>Robert Atkyns</hi> (then Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant)
moved the Lord Keeper at the Hearing, That he might have
Reparation against the Plaintiffs in that Bill, especially against the
Plaintiff <hi>Bedford,</hi> a Clerk in Chancery, who needlesly thrust himself
in to be a Plaintiff, and drew the Bill himself, as appears by the Bill
Fol 34, 35, 36.) and also against the Plaintiff's Council, who sign'd
the Bill, <hi>viz.</hi> Sir <hi>William Williams, Sergeant Bretland,</hi> and <hi>E. Otterborn,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:95470:5"/>
for the Scandals cast upon the Appellant Sir <hi>Robert,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Scandal.</note> (who at that
time was Chief Baron of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and an Assistant to the
House of Lords.)</p>
            <p>1. The Bill charges the then Defendant, (Sir <hi>Robert,)</hi> as acting
against the Plaintiff, (Mrs. <hi>Took,)</hi> by his Greatness and Power. <hi>Fol.</hi>
44. and 46. (which Reflects upon him in Relation to his Judge's
Office.)</p>
            <p>2. And <hi>Fol.</hi> 54. and 55. That Sir <hi>Robert</hi> threatens to ruin the
Plaintiff, (Mrs. <hi>Took,)</hi> in Law-Suits, unless she will comply with
his unreasonable desires.</p>
            <p>3. And <hi>Fol.</hi> 58. and 60. That Sir <hi>Robert</hi> carried on the Suit at
Common-Law, in the Replevin, in the Name of <hi>Hook,</hi> contrary to
<hi>Hook</hi>'s desire.</p>
            <p>All which are very false, and the Plaintiffs have not made the least
proof of them; but the contrary of them appears by <hi>Hook</hi>'s own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Suit by Replevin, Nor were they at all material to the Bill,
which had been as sufficient without them.</p>
            <p>By the Stat. of 8 <hi>Eliz. Cap. 2. Parag.</hi> 4. The penalty for Suing
in another's Name without the consent of such Person, is six Months
Imprisonment without Bail, and not then to be delivered out of
Prison, till first paying treble Damages, and Costs, and Ten
pounds penalty besides; yet the Court would have no regard to all
this, but it must remain to Posterity upon the File.</p>
            <p>It is usual in <hi>Chancery,</hi> (as it was also in the Star-Chamber,) and
other Courts, to give Damages to the Defendant for the Scandals in
the Bills, and there are Precedents of it.—But the Lord-Keeper
held these no Scandals.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Robert</hi> Appeals to the Lords herein, and prays he may have
Reparation, as well against the Council that Sign'd the Bill, as
against the Plaintiffs; and that the Bill may be taken off the File.</p>
            <p>It may perhaps be offer'd by the Respondents, (Mrs. <hi>Took,</hi> &amp;c.)
upon the Hearing this Appeal before the Lords, That in the hearing
of the Cause in <hi>Chancery,</hi> a Bill Exhibited by the Appellant, (Sir
<hi>Robert,)</hi> in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> against Mrs. <hi>Took,</hi> and her Husband,
(Capt. <hi>Took,)</hi> and against her Trustee, (Mr. <hi>Bennet,)</hi> and against
<hi>Hook,</hi> (the Tenant of the <hi>Rose-Tavern,</hi> &amp;c.) was read; whereby it
appear'd that Sir <hi>Robert</hi> in Effect then admitted of Mrs. <hi>Took</hi>'s Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Maintenance, and Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s Estate, (in Trust for her,) as
good, and claimed to himself only the overplus of the Rents, (if
any) during her Life, and the Reversion of the whole after her
Death.</p>
            <p>In this Bill of Mrs. <hi>Took</hi>'s in the <hi>Chancery,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answ.</note> whereupon the Decree
now Appeal'd from, is made, there is not any Allegation, nor the
least touch or mention of that Bill of Sir <hi>Robert</hi>'s in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> nor
of the Matter of that Bill: For had it been alledg'd in Mrs.
<hi>Took</hi>'s <hi>Chancery</hi>-Bill, Sir <hi>Robert</hi> could have given it a full Answer,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95470:6"/>
and shewn how that Sir <hi>Robert</hi> at the Exhibiting of his Bill in the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,</hi>
had not so fully discovered the Fraud of the Separate Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
as he has done since, but believ'd; (as the Deed for the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Maintenance, does alledge, see her Deed,) that the Rents were
sufficient to answer her the 200<hi>l. per An.</hi> and that 160<hi>l. per. An.</hi> over,
would have been left for Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> which by her proofs appear to be
false, and the Rents short of making good her 200<hi>l. per An.</hi> as she
alledges: See her Bill. <hi>A Court must proceed Secundum Allegata.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> The reading that Bill of Sir <hi>Robert</hi>'s in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
all the proof offer'd at the hearing the Cause in <hi>Chancery,</hi> were ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular,
there <hi>being</hi> nothing in the Cause in the <hi>Chancery</hi> put in Issue by
the Bill and answer. The only Equity of the Plaintiff, Mrs. <hi>Took</hi>'s
Bill, being a Trust of the Separate Maintenance, and Sir <hi>Robert</hi>'s No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it; both which were confess'd by Sir <hi>Robert</hi> in his answer.
He only insisted upon it both by his Plea and Answer, that their Deed
was Fraudulent, which ought to be tried at the Common-Law; and
that he being a Stranger, (neither Party nor Privy,) therefore the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
was not material. Here was nothing remain'd that requir'd proof
in <hi>Chancery;</hi> yet to increase the Charge, the Plaintiffs proceeded to
proofs, which has given occasion to Sir <hi>Miles Cook,</hi> to load Sir <hi>Robert</hi> with
near 200<hi>l.</hi> Cost; which, tho excepted too, is confirm'd by the Court.</p>
            <p>3<hi>dly.</hi> Had the matter of Sir <hi>Robert</hi>'s Bill in the <hi>Exchequer</hi> been the
least hinted at, or stirr'd in Mrs. <hi>Took</hi>'s Bill in <hi>Chancery,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert</hi> had
been awakened by it, and forewarn'd to have answer'd to it, and
made proof upon it, <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That his Bill in the <hi>Exchequer</hi> was designed meerly to state the
Debt owing to him by Mr. <hi>Took,</hi> and to compel him to a Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Mortgage, or to be barr'd of his Redemption; and all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
(as was propos'd to Sir <hi>Robert</hi> on the behalf of Mr. <hi>Took,)</hi> were
inclin'd to get an Act of Parliament pass'd for the sale of Mr. <hi>Took</hi>'s
Estate; and to have the Debt due to Sir <hi>Robert</hi> upon the Mortgage,
and the Debts to his other Creditors paid off, and a provision after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
made for Mrs. <hi>Took,</hi> which Sir <hi>Robert</hi> offer'd to further: So that
it was not so seasonable nor proper at that time to question their Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
nor to object Fraud against it. Nor was it proper for Sir <hi>Robert</hi>
to Object or Controvert the Fraud of it in Equity, there being sufficient
Remedy against it at the Common-Law; which Course too he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
pursued; when he found they proceeded not in their Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to get the Act of Parliament pass'd. And the Fraud more
plainly appearing,</p>
            <p>4<hi>thly.</hi> Sir <hi>Robert</hi> at the hearing of this Cause in <hi>Chancery,</hi> oppos'd
the reading of his <hi>Exchequer</hi>-Bill in Evidence, as being no regular
proof or evidence either in Law or Equity.<note place="margin">A Bill in Equity is no Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in another Suit.</note> Bills in Equity being the
Invention and Surmises of the Council that draw them; and the
Suggestions and Allegations that are in them, are indeed but of the
Nature of Interrogations to enforce a Discovery from the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95470:6"/>
but are no Conclusions, nor Estopples to the Parties that exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
them, nor evidence against them, who do not so much as Sign
them themselves.</p>
            <p>Nor shall Sir <hi>Robert</hi>'s Bill in the <hi>Exchequer</hi> controll his Indenture of
Mortgage, whereby the Fee-Simple of the Houses in Question is
conveyed in possession to him, and not a Reversion only.</p>
            <p>Nor shall it overthrow his Answer upon Oath in this Cause, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he makes Title to the Houses in Possession, as being the Purchaser
of them for a valuable consideration,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and being indeed forced to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Mortgage, (by Mr. <hi>Took</hi>'s defrauding him of a former se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
which Sir <hi>Robert</hi> had for his Money,) or else Sir <hi>Robert</hi> must
have lost his money.</p>
            <p>Now that Sir <hi>Robert</hi>'s <hi>Exchequer</hi>-Bill ought not by the Rules of
Law to have been allow'd for Evidence, no not in the <hi>Chancery,</hi> tho
between the same Parties, appears by a printed Case, by the Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of a Lord-Chancellor too, in the very like Case in the
main; but the present Case on Sir <hi>Robert</hi>'s part is much stronger
than that too on his Side.</p>
            <p>The Case is <hi>Mich. 14. E. 4. Fitzh. Abr. Tit. Subpoena plac.</hi> 15. One
<hi>Tate</hi> was Sued in <hi>Chancery</hi> by a Bill in Equity, (as Sir <hi>Robert</hi> is,) and
made to answer upon Oath at the Hearing, (just as was in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Case,) a Bill of <hi>Tate</hi>'s, (then Defendant,) exhibited by him in
the same Court too, and for the same matter, (and thereupon so
much the stronger against <hi>Tate,)</hi> was offer'd to be read, which did
contradict and differ from his answer: By the Chancellor, (by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the King's Sergeants,) <hi>Tate</hi>'s Bill was not to be regarded,
for he was Sworn to his Answer, but not to his Bill.</p>
            <p>5. If Sir <hi>Robert</hi>'s <hi>Exchequer</hi>-Bill had been Evidence, (as it is not,)
yet it serves only to prove, that (in Sir <hi>Robert</hi>'s opinion at that time
when his bill was Exhibited,) Mrs. <hi>Took</hi>'s Deed of Separate Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
was not Fraudulent, or that he then had not discovered the Fraud.</p>
            <p>This would then have been proper to have been offer'd upon the
trial of the Issue at Common-Law, but is no Ground for a Decree:
And Sir <hi>Robert</hi> may change his Opinion upon further Discovery of the
Truth of the Case; for it is at most but his then apprehension of
it, it alters not the truth of the Case, nor the matter of Fact in it:
and he was seduced into that good opinion of Mrs. <hi>Took</hi>'s title to her
Separate Maintenance by Mrs. <hi>Took</hi>'s own Deed, which did affirm
the yearly value to be 360<hi>l. per An.</hi> which (had it been true,) would
have been sufficient for both their turns; but in truth there has not
been enough to pay the 200<hi>l. per An.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Separate Maintenances are but of late Invention, and bring many
mischievous consequences after them: And not one Precedent of the
<hi>Chancery,</hi> (as 'tis believ'd) can be produc'd, where ever, (before this
Decree,) a Separate Maintenance hath been Countenanc'd against a
Purchaser. Which Purchase to the Appellant, (Sir <hi>Robert Atkyns,)</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:95470:7"/>
never was made out of any greediness of profit,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Robert</hi> was forced to take this Mortgage.</note> but he was meerly
driven to it, to accept it as a farther Security, after he had parted with
his Money to the Husband, who had defrauded Sir <hi>Robert</hi> of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Security, (as appears by the proofs.)</p>
            <p>And either the Husband or the Wife, or any Friend of theirs on
their behalf, may still redeem if they please, if it be done in
some reasonable time, Sir <hi>Robert</hi> will be willing to accept of
his money again.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Robert</hi> hopes to be excus'd for using this Freedom with the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery;</hi>
It being generally known, that long before this present occasion,
even while he himself Sate in a Court of Equity, (established by Act
of Parliament,) he both in that Court, and in the Highest Court, (the
House of Lords,) discharg'd his Conscience, by inveighing against
the Encroachments of Courts of Equity.</p>
            <p>To Conclude, The Apellant, (Sir <hi>Robert Atkyns,)</hi> humbly moves
the Lords, to take up the same resolution in this present Case,
(which appears in the Precedent and Example to be of highest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,)
as their Noble Ancestors and Predecessors did in the
Twentieth Year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>IIId.</hi> when the Statute of <hi>Merton</hi>
was made, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9<hi>th.</hi> The Lords being press'd by all the Bishops
to make the Ancient Law of <hi>England</hi> to conform to the Constitution
of the Church but in one point, <hi>Viz.</hi> That Children born before Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony
might be accounted Legitimate, and Inheritable to Lands.
All the Earls and Barons with one Voice answered, <hi>That they would
not change the Laws of the Realm, which hitherto have been</hi> Used <hi>and</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</p>
