            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Firſt-born Sons; and that the practice of your Neighbour, can be no other than ſuch, appears in this, that he has not Exhaeredated his Son by the former Venter, upon the account of any horrid Crime the Son has committed, but only to ſerve his own Fooliſh Fantacies, private Paſſions, and indirect Fondneſs: And therefore let him hear what <hi>Philo</hi> and others ſay to the point of Exhaeredation;<note n="a" place="margin">Patres Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicationis triſtia verba pronunti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, filioſ<expan>

               <hi>I.</hi> The Right, and Priviledge of <hi>Primogeniture,</hi> is derived from the Law of Nature</p>
            <p>That this Precedency, both in Honor and Right appertains to the Firſt-born by the Law of Nature, appears in this, That <hi>Primogeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is not only preferred where Gods Revelation of himſelf in the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101097:4"/>
Scriptures are received, but where they are not received; the Right therefore of <hi>Primogeniture</hi> is from the Law of Nature: Again, If <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeniture</hi> had not been a Sacred Thing, and Inheritance annexed to it by the Law of Nature, then could not <hi>Eſau</hi> have been pronounced a Prophane Perſon for Selling his Birth right, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 16.

               <hi>II.</hi> The Preference, and the Prerogative of Primogeniture, in point of Dignity, Poſſeſſions and Conſecration, is of Divine Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>This is manifeſtly evidenced by ſeveral places of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>In reſpect of Dignity and Power,</hi> as where God ſaid to <hi>Cain</hi> of his Younger Brother <hi>Abel, His deſires ſhall be ſubject to thee, and thou ſhalt have Dominion over him,</hi> Gen. 4. 7. So when Old <hi>Jacob</hi> called his Sons to Bleſs them, he expreſſeth himſelf in this wiſe to his Eldeſt Son <hi>Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben; Reuben,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Thou art my Firſt born, my Might, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of my Strength, the Excellency of Dignity, and the Excellency of Power,</hi> Gen. 49. 31. Which kind of Excellency is acknowledged by the Good King <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> to be annexed to Priority in Birth; <hi>For he gave to his Younger Sons great Gifts of Silver and Gold, with Fenced Cities in</hi> Judah; <hi>but the Kingdom gave he to</hi> Jehoram, <hi>becauſe he was the Firſt-born,</hi> 2 Chron. 21. 3.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:101097:4"/>
2. <hi>In reſpect of Poſſeſſions,</hi> As, where God forbiddeth the Father to Diſinherit the Firſt-Born of his double Portion, becauſe by Right of Birth it is Due unto him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 17.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>In Reſpect of Divine Conſecration,</hi> As, where God maketh Choice of the Firſt-Born to be Sanctined and Conſecrated to himſelf. <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 2. and 22. 29. and 34. 19. <hi>Levit.</hi> 27. 26. <hi>Numb.</hi> 3. 13. and 8. 16. and 18. 15. <hi>Neh.</hi> 10. 36. <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 23. Sir, Any Reaſonable Man would think that ſuch Reſpects or Conſiderations as theſe ſhould be enough to deter a Father from Depriving his Eldeſt Son of his Prerogative of Birth, and from preferring his Younger Son, which he has by another Wife, in Succeſſion before him.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>III.</hi> Priviledges of Primogeniture are highly Approved, and very much Countenanced, by the Divines of our Church.</p>
            <p>What Reſpect and Care the Eminent Divines of our Church have had for the Preſervation of the Order of Nature, and of Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, in the Right of Primogeniture, as to the Dignity and double Portion of the Firſt-Born; ſhall be Apparanted (amongſt many others) by a Triumvirate of Witneſſes, to wit, <hi>

            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>There be (ſaith he) but</hi> Two Great Rights, <hi>which you find in Scripture. 1.</hi> Jus Primogeniturae, The Right of Primogeniture. <hi>2.</hi> Jus Regni, The Right to a Kingdom. <hi>In the</hi> Firſt <hi>of theſe all Domination was Originally Founded; For the Elder Brother in his Tribe, was</hi> Princips Familiae, The Prince of his Family. <hi>And not only the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence</hi>

                  <hi>of Dignity which was his Birth-Right, but the Inheritance is ſo faſtned to him, as if God intended no ſeparation either by the Hatred, or Affection of the Parent.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>The Text is moſt Remarkable,</hi> (<note place="margin">Deut. 21. 15.</note> 
               <hi>and I wiſh all Parents would lay it to heart,)</hi> If a Man have two Wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have Born him Children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the Firſt-Born Son be hers that was hated:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>ver.</hi> 16.</note> Then it ſhall be, when he maketh his Sons to Inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the Son of the beloved Firſt-Born, before the Son of the<note place="margin">

            <p>
               <q>Therefore, Tho' the Law hath been over Curious to un-rivet this Birth-Right, by God's and Man's Law Entailed upon the Elder, by bringing in Feigned Perſons, and falſe Vouchers, and Formal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations to diveſt it. I muſt only ſay thus much, <hi>Sic non fuit ab Initio,</hi> (as Chriſt ſaid of Divorce) <hi>It was not ſo from the Beginning;</hi> but out of the hardneſs of Mens Hearts did this Invention ſpring.
