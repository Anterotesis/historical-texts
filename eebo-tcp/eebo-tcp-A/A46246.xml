         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Duty, from a consideration, that the great and good object
of my <hi>Addresses,</hi> would deservedly require my choicest
Thoughts, and accutest Contemplations; which since (upon
deliberate disquisition) I have found so true, that in my
very first attempt, I was discouraged; for the Lustre of
the Subject, began to dim the Eyes of my Fantasie, and
wrought in me a fear, That to render Him his merited
Commendation, would prove beyond the reach of all my

               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:50025:5"/>In the Reer, upon a Third Angle, sitteth <hi>Phigalia,</hi> a Dryad, or Wood
Nymph, in a Robe of <hi>French</hi> Green, with a Scarf of Gold; a long curld
brown Hair, and about her Head a Garland of Wild-flowers, and under her

<hi>Fishmongers.</hi> On the Fourth Angle, another Nymph, with a Silk Ash-colour'd
Robe, with a Scarf, fringed with Green and Silver, with a
Banner of the City.</p>
            <p>The ascent to this Rustick Mansion, is natively imbroider'd with Brambles,
Thorns, and Bryers, of all sorts, bearing large visible clusters of Berries, red,
black, and green, Hipps and Haws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with small Trees, laden with wild
Fruits; and at the foot of this building on the right Hand, under <hi>Bacchus,</hi>

in <hi>Autum,</hi> intermingled with large Clusters of plump Grapes, with <hi>Vinitorians</hi>
and Vine-dressers, in naked Tauny Shapes, with Grapes and Leaves bound
about their Heads and Middle.</p>
            <p>On the left hand is a Forrest, properly accomodated and wildly adorned
with variety of Trees, Ravenous Beasts and Birds, Inhabited by Satyrs, which
are form'd like Goats from the middle downwards, with Goats Feet, and Mens
Heads, with short black curl'd Hair, and upright Horns, with hairy Bodies.</p>
            <p>Also divers Wood Nymphs the <hi>Dryades,</hi> and <hi>Hamadryades,</hi> significantly
attired, in green Silk Robes, and gray Silk Mantles, fringed with Gold and
Silver, wearing about their Heads, Garlands of Wood-bine, Honey-Suckles,
Wild-Roses, Marjoram, and wild Thyme; Their action properly is Dancing
in Rings, which the <hi>Sylvans</hi> and <hi>Satyrs</hi> perceiving, they mingle in their
Measures, and Dance with them several Art-less Roundelayes, to the Musick
of a Piper.</p>
            <p>His Lordship having delightfully past a short space of time in the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation

            <head>The Third PAGEANT.</head>
            <p>ON a very large <hi>Pageant,</hi> is a very rich Seat of State, containing the
Representor of, the Patron to the <hi>Goldsmiths</hi> Company, Saint <hi>Dunstan,</hi>
attired in a dress properly expressing his Prelatical Dignity, in a Robe of
fine white Lawn, over which he weareth a Cope or Vest of costly bright
Cloth of Gold, down to the ground; on his Reverend grey Head, a golden
Mytre, set with Topaz, Ruby, Emrald, Amethyst and Saphyr; in his left
Hand he holdeth a golden Crosier, and in his right Hand he useth a pair of
<hi>Goldsmiths</hi> Tongs: Beneath these Steps of Ascension to his Chair, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50025:6"/>
to St. <hi>Dunstan,</hi> is properly planted a <hi>Goldsmiths</hi> Forge and Furnace,
with fire and Gold in it, a Workman blowing with the Bellows: On his
right and left hand there is a large Press of Gold and Silver Plate, representing
a Shop of Trade: And further in front, are several Artificers at work on
Anvils with Hammers, beating out Plate fit for the forgery and formation
of several Vessels in Gold and Silver. There are likewise in the Shop, divers
Wedges or Ingots of Gold and Silver. And a Step below St. <hi>Dunstan,</hi> sitteth
an Assay Master, with his Class Frame and Ballance, for Trial of Gold and
Silver, according to the Standard. In another place, there is also disgrossing,
drawing, and flatting of Gold and Silver Wyer. There are also <hi>Finers</hi>
melting, smelting, fining, and parting Gold and Silver, both by fire and water.
And in a March before this Orfery, are divers <hi>Miners</hi> in Canvass Breeches,
red Wastcoats and red Caps, bearing Spades, Pickaxes, Twibills and Crows,
fit to sink Shafts and make Addits. The Devil also appearing to St. <hi>Dunstan,</hi>
is catch'd by the Nose at a proper <hi>Qu.</hi> which is given in his Speech. When
the Speech is spoken, the great Anvil is set forth, with a <hi>Silversmith</hi> holding
on it a Plate of Massie Silver, and three other Workmen at work, keeping
excellent time in their orderly strokes upon the Anvil.</p>
            <p>His Lordship having well survey'd the Curiosity of the Design, the good
order of the Scene, with the variety and aptitude of the whole Concern:
Being attentively fixt, St. <hi>Dunstan</hi> rising up, all the Workmen cease, whilst
he maketh Addresses to my Lord, in this ensuing Metrical Congratulation.</p>
