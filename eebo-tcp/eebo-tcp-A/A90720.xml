         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ſecond (which is a conſequence of the firſt) <hi>viz.</hi> unity of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
which is compared to a ſtaffe of beauty, theſe two being
the ſupporters of a people from confuſion and deſtruction, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they have their being. Secondly, conſidering alſo, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
a man ought to ſee to his owne houſe, and not to adventure
to meddle with his neighbours dwellings, untill hee bee called
by an outward voice, as well as by an inward provocation, and
<pb facs="tcp:114314:3"/>
that notwithſtanding upon an extraordinary caſe of danger, hee
may (if not abſolutely prohibited) put to his helping hand
when a whole City is on fire, for it is then expected that their
neighbours ſhould come without an outward call, and put to
their helping hands. Provided that when hee appeareth, hee bee
allowed and approved by thoſe in Authority there, that he bee
able to doe good and not hurt; And alſo, conſidering how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
have adventured now in theſe times of danger, that have
been much defective in ſome things by them put forth: And
further ſeeing ſome have thruſt forth the poyſon of Aſpes to
the increaſing of our Kingdomes ſickneſſe: And alſo that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
have been permitted to uſe their Pens, who were but private
men, and perhaps, they have not all of them brought gold,
nor much ſilver, yet accepted too: Theſe things being by mee
thus conſidered, and being abſolutely perſwaded that I have ſome
water to quench the fire; and alſo ſome gold, if not ſilver, and
pearles, to helpe repaire what wilde fire hath exhausted; I
therefore have adventured toward the ruinated Houſe of this
our Iſrael: And my chiefe care is to bring ſuch materialls as
is moſt wanting to it, for if I come not with fitting matter,
I ſhall doe little good, if not much hurt, as ſome others have
done before mee: Yea, I, in ſo doing, may too eaſily increaſe the
flame. For ſometimes, the leſſe ſtraw or combuſtible matter is
beſt, eſpecially when the fire is too neare the thatch already; And
ſo many (that ſeeme to bee friendly helpers) are crafty hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
in this our great neceſsity: And truly I ſee many at worke,
and labour at it too, but they cannot well conclude about thoſe
things that are wanting to this Houſe. Therefore I am buſied
in the viewing of the materialls, which (as I thinke) bee thoſe
that truly belong to ſome ſpeciall parts of this frame; the which
are ſought for by many, and yet ſcarce found; (eſpecially by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of the Sectaries:) One ſaith, this is the piece that ought to be
next; and another ſaith to him, that that piece doth not belong
<pb facs="tcp:114314:3"/>
to any part of the building, but that it belongs to <hi>Romes</hi> Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue;
and another hee would lay a foundation where there is a
good one already; and a fourth, hee would take away both that
good one already laid, and the other that perhaps ſhould lye ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
neare it too; and a fifth, hee like a cunning fox, would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
them that it doth not belong to any of them all to build a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
that frame, and tells them in plaine termes, that they
are not lawfully called to build there in this Workmanſhip;
his policy was no other, but to keep them at ſtrife from buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
untill the Houſe were quite conſumed by his wilde-fire
brought from <hi>Rome,</hi> to which place hee did belong, (but that
hee had cloathed himſelf in a ſheeps skin, and would be thought
to bee a true ſheep, that hee might the more eaſier deceive.)
But I am ſure there are many honeſt builders, and they are
lawfully called too, and alſo that they have true materialls,
but that notwithſtanding this fox, with wolves, and certaine
beaſts of the bottomleſſe pit doe hinder them, by putting all
the parts of the materialls of the Houſe in ſuch a mixture
of confuſion, that many who have leaſt policy, cannot eaſily
finde the true piece that is to bee laid next in the building:
And ſome other of them doe know the right pieces, but will
not confeſſe which they are, becauſe they would hinder the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
builders, that ſo they may take ſome of the parts of it,
and build little caves for their owne private profit and gaine;
My paines herein, is to deſcribe the true parts of this frame,
and to lay them in order ready for thoſe that are the true
builders, and to unmaske the counterfeit builders, (or rather,
the pullers of it downe) as alſo to helpe the weake in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who can ſcarce know the right piece, or true part of
the building, becauſe the ſmoakie flame hath diſcoloured it:
I doe perſwade my ſelfe, if this could well bee done, wee
ſhould ſoone build peaceably, lovingly, and in a godly unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
though ſome peeviſhneſſe would bee ſtill amongst ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb facs="tcp:114314:4"/>
becauſe they have ſuffered ſome loſſe ſince this flame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</p>
                  <p>My endeavour is to ſhew what the Church of Chriſt in the
largeſt ſenſe, doth conſiſt of, and who ought to feed them,
and who ought to ordaine thoſe Paſtors; and where, or how
they ſhould dwell, and many particular Points that are in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt the Presbyterialiſts, and thoſe that diſſent from
them in the government of the Church, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>If you thinke mee too tart in my paſſages, I pray conſider
with me, that the government of the Church is no light fly; it is
either a great happineſſe if it be in a good frame, or a great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
if it be in confuſion, we have experience of it too much
already.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, my ſharpneſſe is not intended to any, but to thoſe that
deſerve it, to others it is not meant.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I beleeve that rationall men, and ſingle-hearted,
will not much diſſent from me in thoſe things which I have labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to prove and maintain for truth.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I am ready to receive a confutation in any thing
wherein you can with either Scripture or Reaſon confute
mee; provided, that you doe not argue againſt Scripture,
where a Babe may not onely read, but as eaſily conclude what
is truth.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, perhaps my plainneſſe in phraſe and method may
diſlike ſome that have more learning in the Tongues, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Liberall Arts to diſplay truth with, I intreat them to
note what my end is in this my paines, not to come with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of ſpeech, if I had it, I aime at truth of matter, for
it is that which we have need of in theſe times.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, I beleeve that they are the vulgar ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that have moſt need of helpe in theſe Points I treat of;
for the Learned I hope, there are not many of them that doe
<pb facs="tcp:114314:4"/>
much miſcarry in theſe things, nor will diſſent from the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialls
in them.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, if I chance to come out a ſecond time, it may hap
I may ſore higher then ſome looke for, but I would firſt
appeare to the weakeſt, for they are thoſe that the wolves
doe watch to make a prey of chiefly; therefore I would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to ſecure them, and then I paſſe very little to meet
with both Fox, Wolfe, and all the Frogs of <hi>Rome:</hi> And
ſo much I beleeve you will conclude upon, when you ſee their
skins ſo pulled about their eares, as in this Booke they lye,
if a courſe be but timely taken with them, they will rather be gone
from us, then ſtay to be ſo mangled, as here they be.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, I intreat you to bee adviſed by mee in this one
thing, eſpecially, <hi>viz.</hi> when any Point is treated upon in any
Booke, wherein the Text to prove a Doctrine by, is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
at large by the Author, but the place named by figures
onely, there take good heed leſt you (too ſoone) make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of a (ſuppoſed) truth, before you looke in the Text
it ſelfe; for many Writers doe not rehearſe the ſentence it
ſelf, but name the place, and ſo goe on in argument with it;
and many times the Reader makes a concluſion as the Author
of the booke doe conceive to bee the truth, although it bee
many times falſe; therefore it were good that all Writers
would rehearſe the ſentence of the Scripture they quote to prove
any thing by, at leaſt in a matter that is of any great weight,
as in this Book I doe. Another thing I intreat of you, which
is this, that you will read ſeriouſly, and minde onely that you
read (free from diſtraction or trouble of minde) as you read;
and read through a Point from the beginning to the end, when
you read. And when you have a Booke, whoſe matter is ſure
Divinity, and ſhort for memory, and plaine for capacity, keep
that by you to view continually.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:114314:5"/>
I intreat the Reader to accept of this my good will to doe him
good, and by his ſo doing, I ſhall bee well ſatisfied; and bee
ready in any way I may or can be able to be</p>

they divided contrary to the doctrine, which they had received (ſaith
the Text) (for in ſome caſe a man may divide, but he muſt have ſome
warrantable cauſe) but the end of this their diviſion was not to ſerve
Chriſt Jeſus, but their own bellies; (for ſo ſaith the Text) and this muſt
be done in or by ſome faire colourable demeanor, <hi>viz.</hi> good words,
and fair ſpeeches (ſaith the Text) but all this was but to deceive, (ſaith
the Apoſtle) and becauſe they could not delude the wiſe, therefore
they would tamper with the ignorant, (for ſo ſaith the Text) they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114314:6"/>
the hearts of the ſimple; from hence I note alſo, that theſe were
falſe Teachers, that did make this diviſion for their own private gain;
<hi>viz.</hi> to ſuck from the poore ſilly people, in way of pretence to teach
them the truth (for they did it to ſerve their belly.) You ſhal ſee more
of them in ſome of the next Scriptures following. The next Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
quoted, was 1 <hi>Cor 1. 10. Now I beſeech you brethren, by the name of
our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that yee all ſpeake the ſame thing, and that there be no
diviſions among you, but that you be perfectly joyned together in the ſame mind,
and in the ſame judgment.</hi> In this Scripture the Apoſtle perſwades theſe
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> from diviſion amongſt the common hearers there, (chiefly
at leaſt) and ſhewes ſome cauſe of it in them, and that was for want
of a mind and judgement well informed, and therefore they did much
contend with each other, as in the 11 verſe you may ſee. And therefore
they were partiall in reſpecting and affecting of their Teachers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
juſt cauſe; (for thoſe Preachers were ſo knowing, that they did
not differ in their judgements in thoſe things they taught) but this
was their carnality in affecting the Preacher more for his wiſdome in
words and phraſes, &amp;c. rather then for the truth of matter, (as is very
likely and cleare in the 17 verſe) for there hee ſaith he did not preach
the Goſpel with wiſdome of words, (that is, chiefly) leſt the Croſſe of
Chriſt ſhould be made of none effect. But by what hath been obſerved
here chiefly for our purpoſe, is, that there ought to have been no divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
amongſt them, ſeeing there was no cauſe; and in Chap. 3. ver. 3.
he did alſo forbid diviſions, and tells them the reaſon of it, <hi>viz.</hi> they
were carnall, and lookt upon their Teachers more then to Gods word
and working by the Miniſtery of their Preachers, as is to be ſeen in the
fifth verſe: and truly I muſt note one thing more from the words of
the third verſe, and that is this; The reaſon why men have not their
judgement better informed, is, becauſe they doe not renounce their
carnall corruptions, for the more a man deſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eth to renounce his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
the better underſtanding he ſhall have in the Word of God;
<hi>Yee are carnall,</hi> ſaid hee. But I paſſe to the two other Scriptures na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
for they are thoſe which I doe moſt intend for my (chiefe) pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
<note place="margin">The text pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the point inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, viz. not to forſake the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling, &amp;c.</note> The firſt of them is <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 24, 25. theſe are the words of the
Text, <hi>Not forſaking the aſſembling of our ſelves together, as the manner of
ſome is, &amp;c.</hi> In this verſe the Apoſtle pre-admoniſheth them to beware
that they bee not drawne away from their publick Aſſemblies in their
godly exerciſes by the examples or enticing of ſome that had already
forſaken them. By the Apoſtles expreſſion in this verſe it ſeems thoſe
that did forſake, did not ſhew forth any notorious evill ayme or end,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114314:7"/>
(for the preſent) wherefore they did forſake the aſſembling of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
together with thoſe that the Apoſtle here forewarneth, therefore
thoſe might have ſome cloſe colourable pretence, which as yet did not
breake out, but ſome evill ayme they had, for the Apoſtle noteth them
and forewarneth the reſt, <hi>Selah.</hi> Surely, it was an evill in them, (for
the Apoſtles Conſtitution was good in the government he had eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
amongſt them) it ſeemes here alſo that amongſt the Church of
God diviſions are naught, for the Apoſtle endeavours the contrary,
what ever the intent be of thoſe that forſake and divide without ſome
apparent and weighty cauſe.<note place="margin">The chief text or illuſtration</note> The next place is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 24, 25, 26. I
will name but part of the firſt verſe, and then all the reſt; theſe are
the words, <hi>God hath tempered the body together, having given more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
honour to that part which lacked, that there ſhould bee no ſchiſme in the
body; but that the members ſhould have the ſame care one of another;</hi> And
whether one member ſuffer, all the members ſuffer with it; or one
member be honoured, all the members rejoyce with it; the Apoſtle in
theſe verſes excellently alludeth to the body of a man, to ſhew the
conſtitution or frame of Chriſts myſticall body, <hi>viz.</hi> his Church on
earth, that, as the body of man conſiſts of divers members, ſo doth
the Church of Chriſt, and have their ſeverall offices of care and good
performances one unto the other, and if any member ſuffer, the reſidue
are ſenſible of its wants of proſperity; and if it bee well and health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
the reſidue of the members of the body rejoyce with it, becauſe
the honouring of one member is the honouring of the whole, (as a
gold-ring on the finger, is eſteemed an ornament to the whole body)
&amp;c. Thus it is with the myſticall body of Chriſt, (ſaith the Apoſtle
in ver. 27, 28.) they are to take care one of another, as the corporall
body of man, the which it cannot doe if it bee divided member from
member; therefore (ſaith the Apoſtle in ver. 24.) <hi>God hath tempered
the body together, &amp;c.</hi> and in ver. 25. he tells us, that the end of Gods
joyning the members together thus, is, that there ſhould be no Schiſm
in the body, but that the members ſhould have the ſame care one of
another; thus it is with the myſticall body of Chriſt, if the members
be divided, then is the body (ſpirituall) weakned, and in great imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and danger, eſpecially if many members be either lame, or quite
divided from it.<note place="margin">

Reaſons (in ſome particulars) alſo rendred by the Apoſtle in the
words of this 12 Chap. of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 24, 25, &amp; 26 verſes: Now next I am
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114314:7"/>
to perform three things which I have promiſed you, before I come to
the <hi>Goliah</hi> and his younger brethren, and of theſe three things I will
be briefe,<note place="margin">The firſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to prove that ſuch diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are naught; it eſtrangeth their affections</note> (for I long untill I come to the main ones.) The firſt is, to
ſhew by Reaſons, That diviſions in godly exerciſes of our Religion, do
occaſion great inconveniences to the Church or children of God;
Firſt, it eſtrangeth and weakeneth their affections one towards the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
this we have experience of enough already on both ſides, amongſt
us in theſe dayes: I ſhall not need to uſe many words to cauſe you to
conclude with me this truth, for by our diviſions in ſome points of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and much more in the government of the Church, and the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
ways that ſeverall perſons and Congregations ſteer; the Church is
divided or weakned in their affections.<note place="margin">2 Reaſon, it cauſeth an evil opinion of each other.</note> Secondly, by theſe diviſions
there is produced an evill opinion one of another, whereupon one is
jealous of the other, leſt the one do circumvent the other in his way,
which hee hath reſolved to walke and reſt in, (for all men in every
way in Religion, accounts his one way beſt, and therefore thinks him
not ſo good as himſelfe that differs from his wayes) whereupon (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſmal occaſions) they wil be ready to flout and ſcoffe at each other,
and to fall at length to blows perhaps too.<note place="margin">3 Reaſon, it occaſious Civil wars.</note> Thirdly, when our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are ſo weake towards each other, then Civill wars are apt to bee
amongſt us, for every one will bee jealous leſt the other would rob
him of, or divert him from that which hee accounts ſo precious in his
own way of Religion.<note place="margin">4 We are lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemy, &amp;c.</note> Fourthly, when wee be ſo much divided, then
wee are liable to be a prey to a common Enemy. Fifthly, by diviſions
(in theſe kinds) we are liable to have Teachers of divers errors, to a
farther confuſion in Religion;<note place="margin">5 Errors will hereby be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, &amp;c.</note> for the ſeverall preachers of the Word
of God, that are Preachers to ſo many ſeverall ſorts of Sects, will
bee as ſtrange to each other themſelves, ſo that they will not meet to
conferre together about Religion (or at leaſt but few together) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there are but few of many Sects, that are of good ability in
knowledge (as Preachers) and ſo they will bee the more unable to
know and preach the truth to the people.<note place="margin">6 Wee ſhall have little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of evill, &amp;c.</note> Sixthly, there will bee
little power in any to puniſh or reſtrain thoſe that are to be reſtrained
or puniſhed, becauſe the State will bee ſo divided both in opinions and
ſeverall Companies: in ſum, we ſhall be an abſolute <hi>Babel.</hi> The next
in order (which I promiſed you) is the benefit or happineſſe which
we may attaine unto by a godly unity in affection; I hope much need
not to bee ſaid of this, for all people have experience of it (unleſſe
fooles and little Infants, &amp;c.) but yet ſomething of it I will note in

deprivation of inconveniences is an injoying of happineſſe; for if
that which is evill bee taken away, there remaineth that which is
good, and ſo ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Take away the droſſe from
the ſilver, and there remaineth a veſſell for the refiner.</hi> Wee ſhall then bee
joyned in our affections to love each other, the which will have joyned
to it a good opinion of each other, and this is in holy Scripture called
the ſtaffe of Beauty; Neither ſhall we be ſo jealous of each other with
an evill ſuſpition, nor fall to blowes, nor jars, nor Civill wars. For
then we ſhall be joyned together in one, and be a ſtaffe of Bands; and
being ſo, wee ſhall the leſſe feare a Common enemy; then ſhall our
Preachers meet, adviſe, and conferre together, for to be the better able
to teach us the truth, yea, they and we ſhall bee ſo amiable to each
other, as that they will bee incouraged to watch over us with joy, and

uniformity in divine Ordinances. I hope I ſhall not need to trouble
my ſelf nor the Readers hereof with many arguments to make this
good, ſeeing we now are taught it by wofull experience, (by the want
of it) but yet I will begin with an authentick Scripture, and that is in
matter of Religion, for that is it which moſt occaſions either unity,
(if we well comply together) or diviſions, if we diſſent from others in
it, (for we eſteem that beſt, which wee think will moſt advantage us)
for men do not uſually ſtrive much for chaffe or droſſe, but for wheat,
gold, ſilver, or pearles, or ſuch like things. This Scripture is <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.
24, 25. theſe are the words, <hi>Let us conſider one another to provoke unto
love and good works, not forſaking the aſſembling of our ſelves together, as the
manner of ſome is; but exhorting one another, &amp;c.</hi> Let us, ſaid hee, (we who
are not diſunited in our way of our godly exerciſes of Religion) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
one another to love and good works; as if hee ſhould ſay, Wee
who are not divided from each other in our ways of godly exerciſes,
are not divided in our aſſemblies, whereby we may be helpfull one to
each other, in provoking each other to love, (that is, unity in affection)
and good works. And that this is the true genuall ſenſe of the verſe,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114314:8"/>
it will appeare in the next verſe, where he dehorteth them from forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the aſſembling of themſelves together, as the manner of ſome
then was. In which words you may ſee that ſome (having forſaken
the uniformity in thoſe godly exerciſes, which theſe that are here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
did perform) had forſaken their aſſemblies alſo, and therefore
had loſt this good opportunity which theſe in ver. 24. had (that is to
ſay) to provoke unto love and to good works; you may know by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
that what one man diſliketh in another, doth cauſe ſo much
the leſs love or liking in him towards that man in whom he imagineth
ſomething worthy of his diſlike; for the true proverb is, Like loveth
its like, and the more they faile in their likeneſſe, the leſſe they love:
and this holdeth in every thing that is eſteemed good, and the more
good the matter or thing is accounted by one party, and diſliked by
the other, the more will their affections of love bee abated, eſpecially
in mankinde, and much more in divine things and heavenly ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Now I come to the chiefe Maſter-piece, or <hi>Goliah</hi> with his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour-bearer:
<note place="margin">Whether wee may not attain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

attaine to this uniformity in a warrantable way, without much offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
any good conſcience, (though weake) that ſo we may attaine to
this unity of affection in godlineſſe, and thereby attaine to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
I ſpake of, both in this life and the world to come ſempiternally.
And I will name ſome points of Doctrine which thoſe that ſtand for
the Presbyteriall government (or neareſt it) doe hold and maintaine,
the which thoſe that doe diſſent from us doe oppoſe, ſome of them in
one point, and ſome of them in another point, &amp;c. the which points
are not (amongſt moſt of us) held to bee fundamentalls of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
as in truth they are not; that is to ſay, both parties (if honeſt
and true hearted in the fundamentalls) may bee ſaved without them:
(if they could hold and continue ſo to the end of their dayes, and
their ſeed alſo ſucceſſively) But thoſe things we differ in are ſuch as are
to maintain and preſerve us in thoſe fundamentalls chiefly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which we cannot long ſtand upon them, but ſhall fall off: And
theſe points doe chiefly concern the government of the Church, and
divers particulars in the demeanors or manners in the ſame;<note place="margin">The chiefe points named.</note> as alſo,
who ought to bee accounted worthy to bee eſteemed a member of the
Church, and accordingly received to be of the company and partakers
of the ordinances belonging to the Church. Therefore I will name
ſo many points, as I have heard differenced between thoſe that are for
the Presbyteriall government (or neareſt it) and their oppoſites, (and
perhaps I will inſert a few more points too) and produce what Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114314:9"/>
I can remember to cleare the truth of the points, and bring di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Reaſons for ſome points too, by which meanes many may not
pretend liberty of conſcience without juſt cauſe, and bring ruine to
the whole body ſpirituall: To name theſe points in order (ſtrictly) I
will not promiſe content to every one:<note place="margin">The firſt chiefe Point aimed at viz. who are the Church, &amp;c.</note> And firſt for the Church, <hi>viz.</hi>
Who are it: To this I anſwer, in ſtrict knowledge of it, none but
God can tell; but ſo farre as the Scriptures give us light to ſee, ſo farre
we are to conclude in a charitable eſteem, and that is thus, Thoſe that
profeſſe to be ſaved by faith in Chriſt Jeſus (according to the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls
contained in the Word of God) and are partakers of his
ordinances, and frame their lives according to his commandements.
Now herein we differ much about this latter part, the Independents
and we Presbyterialls. The Presbyterialls ſay, that there be divers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of ſanctification, which in ſome is more, and in ſome is leſſe, yea,
ſo little in ſome, as that they doe but eſchew the habituall acting
of capitall ſins in their outward demeanors to mans view, (ſo to ſpeak
comparing one ſin to another) as thoſe the Apoſtle hath laid down as
a rule for us to be guided by in this particular point now in hand, <hi>viz.</hi>
to judge and account of a fit member (in ſome degree) of a Church, as
we may ſee in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 5.<note place="margin">Theſe are without the pale of the Church.</note> 
                     <hi>No whoremonger, nor unclean perſon, nor covetous
man, which is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdome of Chriſt,
and of God.</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10. <hi>Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers,
nor effeminate, nor abuſers of themſelves with mankinde, nor theeves,
nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, nor ſuch like, ſhall
inherit the kingdome of God.</hi> But the Independents, or (as they will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be called) the Congregationall party, they hold, that except there
be a more greater and more larger or ſtricter walking in the wayes of
God, there can be no concluſion made that thoſe perſons have any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
grace in them at that time, and therefore not to bee received as
members of a Church, but that if they will be eſteemed members of the
true Church, they muſt have ſuch godly exerciſes in their families in
a more demonſtrative degree and manner, then doe appeare to bee in
them that are for the Presbyteriall government, (for the more part)
and more zealous and frequent in the exerciſes of divine ordinances,
or elſe they are not to be received as members of Chriſts myſticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
Now to decide this queſtion, I will bring divers Scriptures to
prove, that there were divers ſins, and divers ſorts of ſins both of omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and commiſſion amongſt the true beleevers, not onely in the time
of the old Teſtament, as the ſins of <hi>David</hi> a man after Gods own heart,

17. in this place Chriſt prayed for his Apoſtles, <hi>that they might be (yet

fornication and adultery, as you may ſee in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 23. to the end of
the Chapter, and ſome of the former verſes alſo; and in the eight firſt
verſes you may ſee a great fault in them, reproved by the Apoſtle, <hi>viz.</hi>
ſo great a defect of love and good will each to other, that they went
to law one againſt another, and that before the (unjuſt) unbeleevers,
yea, they themſelves did uſe fraud to each other, as in v. 8. appeareth,
and yet theſe to whom this reproof was given, were beleevers, as you
may ſee in ver. 6. By all theſe Scriptures it doth appeare, that many
(in the preſent ſtate of grace) have been charged and reproved for
many ſins and corruptions at that time when they were in the faith,

thus I prove it, When the people of Iſrael did perverſly ſinne againſt
their God, (after long inſtruction and meanes of their edification in
the will and word of God) then he did threaten them, and ſaid thus,
<hi>By men of other tongues, and ſtammering lips, will I ſpeak to this people, &amp;c.</hi>

make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou ſhalt bee dumbe, and
ſhalt not bee to them a reprover, for they are a rebellious houſe.</hi> Theſe places
are clear for this purpoſe, that God will ſend unable Teachers to a
people as a curſe to them for their ſins againſt him in time of plentiful
knowledge: and for their ſins he did at another time tell them that he
would let them have as bad Prophets in their lives and converſations,
to be evil examples for them, ſee this in <hi>Mich.</hi> 2. 11. theſe are the words,
<hi>If a man walking in the ſpirit of falſhood doe lye, ſaying, I will prophecy of
wine and ſtrong drinke, even he ſhall be the Prophet of this people;</hi> and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

to prove that, becauſe of the peoples diſobedience when they have the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114314:11"/>

curſe to them, in the ſtead of good and fit guides: And now that God
will give better Teachers of his people, when they walke obediently

in a certaine place God promiſed to ſend them Paſtors that ſhould
teach them with knowledge and underſtanding. And when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

<hi>David;</hi> thus you may ſee, that it is the love of God to us, in giving us

the leaſt) the Preachers of the Word of God ought to doe it: and the
firſt Scripture is <hi>Act. 14. 23. And when they had ordained them Elders in
every Church, and prayed with faſting, they commended them to the Lord on
whom they beleeved:</hi> for the places where they did ordaine them, you
may ſee in the end of ver. 21. If you doubt whether theſe were prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
Elders that the Apoſtles did there ordain, I muſt ſay, that it is
very likely they were: but if not, yet it makes for my point in hand, for
if it belonged unto the Apoſtles to ordain inferiour Elders, then I am
ſure you will grant me the other, <hi>viz.</hi> that they did ordain the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
Elders, I can prove it out of other Scriptures plainly, but I know
you will not oppoſe me in this. But here is another objection, and
that is this, although the Apoſtles did it, yet we are not to follow that
Rule ſtill, unleſſe we had a command left unto us, ſo to doe for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
ſucceſſively. To this I anſwer, that what the Apoſtles did then,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114314:11"/>
was for our imitation in that particular, for they did not give or leave
any other order or rule to us in the Word of God, and therefore wee
muſt ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Whatſeever was written, was written for our inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Titus was to ordaine elders for the miniſtry of the Goſpel.</note> But I will proceed to other texts, <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 5. to the end of ver. 9.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114314:12"/>
of thoſe that would have every Congregation ordaine their own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor

them) ſhould not be the ordainers of men for to bee the Preachers of
the Word of God, rather then thoſe that are more ignorant by thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of particulars in the Word of God, and ſo many honeſt men
there too: What, are they not ſo? I ſay they are, and ableſt, and honeſt
too; but put caſe, ſome ſhould be thought otherwiſe, you know that
no company of any ſort is uſually ſo intirely good, but that ſome may
be defective; what think you of your ſelves, may there not bee ſome
worſe then others? Nay, may there not be hypocrites and varlets too,
if ſo, then you every way are worſe then the learned, and therefore
every way more unfit for to ordain men to be Preachers of the Word
of God. Now a touch of one thing more, and then I will paſſe to
another point, and this is ſomewhat differing from the former, but I
will joyn them together, and that is this; The Preachers of the word
of God were ſuperintendents of other Preachers in the Apoſtles time,
and this I prove as followeth,<note place="margin">Some miniſters were ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

had received, &amp;c. from the which ſome had already then ſwarved and
turned aſide to vaine janglings, as many doe now amongſt us in theſe
dayes; and in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 14. you may read the like, theſe are thoſe
words, <hi>Charge them before the Lord, that they ſtrive not about words to no

was to be given by <hi>Timothy,</hi> are thoſe men that are deciphered in ver. 2.
of this Chapter, that is to ſay, to thoſe that were already in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
of the Goſpel, this authority the Apoſtle ſent to <hi>Timothy</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
towards thoſe Preachers, and did not ſend it unto thoſe Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
directly, this power to give the charge was ſeated in <hi>Timothy</hi> by the
authority of the Apoſtle: and truly if it may not bee ſomewhat like it
now at the leaſt, in ſome degree, we ſhall be in great danger to bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorted
upon all occaſions, though I can well wiſh that ſome choiſe
men from among the people may bee joyned with them too, in this
ſuperintendency; for it will give the people great ſatisfaction from
their feares of an unjuſt compulſion. This one thing more I will note
as the great cauſe of our diſtractions,<note place="margin">Some being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to be miniſters of the Goſpel before they are able, do much hurt.</note> yea, the greateſt of all,
(next the peoples ſins in generall) and that is the allowing of men,

if the Teacher be not well grounded in Divinity, how can hee defend

Wolves?<note place="margin">The Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt's objection againſt our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, viz. they are of the Popes order, &amp;c.</note> The next point which the Separatiſts pretend to be unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
in our Miniſters for to ordaine Preachers of the Goſpel, is,
That they are of the Popes order, and receive their owne ordinations
from him; it being firſt and primarily received of him, and therefore
(he being the maintainer of Idolatry (from whom they had their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination)
they cannot be the lawfull Preachers of the Word of God,
and therefore ought not to bee the ordainers of the Preachers of the
Goſpel. This objection is like a <hi>Remora</hi> who turns his belly upward,
(as is ſaid) opens his legs, or ſome ſuch parts of his body, &amp; claſpeth
about this goodly Ship of ours, <hi>viz</hi> the Church, to the hindering
of us from arriving pleaſingly and ſafely to our heavenly Haven. But
I will knock him off thus, firſt, you cannot prove that (if in caſe they
have their ordination from the Pope) the Pope at firſt was abſolutely
an Idolater, but that he then held the fundamentalls of the true Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
though he then was received as the univerſall head of thoſe that
ſubjected themſelves unto him: That this may appear a truth to you,
I pray you take a view of a Book called the Apology of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
written about the time of the maſſacre in <hi>France,</hi> dedicated to
the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> in which you may ſee the Canons of the Pope
and Popes at firſt, and alſo thoſe that had been made by ſucceeding
Popes ſince untill that time, and there you may obſerve that thoſe
Canons that were made by the former Popes, are ſo much different
from thoſe that have been made ſince, as that if he would hold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to thoſe firſt Canons of thoſe firſt Popes, hee muſt then renounce
his Antichriſtianity and Idolatry, and ſo joyn with us, and walk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to heaven, although it was a ſin in him to aſſume that univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
ſtile and power. But ſecondly, put caſe it had been ſo, yet this
makes little for you, for if they ſee the evill that he perſiſted in, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114314:13"/>
yet themſelves hold the fundamentall truths of the Goſpel of Chriſt,
(though perhaps tainted in ſome particulars) and ſo part from him to
hold to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> what is or may be objected againſt them for their ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
ſhal we condemn them for their forſaking the badnes of the Pope,
and adhering to the goodnes of the truth of Chriſt? God forbid; Nay,
I will ſay more in their behalf, they have converted (inſtrumentally)
many thouſands to the true faith by their Miniſtery, and built them up
in it alſo, which is a ſign that they were true Miniſters of the Goſpel
of Chriſt, and thus much the Apoſtle avoucheth in theſe words in one
of his Epiſtles, 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 2. If I am not an Apoſtle to others, yet doubtleſſe I am

things belong unto the Lord:) And alſo who are fitteſt to feed, or to
be the Preachers of the Word of God to it: and who are to ordaine
thoſe that ought to be their Preachers (at leaſt chiefly and ordinarily)
with other Points (as younger ſiſters to thoſe chief Points:) Now it
follows in the next place for me,<note place="margin">Where it is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt the Church of Chriſt ſhould dwel, or how neer to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, viz. toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> to view out a habitation for them,
<hi>viz.</hi> where it is fitteſt they ſhould dwell, or in what order, manner,
or fit accommodation they ſhould be in. I ſhall be very briefe in this,
eſpecially if I doe not meet with ſome ravening wolves in the way,
who perhaps will think that I am labouring to prevent them of their
prey. In brief thus, they ought to live neare together, both ſhepheard
and ſheep, for conveniency, that ſo in the firſt place they may have
more familiar acquaintance one with the other, thereby performing
neighbourly duties each to other, knowing thereby ſo much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
each others wants, and accordingly accommodating themſelves the

(though not in things too high for their intellectuall faculties,

accommodating themſelves in theſe outward comforts of the things

as they are able to digeſt it, (for ſome muſt have milk being babes)
and ſome (at ſome times) may be able to concoct and digeſt ſtronger

devour the flock; and theeves that would rob them of their fleeces, and
eſpecially in cold weather, <hi>viz.</hi> when they cannot well ſpare it; and
that they may the better maintain their own Paſtors or Teachers, that
ſo they may have a maintenance for themſelves and their families, and

Not like ſome that would have them live any where ſcattered abroad

or ſuch like thing, or ſome other thing in ſtead thereof; which if this
be, and be permitted long time together, they will (as perhaps ſome of

there ſtill, many of them may ſtarve, and hunger you know is a ſharp
ſauce, ſurely they muſt leave the reſt of the flock, and then that rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of the flock muſt ſtarve for want of ſpirituall food; and this wil
occaſion them to be more wicked, to the diſhonour of God, and their

or Teachers, that ſo you may not be thought to have ſilver coloured
fingers,<note place="margin">The Monſter.</note> and golden coloured hearts. But me thinks I ſpy a monſter
now appearing, ariſing out of the bottomleſſe pit, with a foxes head,
and a crocodiles heart; its heart had a dark ſuperſcription on it, hard
to be read (but that God gives ſome ſome ability in times of great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to diſcern it) but looking wiſhfully upon it, I diſcerned it to bee
anagrammatticall, and then I knew how to read it, &amp; the word was (as
I had put the letters in their due place) Covetouſneſſe; As for his head,
I did read preſently what that did portend or foreſhew, I knew there
muſt be ſubtlety, I bethought my ſelfe of this myſterie, and thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
it (ſummarily.) This Monſters heart whoſe name is Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe
(in the myſtery) doth imploy his foxes head to prevent this
fair accommodation of the Church, which I am now working with
my pen, and me thought he preſented to me an objection, to prevent my
diverting of him of his ungodly (and kingdom-deſtroying) gain;<note place="margin">The objection againſt a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall Church.</note> and
that was this as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi> you cannot prove that there is any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
that a Nationall Church is to be any where, at leaſt not now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the goſpel; Upon this me thought I ſoon underſtood his head, and
the Anagram of his heart alſo, and then I compared them together,
and eaſily and truly knew him to be one of <hi>Baalzebubs</hi> crew; and from
that concluſion I quickly drew another, and that was this, he (that is)
this Monſter, under pretence of a more purified Church, (which I wiſh
alſo (but with a true heart in the ſight of God) would in pleading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a nationall Church, overthrow parochiall Churches, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
he could never have hopes to obtaine his deſire. Then I bethought
of what I had before concluded concerning the Church of Chriſt,
what it doth conſiſt of in the largeſt ſenſe, and that is this, Thoſe that
make an open profeſſion of faith to bee ſaved by the merits of Jeſus
Chriſt, and declare it in the partaking of his ordinances, and frame
their lives accordingly, <hi>viz.</hi> do not habitually act capital ſins, though
it may ſometimes fall out (through more then ordinary temptation)
they be, as it were, overtaken now and then, as <hi>David</hi> was ſometime
one way, and others ſome another way; Theſe we are to eſteeme the
Church of God, although perhaps they may not have grace in their
hearts, nor yet be ſaved; But this is the rule that we ought to be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114314:14"/>
by, to eſteem of a ſuppoſed member of Chriſts myſticall Body,
untill hee declareth the contrary by wicked words, or more ſinfull
deeds; for ſecret things doe belong to God onely, and the ſtrict know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the heart is one of thoſe ſecrets. Thus when I had noted
againe this point, I then thought, and was fully ſatisfied, That Chriſt
hath more members amongſt us, in moſt Pariſhes, then this Monſter
did pretend, although by reaſon he hath much hindered the ſetling of
the government of the Church with us in the Presbyteriall way (or
at leaſt very neare that way.) Many for want of a good diſcipline and

adventured as a Lion (me thought) to encounter this Monſter, and I
took the way which my Saviour did in the wilderneſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<hi>Pſal. 33. 12. Bleſſed is the Nation whoſe God is the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> this was
ſpoken of the Jewes then the people of God: <hi>Gen. 22. 18. In thy ſeed
ſhall all the Nations of the earth bee bleſſed:</hi> Gen. 18. 18. <hi>All the Nations
of the earth ſhall be bleſſed in Abraham.</hi> I know ſome will not be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
fully with theſe Texts of Scripture, and I know their objections,
therefore I will produce ſome other, although I know theſe are for
the ſame purpoſe. Another Scripture ſaith, <hi>That Nations ſtall flow to
thee,</hi> viz. to Chriſt. But let us ſee what the Lord ſaith by the mouth
of his Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> chap. 55. ver. 5. theſe are the words, <hi>Thou ſhalt call
a Nation whom thou knoweſt not, and Nations that knew not thee, ſhall run
unto thee,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Nation ſhould in the more generall profeſſion em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt.</note> 
                     <hi>viz.</hi> to Chriſt; he did not mean that whole Nations ſhould,
or would run to Chriſt ſingularly generall, <hi>viz.</hi> not every particular
man or woman ſhould bee converted to Chriſt; but that the Nation
ſhould in the more generall profeſſion embrace the doctrine of Chriſt;
and many of them in truth of heart, as the Jews did at that time, when
<hi>David</hi> the kingly Prophet ſpake thoſe words now quoted out of the
<hi>33 Pſalm</hi> aforeſaid, though there be many rebellious <hi>Corahs,</hi> and other
ſinfull murmuring people and wicked tranſgreſſors amongſt theſe, as
there was amongſt thoſe Jews, as they were in the way to <hi>Canaan</hi> land
(the type of heaven.) And now me thinks this Monſter is ſtopped in
his aime and hopes; I therefore now will proceed to another Point,
as I have proved it by Reaſon and Scripture, that diviſions in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
exerciſes of our Religion, is naught and dangerous to the ſtate of
Chriſtians: And alſo that it is a great happineſſe to bee united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a warrantable uniformity in the Divine ordinances of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
Now I come to prove more particularly what ſpeciall decrees
and ordinances the Apoſtles did ordain and appoint for the Churches
of God in the Primitive time, the better to accommodate them in a

compared with chap. 16. v. 4. In ver. 23. wee may ſee the Apoſtles
and Elders, and Brethren ſent greeting to the Brethren in <hi>Antioch,</hi> in
<hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> (theſe were divers Churches;) And in ver. 29. you
may ſee what the decrees were that they had decreed for them, or at
leaſt what ſome of the decrees were, the which were for (all) thoſe
Churches. And in chap. 16. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> going through the Cities,
delivered them the decrees for to keep that were ordained of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
and Elders which were at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Here wee may ſee, that all
thoſe Cities had but one ſort of decrees, as is more then likely, for the
Apoſtles did ordain for <hi>Antioch, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> but one ſort of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
things as in ver. 28, 29. of chap. 15. doth appeare plainly; the
which <hi>Paul</hi> and the reſt delivered to thoſe in <hi>Antioch,</hi> as in ver. 30. ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth,
and afterward they came to <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> as in ver. 41. you
may ſee, and thoſe ordinances did much confirme the Churches, as
you may ſee in the laſt words of this 41. ver. aforeſaid; and in ver. 5.
of chap. 6. alſo; ſurely uniformity in the truth is a meanes of confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and unity of affection; and in 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 17. Thus ordain I in all
Churches;</hi> in this place the Apoſtle reſolves ſome queſtions to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi>
and putteth them and other Churches into one uniformity,
as is cleare by the words of the text, <hi>viz. Thus ordain I in (all) Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
and ſo in 1 <hi>Cor. 16. 1, 2. As I have given order to the Churches of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia,
even ſo doe yee;</hi> there was a uniformity in providing for the poor.
Thus we may ſee the bleſſed Apoſtle did endeavour uniformity in all
the Churches of God, I wiſh the like practice were amongſt us in theſe
dayes, <hi>viz.</hi> uniformity in godly wayes. But ſome may demand a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
if the Apoſtle did not ſometime in ſome caſes give leave to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
in caſe of Conſcience for want of true knowledge in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
<note place="margin">Some caſes of Conſcience.</note> to doe, or not doe. It's true, he did ſo, but not in thoſe
things that were of any danger to the ſtate of the Church or Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
for thoſe that were weak in knowledge for the preſent, that they
might not ſin againſt their conſcience in eating of herbs, by him that
did think he might not eat fleſh; &amp; likewiſe to celebrate ſervice to God
upon ſome ſpeciall day or dayes rather then in ſome other days, (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
that they did not doe it as having reſpect to the old types or
ſhadows) that did foreſhew the comming of Chriſt, the ſubſtance, leſt
they either be intangled with juſtification by works, or elſe in ſtead of
relying on the true Chriſt already come, ſhould (as the Jews do now)
look for a Jeſus to come, as hee is already come: But this liberty the
Apoſtle did not confirm to be as a law alwayes for them to reſt on, as
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:114314:15"/>
not to ſeek for better aſſurance of knowledge therein, for hee at that
time did ſhew the very legs of that ſtatue, in theſe words, <hi>viz. He that
eateth herbes is weake,</hi> and ſo ſaid he of him that ſhould bee opinionated
about the obſervation of a day; Not that which before was to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
as a type, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 10. but that we may ſet apart ſome days more
eſpecially then others for divine exerciſes, for the Apoſtle had done ſo

16. 2. and as you may perceive by their uſuall meeting upon the Lords
day, and other dayes ſo often ſpoken of in the Scriptures. But what
is all this to thoſe things that are now in theſe our dayes ſo much
pleaded for? Alas, thoſe things were but flea-bitings, to them that
ſome would have now adayes; ſhall we give way to ſuch things as are

give toleration in ſuch great matters; this is the ſtaffe of Bands, the
which if it be broke, I am ſure the other ſtaffe called Beauty, wil ſoon
be all to ſhivers. If all that plead tenderneſſe of conſcience may have
liberty as they deſire, every one that is without grace will take up that
plea; Do you not think that a very varlet, or peeviſh, or perverſe man,
out of a malignant diſpoſition will plead liberty of conſcience to act

thoſe he confeſſeth to be truth, and ſenſible too, and thus remaineth a

his own conſcience, and ought to be dealt withall by force, for he hath
an obſtinate or malignant ſpirit; and you may know, that after a man

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114314:17"/>
led <hi>Antinomians:</hi> I ſhall pitch upon Scripture to confute theſe, who
hold this curſed Tenet; I told you that the laſt Monſter (as I
thought) did ariſe out of the bottomleſſe pit from <hi>Baalzebub,</hi> but I
think this is that old Dragon himſelf; nevertheleſſe I beleeve, ſome
honeſt people might be intangled in this error alſo, becauſe this hath
been a time of difference, in many things among the learned; The
firſt Scripture is, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 20. compared with ver. 24. In ver. 20. you
may ſee, that the Jewes that were beleevers were zealous of the Law;
and in ver. 21. you may eaſily collect, that they ſtill obſerved the old
Ceremonial rites and cuſtomes from which <hi>Paul</hi> did diſſwade them in
teaching; but in ver. 24. you may ſee it clearly, that <hi>Paul</hi> obſerved the
old morall Law ſtill, for there you may perceive that ſome had given
a falſe information of <hi>Pauls</hi> not obſerving the Law, (as is very likely)
the which is by thoſe Jewes mentioned in this verſe, and confeſſed to
be an untruth, being now better informed, for theſe are the words of
the Text, at the latter end of it, <hi>All may know that theſe things whereof
they were informed concerning thee, are nothing, but that then thy ſelf alſo
walkeſt orderly, and keepeſt the Law.</hi> Now <hi>Paul</hi> had alwayes preached
down the Ceremoniall Law: that were but types and figures of Chriſt,
&amp;c. therefore it was the Morall Law: and truly, why not to be obſerved
by us under the Goſpel, as well as by the beleevers before Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
in the fleſh? provided we obſerve it but as thoſe beleevers did, for
they uſed it but as a guide to live honeſtly by, for <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and
all the ſervants of God recorded in the Scriptures of truth are ſaid to
be juſtified by faith, and therefore God commanded the Jewes that
were beleevers in the promiſe of everlaſting life, by faith in Chriſt, in
the time of the Prophet <hi>Malachi,</hi> to remember the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
which he had commanded in <hi>Horeb;</hi> theſe are the words of that text,
<hi>Remember yee the law of Moſes which I commanded him in Horeb for all
Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> &amp; Rom. 7. 14. <hi>We know the Law is ſpirituall,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
there, <hi>viz.</hi> it is ſuitable to the pure Spirit of God, by the which
our Spirits ſhould be qualified and guided to thoughts, words, and
deeds, and therefore in <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 17, 18. our Saviour Chriſt forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
us to have ſo much as a thought, that the Law or the Prophets
ſhould be deſtroyed, but ſhall continue till all things be fulfilled, (and
that will not be till heaven and earth be paſſed away, &amp;c.) Now that
he meant the written Law in this Text is plaine, for the words are,
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntill heaven and earth paſſe,</hi> the Law ſhall not paſſe; But if hee had
meant the Law onely written in the hearts of the godly, darkly, (for
ſo it is but darkly in the beſt) then he would not have ſaid, till heaven
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:114314:17"/>
and earth paſſe; for the Law ſpirituall in the hearts of thoſe that are
to be ſaved ſhall be more perfect in them for evermore. And beſide, to
put you out of all doubt, ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 21. where <hi>Paul</hi> confeſſeth inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly,
That <hi>hee was then under the Law to Christ,</hi> even then when hee
was a beleever in Chriſt for ſalvation; yea, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 22. hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
hee <hi>did delight in the law of God, after the inner man,</hi> but even then
there were ſome that did ſlander him in this very point, (as is more
then likely) as you may eaſily perceive in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 31. by his ſpeech
there as by way of vindication; the words are theſe, <hi>Doe we then make
void the Law through faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God forbid, yea, we eſtabliſh the Law;</hi> thus you
may ſee that he did not null the Moral Law, by his preaching of faith,
nor yet by his beleeving it, therefore O yee <hi>Antinomians</hi> deteſt your
curſed Tenet, for the beſt of us doe ſee our ſins but dimly in our ſelves;
and although the more a man is ſanctified the more hee can diſcerne
the remnants of his ſins in him, yet he cannot ſee them all: And you
know the leſſe a man is ſanctified, the darker he is in his judgement in
the knowledge of ſin; to ſpeak plainly thus, we have all (even the
beſt of us) need of a guide, for God hath ordained outward meanes,
as well as inward, for the edifying of his Saints; And if we retain the
Law for a looking-glaſſe to ſhew us our deformities, and not to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
by it, what hurt then is there in the retaining it? It is to us not
a curſe but a bleſſing; but if we reject it, and caſt it off from uſing it, I
am ſure we ſhall thereby procure not a bleſſing but a curſe, therefore
beware leſt you have unawares admitted of ſome Jeſuiticall ſpirits. I
will note one thing more out of that in <hi>Mat. 5. 17. viz.</hi> that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
joynes the Law and the Prophets together, and ſaith, <hi>That he was
not come to deſtroy the Law or the Prophets;</hi> why will you underſtand one
of them in the ſpirituall ſenſe onely, and the other in the literall onely?
for I hope you will all conclude, that he ſpake of the Prophets in the
literall ſenſe, that their propheſies that are written ſhall laſt no longer
then the end of the world; therefore it is the Law alſo that is written

him, remembring what (as it is ſaid) a champion once did with a ſpear

Iſrael ſhall heare and feare;</hi> and in <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 26, 27, 28. you may ſee that
<hi>Moſes</hi> called a hoſt of men to put Idolaters to death, (for thoſe Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were many at that time) they had a Calfe-god made of gold; and
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 15. whoſoever would not ſeek the Lord God of Iſrael,
was to be put to death, (by a covenant which they then made) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they had the uſe of the Magiſtrate at that time alſo: And ſurely
a compulſive law to make people come to the ordinances of God (in a
kingdom where there is a power ſeated in the Magiſtrate, hereditary, or
otherwiſe (among a people, eſpecially that do profeſs the Religion of
God, as theſe in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> did) ought ſo much the more to be uſed &amp; put
in execution, as thoſe laws were in the time of <hi>Aſa,</hi> as in the place before
quoted; &amp; ſo much you may eaſily conclude from that of our Saviour,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 14. beginning at v. 16. and ſo forward to the end of v. 24. for the
Jewes being invited to the great Supper, made light of it; for which
cauſe they were rejected of the King, <hi>viz</hi> God the Father; upon which
rejection we Gentiles were, and are invited, and in caſe we be unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to come to the Supper, the ſervants have power put into their
hands to compell men to come into this Feaſt, (that is to ſay) the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Calfe;<note place="margin">Compelling men to heare the Word of God.</note> for theſe are the words of the text, <hi>Go out into the high wayes
and hedges, and compell them to come in, that my houſe may bee filled, viz.</hi>
that they may partake of the ordinances of ſalvation, and yet all theſe
had not on the wedding garment, as another of the Evangeliſts infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
us, there was no ſtrict choyce to bee made of all that mixt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
that were in the high-ways and hedges (at firſt) before they were
partakers of the ordinances of God, (ſo to ſpeak in the ſpiritual ſenſe.)
If any object, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 19 made a ſeparation, and therfore
we may alſo ſeparate from them, and not puniſh. I anſwer, that <hi>Paul</hi>
had no power to compel the unbeleevers to ſubmit themſelves to him,
neither had he power to puniſh them for any fault, for hee, and thoſe
that were then converted had not the lawfull power of ſuperiority;
but if the principal powers of that People had been beleevers, then
they might have puniſhed the people for not obeying their commands
in matters of the goſpel, as well as they then would have done it for
any other miſdemenor, neither would the Apoſtle have forbad them;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:114314:19"/>
But when a man comes into a ſtrange place, he may not exerciſe any
authority of ſuperiority, it belongs to the Magiſtrate, and if the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
or Magiſtrates, (in whom the power is ſeated, together with
the chief part of the people) will not comply with the goſpel of God,
nor be favourable to the beleevers in Chriſt, but oppoſe, and be inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to the Profeſſors of ſalvation by faith in Chriſt, then may the
Saints ſeparate from the unbeleevers; and we may ſee in the booke of
<hi>Nehemiah,</hi> ch. 13. v. 25. that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did not onely curſe the Jewes
with the curſe of God, (that is, wiſhed them ſome puniſhment) but
he alſo ſmote them, and plucked off their haire, &amp;c. If we were but ſo
wiſe, as to note the end wherefore puniſhment was ordained and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by God, to be exerciſed upon the bodies of men, (for the more
part) we might ſoon ſee more clearly then blinde men doe; for theſe
are the words at the ends of many Texts of the holy Scriptures, <hi>viz.
All Iſrael ſhall heare and feare, and doe no more ſo:</hi> And again, <hi>So ſhall
you put away evill from among you.</hi> But I wiſh with my heart and ſoule,
that our puniſhing or afflicting were ſuch as God appointed by <hi>Moſes,</hi>
at leaſt, in moſt particulars; Corporall puniſhment was then the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God (moſt ordinarily) and that without reſpect of perſons,
or very little favour to thoſe that were higher then others, (amongſt
thoſe that were under the King:) ſurely men would more feare and be
aſhamed of bodily puniſhment, then of Purſe-puniſhment, for he that
hath this worlds goods, maketh very light of paying a competent ſum
of Mony for his offence; but if (as God commanded) they might bee
otherwiſe afflicted, <hi>viz.</hi> on their bodies, without much partiality, they
would forſake their ſins ſooner; But this would then hinder the filling
of many Purſes, &amp; therefore me thinks I hear their owners crying out
againſt me: but if this were amended, I hope many that would have
now no Civill Magiſtrates, would then eaſily conclude with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and yeeld obedience to Principality and Powers, as in
<hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 1. &amp; <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1, 2. and if they will not bee a terror to good
works, but to the evill workers, and will bee protectors of thoſe that
doe well, then I hope many will obey for conſcience ſake, as in ver. 3,
4, 5. O that all had hearts to ſay with me this truth. <hi>Amen.</hi>

from joyning in a uniformity in the government of the <hi>Church,</hi>
is the Images, Pictures, yea, and the monuments of Idolatry, becauſe
they are not more fully taken away, the which cauſeth them to doubt,
that Idolatry will increaſe in this our Kingdome again, ere long time
be. But for this, I will anſwer them thus, the Parliament hath made
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:114314:19"/>
a good progreſſe already againſt them, and therefore I hope well for
time to come, that there will be ſome farther progreſſe in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
and for my part I will willingly joyne with you in this point,
and I hope to produce clear Scriptures for it too, for unleſſe we have
a ſpeciall care to keep Idolatry out, I know the wrath of God will fall
upon us, for that is the ſin which our Saviour Chriſt himſelfe did ſay
would bring deſolation: My firſt Scripture, is <hi>Deut. 7. 25. Burn the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
covet not the ſilver nor gold that is upon them, &amp;c.</hi> And Chap. 9. 21.
<hi>Moſes burnt the golden Calfe with fire, and ſtamped him, and ground him
ſmall even to duſt, and caſt the duſt thereof into the River, and made the
people drinke it,</hi> (in a holy indignation againſt them, and the golden
Calfe, as you may ſee in <hi>Exod. 32. 20.)</hi> And in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18. 4. was the like
zeale of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> in breaking in pieces the brazen Serpent, the which
was ſet up for a good uſe and end at the firſt, (but that the people
had afterwards Idolatrized to it, and therefore it was broken, to take
away, or cut off the occaſion of Idolatry in future time:) And he called
it <hi>Nehuſhtan, viz.</hi> a piece of braſſe, in way of deteſtation, &amp;c. ſo that we
ſhall wel enough agree herein, and I hope all honeſt men wil ſay <hi>Amen</hi>
to this; for ſee <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43. 7, 8, 9. and there alſo you may learne, that
God would not be appeaſed towards thoſe Jews, unleſſe the carkaſſes
of thoſe Kings that had been Idolaters were taken away, which then
lay there as Monuments, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Another Point which thoſe that divided from us are afraid of very
much,<note place="margin">Idolatrous Marriages, &amp;c.</note> is this, <hi>viz.</hi> leſt Idolatry be occaſioned to be in this Kingdom,
by reaſon of the permitting of Idolaters to live amongſt us; and ſome
peoples marrying with thoſe that are Idolaters;<note place="margin">The permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Idolaters to live with us, doth offend Sectaries; and that is no fault in them.</note> and truly that is
ſome cauſe to be feared: yet wee have good grounds of hope to the
contrary too, for much is amended in this kinde already, we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a farther care will be taken herein, by the chiefe eyes of this our
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> for it is a dangerous ſin, as we may prove by Scripture and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
too: We will produce them as followeth, the firſt is <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.
12, 13, 14, 15, 16. in this place you may ſee that the Parents of thoſe
people there mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> the Jewes, might not take the daughters
of the Idolaters, (that were Idolaters) to be their ſons wives, nor give
their daughters to be wives to their ſons, as you may ſee in <hi>Deut. 7. 3,
4.</hi> And therefore thoſe were to be drove out of the Land from the
people of God, as you may ſee in <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 31, 32, 33. But the people
would not doe as God had commanded them, but mixed themſelves
amongſt them, and (too ſoon) learned their works, as you may ſee in
<hi>Numb.</hi> 25. 2, 3, 4. And the Lord was ſo fiercely angry with them for
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114314:20"/>
this their ſo doing, that hee ſpake to <hi>Moſes</hi> to take the heads of thoſe
people, and hang them up againſt the Sun, that the fierce anger of the
Lord might be turned away from <hi>Iſrael;</hi> I pray you ſee the place. And
by this their mixing with them they learned their works, as you may
ſee in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 34, 35, 36. And <hi>Ahab</hi> was forwarded in idolatry, by
marrying of a daughter of a <hi>Zidonian</hi> king, for which cauſe the Lord
ſent a ſore famine, as you may ſee in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16. 30, 31. It is ſuch a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching
ſin, that even wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf was led and occaſioned to
it by ſuch marriage, as you may ſee in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 1. 2, 3, 4. and therefore
he loſt ten Tribes of his kingdom from his ſon afterwards for it. Thus
we ſee how prevalent a thing it is to be mixed with idolaters, but more
eſpecially to have a wife lie in his boſome that is an Idolater; and ſee
what ſeverity <hi>Nehemiah</hi> uſed to the Jews in his time for this ſin, even
for ſuch marriages; he did ſeparate them again, and pulled them by
the haire, and ſmote them for it alſo, even for this their ſinne, as in
<hi>Nehem.</hi> 13. 23. to the end of that chapter. Doubtleſſe his heart cannot
be right with God, that liketh Idolaters no worſe, then to take of
them to be his boſome friend, and eſpecially in marriage; And Popiſh
Idolaters are worſe then thoſe; If any will ſay that the Papiſts are not
Idolaters:<note place="margin">Papiſts are Idolaters.</note> To this I anſwer, they are worſe then many other Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
and thus I cloſe againſt them: Firſt, their Images are Idols, which
they bow unto, and therefore their Worſhip is idolatry, ſee 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
33. 7. If they ſay they doe not worſhip the Image, but that they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
God by that Image; I ſay they lie: 1 They cannot make a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of God. And 2 they cannot prove that ever God commanded
any ſuch manner of Worſhip. 3 God hath forbid the making of ſuch
Images throughout the holy Scriptures, but hath commanded his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to break them down; and if you look in <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1. 5. you may ſee
the Jews had intended ſome ſuch hodge-podge, for they worſhip the
Lord, and yet they would ſweare by their <hi>Malchom</hi> too; and you may
read, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 41. that the Iſraelites at that time are ſaid to feare the
Lord, and yet they then ſerved their Images too, where you may ſee
clearly, that thoſe Jews pretended to worſhip God by way of thoſe
Images; and this is juſt ſo as our Papiſts do plead for their Idolatrous
Worſhip, or Worſhip by Images; and ſo in many places in that chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
aforeſaid are the like paſſages: Where you may ſee alſo, that the
Lord threatens them for it; yea, thoſe in <hi>Zephany</hi> 1. aforeſaid, are
threatened to be cut off, as in the former part of that firſt chapter you
may ſee, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. God forbad the making of any reſemblance of him,
and tells them by <hi>Moſes,</hi> that they ſaw no manner of ſimilitude, in the

and ſo become a worſhipper of the Image it ſelf: and truly it is
the onely way to become an Idolater: Firſt, to invent a ſimilitude of
God, and make it accordingly; and then worſhip God by it; and
after that to worſhip and adore the thing it ſelfe;<note place="margin">How Idolatry came into the world, as hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reports.</note> and Hiſtory doth
declare thus much to us, as we may read in the book of <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> chap.
14. ver. 12, 13, 14. to the end of ver. 20. Now if we have cauſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of Idolaters, then much more of Popiſh Idolaters, for they are
more dangerous then thoſe former Idolaters were, for theſe do more
perſecute the true Servants of God, then thoſe Idolaters did; theſe
profeſſe they do God good ſervice in ſlaying of us the true Servants of
God, as our Saviour foretold, and we always have found it to be true,
by all their treacherous and murtherous plots; yea, they are ſo much
the more dangerous, becauſe (that although they call themſelves
Chriſtians in way of diſſimulation) they call us Hereticks,<note place="margin">The Papiſts call us Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</note> and our
Religion Hereſie too; and therefore wee ought to bee more wary of
them, then of other Idolaters, for all the Devils in hell cannot deviſe
a more dangerous People and Religion then they, and theirs is, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is good to lay out ſome of their Tenets, by the which we may
ſee them the more clearly to bee the Doctrine of Devills, leading to
damnation.</p>
                  <p>And thus I do begin briefly,<note place="margin">The Popes tenets, or ſome of them.</note> They hold that there is a Purgatory,
or a place to purge us of our ſins, after this life, ſo that if wee bee not
the true ſervants &amp; children of God in this life, yet notwithſtanding
we may be there made capable of everlaſting ſalvation in heaven: the
which will nouriſh all men in ſin that ſo beleeveth; for if men be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
that there is another place after their death to prepare them
for heaven, then they will live here as they liſt, and ſo be damned:
But to what end is the doctrine of faith and ſanctification ſo much
preached in this life, both by the Prophets, our Saviour, his Apoſtles,
and ſucceeding Miniſters; And why is <hi>Dives</hi> complaining in hell,
(ſo to ſpeak) if this be a truth; Thoſe that are not converted in this
life, ſhall not be acknowledged by Chriſt after this life ended, he will
then ſay to them, <hi>Goe yee curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil
and his Angels.</hi> Secondly, that Images of God and Saints are to bee
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:114314:21"/>
worſhipped. Thirdly, that prayers to Saints departed are to be made,
and their interceſſion to be required. Fourthly, that there is a propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory
Sacrifice to be offered daily in the Maſſe for the ſinnes of the
quick and dead. Fifthly, that a man may merit heaven by his good
works. Sixthly, that it is a mortall ſin to read the Scripture, (but by
the Popes diſpenſation.) Seventhly, that their Clergy ought to preach
in an unknown tongue. Eightly, that if the Pope do pronounce a man
to be a Saint, he then is one, and muſt be ſo. Ninthly, that there is a
vertue in their water with which they baptize their infants, that doth
conjure the evill ſpirits out of them, putting oyle upon them, and ſalt

judgement or decrees. 11 That the Laity are not to drink the blood

God the Son ſometimes like a Lambe, &amp;c. they may as well make
a Rock, a braſen Serpent, a Pillar in a Cloud, &amp;c. 15 They reſemble

Cakes to the Picture of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and worſhip it. 18 <hi>Bonaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
hath transformed the Pſalter of <hi>David,</hi> to the honor of the Virgin
<hi>Mary,</hi> changing God into Goddeſſe, and Lord into Lady, and where
it is ſaid by <hi>David,</hi> Praiſe the Lord, by him it is ſaid, Praiſe the Lady;
and for, truſt in the Lord, truſt in the Lady; and in his 35 <hi>Pſalm</hi> are
theſe words, Incline the countenance of God upon us, and compell
him to have mercy upon us. 19 <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affirmed, that if the Pope
did erre, commanding vice, forbidding vertue, the Church ſhould bee
bound to believe vice to be good, and vertue to bee evill, except ſhee
would ſin againſt conſcience. 20 They offer incenſe to the Saints in
generall, and pray unto them, and ſweare by them. 21 The <hi>Roman</hi>
Church maintaineth that the merits, interceſſion, and blood of the
Saints and Martyrs, are mixed as ſatisfactory with the blood, merits,
and interceſſion of Chriſt: O horrid blaſphemy! 22 They baptize
Bels and Ships. 23 They bleſſe Holy water, (as they call it, and ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle
it upon Men and Beaſts upon St. <hi>Anthonies</hi> day, (as they call it) and
on all the horſes and beaſts in the Countrey, (as ſome that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted

from their Religion affirm) whereby the Monks get abundance
of mony to maintain them in their baſe knavery and idleneſſe a long
time afterward. 24 They allow inceſtuous marriages, contrary to
the fourth Commandement. 25 They deny concupiſcence to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
ſin after Baptiſme, as if in any article of time it might bee ſaid of
man, that he is without ſin. 26 (Notwithſtanding all theſe blaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

                  <p>Now appeareth another point unto me ready for its taggs,<note place="margin">The Lords prayer.</note> ſent to me
as from a meſſenger of heaven, bemoaning and lamenting in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of the Lords Prayer, ſanctified with his own lips. And truly this
almoſt affrighted me. And I wondered what Beaſt (amongſt thoſe in
the Apocalyps mentioned) this was, that ſent forth ſuch a ſmoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
ſulphurous favour. At length, I thought I had eſpyed two kinds
of creatures; and the one me thought was a ſubtle Jeſuite in an honeſt
mans habit, who ſeeing an honeſt man willing and forward to run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from <hi>Rome,</hi> and that they had but a weak judgment, (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
might run too farre) hee therefore fluttering with the invented
wings of either <hi>Dedalus,</hi> or the wings of his ſon <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>arus)</hi> beat the wind
ſo cloſe to their backs as they ran, that they were too far gone of a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,
and were almoſt in the Red Sea before they were aware of it,
and were like to have been drowned in their own bloud. And then I
was well perſwaded in my minde concerning this Beaſt, and knew hee
was one of <hi>Romes</hi> croaking Frogs: But as for the other, me thought
he had ſome goodneſſe in him indeed, but yet hee had ſome malignity
and peeviſhneſſe in him againſt thoſe that had abuſed the Formes of
prayer before, (for there is ſome malignity in ſome of thoſe that are in
the moſt right way) and ſo he helped forward this diſtemper. I ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus where the diſtemper lay, did reſolve to walke in the middle
way of truth, that ſo I might guide the ſimple, and ſettle him in the
truth, and ſend the croaking Frog to his home at <hi>Rome;</hi> and thus
I began to argue; Firſt, that a Form of prayer of it ſelfe, being the
Word of God, muſt needs be good. Secondly, that a man may pray
to God in the words of that Form; for though ſome doe but babble
in a Form, yet you may not conclude that all are babblers that uſe a
Form, for then you will condemn our Saviour, for hee uſed a Form
two or three times together a little before his death; and the Pſalms
of <hi>David</hi> were penned for praiſes to God for ſome mercies before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and were to be ſung afterwards to Gods glory; this you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deny I am ſure. And if you ſay, men do now but ſpeak the words
of it; and therefore if they were debarred of them, then they would
pray in the Spirit, (if they have any ſaving grace in them.) To this I
anſwer in the firſt place,<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 15.</note> with the words of St. <hi>Paul, To the pure, all
things are pure, but</hi> to the contrary party <hi>nothing is pure, for their
mindes and conſciences are defiled;</hi> the meaning is this, That thoſe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:114314:23"/>
that have honeſt hearts, will honeſtly make uſe of honeſt things. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
if you would utterly deprive all ſorts of a Form of prayer, how
then ſhall ignorant youths, and little young maids pray? nay, many
times old men are but new converts, and what will you have them do?
If they uſe many words in a prayer, they will too ſoon ask they know
not what, like the mother of <hi>Zebedees</hi> children; yea, they (being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant)
will preſently in their pride of Spirit think themſelves fit to fit
at the elbows of Chriſt in heaven, (for they will think they are fitter
for the place then <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Aaron;)</hi> ſurely it were ſafer for ſuch to uſe
that Form which God taught the people in the time of <hi>Moſes, Deut.
28.</hi> it was to them a Form, <hi>viz. Amen.</hi> But if you can pray knowing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
then poure out your hearts to God according to true knowledge:
But I have heard ſome pray, or ſay many words, and but little matter,
but chiefly it was tautologie, and often repeating the ſame words, and
could not proceed farther, and thought themſelves highly gifted too;
therefore take heed of ſpirituall pride, judge of your abilities with a
ſingle eye. I know ſome that have applauded a Miniſter for making
ſuch an admirable prayer, as none near him was to be compared unto
him, but it was the ſillyeſt tautologie, that I was aſhamed to heare it.
Doe you think in your conſcience, that if you were taught in a Form
to ask for a hundred pounds of ſome that are both able and willing to
give it; and alſo you wanted bread to put in your belly, (being hungry
and empty) that then you could not ask in that Forme? yes, I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
you; therefore beware of ſpirituall pride. But now having thus a
little prepared you (as I hope) for ſome ſure inſtruction, I now come
more home to you, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 1. you may ſee that our Saviour taught
his Diſciples a Form of prayer, (they not knowing how to pray, as it
ſeems (unleſſe ſome ſhort prayer, as at ſome other times they did, as in
theſe words, <hi>Lord increaſe our Faith, &amp;c.)</hi> in theſe words, <hi>When ye pray
ſay, Our Father which art in heaven, &amp;c.</hi> here you may ſee that they
were to uſe the words that he taught them. And although <hi>Luke</hi> hath
it in this manner, <hi>Pray you,</hi> that's nothing to overthrow this Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt,
for both wayes are lawfull; nay, God ſometime did bid the Jews
that they ſhould take unto them words, and come to him in prayer,
and taught them a Form of words too by the Prophet <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſea,</hi> 14. 2, 3.
theſe are the words, <hi>Take unto you words, and turn to the Lord; ſay unto
him, Take away all iniquitie, and receive us graciouſly, ſo will wee render
the calves of our lips; Aſhur ſhall not ſave us, we will not rid: upon horſes; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will we ſay any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our Gods, for in thee
the fatherleſſe findeth mercy.</hi> All this Form of Prayer the Lord taught the

people by the Prophet <hi>Hoſea:</hi> And <hi>Col. 3. 16. Let the word of Chriſt dwell
in you richly in all wiſdome, teaching and admoniſhing one another in Pſalms,
hymnes, and ſpirituall ſongs, ſinging with grace in your hearts to the Lord,
&amp;c.</hi> He did not here mean (in this place) any new Pſalmes or hymnes,
for he bad them admoniſh each other in thoſe Pſalmes and hymnes;
therefore thoſe Pſalmes and hymnes were then Canonicall: although
I could wiſh that upon ſome occaſion, (were it not for ſtartling the
weak in knowledge) that ſome Preacher that were a ſolid man, would
frame a Pſalm for that ſpeciall occaſion, (for he that can make a prayer
according to the Word, is able alſo to make a Pſalm) but this I think
would be inconvenient; but this is fit to bee done, <hi>viz.</hi> the Preacher
himſelf ſhould fit a Pſalme out of the Book of Pſalmes for the ſeverall
occaſions, and ſuitable to his Sermon. And thus much for this point
alſo, with this concluſion:</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Now ſince we had no Prayer-booke,</l>
                     <l>The Sabbath afternoons;</l>

                  </lg>
                  <p>And now me thinketh I ſee another ſtand by,<note place="margin">Of Muſicke.</note> with a queſtion in his
mouth; (for theſe times are fraught with them now) And this is it,
<hi>viz.</hi> How if Pipes and Organs ſhould chance to be put upon us againe,
as they were before the Parliament begun, will not that bee Idolatry
thinke you? and if ſo, then I hope you will graunt us a warrant to
run out of the Church? To this I anſwer, Firſt, what is lawfull in it
ſelfe is one thing, and what is an inconvenience, is another thing;
therefore ye ought to be informed well in your judgement before you
bee too forward to make a concluſion. Firſt, if in it ſelfe it be Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
now, what was it all that time, when God himſelf in <hi>Davids</hi> time
allowed it, in the praiſes of his people? If you ſay that the Pope uſeth
it to his Idols, and therefore it is Idolatry. I anſwer, ſo did the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
very likely; And beſides, if that be it by the which you would ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a concluſion, <hi>viz.</hi> that becauſe the Papiſts uſe it, therefore we may
not uſe it, then may not we ſing unto the true God becauſe the Papiſts
ſing unto their Idols, (for ſinging is melody) therefore this your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is of no validity. But here is another queſtion put to mee, and
this is the maine one, <hi>viz.</hi> In the time of the old Law it was lawfull,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:114314:24"/>
but is not now, it being not now commanded, therefore it is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
To this I anſwer, briefly: if you conſider the end wherefore it
was at the firſt allowed, you may eaſily make concluſion. The end
why it was firſt allowed was this, to occaſion joyfulneſſe or chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in the uſers and hearers of it, that ſo they might praiſe God with
the more lively affections, (for all know it is an outward occaſion of
naturall joy;) and the Word of God being then uſed with it, <hi>viz.</hi> in
Pſalmes or hymnes, doe turn the uſe of it (by the operation of Gods
Spirit) to the more hearty praiſing of God. Secondly, to your que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
more fully, that is, becauſe it is not commanded by the Apoſtles,
therefore it is not now lawfull for us to uſe it in the praiſes of God.
Why, the Apoſtles would have us to uſe all meanes poſſible to inable
us to praiſe God the more chearfully: But (ſaith ſome) ſome doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the melody more then the matter they ſing, or God to whom
they ſing. To this I anſwer, ſo without all queſtion doe ſome that
ſing without Muſicke, and have no devotion to God. Therefore
the Apoſtles concluſion muſt bee ours, <hi>viz.</hi> to the pure, all good
things are pure, but to them that are otherwiſe is no good thing pure.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, But the Parliament hath forbid it now, and therefore it
is unlawfull. I doe anſwer, that many things at this time are forborn
for divers reaſons. Firſt, it is (and eſpecially hath lately been) a time
of mourning, yea, to mourne with ſorrowfull hearts, rather then joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
hearts, although wee bee godly diſpoſed at that time, (for you
know in the time of <hi>David</hi> muſick was not uſed, when they faſted
to God, and were humbled for ſome puniſhment that then was upon
them.) Secondly, it might be forbid by the Parliament to ſatisfie the
People who are weake in their judgement and thought every thing
was Popery or Idolatry, becauſe ſome did begin to leave that way,
and then it ought to be taken away for the preſent. Thirdly, becauſe
the People were addicted to Idolatry, (many of them) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it ought to bee taken away. For the Braſen Serpent that was
ſet up (at firſt) for good uſe, was taken downe, yea, and broken in
pieces, in way of deteſtation and called a piece of Braſſe, when the
people had idolatrized to it; But this ſhall be my concluſion, it is no
great matter whether it be or bee not, and ſo I end this Point, with a
generall reaſon why I have treated thus much in it, which is this, I
would gladly learn the Reader hereof, to make ſome diſtinctions; for,
for want of this, many miſchiefs are amongſt us; and the Leaders of
the Sectaries, either cannot or will not doe it: what the Reaſons are
I leave to you, to be guided by ſome of thoſe I mentioned in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:114314:24"/>
points, <hi>viz.</hi> policy. But now I will ſet to your view ſome Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to you to pitch your judgement on more clearely, both out of
the Old and New Teſtament: firſt in <hi>Exod. 15. 20. Miriam</hi> the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe
did praiſe the Lord with inſtruments of muſick. <hi>Judg.</hi> 11. 34, 35.
There you may ſee <hi>Jephthah</hi>'s daughter did it too. <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. 19, 20, 21.
There was a feaſt at <hi>Shiloh</hi> yearly, <hi>a feaſt of the Lord,</hi> (ſaith the Text)
and the daughters of <hi>Shiloh</hi> did uſe to dance there at that feaſt. <hi>Pſal.

with the tymbrell and harpe:</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 150. &amp; <hi>Pſal. 33. 2, 3, 4. Pſal.</hi> 108.
1, 2. And I will end with that in the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> chap. 14. v. 2, 3.
and I pray conſider of it; theſe are the words, <hi>I heard the voice of harpers,
harping with their harps, and they ſung, as it were, a new ſong before the
Throne, &amp;c.</hi> And Chap. 15. 2. 3. <hi>Theſe are the words of thoſe that had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the victory over the Beaſt, They had harps of God,</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>and
they ſang the ſong of Moſes the ſervant of God, and the ſong of the Lamb, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Great and marvailous are thy workes Lord God Almighty, juſt and true
are thy wayes, thou King of Saints.</hi> And thus much for this point.</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Some have ſuch tender ſculls, they'l dye with little haile;</l>
                     <l>As goſlings tender be, alas what doe they aile?</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>And now I deſire to know wherein the difference lyeth betwixt
thoſe that ſtand for the Presbyteriall government, and thoſe that ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from them, by reaſon of thoſe things contained in thoſe Points
thus lately treated of; and conſequently why we may not joyn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Presbyteriall government.</p>
                  <p>And now I come to the firſt of the laſt three things I promiſed to
touch,<note place="margin">Signes to ſhew whether party is the beſt in their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> and that is to anſwer ſome of the Sectaries to ſome things
which they affirm of themſelves, concerning their converſation, that
they are the moſt godly people in their lives and converſations, and
therefore they have the better judgements. To this I anſwer, wee may
not take your bare word for it neither; for if men plead for a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
it is rather a ſign of the contrary. Secondly, it is is an ill ſigne in
you, to be ſo uncharitable in your cenſures of us the Presbyterials, you
account moſt of us to be uncapable of the Sacraments, although you
cannot prove us to live in ſuch ſins, (and eſpecially in that degree in
thoſe ſins) which the Word of God doth exclude a man for; and is
this a good ſign think you? Thirdly if you ſay that you are more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in your following the Preachers, and the exerciſes of Religion; &amp;
therefore you are better, and more godly then the Presbyterials. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
ſo might the Phariſees have ſaid, for which cauſe they had their
name <hi>zelotes</hi> (many of them;) yea, this was the cauſe that they did
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:114314:25"/>
ſeparate from the reſidue of the people, and would be called Phariſees,
the which word commeth of the Hebrew word <hi>Phares,</hi> which ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to make a breach by ſeparating from others; and is this a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
alwayes think you? you know the Phariſees were worſe
then the common people were from whom they ſeparated, for inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they were full of rottenneſſe; yea, our Saviour ſaid of them, that
they were ravening wolves, although they were ſo zealous to pay tithe
of mint, aniſe, and cummin. By all this you ſee now, that your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
therein is ſtark naught; beſides, I have found that the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialls
are more forward to neighbourly goodwill, and to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
a man with what they can, then you are: this I have proved to be
true (although I have not any thing of any man, but what I pay for.)
But the Independents are full of ſhifts and excuſes, (ſo many as I have
been acquainted with) I wiſh they would not equivocate ſo much as
they doe; I hope they will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eale truly in their ſhops. Fourthly, they
ſay they have more knowledge in the Word and will of God then the
Presbyterialls have. I anſwer, (if this were true) you are ſo much the
worſe, if your hearts are not thereby made better; for you come much
ſhort of the Phariſees in our Saviours time, in the literall knowledge
of Divine things, yet they were the worſt of people. Beſides, it is not
true neither which you affirm of your ſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> that you are the
moſt knowing, for you are exceeding weak in your judgements, (for
the more part) And many of the Presbyterialls, which have not the
tenth part of literall knowledge, have notwithſtanding a better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
in many things in the Word of God, and ſincere hearted too.
Fifthly, I wiſh I might not ſay that there is with you too many moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
of ſpirituall pride; for there was another ſect among the Jews,
that called themſelves Sadduces, and would be thought to be more juſt
in their dealings then other men, and yet were not ſuch as had ſaving
grace in their hearts, they called themſelves Sadduces from the hebrew
word <hi>tſedek,</hi> (as ſome Expoſitors affirm) and yet they denyed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
from the dead, therefore this is no true infallible ſigne nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Sixthly, are you not as forward to corporall pride, as the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterialls
too? (although I think you are not ſo ſick of the faſhions, as
ſome of the Presbyterialls are.) Seventhly, are you not more obſtinate
in your way of ſeparation after conviction, then the Presbyterialls
are? I wiſh I could not juſtly complaine of this; for I have knowne
many, when they have yeelded in many chief things in their way of
ſeparation, and yet would go on ſtill in their way of diviſions; ſo that
with you is wilfull obſtinacy alſo. I doe not ſpeak this to excuſe the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:114314:25"/>
Presbyterialls from many ſins, no, I blame our ſelves exceedingly too:
But this is the maine thing which I aime at, to beat downe men from
eſteeming of themſelves above that which they are. And thus much
for this point alſo.</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Some have ſuch ſhallow-heads and gnats about their eares;</l>
                     <l>I think their hearts be dead; where is their hopes, their feares?</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>Now farther (you ſay) that many of our ſide are ignorant in the
Word of God, and live looſly in their converſations; It is true, they
doe ſo; and you ſay they be proud and ſcornfull in their carriage to
their inferiours, and think to have others to ſtoop to them becauſe of
their gay-cloaths and big looks, they having (many of them) much of
this worlds good; but yet they have little or no vertue in them; the
which is that which is worthy of the true reſpect, and not a bare title.
In this I will not diſſent from you, but will conclude, that a wiſe man
will not much reſpect any thing that is but an adjunct of a man, and
is no part of the man, for <hi>Dives</hi> was gay, and had this worlds goods,
but yet he was not any whit the better eſteemed of God, but hell muſt
be the place of ſuch a one:<note place="margin">Coruptions in Gods people, and eſpecially in thoſe that live in wealth, and at eaſe.</note> but yet theſe with us may have ſome ſaving
grace in them; for you muſt endevour to diſtinguiſh degrees of good
and evill, otherwiſe you will never bee able to make a true concluſion.
And truly this is a great reaſon for me to conclude that your Leaders
are either ignorant of theſe things, or elſe they keep you blinde on
purpoſe, that ſo you may remaine Separatiſts ſtill. You may know
that thoſe that have this worlds goods are lyable to many temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which other inferiour people are more free from; and though
they themſelves fail as much another way perhaps too. Have you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſeen a man that being holden in from occaſions of temptations, by
being in a mean eſtate, and thereby afflicted; who, afterwards, having
been raiſed to a greater eſtate, was more vaine then thoſe whom hee
before counted wicked;<note place="margin">Davids fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</note> ſee how good <hi>David</hi> failed in godlineſſe, when
great temptations encountred him, as being at reſt in his kingdom of
wealth, walking and ſolacing himſelf upon his houſe top, and having
ſuch an object of carnall delight; and that ſin did occaſion another as
great, O that was a great one indeed! for having faln into the ſinne of
adultery, and thereby being lyable to diſgrace, he thought to cover it,
by uſing policy, and yet that policy muſt nevertheleſſe goe ſomewhat
neare him too; but yet he thought, having ſuch an occaſion to hazard
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> in battail, it would be the more tolerable, and therefore hee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured
upon the cutting off of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> that ſo he might take her to
be his wife, to cover the ſin from being known: To be ſhort, they are
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:114314:26"/>
more lyable to carnality and vanity then many other men are, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they have ſaving grace in them. But what is all this for the
Point we ſtand for, <hi>viz.</hi> the government of the Church? I ſtill ſtand
for truth, although abuſes be; for I know, no outward accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
will beſtead us at the great and dreadfull day of judgment.</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>No ſtrouts, nor clouts, nor words that ſwell,</l>
                     <l>That will beſtead us then;</l>
                     <l>For I know well, and doe you tell</l>
                     <l>'Tis vertue maketh men.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>And now in the next place I muſt note another thing which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
in keeping men from renouncing an opinion once maintained
by them,<note place="margin">The hinderan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that keep men from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

diſgrace, leſt others doe deride them; and truly my heart almoſt blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to think of it, for it is a great tryall indeed, and eſpecially if men
have not a great meaſure of grace; but yet I hope we do conſider that
God is to have his glory, what ever we undergoe; <hi>Let God be true, and
every man a lyer.</hi>

things we ſin all: O that we could joyn together, then might wee
eaſily prevail of the Parliament, wholſome Laws, yea, and Officers too,
to keep us in a more ſtricter way in godlineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Now let us take ſome notice of ſuch things as may whet our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
more ſpecially to perform our duties ſeverally:<note place="margin">Motives to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

worthy of all honour, and to have all glory aſcribed to him, yea, all
good is (and ought) to be aſcribed to him, for he is the totality of all
things; in him we live, move, and have our being; and in him all
things conſiſt, whoſe goodneſſe doth appeare in his creating of us
after his own Image, in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, and knowledge,
and other qualities; in a fit degree for creatures to have reſemblance
of their Creator, and to be bleſſed for evermore; whoſe purity may be
ſeen in his Law which he hath ſet to our view, to behold his excellency
in; the which <hi>Moſes</hi> the man of God admired with theſe words to
the children of <hi>Iſrael, What Nation is there under heaven that have Lawes
ſo righteous as ye have?</hi> And <hi>David</hi> ſaith thus of them to God, <hi>Thy Law

that bleſſed Creation; and alſo what is due to us now by falling from
God by our diſobedience, even everlaſting damnation and torture, and

in providing for us a remedy, that we may not be ſubjects of torments

the doores of our hearts, and bidding us open, yea, that giveth us
power and ability to open, onely that we be not wanting in the not

be no more. Now let us conſider what allurements the Lord our
God hath ſet forth in his Scriptures of truth for our encouragement,
the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> in his 12 chapter, ſaith, <hi>Thoſe that be wiſe ſhall ſhine

for ever, and ever.</hi> And in the Book called the <hi>Ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

many allurements for us to be whetted on in godlineſſe; <hi>To him that

(which betokeneth the glory of an Emperor;) <hi>and to have a morning
Star; yea, he ſhall be a pillar glittering in the Temple of God; yea, Chriſt will
write upon him the name of God; and the name of the City of his God, new Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,

                  <p>Thus we ſee the goodneſs of God in giving us ſuch allurements to

forth to us, to the end we might not be weary in wel-doing, though we

Elements, yet the ſoul is not to bee derived ſo from the Parents, for
that is a ſpirituall inſpiration, and is not nouriſhed by any of the four
Elements, but hath its exiſtence and ſubſiſtence from God onely. And
now I come to Scriptures, the firſt is <hi>Mal. 2. 15. When God made one, yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Eccleſ. 12. 7. The Spirit ſhall return to God who gave it;</hi> and hence it is
(very likely and chiefly) that God is ſaid to be the God of the Spirits
of all fleſh, rather then of the fleſh it ſelf; for although God be the
God of the fleſh too, yet that being made of the four Elements, is not ſo
ſpecially regarded of God, as the ſpirit or ſoul is; and hence it is very
likely that <hi>Moſes</hi> calleth God, the God of the Spirits of all fleſh, as in
<hi>Numb. 16. 22. Let the Lord the God of the Spirits of all fleſh, ſet a man over

                  <p>The reaſon why men doe not ſee the ſalvation of God in Chriſt is (among many) eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
becauſe they doe not yeeld obedience in their hearts to ſo much of the morall Law, as

that it bee ſo in deed and in truth. I ſpeak this to ſtop the mouths
of ſome wicked people, that are ready to ſay that there is no difference
among men, <hi>viz.</hi> that all are alike now in the ſtate of grace, excepting
onely the imputative righteouſneſſe of Chriſt; yea, I have heard with

have no inherent holineſſe nor righteouſneſſe. But if this be a
truth, why then did our Saviour pronounce a bleſſedneſſe to thoſe
that are pure in heart? And why did all the Apoſtles preach ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be inherently in the juſtified ones? yea, if any man be in Chriſt
he is a new Creature, yea, <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe (in the behalf of himſelf, and

throughout both in body and ſoule, &amp;c. But yet notwithſtanding
it is imperfect in regard of degrees; and therefore it is that the Prophet
concluded that all our righteouſneſſe were as filthy rags; and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle

                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:114314:28"/>
This point is to ſhew how many ſubjects have neglected, refuſed and
oppoſed their Kings commands, when thoſe commands were unjuſt
by Gods expreſſe Word; yea, they did hinder their King from acting
ſin himſelf, and that by force too.</p>
                  <p>My firſt Scripture is 2 <hi>Chron. 26. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. Azariah,</hi> and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
valiant men withſtood <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> their King, to hinder him from
ſinning againſt God, in doing that which belonged to his ſubjects to
be done, he being forbid by Gods ſpeciall command; and if they had
not hindred him, then they ſhould have ſmarted for it as well as their
King. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 45. ſheweth, that the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did hinder their
King <hi>Saul</hi> from committing a ſin againſt one of his ſubjects, which he
had ſworn to doe, but they did reſiſt him, and ſwore that <hi>Jonathan</hi>
ſhould not die,<note place="margin">Accidentall ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.</note> (ſeeing he did not deſerve death:) <hi>Jonathan</hi> knew not

lawfull, as you may read in ver. 27. and ſuch a one was to be pardoned
by Gods command, as in <hi>Ezek. 45. 19. Numb.</hi> 15. 27, 28. &amp; <hi>Levit.</hi> 4, 27.
And this is noted alſo as a good deed of the people, in oppoſing their
Kings in theſe things. And in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 30, 31, 32, 33. and ſo forth,
<hi>Jonathan</hi> would reſcue good <hi>David</hi> from <hi>Sauls</hi> ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

intent, though he had <hi>Sauls</hi> diſpleaſure ſo farre, as to the hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of his own life, for this his ſo doing. This did good <hi>Jonathan</hi>
contrary to the command of his Father, though the King; and this
alſo is recorded for his commendation. But contrariwiſe when the
people did not hinder their Kings, but joyned with them in that which
was evill; then they and their Kings muſt ſmart for it too; as you may
ſee by the peoples joyning with their King <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> againſt <hi>Elijah</hi> the
Prophet, as in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 1. And ſo alwayes throughout the Scriptures,
you may obſerve the like puniſhment upon the people for ſeconding
their Governors in evill. Yea, this was the very cauſe of the caſting off
of the Jewes chiefly; for they joyned with their High-prieſt, chiefe
Prieſts and Phariſees, and the Rulers of the Jewes in crucifying of
Chriſt; and therefore his blood is upon them, as well as upon their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
unto this day: Do you not think it had been happy for the
people of the Jewes, if they had oppoſed their Elders and Governors,
and kept them from ſlaying our Saviour Chriſt? Yes truly, it had been
well for that people. And the ſubjects of <hi>Ahab</hi> were acceſſory to <hi>Ahabs</hi>
