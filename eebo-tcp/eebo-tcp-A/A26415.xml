            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Royall Brother,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ALthough the Imperiall Diadem hath Crowned each of us, by the Omnipotent providence of the Almighty, and those once dis-united, might exasperate our Princely mind against the British nation, yet the noble lenety of your Clement Nature, and the propitious consideration of those impendent and intricate perills, wherein your Kingdomes are dangerously involved, have respectively induced me to declare our good exoptations &amp; well-wishes to you. And whereas we maturely understood and with credible information received intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the rebellius insurrections of Ireland, We did respectively sympathize with your solicitous deploration of their disasterous procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and will (as shall be perspicuously declared hereafter) vindicate their furious rebellion: But your Majesty (as hath been promulgated by report) hath been mis-informed of divers particulars, which not onely casts an indigne aspersion o our royall Name, and Monarchicall Throne, but highly derogates from Our Imperiall <unclear>prerogative</unclear> and innocuous intention. It hath been <unclear>publikly</unclear> divulged, that we alwayes made a ludibrious dirision at the perillous distractions of your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and did not onely rejoyce at the disloyalty of Ireland, but also instigated those Rebells with a calumnious suggestion to proceed in their bloudy Tyranny, as if they should depend in <unclear>expectation</unclear> of our <unclear>auxiliary</unclear> assistance. But we doe utterly defie and detest this scandalous and trecherous imputation reflected on Us, and doe withall desire that the Authors of this ementitious Fable fathered on us, may suffer exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary punishment: For we royally protest and affirme, with our cordall assertion, that whereas the dolefull intelligence of the British distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction came to our first audience, We were so farre from entertaining any derisive alacrity, that we seriously rather deplored the preposterous condition of of the same: And as for the rebellion in Ireland, it did so astimulate Our just indignation, that Wee alwayes dis-affected the same, and did not onely de<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ort our subjects from presuming to conjoyn with them, but also did publish a Proclamation to the Epidemicall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb facs="tcp:63996:3"/>
of all in disswasion from that resolute intention. Wherefore in this behalfe, We are infinitely abused, and our royall Clemency blasted with the infamous tongue of audacity, for rather a reciprocall sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of those grievances did concurre in our Princely lenity, then a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory antipathie of vindicative resolution found any entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tyrannicall habitation in Our commoted Ire. Although ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fugitive delinquents, (as <hi>Finch</hi> and others) escaping from Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Iustice, supposed to find their <hi>Asylum</hi> in our realme, yet impute not so vitious a connivance to our unspotted Innocency, for we wil ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver protect them from impunity. First then, the fraternall concatena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Brotherhood (which by the legitimate bond of nature We are enjoyned unto) doth foment a solicitous Indulgency in Our Princely minde to concord and co-union, and not to inhiate the precipitious demolition, or at the least extenu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tion of each others Crown. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the singular love of our Sister (which likewise by the respective in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of Nature we are induced unto) doth by a sweet and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious compulsion injoyne Vs to corroborate, and not to precipitate each others Throne. Lastly, the firme League made between us (which by the Nationall Law of Kingdomes we are bound to observe) doth propitiously instigate us to preserve each others Imperiall Diadems. All these unitely concurring together to the pl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ur Royall intents, and indulgent desires for the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing prosperity of England. We applaud you for the Royall enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of our Mother, (although we have little cause, in regard of her intestine stratagem against us) yet we conceive, had shee tarryed longer in England, she would have suddenly brought the State to a destructive <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

VVhat I now implore, and desire more, is contained in these concise subsequent Declarations: First, that your Majesty would be graciously pleased to expedite and animate your Parliament to deliberate things in a conclusive Confirmation, that as they have begun Nobly, they may conclude with more fortunate successe to the future security of the Realm: for procrastination in State matters doth either discourage some in the same Nation, whose imminent grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
<pb facs="tcp:63996:3"/>
are not eased, or at least doth animate forraigne Enemies to perfect any conspiracy against a Kingdome; but a sudden conclusion doth both create alacrity in the joyfull minds of Subjects, &amp; also prevent what stratagem may be in agitation. Secondly, We desire that your Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would correspondently accord with your Majesty without any opposition on either sides, that thus unitely concurring together, the waighty affaires of the Kingdome may be determinated with more facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Lastly, what we desire more is, that you would expedite your consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the more propitious reliefe of <hi>Ireland</hi>: And for our selfe wee royally protest, that we will confirme our former resolution to curbe the Tyrannicall insolency of those Rebels, which shall bee a sufficient testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THe malignant disposition of some ill affected persons to the Commonwealth, like some diseases in mans body, which by a kind familarity, and consent with nature, fasten and get the possession of the body, and by degrees doth subvert and ruine the whole structure in man.

Religion hath been in its power perverted, the passage of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell much hindred, the Lawes of the Kingdome in many points subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the execution of justice upon many Malefactors prohibited, and the finall peace of this Realme drawn into many most strange distractions &amp; distempers, and his Majesties good opinion of his most loyall Subjects good intentions hath been much abused; so that the proceedings concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the affaires of this Realme, have taken very small or none effect. The Cotholike Faction, perceiving their malicious practices to be hindred, did well hope that now her Majesty being in those remote parts, that they might have the more reall accesse unto her privacie, and by that meanes the better opportunitie to execute their devillish counsels, and malicious intentions, have often attempted their <unclear>accesse</unclear> unto her Majesty: but by the care and vigilancie of that most religious and vertuous Princesse, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with the desires of this Realme now to be hindred, have <unclear>endevou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</unclear> by most execrable and irreligious attempts, to remove all obstacles which they apprehend did hinder the prosecution and execution of their and desires.</p>

Thus no Cheat never wants a faire dissimulation to cloke and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their base intentions, and vice as yet could never want any excuse for its deformity. Being thus come to the Court, without a very tedious stay, her goodnesse not being jealous of any evill intentions, as vertue is not suspitious, gave them admittance unto her person, after which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance they delivered unto her hands and co<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
