            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

by the Fury of the

hardly soever they were used there, they found
a better Treatment from the <hi>Bereans,</hi> of whom
St. <hi>Luke</hi> saith, that <hi>they were more noble,</hi>

               </gap>
more ingenuous, <hi>than those in Thessalonica, in
that they received the word with all readiness of mind,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106696:3"/>
and Searched the Scriptures daily, whether those
things were so,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In which Words:</p>
            <p>1. We are Directed to the Rule, by which
all Points of Faith are to be Determined; and
that is the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>2. There is the Capacity all Persons are in
to judge of that Rule; for the Words are spoken
indifferently of the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Berea,</hi> the Auditory,
to whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> Preached; that they <hi>Searched.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Here are the Qualifications of such as
would judge aright, and they are Sincerity and
Diligence: They were <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> more candid,
and they <hi>Searched the Scriptures daily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. There is the way and means which are
to be used in the Interpretation of the Rule;
and that is by comparing the Doctrine with
Scriptures; there they Searched, <hi>whether those
things were so.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. There is the Success of this course, <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
many of them believed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have already Treated of the Three First of
these in the foregoing Sermon, and have
shewed the Scriptures to be the Rule of
Faith; that it is the privilege of all to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
to that Rule for satisfaction;<note place="margin">John 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>9.</note> and that
by Searching, they may arrive thereby to a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106696:3"/>
Knowledge and understanding of that Rule.</p>
            <p>And I shall now proceed to the way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation,
and the Consideration of the course
that is to be taken for the better understanding
of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>In Discoursing upon which,</p>
            <p>1. I shall premise some things with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
both to the Perspicuity and Difficulties
of Scripture; for it must be acknowledged
that the Sacred Books have a mixture of both.</p>
            <p>2. I shall lay down such Rules, as may be
of use for the better Interpretation of it.</p>
            <p>As to the former I premise,</p>
            <p>1. When we speak of the Scriptures, we
take it for granted that the Translation of it,
generally speaking, renders the true sense of the
Original; that is, the Original and Translation
are to him that understands both, as it were but
one Book; and so again to him that understands
the Translation only, it is the same as if he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
the Original.</p>
            <p>And that this is so, is evident; because all
Translations (though not Expositions) of what
Language, Church, or Age soever, do for the most
part agree: And if a <hi>Catena</hi> or Draught were made
of them, as there was of the Ancient Versions,
it would appear so to be, beyond all Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:106696:4"/>
So that if any Stranger utterly unacquainted
with the Christian Doctrine, or the Translations,
but skill'd in those Languages, should compare
them, he would be able to say that the Book
was the same, and only differ'd in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
as the Ancient, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Greek,</hi> and
<hi>Arabick,</hi> and <hi>Syriack;</hi> or Modern, <hi>viz. English,
French, German,</hi> or <hi>Italian,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And let Men differ as they will in their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Opinions, let them be <hi>Jews,</hi> as were the
Translators of the <hi>Septuagint;</hi> Apostates, as was
<hi>Aquila;</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. Just. Mart. Dial. cum Tryph. &amp; Tertul. contr. Jud. c. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Marcionites,</hi> as <hi>Theodotion; Ebionites,</hi> as <hi>Symma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.</hi>
Yet unless in those points in which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriously
corrupt the Text to serve a cause, and
wilfully and apparently depart from the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
there is a general consent among them in
the main.</p>
            <p>Which is a clear proof,</p>
            <p>2. That the Scriptures were Wrote so as to
be understood; for else how could different
Translators, unacquainted with the Language
or Writings of each other, so exactly hit upon
the same rendition of it?</p>
            <p>And indeed it would be too bare fac'd a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
upon Almighty God, by whose Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and Inspiration the Scripture was Wrote
(as I have shewed) to suppose that such a Book
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106696:4"/>
thus proceeding from so Divine a hand; and
upon so noble a Design as the Revelation of
God's Will to Man, should labour under such
a defect as the Compositions of Men of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Understanding are not guilty of.</p>
            <p>Certainly it is as possible to Write so as to be
understood, as it is to Speak and be understood;
and since Writing is but a kind of Speech,
Speech may as well be supposed unintelligible
as Writing; and if it were so, both the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and benefit of Conversation would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
and lost.</p>
            <p>And what a presumption is it to deny that
to God which we give to Men; and that when
we grant that Men not only can, but do express
their Thoughts plainly upon occasion by Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
that God either has not that Power, or
Will; but where he pretends to declare his
Will to Mankind, it should, as God saith to
<hi>Job 38. 2. darken counsel by words without knowledge;</hi>
and Write so as not to be understood, which
is to Write to no purpose, but only to fill the
World with contention, as if what is call'd
Revelation were not <hi>to send Peace, but</hi> in the
Letter of it, <hi>a Sword</hi> of strife among Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:106696:5"/>
If we own God for the Author, we must
say, that the Scriptures were Wrote that they
might be understood.</p>
            <p>3. We may suppose further, that at the time
when the Scriptures were Written, they were
intelligible by those that were Cotemporaries
with the Writers, and understood the Language
they were Written in. Which was a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
they had above all After-Ages; for there is
no Nation but what has peculiar Customs, to
which Forms of Speech often relate; nor is there
any Language which hath not Idiotisms
and Phrases of their own; and therefore where
these are not to be understood, or are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
the sense is lost or prejudiced, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed,
as I shall presently shew.</p>
            <p>4. We may reasonably conclude, that what
had no immediate reference to the persons then
in being, nor to the Ages, and Customs, and
Proprieties then in use, but contained common
matters, and was Clothed in common Forms
of Speech, was intelligible to others that did
not live in those Ages, and generally as intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as to those that did. Such is the Decalogue,
which may be understood by us in this Age as
well as those that were at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> at the
first delivering of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:106696:5"/>
5. The Scriptures being to continue to the
World's End, and, generally speaking, being
written for the use of all Men of all Ages and
Nations, they must consequently be Intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the main, and capable of being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by all persons in all times; or else they
were written in vain: For to what purpose should
they be preserved, or should they oblige Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
to read them, if they were not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood?</p>
            <p>6. I may say, that in Fact the Scriptures are
plain in all things that are intended for the use
of all, and that are necessary for all to know,
in point of Faith or Practice.</p>
            <p>Such are,</p>
            <p>(1.) All the Principles of Natural Religion,
such as the Being of a God, and his Creation
of all things; the Worship to be given to him,
the Government of the World by Providence;
the Immortality of the Soul, and a State of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and Punishments in another Life.</p>
            <p>These every one may understand as he reads
them in Scripture, and which no man can read,
but he must find out and understand.</p>
            <p>(2.) Such is the History of Providence,
that is God's prospering the good and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wicked Nations; his preserving a Church
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106696:6"/>
under all the Storms of the most violent Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions:
His carrying on the train of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
through all interruptions; and accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them at the time, and after the manner
long before prefixed.</p>
            <p>These are matters of Fact, and what are
obvious to all in the reading of them.</p>
            <p>(3.) Such is matter of pure Revelation, and
especially that which concerns the Redemption
of Mankind by Jesus Christ. As to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that he was before the Worlds, which were
made by him: That <hi>in the fulness of time,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Ancient Predictions, he became Man,
and was made Flesh: That he wrought Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
in Confirmation of his Mission from God,
and of the Doctrine he Taught and Professed
to receive from the Father: That he was
Crucified and Died as a Sacrifice for the Sins of all
Mankind: That he rose again the Third Day
from the Dead, and ascended into Heaven: That
he sent down the Holy Spirit, and continues at
the Right Hand of God to be our Mediator;
and that we are with respect to that Mediation,
to offer up all our Prayers in his Name to the
Father: And that he is to come at the End of
the World to Judgment, and shall raise the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106696:6"/>
Dead, and Summon them all before his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal.</p>
            <p>(4.) Of the like kind are all the Proofs and
Confirmations of the Doctrine of our Saviour
before spoken of under another Character;
such are Prophecies and Miracles. Prophecies,
which though sometimes obscure in point of
Phrase, yet there are those that are without
difficulty; as that of <hi>Josiah</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> by Name,
that of the place of our Saviour's Birth, the
Stock and Lineage, the Tribe and Family he
should proceed from; the time he should sufferin
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the other Attestation by Miracles is too
evident to be insisted upon.</p>
            <p>(5.) Of this sort are the terms of Salvation;
among those things which are plainly set down
in Scripture; we may find whatever relates to
Faith and Manners of Life: And in these two
are comprehended all that is necessary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
So that whatever is not plainly set down in
Scripture,<note place="margin">Aug. de Doct. Christ. l. 2.</note> or evidently inferr'd from it, is not
necessary to Salvation.</p>
            <p>Now I am apt to think, that no person that
comes unprejudiced, I mean not prepossess'd with
contrary Principles, or corrupt Affections, but
must needs own the Scripture to be clear in the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106696:7"/>
points before rehearsed, if so be he reads it with
an ordinary Diligence and Care.</p>
            <p>But will it be said, Are there not obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
allowed to be in Scripture, and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which are not to be surmounted? And
what is a clearer proof of this, than the different
Expositions we meet with, and the different
Opinions Men espouse, and therefore espouse
them because they conceive them to be the
dictates of Holy Writ?</p>
            <p>1. I Answer, That is no Objection against
it; for then there can be nothing certain, if
the calling it in question will render it uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
            <p>2. This indeed has been an Argument set up
to overthrow the Authority of Scripture, and
some have been so impertinent as to make use
of the various Constructions and Significations
of Words, to serve this impious cause.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And so among other things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Philos. Scipturae Interp. C. 3. n. 16. &amp; n. 25. &amp;c. 4.</note> 
               <hi>one quotes that
Saying of</hi> Quintilian, There are innumerable kinds
of words of ambiguous and various signification; so
that it seemed to some of the Philosophers, that there
was no word that doth not signify many things.</p>
            <p>But if this be a reason why the Scripture is
obscure, and the sense not attainable, then it
is common with that to all Books whatsoever,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106696:7"/>
not excepting even that Book which the Author
thought so well of, as to publish for the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the World.</p>
            <p>If this were of any force, then it would be to
no more purpose to speak than to write; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the words we use are capable of different
senses, as well as what we write.</p>
            <p>This is a way of arguing that proves too
much, and goes too far, and serves no more than
an argument that falls short, and comes not up to
the Case in hand.</p>
            <p>This would make the Divine Oracles like
those of the Devil, to be no other than <hi>Aenig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's</hi>
and Riddles, as if, in the New coined Phrase
of the Members of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, they
were but the <hi>Various figures of Ink upon a Book:</hi>
Or served to no other use than white Paper, to
Write what you will upon, and make what
sense out of it that a fruitful Brain can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</p>
            <p>3. Though there are obscurities in Scripture,
it falls upon such points as are not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
necessary, and not necessary to all; and
notwithstanding which, a person may be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
though he dye ignorant of them, or of
the sence of those Scriptures which contain
them. For there is no greater sign of their
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106696:8"/>
not being necessary, than that they are not what
we can understand, or are not plainly to be
found in Scripture.</p>
            <p>4. Though there are obscurities in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
yet they are nothing in comparison to the
plain Texts of it; and which no more hinder us
from understanding the plain, than the Spots
in the Sun prevent us of the Light of it.</p>
            <p>The Obscurities are like the various Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Serm.</hi> Fourtb and Sixth of the last Year.</note>
of little consequence, and importance,
(as I have shewed) and nothing comparable to
what remains intire and perspicuous. They are
only <hi>some things that are hard to be understood.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 16.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But how many are the plain and intelligible,
and especially of things necessary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
            <p>5. When, I say, there are Obscurities in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and that they fall upon less necessary
points, I grant that even those obscure parts
are not without their use; it being here, as in
the Heavens, where the Cloudy Stars that
scatter a faintish light through the Galaxy or
Milky-way, though not discernible but by a
Telescope; yet (if we may judge of what we
do not know of Nature, by what we do) have
their use, and by their Influences, without doubt,
serve a Noble design. So though the Obscure
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106696:8"/>
Texts of Scripture afford a dim light in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison,
and what we can at present give but a slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
account of; yet we our selves have sometimes
perceived, when we have come by searching
to understand any of them, that we understood
not before, that they prove of very great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
as they serve to confirm the plain, and
do give light to those that were otherwise, and
were it not for the light given by these, would
have remained obscure.</p>
            <p>And indeed, Almighty God has so wisely
ordered it, that as there are some Works in
Nature we do understand, and some we do not;
some serve a lesser, and some a greater end:
So has he also <hi>temper'd</hi> the body of Scripture to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
the difficult with the easy, the obscure
with the plain, the less necessary with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
that our industry may be excited by our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to understand them; and our labour
be rewarded by the understanding of them:
That we may <hi>Search</hi> as the <hi>Bereans</hi> here did,
and upon our Searching, may, as they, come
to <hi>believe</hi> and understand, or be confirmed in
our belief of them.</p>
            <p>Toward the better understanding of which,
2. I shall direct to some Rules that may be
of singular use to us in our Search and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:106696:9"/>
1. Where in the first place it is advisable,
that we be very conversant in the Sacred
Text; and as the <hi>Bereans, search it daily;</hi> by
which means much of the obscurity will wear
off; and the Phrase, and Style, and way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
will be more evident, and the matter of
it make not only the stronger impression on our
minds, but be clear'd up also insensibly to us.
We see how much difficulties are lessened by
practice, as it is in learning the Alphabet, and
the first Principles of any Language or Science;
and when we in the beginning struggled with
our selves, and used a kind of force to bend
our minds to it, by degrees the difficulties aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and we became complete Masters of the
matter that lay before us. So it is in reading
the Scriptures, where by use we are wonderfully
let into the meaning of them. For this reason
it was that the Prophets were read in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue
every Sabbath-day, as is implied, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.
27. And why also the Scriptures were read as
well when not understood as when they were;
according to the practice of the Eunuch.<note place="margin">Act. 8. 30, 31.</note> For
to what purpose would it have been for him
when alone, without an Interpreter, to have
read <hi>Isaias</hi> the Prophet upon such an obscure
Argument, if by reading it he might not have
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106696:9"/>
been some help to himself, and by degrees
have attained to a further understanding of it
more or less?</p>
            <p>And I dare appeal to any that have taken
this course, and have daily read, and read them
with the like impartiality as other Books, and
much more where they have read them with
the reverence and attention due to Divine Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
whether they have not found the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
lessen upon their hands. And if such as
daily read those Books with these and the like
Qualifications, would but account with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for all the difficulties assoyl'd and sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
this way, without any other assistance, it
would be no unpleasant or unprofitable refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>2. Although it be of this advantage to read
the Scriptures in course, as was usual in publick
in the Synagogues, and in private among per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
piously disposed: Yet it would add much
to the rendring the abstruser parts more easy and
intelligible, if they began with the plainest,
either for Duty or Matter, and then proceeded
to the more obscure. For this is a reducing
things into a strict and natural method; and is
like the beginning with the beginning of a
Book wrote in that way, and so gradually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106696:10"/>
as we are led along from point to point,
from Proposition to Proposition, till we come
to the end of that, and the difficulties together.</p>
            <p>The Scripture I own is far from being Wrote
after this humane and artificial method, but in
a way Extraordinary and Divine: and is among
other reasons, composed after the manner in
which it is, that we may be obliged to use
a befitting industry in searching into the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it; and 'tis certainly one part of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
so to order it, that as there is this
difference plainly to be observed in Scripture,
so we would thus make an advantage of it by
beginning with <hi>Words</hi> and things <hi>easy to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,</hi>
before we attempt to understand what
is in a sphere for the present above our capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city;<note place="margin">Hebr. 5. 12. 14.</note>
for <hi>such have need of milk, and not of strong
meat, which belongeth to them that are of full age,
even those who by reason of use have their senses
exercised to discern both good and evil;</hi> and I will
add, between things plain and abstruse, more
necessary and less, certain and doubtful.</p>
            <p>3. Another Rule for the understanding of
Scripture, is to be well acquainted with the
principal design, and the chief Subject of it,
whether as to Faith or Practice: For from thence
doth arise what is usually called the <hi>Analogy of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106696:10"/>
Faith;</hi> and which will be a Standard upon all
occasions to have recourse to. For what Sense is
to things sensible, and Reason to things meerly
reasonable, that is the Analogy of Faith to all
Interpretations, and according to whose Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration
they must stand and fall: Of this the
Apostle gives an Instance as to Faith, 1 <hi>John
4. 2, 3. Hereby know ye the Spirit of God; every
Spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in
the flesh, is of God. And every Spirit that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is
not of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if there should be any place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that such Hereticks would produce in
their favour, we may peremptorily conclude,
that the meaning they would force upon it,
is no more the meaning of that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
than that can be the Spirit of God,
<hi>which confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. For the better understanding of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
it is a proper way to compare Scripture
with Scripture, the Old Testament with the
New, the obscure with the plain. For that
which is obscure and difficult in one place,
is usually explained and made clear in another,
as St. <hi>Austin,</hi> in the Book before quoted, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:106696:11"/>
Toward the more useful Application of
this Rule, it may be convenient to enquire
from whence the Difficulties and Obscurities
in Scripture do arise; Whether from the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limity
of the Matter; the Proprieties of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
the Relation that one thing has to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as Types; the Modes and Forms of
Speech in Matters Prophetical or Figurative;
which we may be helped in by this way of
comparison.</p>
            <p>When I have just before said,<note place="margin">P. 12.</note> that <hi>there is
no greater sign of the matter's being unnecessay, than
when it is what we cannot understand, or is not
plainly to be found in Scripture:</hi> I mean thereby,
not the matter or thing spoken of, but the
Proposition: For the Proposition may be a plain
and a very intelligible Proposition, when the
matter of it is inexplicable, and above our
understanding. As the Proposition, <hi>God is a
Spirit,</hi> is a plain Proposition, and as easy to
be understood in respect of its Sence and Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as that a Triangle is a Figure consisting
of Three Angles; but the matter is vastly
different; for who can tell what a Spirit is,
or can give as adequate a Definition of it,
as he can of a Triangle? And yet the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
before-recited of God's being a Spirit,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106696:11"/>
is as plain to be understood, and as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be believed; as if it were in its Nature
plain, and Intelligible, and that we as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
knew what a Spirit is, as we know what
a Triangle is: And therefore the Obscurities
arising from such Sublimity of the matter, are
not to be brought here to account; for they
can never be made plainer to us than they
are, till our Understandings are Elevated and
raised up to them. 'Tis a Spirit alone that
can tell what a Spirit is, and 'tis God only
knows himself. And though now we have
it as plainly Revealed that <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> as
that God is; yet we must be contented nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to have an adequate Notion of God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
we were as God, nor also the like Notion of
a Spirit, till we become Spirits our selves.</p>
            <p>When I say again, That it is a sign of the
<hi>matter's being unnecessary, that it is not plainly to be
found in Scripture;</hi> thereby is meant what is
plain to such as Search, Enquire and Compare,
and know how to argue from it: And if by
Search and Enquiry, by comparing and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it comes to be plain, I may as well so
call it, as if it was in so many words therein
expressed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:106696:12"/>
There is a very convincing Argument of a
Future State in the Scripture quoted by our
Saviour, when God saith, <hi>I am the God of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 32.</note>
&amp;c. from whence our Saviour with great
strength infers, <hi>God is not the God of the Dead
but of the Living;</hi> and so those that he is the
God of, are alive. But though the force of
the Argument is now very evident, by the
light our Saviour gives to it, yet I believe few
would have observed it without that Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or to be sure without taking that Method
of comparing Scripture with Scripture.</p>
            <p>For it is by that Rule,</p>
            <p>(1.) We come to understand the Idiotisms
and Proprieties of the Language in which the
Scripture was Written; and without attending
to which, we shall fall very much short of
attaining to the sence of it. These Idiotisms
are common, with the Hebrew, to all Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and so are no otherwise to be understood,
than by a strict Observation of them.</p>
            <p>As for Example, Without this Key, how ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable
would it be to other Texts, to
have it said,<note place="margin">Hos. 6. 6.</note> 
               <hi>God would have mercy and not sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 9. 13.</note>
and that our Saviour should require his
Disciples,<note place="margin">Joh. 6. 27.</note> 
               <hi>not to labour for that meat which perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;</hi>
and that the Apostle should forbid Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106696:12"/>
the <hi>adorning themselves with the outward adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of plaiting the hair,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 13.</note> 
               <hi>and wearing of gold, or of
putting on of apparel?</hi> All of which were not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
allow'd, and some requir'd else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.
But now if we attend to the Genius
of the Hebrew, and compare one Scripture
with the other, we shall find, that the <hi>Jews</hi>
having no Degrees of comparison, were wont
to express comparisons by <hi>Antitheses</hi> or <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives;</hi>
and then the sence of the Negative
<hi>Not,</hi> is <hi>not so much;</hi> as <hi>labour not,</hi> that is, not
so much <hi>for the meat that perisheth,</hi> as <hi>for that
which endureth to everlasting life,</hi> &amp;c. And if
this be observed, we shall find there is no
contradiction, when in one place Sacrifices are
requir'd, and in another, that <hi>God would have
mercy and not sacrifice;</hi> when in one place, it
is commanded to <hi>work with their own hands;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Thes. 4. 11.</note>
and in another, <hi>labour not for the meat that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>(2.) By this way of comparison we come
to understand the Figurative Phraseology or
manner of Expression in Scripture, and we shall
find that such are not to be understood in a
proper and literal, but allusive sence.</p>
            <p>As for Instance; God is in Scripture said
to have Eyes and Hands, Ears and Bowels,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106696:13"/>
which are terms belonging to a Natural and
Human Body: And also to Laugh, and to
be Angry, and to Repent, which are passions
belonging to Mankind. And yet we read al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
that <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> and so hath not a
Body, nor any of the parts belonging to it:
And that he <hi>is not as man that he should repent;</hi>
and neither is nor can be subject to those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
and Passions which belong to us.
And therefore when such Bodily or Mental
Affections and Properties are imputed in words
to him, it is in a figurative and improper sence,
and which are spoken of him after the manner
of Men, and in condescension to our Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
who are not able to conceive of him as,
and according to what he is in himself. So that
it would be a gross piece of folly, for the
sake of such Figurative Expressions (as <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret</hi>
saith of <hi>Audaeus</hi>) to conceive of God as
a Corporeal Being;<note place="margin">Haeret. Fabul. l. 4.</note> which is to say, he is not
a Spirit, and so to make the Scripture incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with it self.</p>
            <p>Another instance of this kind, is the Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Saviour, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> which
being a Sacramental as well as Figurative Phrase
of Speech, recourse must be had to the like
Institutions in Scripture, and to what has the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106696:13"/>
nearest resemblance to it; and that is the Passover,
the <hi>Jewish</hi> Sacrament, and, as I may so say, their
Lord's Supper. Now when we read in the Law,
of the <hi>Lord's Passover,</hi> and that they <hi>roasted</hi> and <hi>eat
the Passover,</hi> we easily conceive that by it they
meant not the Angel's passing over the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> (which gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to the Phrase); but the Lamb, which
was the Memorial and the Representation of
it. So when in Correspondence hereto, we
read of our Saviour, that at the Institution
of the Lord's Supper, he said of the Bread,
<hi>This is my Body;</hi> and that he broke the Bread,
and they eat of it; we can reasonably no more
understand that his Natural Body was then
actually broken, and that they did eat his very
Body, than we can understand, that when the
<hi>Jews</hi> roasted and eat the Passover, they roast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and eat the Angel that passed over the
Houses where the Blood was sprinkled. And
therefore what was improperly and figuratively
spoken of the one, was after the same manner
spoken of the other, and alike to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</p>
            <p>Indeed such Figures and Modes of Speech,
are as soon understood, for the most part, as
plain and literal Propositions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:106696:14"/>
As when our Saviour is called a <hi>Lamb,</hi> a
<hi>Door,</hi> a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> a <hi>Vine,</hi> he was no more
really such, nor are such Phrases any more
literally to be understood, than that <hi>Herod</hi> was
a <hi>Fox,</hi> and the Pharisees <hi>Vipers,</hi> because they
were so called by our Saviour: And therefore as
our Saviour's Auditors as soon understood him,
when he spoke after this Figurative, as if in
the plainest and literal Phrase of it; so one
would think they should, and we may be as
certain they did understand our Saviour, when
he said, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> not of a proper hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Body, but only by way of Representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
according to the nature of the thing, and
those places to which this had an immediate
reference.</p>
            <p>(3.) By this way of comparison we come
to understand the Typical Phrase of Scripture;
which of it self is, like the Types, obscure.</p>
            <p>There is a great Conformity between the
Old Testament and the New, and especially
as to what is the main Subject of the Mosaical
Law,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. 1 Cor. 10, 11.</note> the Types, Ceremonies, and Rites of
it: And where there is this Correspondence
and Conformity, we must for the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the one, borrow light from the other.
And therefore when the like Forms of Speech
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106696:14"/>
are us'd in the New Testament, as are in the
Old, it is to be supposed that we are well
acquainted with the Old; or that we must have
recourse to that for the understanding of the
New: Of this the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is
an Instance, the Phraseology of which is mostly
Legal and Ritual; and so we must be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with those Rites, or the Modes of speaking,
to understand it. I shall here content my self
with a particular or two of this sort.<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Lev. 4. 3, 8.</note> It is a
known case, and very usual in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in the Levitical or Prophetical part of it,
to call <hi>a Sin-offering</hi> by the name <hi>Sin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isai. 53. 10. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> or in the
Translation of the Septuagint, <hi>for Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this is an Elliptical way of Expression,
very customary in those and other Languages;
but what is customary and significant in one,
yet if Translated into another, oft-times looks
absurdly; and so it is necessary in such a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
to supply it by what was before under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
but not expressed; as it is in the
Cases abovesaid. Thus for instance, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9. 28.
'Tis said our Saviour <hi>Christ was once offer'd to
bear the Sins of many; and unto them that look for
him, shall he appear the second time without Sin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Salvation.</hi> But thus he appear'd the first time,
he was then without Sin; and therefore here
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106696:15"/>
according to the Subject the Apostle is discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
upon, it is to be supplied after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<hi>without a Sin-offering.</hi> So it is, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. 8.
and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. So we have it according to
the latter Phrase of the Septuagint, <hi>Rom. 8. 3.
God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh,
and for Sin condemned Sin in the flesh.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>For Sin,</hi>
is a Phrase rough and abrupt; but if we add to
it <hi>by a Sacrifice for Sin,</hi> it is very agreeable and
intelligible.</p>
            <p>Now when there is this Mystical Relation, and
the Gospel has a respect in its Phrase and manner
of speaking, to the Types and Ceremonies
of the Law, the Antitype is to be explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Type, the New by the Old.</p>
            <p>(4.) By this way of comparison, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
acquainted with the Prophetical way of
Writing, and may understand what without it
would be obscure.</p>
            <p>I have just before observed the Relation that
is between the Law and the Gospel; and that
if we would understand the Gospel, it is fit to
repair to the Law, as to the Phrase of it; and
if we would understand the Law in its noblest
sence, we must repair to the Gospel. And from
this Relation between these Two is it, that the
Prophecies of Scripture, especially as to the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106696:15"/>
State of the Church under the Gospel, are
clothed in the Phrase of the Mosaical Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Rites. Thus the Success of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and the Enlargement of the Christian
Church, is described under such Characters.
Isai. 2. 2. 3. <hi>It shall come to pass in the last days,
that the Mountain of the Lord's House shall be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
in the top of the Mountains, and all Nations
shall flow unto it.</hi> Isai. 66. 23. <hi>It shall come to pass
from one New-moon to another, and from one Sabbath
to another, all flesh shall come to Worship before me</hi>
at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> v. 20. which, and the like Phrases
were no more literally to be fulfilled, than that
we shall <hi>eat Bread in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now as the Happiness of the Future State
is often described by such Phrases as belong to
this present state, and not to that which they
are literally applied to: So the Prophecies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the state of the Church under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
are frequently exemplified under such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblances
and Forms of Speech as suited the
People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> for whose immediate use
they were wrote; and notwithstanding which,
neither they nor others could possibly be led in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
such a mistake, as to think that such should
the Kingdom of the Messias be, as those Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
verbally signified; when it was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106696:16"/>
from the Prophecies of Scripture, that that
Legal State was to be abolished, and also that
several of the things in the nature of them were
unpracticable. As for example; when it was
said, that <hi>from one New-moon to another, and from
one Sabbath to another,</hi> that is, Monthly and
Weekly, all Nations should come up to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the Lord at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore in the Explication of such
Phrases, we must not consider what they exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
signify in their first and original use, but to
what purpose they serve and are applied; and
if so we do, we shall lightly as soon understand
the <hi>New heaven and the New earth,</hi> which St. <hi>Peter</hi>
speaks of, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 13. as <hi>the Heaven and the Earth</hi>
in the First Chapter of <hi>Genesi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>:</hi> And as well shall
we understand <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Euphrates</hi> in the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
sence of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> as we do in the
Historical Books of Scripture.</p>
            <p>But above all, there is nothing doth so lay
open the Secrets and Mysteries of Prophecy, as
the Event; for by that means, where it is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,
it is as clear as if it had been Historically
related. And as if we look back from the
Event to the Prediction, we the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
that Prediction, which without the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Observation of the Event we could not
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106696:16"/>
perhaps have understood: So by comparing
what yet remains to be fulfilled, with what has
been already fulfilled, we have a useful key for
the understanding of the one by the other; the
obscure by the plain, and what we do not
know the meaning of, by what we do.</p>
            <p>Thus, for instance, we may understand the
Prophetical Schemes of Speech, concerning the
destruction of a Nation, by comparing one of
the Testaments with the other; or what is to
be fulfilled with what has been fulfilled. So
when in the Old Testament we find it Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically
threatned of <hi>Babylon, Idumea, Egypt,
&amp;c.</hi> that the <hi>Stars of Heaven, and the Constellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
thereof shall not give their light</hi>—that <hi>all the Host
of Heaven shall be dissolved,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isai. 13. 10. 34. 4.</note> 
               <hi>and fall down as the Leaf of
a Vine</hi>—And when that we read in <hi>Daniel,</hi> the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Horn <hi>cast down some of the Host and of the Stars
to the ground,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 32. 7.</note> 
               <hi>and stamped upon them:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 8. 10.</note> We have a
key to unlock the Mysterious Expressions of the
same kind in the New Testament. As when
'tis said (if it be to be understood of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of <hi>Judea</hi>) that <hi>the Sun shall be darkned,
and the Moon shall not give her light,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 29. 12.</note> 
               <hi>and the Stars
shall fall from Heaven;</hi> and that <hi>a third part of
the Sun,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Revel. 8. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Moon, and Stars shall be darkned,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106696:17"/>
it is to be understood after the same manner
as the other. Now by a reflection upon the
state of those Nations abovesaid, as well as
the nature of the thing, we find all intended
in those Mystical Expressions was, That these
Nations should be utterly destroyed, and all
Orders and Degrees of men,<note place="margin">Gen. 37. 9.</note> represented by
the Sun, Moon and Stars, should be dissolved:
And therefore accordingly are we in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical
passages in the New Testament, to
understand those Phrases and Forms of Speech
the like way.</p>
            <p>It would be endless to prosecute this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
as far as it will bear; for then I might
go through the 134 Rules of <hi>Franciscus Ruizius;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Regulae Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turas Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cras. <hi>Par.</hi> 1550.</note>
but what I have here laid down is sufficient to
help and direct us, generally speaking, in the
Interpretation of such Forms of Speech, which
often render the sense of Scripture difficult.
But God be thanked, there is little of this in
comparison of what is plain and easy, and
in which the main of a Christian's Duty
is concerned. This the experience of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one that is at all conversant in those sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Books, will confirm, to the silencing
of all Cavils, which some men of Wit, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106696:17"/>
others of Design, may pretend to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>For I dare confidently say, That no one can
plead ignorance against his Duty, or that he
failed in it, because the sacred Pages are not
to be understood. What! will such dare to
refer their cause to the Judgment-day, and be
willing to be determined to Life or Death, to
Salvation or Damnation, as they can make this
good? Will they put Eternity upon this issue,
and insist upon it, That they could not know
what they were to believe or do, because the
Scriptures that should have informed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
them, were obscure, uncertain, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible?
If they will not offer this by way
of relief or mitigation, then 'tis plain that all
the cry of Obscurities, and Difficulties, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties,
are but pitiful shifts, and sorry
pretences. There are plain places and Books
enough and enough, to silence all such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
and arrogant Cavillers.</p>
            <p>If we will believe our own Eyes, and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
our own Understandings, the Scripture
is plain in all that is necessary for us to
know; and if we do according to what that
teaches, and we may learn from it, we shall
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106696:18"/>
never be wanting in all necessary qualifications
for that Everlasting happiness which is therein
revealed, and for the promoting of which it
was written. <hi>Which God grant to us all through
Jesus Christ our Lord.</hi> Amen.</p>
