            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>For as much as many have desired to know the ground in particulars, of our differences in faith and worship towards God, And in some things as to the outward formes at Law, which men have sought to impose upon us in these late yeares; and also what we would desire therein; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is this written following, towards the satisfying of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry honest desire, who loves the kingdome of Christ.</head>
            <p>THere is no kingdome nor people can truely be said to be the Lords and his Christs, but as they come to be guided and governed by the Law of his Spirit in their Consciences, which Spirit and <hi>anoynting</hi> all must wait for,<note place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 3.27.</note> even from the King that sits on high, to the least place of government in any people, That with it all may know <hi>Judgement,</hi>

and order of an <hi>endlesse life,</hi> That in him and in his seed may nations and kingdoms be blessed with peace, even through and in his <hi>Righteous government</hi>; for God the Father ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts neither persons,<note place="margin">

Thus God will plead the Cause of his own seed, and overturne, and shake nations and kingdoms, <hi>untill the earth know that the heavens must Reigne,</hi> and the stout of heart confess <hi>that the head of every man is Christ,</hi>

and his kingdome <hi>in our Consciences</hi>; And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times have been tryed to the losse of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, and lives, to see if they could provoke or drive us from his faith in our Consciences, or tempt us any way to deny him, and owne them in their wills; And though we have dayly suffered thus under every severall power, and people, yet have we not ceased to warne them in love, with much feare and plainnesse, that if by any meanes they might have received his testimony, and not have perished in their gain saying; for our God in whom we trusted shewed it to us, that they should not prosper, nor be established with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, his Spirit, and anoynting, to whom he hath given the government of all people, that shall be blessed by him, yea, <hi>all the nations,</hi>

            <p>And this is the Cause why we have chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed rather to suffer under every power that yet hath risen, then to joyne in with them, because we have not heard the voyce of the <hi>holy one</hi> in the midst of them, neither hath his Spirit in them been the strength of their Counsells,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Isa.</hi> 5.21.</note> but they have sought to make <hi>flesh their arme,</hi> and to strengthen their kingdome <hi>with flattery and deceit,</hi> and not with <hi>truth,</hi>

                  <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.5.</note> and they have sought to make themselves dreadfull by violence, and to rule with cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, and not with the sword of God, which is Judgement and Justice; and have sought <hi>honour from men,</hi> and not from the Lord,<note place="margin">

            <p>And this is the Cause, and no other thing why we have hitherto borne our testimony against them all, even because they would not joyne to the Lord, nor heare his voyce in their day, but the more he called after them by the mouth of his servants, the more they were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And sometimes we have felt some tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in some of them when they have been low, little, and in feare, in which we have had some hope and gladnesse to heare the voyce of <hi>simplicity and truth,</hi> (though but bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenly) so that we could then have said they was <hi>not f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus in generall, an account is given to you that askes a reason, why we have not yet owned any power that yet hath risen, so as to joyne to them in all things. Now to you who desire to know in what particulars we have differed from these governments that yet hath risen since we was a people; we might say our lives, practises, and sufferings hath openly declared it, through the most parts of these nations, and in most, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test of our differences; Yet for the better sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying of some that knows not so much as others, and to take away all occasion of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, from all that would not oppose the way of truth if they knew it, and to leave without excuse the wilfully ignorant, and persecuters of the good old way of Christ; I shall instance in some things, and also shew our warrant for so doing, both by Scripture, and the practise of the holy men of God, in their generation; It being that so many are yet ignorant and unbeleeving, concerning the present leadings of the Spirit of truth <hi>in them,</hi> which is chiefe leader,<note place="margin">

            <p>And as to that first. Though God hath laid it upon us as matter of Conscience, to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

to what outward government or gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners soever he shall set up over us, in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things; and also that with all willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of mind a ready subjection be rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, at every <hi>just command,</hi> not for fear onely, but even for Conscience sake; and that in all things, we should seek the safety, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and well-being of such governers, to the utmost of our power, even as we looke to account to God for it, of whom the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that be, are ordained; yet hath he begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten us unto himselfe alone, and to the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his own Spirit in all things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith and worship, as to matter, manner, time and place; This is to be done and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed singly as to him, in the <hi>leadings of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>

            <p>Also if at any time their Kings or Rulers forgot God, or Kings arose who knew not God, and then would lay upon them Laws and Commands, which was not just an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Likewise might be Instanced, that of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels</hi> praying contrary to the decrees of the King,<note place="margin">

But this may be said for all; That if they would but have denyed the law of God in their conscience, and conformed to the wills of men, and their laws, not o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

need to have suffered death or spoyle.</p>
            <p>So now in that any of us by the same spirit of Christ, and from his light and law in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, are moved to goe testifie against false Prophets, false worships, and declare the way of truth to all people against them to their face; And if Rulers have been so opposite to this as to make laws against it, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us to bow and worship at their wills, which for Conscience sake towards God we could not, for which we have suffered the spoyling of goods, long and heavie impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonments, shamefull usings, and losse of lives also; I say in this we have <hi>a cloud of witnesses,</hi> even the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> our Captaine, and the whole body of Martyrs, who have all gone before us in the selfe same obedience of faith and Spirit, and have suffered the same or such like things from Rulers that knew not God, and teachers that knew not God, in their dayes; and all of them in their dayes was counted offenders, hereticks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or dispisers of Authority or some such reproach was cast upon them by their accusers and persecuters, for obeying the law of their God in their Consciences,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 16.2.3.</note> whom the Rulers <hi>of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of this world have not known,</hi> nor can know, till they beleeve his light in their own Consciences.</p>
            <p>So it is not for new things, nor strange o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, which was never in the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for which we suffer, (though to the world they seeme new and strange, but for the very same workes, of the same Spirit of light and truth, which hath often appeared in a poore contemptible people, and hath as

often received the same measure, from them who professe him in words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in workes deny him; by such have we suffered, who read and preach the same in words, which this eternall Spirit in us now worketh; And with such who with words <hi>garnish the sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres</hi> of those whom their fathers slew, are we counted great offenders, for being found in the same way and practise, and in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the same Spirit, in that measure as we have received it; So we have this added to the testimony of a good Conscience towards God, and towards men, <hi>that we suffer not for evill doing, though as evill doers</hi> (to wit) the practise of holy men, and the Scriptures of truth which will owne us herein, and stand on our parts against all our adversaries and accusers.

               </gap>is will be proved so when we come to particulars, wherein we differ from the wayes and worships of these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent times, and for which we are so much hated and persecuted.</p>
            <p>And we know that it will not be found harmfull to the bodyes, estates, or well-being of any Christian neighbourhood, nor of any other people in the nations, to practise those things wherein we differ, in civill and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall things, nor hurtful to the soules of any. In the things wherein we differ in religious or spirituall matters, from the severall opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and formes of worships that are or have been set up in these nations; As we shall make it plainly appeare if either Spirit of truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Scripture of truth or things equall may but be received on our part. Now we shall mention some particulars in which we differ
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44347:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for Conscience sake from some of the formes traditions, and commands of the men of this present age, and the powers that have ruled therein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> under whom we have therefore suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, as evill doers.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>And first as to those things which some calls civill.</head>
               <p>ANd indeed it may be wondered at, by any moderate people, that in a nation called Christians, any man should suffer, so much as to be called an offender for some of the things which I must mention upon this account, especially they being layd upon us by the spirit of Christ as matter of conscience, and by a people so highly pretending for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conscience.</p>
               <p>As it hath been layd upon us by the Spirit of Christ, to use the same single language to all sorts of people, which the Scriptures uses, and all the holy men of God therein have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver used, that is to say, <hi>thou</hi> to any one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and <hi>you</hi> to more then one; A language, sound, and true, to God, and man, which the Spirit of God first spoke, and gave to man, and of man received it againe without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and never since gave to man any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forme of speech, as we may read in the Scriptures of truth; And in this we differ from some sorts of people, and for it have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

on our Consciences from the Lord, yea the Scriptures also,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13.</note> commands the <hi>forme of sound words,</hi> to be holden fast; now why those who professe the Scriptures for their rule, should persecute us for using the language of it, may be thought strange to the hearers thereof; yet for this we suffer for a testimony against them.</p>
               <p>Also it hath been layd upon us by the Lord to call men and women by their own names, which their fathers have given to them, to be knowne by amongst men; And though in this we differ from some sorts of people, who can give flattering titles to some people in stead of their names, and reproachfully miscall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in stead of their names, yet herein we are owned by the Scriptures of truth, and the practise of all the holy men therein, who never refused their own names to take a proud title, but owned their names that God had given them, And saith the Scriptures, <hi>let me not give flattering titles to man,</hi>

               <p>Also that about our <hi>hats</hi> putting off, which hath been so great an offence to many; This also hath been layd upon our Consciences by the Lord and we dare not disobey him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to please men, though sometimes it hath

been said to us that if we would but put off our hats, we should not goe to prison; others have said, when we came before them for Judgement and Justice, <hi>you shall have no Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, unlesse you put off your hats</hi>; yea some have hazarded their lives hereon, yet durst not disobey God herein, though they have suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red long therefore; and lost their rights for want of justice: yet we have not dared to disobey our God herein, but have valued our peace with him and a pure Conscience above all sufferings and profits herein. Now, this is beyond all the persecuters of old, that men should suffer for their <hi>hats,</hi> yea, even <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> in his greatest heate of persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he made not that an offence, to keepe on their <hi>hats,</hi> more then their other garments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but with their <hi>hats</hi> on as well as hose and shooes, they was bound and cast into the fire;<note place="margin">

Thus would people and powers, drive us from the obedience of our God, in a pure Conscience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and instead thereof cause us to worship a vaine Custome, for which we have no warrant, neither in Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor good example, but saith the Lord,<note place="margin">

               <p>This also hath been commanded us of the Lord, and layd upon our Consciences, not to <hi>sweare at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and because of this we have forborne to sweare, when men have called us thereto, whether to sweare at any change of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or what ever it hath been, we may not <hi>sweare</hi> at all; And for this we have deeply suffered also, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temners of the law, though we have not despised government, but have consented to what just thing was required of us, in truth of heart, without swearing; And for this we have the expresse command of Christ Jesus who hath said,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.34 <hi>Iames</hi> 5.12.</note> 
                  <hi>Sweare not at all</hi>; And his Apostles said, <hi>Above all things my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, sweare not, least you fall into condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And we have also the practise of all the followers of Christ who was never knowne to use an oath since; for to such as receive Christ there is the end of swearing; and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other things which before Christ came to end them, was ordinances of God, but Christ the Covenant everlasting hath ended all swearings of men whatsoever, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden they are in his name, upon paine of condemnation. Further, in the time of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> when swearing was in the Iews Church, it was not to be forced upon them by any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, but they might sweare or not sweare, without any carnall punishment, nor was it required of witnesses to sweare at all, betwixt a man and his neighbour, two witnesses was to establish the matter before the Iudge, but I never read of those two required to sweare, that was as to a mans owne particular, onely in this case, when a man had taken a pledge, and it was stolen from him, then an oath was to be taken of that man in his owne behalfe, that he put not his hand to the stealeing of it,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44347:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and then he was not to repay it againe, but if he would repay it he needed not sweare, so he was not forced. And except in this case onely, I finde not an oath required by any Iudge in <hi>Moses</hi> law. So, these who make us offenders, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or denying to sweare, are out of all the way of God in <hi>Moses</hi> time. And in Christs time, swearing is expressly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den at all, even this in <hi>Moses</hi> time; for faith Christ <hi>It hath been said by them of old time,</hi>

                  <hi>thou shalt not forsweare thy selfe, but shalt performe unto the Lord thy oaths.</hi> So here was <hi>Moses</hi> time, and swearing to the Lord, commanded in truth; and this said <hi>Moses.</hi> But (saith Christ) I say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Sweare not at all,</hi> and this is greater then <hi>Moses,</hi> whose time is without end.</p>
               <p>Further, as to the administration of the Laws of these nations in these late yeares, there we have seene many things, which in our Conscience we cannot joyne to, being shewed to us to be out of truth, and equity, and not helps, but burthens to the nations; Now as to our selves, so many as walke in Christ Iesus, we have one Judge, and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver appointed to us for that end by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; And we may not goe to Law one with another, as men being come to Christ Iesus, the end of lust, pride, and strife, which we have found to be the Cause of fightings, and sutes at Law, and if any thing of that nature would arise in any of us, by our Iudge and Law-giver it is judged, and we are saved; And it is layd upon us by the same Spirit of Christ, not to <hi>sue any man at the Law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.</note> nor to seeke to avenge our selves of such as seeke to wrong us, but to love our enemies, and pray
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44347:11"/>
for them that dispitefully use us, and hate us; And so from all men to suffer for peace sake, for to peace we are called, towards all men, and under the Prince of peace is our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so that we need not men to end Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies amongst us, who are all in unity of spirit, and life, in Christ Iesus.</p>
               <p>But when men haile us before Iudgement-Seats, or cause us to appeare at their Courts of Law, then we meet with many things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them there, which for Conscience sake we cannot bow to, nor uphold, finding them, not onely against the rule of Christians, but, out of the way of common honesty as men, yea many things against truth it selfe, and this we cannot serve, as Law, which is against truth.</p>
               <p>As when they send a Writ to appeare at their Courts, in a mans owne proper person, and in obedience thereto we have come, (may be) two hundred miles or above, and tendred our appearance accordingly, at the very day appointed, then they have with violence and reproach thrust us out of their Court<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
