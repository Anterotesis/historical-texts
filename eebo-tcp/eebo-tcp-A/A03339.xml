            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

he was a rare man for piety and authority also, (you

                  <p>Three speciall reasons and grounds there be for

                  <p>First, In respect had to them that are afflicted.<note place="margin">Reason 1.</note>
For, admit they were not our fellow-members in
CHRIST, nor our kindred or acquaintance, nor our
country-men; admit they were meere strangers to
us, admit they were all most wicked men, yet nature
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4296:9"/>
binds us to be affected with their miseries, because
they are our owne flesh: <hi>Esa. 58. 7. Hide not thy selfe
from thine owne flesh.</hi> And he that hath not humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and naturall affection in him, certainly hath no
grace, but is given up to areprobate mind, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
teacheth us, <hi>Rom. 1. 31.</hi> Yea it is an argument
of a cruell heart to be void of naturall commiserati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and carelesse of other men, whether they sinke
or swim. In this <hi>Cain</hi> first bewrayed his murderous
heart when he said of his brother, <hi>Gen. 4. 9. Am I my
brothers keeper?</hi> And so did the chiefe Priests and
Elders, when (hearing <hi>Iudas</hi> cry out of himselfe for
his sinne, and beholding him in the pangs of despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration)
they said unto him, <hi>What is that to us? see
thou to that.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reason 2.</note> In respect had unto the LORD, who
by these judgements executed upon others, doth
manifest from heaven, that His wrath is kindled,
that He is in a fury. So that not to be affected with
His judgements executed upon others, is a double
contempt done to the LORD Himselfe.</p>
                  <p>1. In that we are not moved, nor tremble to see
Him angry, <hi>Amos 3. 8. The Lion hath roared, who will
not feare?</hi> It is hard to find a man so stout and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
(shall I say?) nay so senslesse or prophane, that
trembleth not sometimes at the fearefull thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claps
and lightnings, because GOD therein mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festeth
His glorious power; and because that though
He strike not many with them usually, yet some He
doth; but there is much more cause to tremble, and
be affected with His generall and extraordinary
judgements upon others; for, thereby He doth not
onely manifest His glorious power, but His reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4296:9"/>
justice also, and anger against sin; which is much
more terrible than the other. See a proofe of this,
<hi>Ezek. 32. 10. The Kings of the nations shalbe horribly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them,
and they shall tremble at every moment; every man for
his owne life, in the day of thy fall.</hi> The Heathen (that
had no goodnesse in them at all) when they should
behold how terrible GOD was in His judgements
upon His owne people, should be in continuall feare
that He would destroy them also. As the scholler
that is himselfe faulty, and obnoxious to the rod,
when he seeth his master in a fury against any of his
fellowes, cannot chuse but tremble, unlesse he be
desperate. This made the Prophet (when GOD had
in a vision manifested to him His glory, <hi>Esa. 6. 45.</hi>
when he saw <hi>the posts of the</hi> temple <hi>doore moved at the
voice of the Angel that cryed, and the house filled with
smoke</hi>) to cry out (from the very consciousnesse of
his owne sinfulnesse and deserts) <hi>Woe is me, for I am
undone, because I am a man of uncleane lips, and I dwell in
the midst of a people of uncleane lips, for mine eyes have
seene the King, the</hi> LORD <hi>of Hosts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. There is in this another contempt also done
unto GOD; because GOD never smites some, but
to warne all, what is due to them, and what they
must looke for, unlesse they repent. Even those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutions
which the Magistrate doth by GODS ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
upon foule offenders, are done chiefly to
warne others, <hi>Deut. 13. 11. All Israel shall heare, and
feare, and shall do no more any such wickednesse as this is,
amongst you.</hi> But much more those judgements,
which the LORD Himselfe hath executed upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
(either immediately, or by His destroying An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels)
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4296:10"/>

                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:4296:11"/>
are intended chiefly, for the instruction, and
warning of others. <hi>The righteous shall see and feare,</hi>
saith <hi>David, Psal. 52. 6.</hi> The LORD consumed the
Sodomites in that fearefull manner <hi>to make them an
example to those that after should live ungodlily, 2 Pet. 2.
6.</hi> And the earth swallowed up <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and
<hi>Abiram,</hi> not onely out of that respect GOD had to
the glory of His owne justice, in taking vengeance
on them for all their sinnes, but that they might <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a signe</hi> unto others, as the HOLY GHOST saith
expresly, <hi>Num. 26. 10.</hi> Every judgement of GOD
hath a voice, and is a reall Sermon of repentance:
and the more generall and extraordinary the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is, by so much the lowder, and more audible
voice it hath: and it is therefore a contempt done
to GOD, when we regard it not, nor hearken unto
it, <hi>Mica 6. 9. Heare the rod, and who hath appointed it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third and last reason and ground of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
is,<note place="margin">Reason 3.</note> in respect had to our selves. For there is
no judgement executed upon others, (specially if it
be any whit publike and generall, and more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary)
but we all are to take our selves interessed in
it: yea to have had a hand in provoking the LORD
unto it. For, as sinne is the cause of all GODS judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that come upon a land, so we must not judge
them the greatest sinners alwayes upon whom they
light. <hi>Those eighteene upon whom the tower of Silo fell,
thinke ye</hi> (saith our Saviour, <hi>Luke 13. 4, 5.) that they
were sinners above all that dwelt in Hierusalem? I tell
you nay.</hi> Neither must we thinke, that the sinnes of
those whom GOD smites with His judgements, are
the only cause of the judgements, or that He is angry
with them only; but know, that He is aswel angry oft
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:4296:11"/>
times with those that He spares, as with those whom
he smites: and the sins of those whom he spares, have
oft a stronger hand in plucking down the judgement,
than the sinnes of those whom He smites have had.
Two notable examples we have for this in the time
of <hi>David.</hi> It was a fearefull judgement that GOD
executed upon <hi>Vzza, 1 Chron. 13. 10. The anger of the</hi>
LORD <hi>was kindled against Vzza, and He smote him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he put his hand to the arke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> and it is said, Verse
12. that the judgement upon <hi>Vzza</hi> much affected
<hi>David,</hi> and made his heart quake. And why so?
Surely, because he knew, that GOD was not angry
with <hi>Vzza</hi> onely, but with the whole congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>our</hi> GOD (saith <hi>David, 1 Chron.
15. 13.) made a breach upon us, for that we sought Him not
after the due order.</hi> He knew that the sinnes of the
Priests, and others that were spared, provoked
GOD to that judgement, more than <hi>Vzza's</hi> did; as
appeares in the beginning of that Verse. <hi>For, because
ye did it not at the first, the</hi> LORD <hi>our</hi> GOD, &amp;c.
The second example is, 2 <hi>Sam. 24.</hi> It was a fearefull
judgement that is mentioned in the fifteenth Verse,
<hi>When by a pestilence that the</hi> LORD <hi>sent upon Israel,</hi>
in three dayes <hi>there died of the people from Dan even to
Beersheba seventy thousand men:</hi> and they that were
slaine, had (doubtlesse) sinne enough in themselves
to deserve it: but was their sinne the onely or the
chiefe cause of that judgement? no certainly; the
sinne of those that were spared was the chiefe cause
of it, as <hi>David</hi> confesseth Vers. 17. <hi>Loe l have sinned,
and have done wickedly, but these sheepe what have they
done?</hi> He knew well that (not the sinnes of those
that perished in that grievous plague, but) his owne
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:4296:12"/>
sinnes had a chiefe hand, in provoking GOD unto
that judgement. So that we see that there is no one
man amongst us all, that hath not just reason to be
affected with GODS judgements upon the Land,
though himselfe be spared, seeing that he is a cause
of it, as well as they that are smitten, and (it may be)
as great a cause as they, nay, (it may be) a greater
cause than any of them were.</p>
                  <p>And this was that that made good <hi>Nehemiah</hi> cry
thus in his prayer unto GOD, <hi>Neh. 1. 6. Both I and
my fathers house have sinned.</hi> As if he had said, that
Ierusalem prospers no better, I and my fathers
house are as great a cause as any other.</p>
                  <p>We have heard the Doctrine which this example
of <hi>David</hi> teacheth us, delivered and confirmed in a
generall manner; let us now come to make use of it,
and to apply it to our owne case, and to the occasion
of our meeting at this time.</p>
                  <p>This Doctrine therefore serveth to exhort us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
two duties. 1. That we would labour to take
to heart, and to be rightly affected with this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of GOD that is now upon <hi>London,</hi> and sundry
other parts of the Kingdome. 2. That when we
are rightly affected with it, we would make right use
of it to our selves.</p>
                  <p>For the first.<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> You will say it is a needlesse exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
for,<note place="margin">Object.</note> who is not affected with this plague?
who is not affraid of it? and wherefore come we
hither els, if we be not affected with it?</p>
                  <p>I answer.<note place="margin">Answ.</note> That none of us (I feare) are sufficiently
affected with it; and that this is the fountaine and
foundation of all good uses we can make of it, either
for their benefit that are visited with it, or for our
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4296:12"/>
selves, that we would labour to be affected with this
judgement of GOD, as we ought to be. I will
therefore shew you what just causes we have to be
deeply affected with this judgement. And they are
principally three.</p>
                  <p>First, In respect of the grievousnesse of the
judgement it selfe. For, wee shall finde this cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
one of GODS sore judgements, <hi>Ezek. 14. 21.</hi>
And when the LORD threatens that Hee Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
would <hi>fight against Ierusalem with an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stretched
hand, and a strong arme, even in anger, and in
fury, and in great wrath, Ier. 21. 5.</hi> He tels them in the
next Verse, how He would do this, <hi>He would smite
the city with a great pestilence.</hi> Certainly the LORD
therefore now fights against our Land, yea He fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
against it in fury, and in great wrath. Observe
foure things in this judgement.</p>
                  <p>1. What a waster it is, <hi>Psal. 91. 6.</hi> it is called the
<hi>destruction that wasteth at noone-day.</hi> In a short time,
even in three dayes it consumed seventy thousand in
Israel, 2 <hi>Sam. 24. 15.</hi> A grievous judgement it must
needs be, when GOD Himselfe matcheth a pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of three dayes continuance (as a thing of equall
force to afflict, and destroy) with a famine of seven
yeares, and with flying by the space of three
moneths before their enemies that pursued them: as
we know He doth, 2 <hi>Sam. 24. 13.</hi> And hath not the
pestilence that GOD hath now sent into our Land,
proved a terrible waster, when in one weeke in one
City it hath swept away three thousand, five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
eighty two?</p>
                  <p>2. Consider how suddenly it takes them away
that have beene smitten with it: many that were
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:4296:13"/>
well in the morning have beene dead of it before
night: it is therefore called the LORDS <hi>arrow, Psal.
91. 5.</hi> It strikes and pierceth men suddenly with a
deadly wound: and Vers. 6. it is said to <hi>walke in
darknesse.</hi> And certainly, sudden death (though it
be not absolutely to be prayed against, yet it) is to be
esteemed a temporall judgement, and a signe of
GODS anger. <hi>Let destruction come upon him at una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares,</hi>
saith the Prophet here, Vers. 8. It must needs
add much to the bitternesse of death, when it comes
so suddenly, that a man can neither commend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to GOD, nor set things in order for the world
before he die.</p>
                  <p>3. Consider, it is such a judgement as oft makes
men destroyers of them whom they most love, and
desire to keepe alive: the father setting at unawares
the infection upon the child, the husband on the
wife, a man on his dearest friend. A great cause of
humbling it is, for a man to have killed any other
man at unawares, as you may see by that law, <hi>Numb.
35. 28.</hi> and what is it then to have killed them that are
dearest to them?</p>
                  <p>4. It is such a sicknesse as doth (usually) debarre
men of many comforts, that other sicke persons do
enjoy. First, many that are visited with this sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
do want convenient attendance and lodging,
dying in the streets and high-wayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of whom that
may be said, <hi>Esa. 51. 20. Thy sonnes have fainted, they
lie at the head of all streets, the fury of the</hi> LORD, <hi>the
rebuke of thy</hi> GOD. Secondly, their friends
dare not visit them; which, as it is a worke of
mercy, so it is a great meanes of comfort to
the afflicted, and such as CHRIST hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:4296:13"/>
us, <hi>Mat. 25. 36. 3.</hi> Whereas none have
so much need of spirituall comfort as they, because
the very disease makes them more subject to terrors
and feares than others, (and is therefore called <hi>the
terrour by night, Psal. 91. 5.</hi>) they (poore wretches)
can have none to comfort them, but may in anguish
of soule cry out, <hi>Lam. 1. 16. The comforter that should
relieve my soule is farre from me.</hi> So that in respect of
this first consideration, the grievousnesse of the
judgement it selfe, they may cry to us all, and to all
GODS people throughout the Land, as <hi>Lam. 1. 12.
Is it nothing to you all ye that passe by? Behold and see, if
there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, wherewith the</hi>
LORD <hi>hath afflicted me in the day of His anger.</hi> And
will you not be affected with it?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if this will not serve, come to a second
cause we have, to be deeply affected with it: because
none of us can tell how farre it may go; how neare
it may come to our owne dwellings. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
though we may say as <hi>Namb. 16. 46.</hi> we are
sure <hi>wrath is gone out from the</hi> LORD, <hi>the plague is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,</hi>
yet as the Psalmist saith, <hi>Psal. 74. 9. There is not
amongst us any that knoweth how long</hi> it will last, or
how farre it will spread.</p>
                  <p>Let no man say, I am farre enough from <hi>London;</hi>
I dwell in a good ayre, and we have taken good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to prevent all danger of this infectio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s disease;
no carriers shall come from thence to us, no Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners
shall lodge amongst us. These are good
meanes, I will not deny, (if they be used with that
compassion that becomes Christians to shew unto
them in misery) and must not be neglected. But all
these cannot secure us from the plague; if we do
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:4296:14"/>
not first make our peace with GOD, all these are in
vaine. If we beare in our bosome the cause of the
plague, if we nourish and increase it daily, (I meane
our sinnes) we cannot be sure to keepe it from our
townes and houses, do what we can. Know thou for
a surety it is GOD that sends the pestilence, as He
saith, 2 <hi>Chron. 7. 13.</hi> In this judgement (above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers)
we are said to fall into the LORDS hands, as
<hi>David</hi> speaketh, 2 <hi>Sam. 24. 14.</hi> And as He sends it, so
He onely guides it whither it shall go, and whither it
shall not go; whom it shall smite, and whom it
shall spare. And though He do usually send it by
outward and ordinary meanes, yet alwayes He
doth not so. Some that live in the thickest of them
that are infected, and in a most corrupt aire, do es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape;
some that flie from the places infected into
the purest aire, are infected, they know not how.
How many Physitians, and Chyrurgions, and nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and keepers that have beene wont to visit the
infected, to sweat them, to dresse their sores, to
wash their linnen; yea, how many that have daily
conversed with them, and lyen in bed with them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
have beene knowne to have escaped the infection
altogether? Whereas many that have beene most
carefull to keepe themselves from all that have been
infected, and to use all good preservatives against the
contagion, have beene taken by it. No man may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
from hence (as some foolishly have done) that
this disease is not in it owne nature more infectious
than other diseases are. No more than (from this
that the three noble Iewes that were cast into <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzars</hi>
furnace, received no hurt at all by it,
<hi>Dan. 3. 27.</hi> and that oft times one house in a street, or
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4296:14"/>
roome in a house escape burning, in the greatest
fires that have beene heard of) a man may conclude
that fire is not in it selfe of a burning and consuming
nature. But in this, as in the other; the finger and
power of GOD is to be acknowledged in restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and setting bonds to this heavy judgement, as
pleaseth Him. And this the LORD (doubtlesse)
doth, to hearten and encourage them that are whole,
to performe all necessary duties of mercy and love
to them that are sicke. And as the LORD can thus
limit the plague of pestilence; so can He (if He
please) command it to go through our whole Land
before it cease, as He did through the land of Israel,
2 <hi>Sam. 24. 15. from Dan to Beersheba.</hi> Though we flie
from it, He can follow and pursue us with it (as He
hath done many, and threatneth) <hi>I will persecute</hi> (and
follow them) <hi>with the pestilence,</hi> saith He, <hi>Ier. 29. 18.</hi>
Though we shut our doores against it, He can make
it come in at our windowes, as they complaine,
<hi>Ier. 9. 21. Death is come up to our windowes, and is
entred into our palaces.</hi> Let no man thinke he can be
sure to avoid this judgement by flying from it, if he
be not carefull to remove the cause of it, and to
make his peace with GOD. Do therefore (before it
come nearer to thee) as the LORD Himselfe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selleth
thee, <hi>Amos 4. 12. Prepare to meet thy</hi> GOD.
And because thou canst have no assurance in thy selfe
that thou shalt be able to avoid the danger of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
of this King that comes against thee (for
ought thou knowest) with so great a power, learne
that wisdome that our Saviour directeth thee unto,
<hi>Luke 14. 32. While He is yet a great way off, send an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage,
and desire conditions of peacewith Him.</hi> If thou
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:4296:15"/>
wouldst be free from the feare of the plague, feare
GOD aright. <hi>Be not afraid</hi> (saith the Prophet, <hi>Esa. 8.
12, 13.) sanctifie the</hi> LORD <hi>of hosts Himselfe, and let
Him be your feare, and let Him be your dread.</hi> If we
could feare the LORD as we ought, we should not
need to feare any thing els in the world. Be sure to
make thy peace with Him; which, how thou mayest
doe, I will tell thee by and by.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly and lastly, (to cause us to take to heart,
and to be affected with this fearefull plague) consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that if this judgement be neglected, (as great as
it is) it wilbe but a fore-runner of some more feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
judgement than this is. And as our Saviour
speaketh in another case, <hi>Matth. 24. 8.</hi> this wilbe
but <hi>the beginning of</hi> our <hi>sorrowes.</hi> There is a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(that this nation hath hitherto beene preserved
from, to the astonishment and admiration of all the
world) that is greater than this; for, it useth to bring
this, and the famine also with it, I meane warre.
The sword of our bloudy and mercilesse enemies is
worse than the plague. This is plaine by <hi>Davids</hi>
choice, 2 <hi>Sam. 24. 14. Let us fall now into the hand of
the</hi> LORD, <hi>(for His mercies are great) and let me not
fall into the handof man.</hi> And surely we have cause to
feare, that if this will do us no good, GOD cannot
endure to have His judgements despised. Heare
what He saith, <hi>Levit. 26. 18. If you will not for all this
hearken unto Me, then I will punish you seven times more
for your sinnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> And certainly, I may say to all you
that heare me this day, if you regard not, nor profit
by this fearfull plague you heare of in <hi>London,</hi> and in
other parts of the Land, GOD will either bring it
home to you, or a worse plague than it, <hi>Luke 13. 3.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:4296:15"/>
Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second duty that this Doctrine serveth to
exhort us to, is, that we would make right use of this
judgement of GOD that is upon the Land, unto our
selves. And that standeth in foure points.</p>
                  <p>First, seeing 1. GOD gives us in this judgement
such cause of sorrow, seeing He is angry: and 2 not
with the Londoners onely, but with us, with the
whole Land: and 3. it may be more with us, than
with them: and 4. seeing we know not how soon
this fire that burnes our neighbours house, may light
upon ours: We must therfore examine every one of
us our own wayes. This direction is given us, <hi>Lam. 3.
39. 40. Wherefore doth a living man complaine; a man
for the punishment of his sinnes?</hi> As if the Church
there should say, why do men mourne, and fret, and
take on so for this judgement of GOD that is justly
fallen upon them? Why do they not betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the right course for the pacifying of
GODS wrath? Which is this, and this onely, <hi>Let
us search and try our wayes, and turne againe to the</hi>
LORD. Every one of us should say thus within
himselfe, surely the LORD is very angry with the
whole Land, with every one of us; and what have
I done to anger the LORD thus, to provoke Him to
this wrath? <hi>Ier. 8. 6, 7.</hi> The LORD chargeth the
Iewes that they did not know His judgement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>no man said, what have I done?</hi> And so surely
will He judge of us. We know not the meaning of
the plague, nor make right use of it, unlesse every
one of us enter into his owne heart, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d say, what
have I done? To this end it wilbe profitable for us
to search the Scriptures, and find out what were the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:4296:16"/>
speciall sinnes which either have brought the pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
upon GODS people in former times, or
which the LORD hath threatned to punish in this
manner, and with this judgement. For the first, I
find five great plagues of pestilence recorded in the
holy Scriptures, and the speciall sinnes that were
the causes of them, are also plainly set downe. The
first great plague we read of, was that which is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, <hi>Numb. 11. 33. The wrath of the</hi> LORD <hi>was
kindled against the people, and the</hi> LORD <hi>smote the
people with a very great plague.</hi> And what was the
cause of that plague? Surely their murmuring and
discontentment at their present condition, their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnesse
to the LORD, who had brought
them out of the land of Egypt, Vers. 20. their loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Manna,</hi> Verse 6. (which the Prophet for the
excellency thereof calleth <hi>Angles food, Psal. 78. 25.</hi>
and the <hi>corne and bread of heaven, Psal. 78. 24. 105.
40.</hi>) their lusting after the flesh-pots of Egypt, and
longing to be there againe, <hi>Numb. 11. 45. Exod. 16. 3.</hi>
Secondly, Another we find mentioned, <hi>Numb. 14.</hi>
where, although the LORD was stayed by the
prayer of <hi>Moses</hi> from smiting the whole congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with the pestilence, and from dis-inheriting
them, as He threatned to do, Vers. 6. yet often of
those men that were sent to search out the Land, it is
said Vers. 37. that they <hi>died of the plague before the</hi>
LORD. And the cause of this is said to be, Verse
36, 37. that they <hi>did bring up a slander and evil report</hi>
upon the promised Land, and thereby made all the
congregation to murmure against <hi>Moses,</hi> who had
spoken so much good of it. Thirdly, Another great
plague, <hi>Moses</hi> hath set downe the story of, <hi>Numb. 16.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:4296:16"/>
49. wherein there died foureteene thousand and seven
hundred;</hi> and yet then so soone as <hi>wrath was gone out
from the</hi> LORD: so soone as <hi>the plague was begun,</hi>
as we read, Vers. 46,—48. <hi>Aaron</hi> (the true <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ype
of our onely High Priest, and effectuall Intercessour
for us unto GOD) went with his incense, and <hi>stood
betweene the dead and the living, and made an attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the people, and so the plague was stayed.</hi> How
fearefull a pestilence would that have beene, if it had
continued any time, if it had not been presently stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
And the sin that provoked GOD to send this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence
among His people, we find to have been their
murmuring and rebelling against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi>
the Ministers and servants of the LORD; as it is plain
by the 41 and 42 Verses of that Chapter. Fourthly,
The fourth memorable pestilence that we read of, is
that which is recorded, <hi>Num. 25.</hi> of which <hi>there fell in
one day</hi> (as the Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 8.) three and
twenty thousand. Moses</hi> in setting down that story saith
<hi>Numb. 25. 9. those that died in the plague were twenty
and foure thousand;</hi> putting all together in that
summe, that perished at that time, and for that sinne;
as well those whom himselfe and the judges had put
to death according to the commandment of GOD,
Vers. 4, 5. (which may seeme to have beene in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
about a thousand) as those that perished by that
plague which the LORD (in His fierce anger, as it is
said Vers. 4.) did send amongst them, which were
the three and twenty thousand that the Apostle
speaketh of. For that most of them that then perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
died of an extraordinary pestilence, (and not all
by the sword of the Magistrate, as some learned men
judge) may appeare by that which the HOLY
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:4296:17"/>
GHOST speaketh of it in other places, as <hi>Numb.
31. 16. There was a plague among the Congregation of
the</hi> LORD; and <hi>Iosh. 22. 17.</hi> where the very same
words are used by <hi>Phinehas,</hi> who had a chiefe hand
in the staying of it; and <hi>Psal. 106. 29, 30. The plague
brake in upon them, then stood up Phinehas, and executed
judgement, and so the plague was stayed.</hi> And what
was the cause of this strange and fearefull pestilence
that consumed in one day three and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand?
Surely it was whoredome, as both <hi>Moses
Numb. 25. 1, 6.</hi> and the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 8.</hi> do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
teach us. Fiftly, the fift and last plague we
read of in holy Scripture was in <hi>Davids</hi> time, the
story whereof is set downe, 2 <hi>Sam. 24. 15.</hi> this went
thorough all Israel <hi>from Dan even to Beersheba</hi> in three
dayes, and consumed in so short a time no lesse than
<hi>seventy thousand men.</hi> And the cause of this plague
was the pride of <hi>Davids</hi> heart, and the confidence
he reposed in his owne strength, and in the outward
meanes he had to defend himselfe by, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for his owne safety. And besides these five
great plagues, I find also mention made of another
dangerous and strange sicknesse wherewithall the
LORD in his just judgement did smite and afflict his
people in the Church of Corinth; which, though
I cannot certainly say it was the pestilence, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the text doth not expresly say so) yet I may
boldly say, it was an epidemicall disease, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
mortality, most likely to be it. <hi>Many are weake
and sicke among you,</hi> (saith the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 30.)
and many sleepe,</hi> that is, die of it. And the cause of this
sicknesse and mortality the Apostle tels us, was this,
that they came carelesly, unreverently, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:4296:17"/>
due preparation unto the holy Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see what sinnes have brought the
plague upon men in former times, yea upon such as
have beene GODS people by profession, aswell as
we. And, <hi>This happened unto them for ensample</hi> (as
the Apostle speaketh, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 11.</hi>) and all the seen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
samples are written and recorded in Scripture of
purpose for our admonition.</p>
                  <p>And although we read of no plagues that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
in the holy Scriptures, but those that I have
mentioned, and for those sinnes; yet find we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
other sinnes also which GOD hath threatned
to punish this way. GODS people were afraid that
He would <hi>fall upon them, and consume them with the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence,</hi>
(as we read, <hi>Exod. 5. 3.</hi>) even for their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
of His solemne worship and service; though
they were then in Egypt where they could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
it without extreme danger. And because
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> had despised and hardened his heart against
former and smaller judgements, the LORD threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<hi>(Exod. 9. 15.) to smite him and his people with the
pestilence.</hi> To conclude, the LORD did by His
Prophet <hi>Ieremiah 21. 5, 6.</hi> threaten in anger, and fury,
and in great wrath <hi>to smite the inhabitants of Ierusalem
both man and beast, and that they should die of a very
great pestilence;</hi> because they stood out in rebellion
against the King of Babylon, and refused to yeeld
unto him as GOD had commanded them: whereby
it appeareth, that an obstinate refusing to obey the
Word and commandment of GOD in any thing,
though it be such, as may be coloured with the
best pretences, will provoke Him to punish men this
way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:4296:18"/>
So then (to apply all this unto our selves) seeing it is<note place="margin">Applic.</note>
evident that we and our nation are guilty of all these
sinnes, for every one of which, we find in the Word,
that GOD hath brought and threatned to bring this
judgement upon His people in former times; seeing
we have beene 1. most unthankfull unto GOD
for our deliverance out of that spirituall Egypt, and
house of bondage wherein our fore-fathers lived:
and have shewed too much desire to returne thither
againe; and have loathed so long the heavenly food
of the Gospell of CHRIST more than ever they
did that Manna; and 2. have brought up and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
a most slanderous and evill report of the
promised Land, and of that strait way that leads un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it; speaking evill of and scorning the life and
power of godlinesse, and discouraging others from
it; murmuring against, and hating (to the death)
such of GODS servants, as either by doctrine, or
example, do presse and provoke us unto it; and 3 are
so ready (upon every occasion) to murmure and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell
against the servants and Ministers of the LORD;
content (indeed) to give them the hearing, but apt
to tell them (if they shall deale particularly and
roundly with us, and require of us obedience to the
truth, and practise of that that we heare and professe)
that they take too much upon them; seeing
4. whoredome doth every where so increase and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
in our Land; and 5. we are every whit as
proud of our owne strength, and as apt to put trust
in the arme of flesh, as <hi>David</hi> was; and 6. the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sacrament is (in all places) so commonly propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and those holy things given to and received
(without difference) by such dogs and swine as have
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4296:18"/>
no care at all d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly to prepare themselves thereunto;
seeing 7. the publique and solemne worship of
GOD is every where so much neglected; and 8 we
have so hardened our hearts against, and profited so
little by many other judgements, whereby the
LORD hath witnessed His wrath from heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us, and sought to bring us unto repentance;
and 9. we do continually (with so great obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy)
refuse to yeeld obedience to many of the expresse
commandements of GOD.</p>
                  <p>Seeing (I say) we are guilty of all these sinnes that
are the proper causes of this judgement, let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
impute this fearefull plague whereby GOD
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ath smitten the chiefe City, and many other parts
of our Land, unto these our sinnes; and justifie the
LORD in this judgement, the causes whereof are so
evidently to be found amongst us: yea let us all
feare, that He will execute His fierce wrath upon us
in the same manner, except we repent us of, and
forsake these sinnes. And this is the first way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we must make right use unto our selves of this
heavy judgement of GOD that is upon the Land.</p>
                  <p>The second is this, that seeing the LORD doth
thus declare and proclaime that His anger and fury
is kindled and inflamed against us all, it behooves us
(without delay) by all meanes to make our peace
with GOD, and to seeke reconciliation with Him.
<hi>Acquaint thy selfe now with Him</hi> (saith <hi>Eliphaz</hi> to <hi>Iob.</hi>
Chap. 22. 21.) <hi>and make peace with Him, thereby good
shall come unto thee.</hi> This, and this onely is the way
unto true safety and comfort. And marke that he
adviseth him to do it <hi>now.</hi> Now is the time to do it, if
ever we will do it, now that His hand is so stretched
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:4296:19"/>
out against us. And we are strangely hardned in our
sins, if (howsoever we have wretchedly neglected it
hitherto) we will do it now. If any shall aske me
what must I doe, and what course must I take
to make my peace with GOD?</p>
                  <p>I answer briefly and plainly, that there be three
things thou must do, if thou wouldest obtaine peace
with GOD: and if thou canst do these three things,
thou needest not doubt to obtaine it.</p>
                  <p>1. Thou must freely, and fully, and particularly
confesse thy sinnes unto GOD, even those sinnes
which I have shewed to be the chiefe causes of this
judgement. <hi>I said</hi> (saith <hi>David, Psal. 32. 5.) I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
my transgressions unto the</hi> LORD, <hi>and thou forga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
the iniquity of my sinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Thou must unfainedly and fully resolve with
thy selfe to cast off and forsake these and all other thy
sinnes, <hi>Prov. 28. 13. Who so confesseth and forsaketh his
sinne, shall find mercy.</hi> Though thou canst not quite
leave them (as who can do that in this life?) yet if
thou canst unfainedly and without dissimulation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
and purpose, and resolve with thy selfe to leave
them all, begging strength of GOD, that thou mayst
be made able to do it, then hast thou forsaken them
in GODS account; and they shall not hinder thy
peace and reconciliation with GOD. In this <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
tooke comfort. <hi>I am purposed,</hi> (saith he, <hi>Psal. 17.
3.) that my mouth shall not transgresse:</hi> and <hi>Psal. 39. 1.
I said</hi> (I fully resolved and determined with my
selfe) <hi>I will take heed to my wayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. And lastly, Thou must strive (by a lively
faith) to lay hold on GODS mercy in CHRIST,
and to get His bloud sprinkled upon thy heart.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4296:19"/>
CHRIST is <hi>our peace,</hi> as the Apostle cals Him, <hi>Eph.
2. 14.</hi> Neither can we (with all that we are able to
do) make our peace with GOD, but onely through
faith in Him. When the destroying Angell saw the
bloud of the lambe sprinkled upon the lintell and
side-posts of any doore, he passed by that house, and
smote none in it, <hi>Exod. 12. 23.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third way whereby we must make right use
to our selves of this judgement that we see upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
is this; it must increase our care to reforme
(not our selves onely, but) our families. It is a vaine
thing for any man to blesse himselfe or take comfort
in his repentance without this care; say not, if I use
all good meanes to make peace with GOD for my
selfe, I hope the faults of my family shall never be
imputed unto me. Search the Scriptures, and you
shall find there was never any man that was himselfe
reconciled and at peace with GOD, but his care was,
that his family might feare GOD, and be in favour
with Him, as well as himselfe. <hi>Cornelius</hi> (though he
were a Centurion, and kept a great family, and had
souldiers to serve him, yet) <hi>feared God with all his
house, Acts 10. 2.</hi> So soone as <hi>Zacheus</hi> himselfe was
become <hi>a sonne of Abraham</hi> (a true believer) <hi>salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
came unto his house</hi> too, <hi>Luke 19. 9.</hi> Christ promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
he should have a faithfull and a religious family.
So speaketh <hi>Eliphaz</hi> also to <hi>Iob, Iob 22. 23. If thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt
put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.</hi> No man that
is himselfe truly returned unto the Almighty, need
to be discouraged in this; if he do his endeavour,
God hath promised, that he shall be able (through
His gracious assistance and blessing) to reforme his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:4296:20"/>
family; though not to convert the heart of every
one in it, yet to keepe them from open and scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
offences. Certainly we do not make the right
use we ought, of this heavy scourge of God, unlesse
we be made thereby more carefull to reforme our
families. For this cause the Lord said He would not
conceale from <hi>Abraham</hi> His purpose against the
Sodomites, because He knew that he would make
this use of it. <hi>For I know him</hi> (saith the Lord, <hi>Gen. 18.
19.) that he will command his children, and his houshold
after him; and they shall keepe the way of the Lord to doe
justice and judgement; that the Lord may bring upon A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham
that which He hath spoken of him. 1. Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
(upon the knowledge and observation of Gods
wrath even upon the Sodomites) would become
more carefull to looke to his whole family, and to
reforme it. 2. God would assist and blesse him in
this his endeavour, and he should see the fruit of it in
his family. 3. This care that <hi>Abraham</hi> had of his
family should be a principall meanes to make good
unto him all Gods promises, to bring upon him, and
make sure unto him all the blessings and good things
that God had promised unto him, and without this
he could have had no assurance of them.</p>
                  <p>O that we could once believe and take to heart<note place="margin">Applic.</note>
these things. Certainly one maine cause of this, and
all other judgements that are upon our Land, is the
want of care that is in them that professe themselves
to be the people of God, in reforming their families;
whether they of their family be drunkards, or sober
persons; blasphemers, or such as feare an oath; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane,
or chast; prophane, or religious; is all one
to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:4296:20"/>
The fourth and last way whereby we must make
right use to our selves of this judgement, is this: it
must make us more mercifull to them that are in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse,
and more ready to relieve them. Nothing
will give us more assurance to be freed from the
plague our selves, or to find comfort and strength
in it, if God shall please to visit us by it, than this.
When Gods heavy hand did hang over <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,
Daniel</hi> speakes thus unto him, <hi>Dan. 4. 27.
Wherefore O King, let my counsell be acceptable unto the,
and breake off thy sinnes by righteousnesse, and thine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
by shewing mercy vnto the poore; if it may be a
lengthning to thy tranquillity.</hi> As if he should have
said, if any thing will lengthen thy tranquillity, and
keepe off the judgement threatned, this is likely to
do it. Remember what ourblessed Saviour hath said
of this, <hi>Mat. 5. 7. Blessed are the mercifull, for they shall
obtaine mercy.</hi> Nothing will give a man more assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to find mercy with God in the time of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse,
than this will. Remember also what His holy
Apostle saith of this, <hi>Iam. 2. 13. He shal have judgement
without mercy, that sheweth no mercy.</hi> If either the
plague, or any other judgement seize upon that man
that hath beene void of mercy, it shalbe upon him
without all mixture of mercy, he shall have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of Gods mercy in it; <hi>and mercy rejoyceth</hi> (or
boasteth) <hi>against judgement.</hi> The mercifull man shall
not feare this or any other judgement before it
come, as other men do: and if it do light upon him,
he shall rejoyce, and find a comfortable sense of
Gods mercy in it. And remember this at this time
especially, now you have kept a day of humbling
your selves before God; know that there is nothing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:4296:21"/>
that will more grace our solemne services before
God, (specially services of this kind) nothing will
make them more acceptable unto Him, than when
we shall therein manifest and declare our selves to be
mercifull and bountifull unto the poore, <hi>Is not this
the fast that I have chosen?</hi> (saith the Lord, <hi>Esa. 58. 6,
7.) to loose the bands of wickednesse, to undoe the heavy
burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye breake
every yoke? Is it not to deale thy bread to the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
and that thou bring the poore that are cast
out to thine house? When thou seest the
naked that thou cover him, and
that thou hide not thy
selfe from thine
own flesh?</hi>

                     </gap> brethren. Unto
these I will say but two words. 1. That God may
justly impute to thee the bloud both of our soldiers
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:4296:27"/>
that died so miserably, and of the many thousands
that have perished by the plague, because thou hast
not striven by thy prayers with God for them. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that rule of our Saviour, <hi>Mar. 3. 4.</hi> He
that useth not meanes to save life when it lieth in his
power, is a murtherer. 2. That this neglecting of
prayer is a dangerous signe that thou hast no feare
of God in thee. <hi>Thou castest off feare</hi> (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aith <hi>Eliphaz,
Iob 15. 4.) and restrainest prayer before God.</hi> It is a signe
thou believest not Gods providence. <hi>The foole hath
said in his heart, There is no God;</hi> (saith the Prophet,
<hi>Psal. 14. 1.)</hi> and one argument to prove this, he gives
Vers. 4. <hi>They call not upon the Lord.</hi> Lastly, this is a
signe that thou hast no comfort at all in God, no as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of His favour. <hi>Will the hypocrite</hi> (saith <hi>Iob,</hi>
Chap. 27. 10.) <hi>delight himselfe in the Almighty? will
he alwayes call upon God?</hi> The cause why men keepe
not a constant course in prayer, is because they have
no delight nor comfort in God. O let us therefore
make conscience of this duty to pray, and to pray
constantly; praying alwayes, as the Apostle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
<hi>Ephes. 6. 18.</hi> &amp; <hi>1 Thess. 5. 16. Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,</hi>
not giving over so good and necessary a duty,
when we have once begun to take it up.</p>
                  <p>The third sort of them whom this Doctrine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth,
are such as (through prophanenesse or
worldlinesse) will not pray. Though the State
have first enjoyned us to keepe these dayes of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
and 2. gone before us in it themselves, and
3. published for our helpe a booke of prayers, as
ample, holy, effectuall, and fit for the present occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as ever were in any Liturgy that I have seene;
(for all which we are greatly bound to praise the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:4296:28"/>
Lord) yet will they not upon these dayes lend their
help to their distressed brethren, nor joyne with us in
praier for them. These men certainly are of the mind
either of those prophane worldlings that say as <hi>Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
21. 15. What profit shal we have if we pray unto him?</hi> Can
we get in our harvest, or provide for our families by
comming to Church, and joyning with you in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er?
Or will our praying keepe away the plague
from us? Or els they are of the mind of those des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
Atheists that said, <hi>Es<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. 22. 13. Let us eat and
drinke; for, to morrow we shall die.</hi> This plague in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth
strangely, and is like enough to reach unto
us; let us therefore while we live be merry, and
make as much of our selves as we can. I grant, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man is not fit to keepe a fast every weeke, special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in this time of harvest; neither did the State in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to enjoyne him to do it: but not to joyne with
Gods people sometimes in this duty, specially on
these solemne dayes of humiliation, is, First, a great
sinne against our distressed brethren, for whom our
prayers would the more prevaile, the more generall
they were, and the more of us did joyne together in
them, as I have proved before out of <hi>2 Chron. 20. 13.</hi>
Secondly, a matter of great danger to themselves, as
that which will provoke Gods displeasure against
them. <hi>Levit. 23. 29. Whatsoever soule it be that shall not
be afflicted in that same day,</hi> (that the congregation
kept their fast on) <hi>he shall be cut off from among his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
In which respect God commanded them to
keepe it in <hi>all their dwellings, Levit. 23. 3.</hi> And <hi>Zeth.
1. 6.</hi> The Lord threatneth to stretch out His hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,
and to cut off them <hi>that have not sought the
Lord,</hi> then much more such as refuse to doe it,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4296:28"/>
being thus called,<note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> and provoked thereunto.</p>
                  <p>The third and last Use is for examination whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our prayers heretofore have beene, or now be
such, so powerfull and effectuall as have been descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
in this Doctrine; whether we be such Israelites
as (like Princes) have prevailed with God in them.
Gods children should inquire after their prayers
how they speed. <hi>David</hi> prayeth oft for an answer,
<hi>Psal. 143 1. In thy faithfulnesse answer me:</hi> and protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it would be a death to him to find God silent to
his prayers, <hi>Psal. 28. 1.</hi> And what answer hath God
given to our prayers? First, we have prayed for the
good successe of our armies against the enemies of
the Gospell. But the enemy hath still prevailed, so
that we may complaine as <hi>Psal. 44. 9, 10, 12. Thou
hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with
our armies; thou makest us turne backe from the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
and they which hate us spoile for themselves, thou
sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy
wealth by their price.</hi> Secondly, We have prayed for
the good successe of our Parliament, that the King,
and Nobles, and Commons might agree together
(as one man) for the setling of Gods Arke and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
among us, as they did in <hi>Solomons</hi> time, <hi>1 King.
8. 1.</hi> But the Parliament (for all our prayers) hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
such an end, as every good heart hath cause to
lament. Thirdly, We have prayed unto God to stay
His hand in the noysome pestilence. When <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ron</hi>
stood with his incense betweene the living and the
dead, the plague ceased, <hi>Numb. 16. 48.</hi> and <hi>Davids</hi>
prayer stayed the plague, <hi>2 Chro. 21. 17, 18.</hi> Our <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
and our <hi>Aarons,</hi> and the whole Land, have oft
prayed against this judgement, and ever since we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:4296:29"/>
to pray, the plague hath increased wonderfully.
So that we may complaine with the Church, <hi>La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. 3.
8. When I cry and shout, He sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tteth out my prayer.</hi> And
<hi>Psal. 80. 4. O Lord God of hosts, how long wilt thou be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
against the prayer of thy people?</hi> What is the cause
of this? I answer, surely (though there may be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
causes) yet this is the chiefe, <hi>Iam. 4. 3. We have as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and have not received, because we have asked amisse.</hi>
And that we may the better discerne, what hath been
amisse in our prayers, I will shew you how those
prayers should be qualified that should prevaile with
God.</p>
                  <p>First, We must pray fervently and importunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as they that will receive no nay in their suits. <hi>The

                     </gap>r of the
most righteous man that is, cannot be effectuall, nor
availe much, unlesse it be fervent. And to such pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
onely is the promise made, <hi>Ier. 29. 13. Ye shall seeke

cause why God hath given no better answer to our

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e we have beene in them, how little affected
we have beene with the miseries of our brethren,
whom we have seemed to pray for. When our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Saviour was in His agony, and his soule was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
sorrowfull even unto death, <hi>Mat. 26. 38.</hi>
His Disciples <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> whom He
desired to watch with Him, and to be some helpe to
Him in that His distresse, fell asleepe; so little sense
had they of His extreme misery, <hi>Mat. 26. 40.</hi> And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
so have we carried our selves towards our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
the members of Christ, we have pretended a
willingnesse to yeeld them our helpe in the miseries
they are in, but alas in the prayers that we have see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to make for them, we have beene overtaken
with drowsinesse and sleepinesse, we have beene in
them little or nothing at all touched with the sense of
their distresse. But as our Saviour said then unto
those His Disciples, <hi>Mat 26. 41. Watch and pray:</hi> So
say I unto you beloved, you can never do your
selves or your brethren good by your prayers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
when you pray you watch, and looke well to
your hearts, to keepe them from drowsinesse and
senslesnesse, from wandring and roving, that when
you pray, you may pray with fervency, and feeling
of your owne necessities, and of the necessities of
them that you do pray for. Let us not thinke that
(because we see no better fruit of our prayers) the
Lord hath beene displeased with us for keeping
these fasts, and presuming to become s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>itors to Him
for our brethren. But let us rather judge, that He
hath therefore delayed to answer us hitherto, that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:4296:30"/>
He might cause us hereby to cry lowder, and to be
more importunate and fervent with Him in our
prayers. For, so dealt He with the good woman of
Canaan, <hi>Mat. 15. 22, 24. 26.</hi> He did not onely delay
to helpe her, but by His neglecting of her, and the
rough answers He gave her, seemed angry with her,
and willing to discourage her, not out of any dislike
He had to her or her suit, (wherewith doubtlesse He
was much pleased) but onely to increase her ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and importunity in prayer.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We must pray in faith, and confidence
to be heard, <hi>Let him aske in faith</hi> (saith the Apostle,
<hi>Iam. 1. 6, 7.) els let him not think that he shall receive any
thing of the Lord.</hi> And surely we have just cause to
pray in faith and confidence that we shall prevaile
with God in these prayers that we make for our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
brethren. Many good grounds of confidence
we have.</p>
                  <p>1. We have heard that it is the will and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
of God that we should pray for them. <hi>And
this is the confidence that we have in Him</hi> (saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
<hi>I I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h. 5. 14.) that if we aske any thing according
to His will, He heareth us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. These extraordinary prayers and fasts that we
keepe, are injoyned us by publique authority of our
gracious Soveraigne, and of the State. And even
that is a thing highly pleasing unto God, and will
much further the successe of our prayers. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
also it is mentioned by the Holy Ghost as a
matter of no small impor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ance, in two of the most
succesfull fasts; that is, in that of <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>dah, 2 Chron. 20.
3. Iehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seeke the Lord,
and proclaimed a fast throughout all ludah.</hi> And in that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:4296:30"/>
of the Ninivites, <hi>Ion. 3. 7. He caused it to be proclaimed
and published through Niniveh, (by the decree of the
King and his Nobles) saying,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>3. These fasts are kept generally, and every
where throughout the Land; and that is also a thing
that God is much pleased with; such prayers, and
dayes of humiliation that have beene so universall,
have beene wont much to prevaile with God: as we
have already heard out of <hi>Iudg. 20. 26.</hi> &amp; <hi>2 Chron. 20.
3, 13.</hi> &amp; <hi>Ion. 3. 5, 7, 8.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. The nation and people that we pray for, are
Gods owne people, and such as beare His Name.
Admit our Land be as sinfull as <hi>Sodom</hi> was, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that if there had beene but ten such in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>om,</hi>
as we have many thousands of in our Land,
God had heard <hi>Abrahams</hi> prayer even for <hi>Sodom,</hi>
because of them, <hi>Gen. 18. 32.</hi> Of our Land (blessed
be God) we may yet say, there is no nation in the
world at this day, that hath so many righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in it; or that hath the Gospell preached in it in
that sincerity and power as we have. Nay, there is
no City in the world where the Gospell is so plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and so faithfully preached, nor wherein God is
so purely worshipped, as in that City that we meet
together this day to pray for. And what an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
that may be unto us in our prayers, is
plaine by that speech of the Prophet in his prayer
unto God for <hi>Iudah, Ier. 14. 9. Yet thou O Lord
art in the midst of us, and we are called by thy Name,
leave us not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this must be acknowledged for another
cause why our prayers hitherto have sped no better,
we have not prayed in faith. Many have joyned
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:4296:31"/>
with us, whose persons God never yet accepted, or
was well pleased with. And till God have respect
to <hi>Abel</hi> himselfe, He will never have respect to any
off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing of his, <hi>Gen. 4. 4.</hi> And such of us as are in the
state of grace, yet have we not stirred up our faith,
and confidence to speed, in the prayers we have
made. Do it hereafter, and thou shalt be sure to
speed the better in thy prayers for it. Say unto thy
soule when thou preparest thy selfe to pray, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
did, <hi>Psal. 42. 11, Why art thou cast downe O my soule?
and why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in
God; for I shall yet praise Him, who is the health of my
countenance, and my God.</hi> Put thy confidence in God,
hope and expect to receive a gracious answer from
Him when thou prayest unto Him, and thou shalt
find better successe in thy prayers, than thou hast
beene wont to do.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We must pray in sense of our owne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthinesse;
no man is fit to pray for Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
but he that feeles <hi>the plague of his owne heart,</hi> as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
speaketh, <hi>I King. 8. 38.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how can that be? (will you say) if I have
when I pray, a deepe apprehension and sense of
mine owne unworthinesse and sinne, how can I be
import<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nate with God in my prayer? How can I
pray in faith, or be confident that He will heare me?
This must needs deprive a man of all boldnesse, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage,
and make him afraid to speake unto God.
This effect the sense of sinne seemes to have had in
<hi>David,</hi> when he cryed <hi>Psal. 40. 12. Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e iniquities
have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to looke up:
they are more than the haires of mine head, therefore mine
heart faileth me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:4296:31"/>
But to this I answer, that no faithfull man hath
cause to feare this. For, Gods people have never
beene so strong with Him in prayer, as when they
were most abased and dejected in themselves, insense
of their owne weakenesse and unworthinesse. <hi>When
I am weake</hi> (saith the Apostle <hi>2 Cor. 12. 10.</hi> weake,
and dejected in my selfe through sense of mine owne
infirmities and afflictions) <hi>then am I strong:</hi> strong
in the Lord, and fittest to do Him service in an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
manner. See an example and type of this
in <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cob, Gen. 32. 25, 26</hi> Never was he so strong with
God, as when the hollow of his thigh was out of
joynt. <hi>He had power over the Angell</hi> (over Christ
the Angell of the covenant, saith the Prophet, <hi>Hos.
12. 4.) and prevailed. He wept and made supplication
unto Him, He found Him in Bethel.</hi> Why wept he so?
Certainly from the sense of his owne infirmity and
unworthinesse; but he prevailed with God in his
supplications neverthelesse, but much the more for
that. See this also in the good woman of Canaan;
do you not thinke she was much abased in her selfe
upon those three repulses that she had received, <hi>Mat.
15. 27.</hi> yet was her prayer then most strong and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
with God, Vers. 28. And this is surely ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cause, why our prayers for our brethren have
beene so weake, and without force with God; we
are too strong, too well perswaded of our selves, to
do Gods people any good with our prayers.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, We must bring with us unto prayer an
unfeigned desire, and a full purpose and resolution
of heart to reforme that that is amisse both in our
selves and others, and so to remove the cause of
Gods displeasure that is kindled against us. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:4296:32"/>
this would give wonderfull force unto our
prayers. This was that that gave such force unto
the fasting and praying of the Ninivites, <hi>Ion. 3.</hi> See
their care and desire. <hi>Let them turne every one from
his evill way,</hi> (say the King and his Nobles in their
proclamation, Verse 8.) <hi>and from the violence that is
in their hands.</hi> See also both the performance of
that they resolved to do; and how nothing so much
prevailed with God for the successe of their prayers
as this, Verse <hi>10. God saw their workes, that they
turned from their evill way, and God repented of
the evill that He had said He would do unt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> them, and He
did it not.</hi> Therefore hath it been usuall with Gods
people in their solemne fasts, not onely to make full
and particular confession of their sinnes, but also to
vow unto God that they would leave and forsake
them; yea they were wont solemnly to bind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
unto this. All this is evident, <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eb. 9. 12, 38.</hi>
&amp; <hi>10. 29. When Phinehas stood up and executed judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
(upon <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cozbi,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> and the Iudges
had before done of many others that were joyned
unto <hi>Baal-Peor, Numb. 25. 4, 5.</hi> and so removed the
cause of Gods displeasure) <hi>the plague was stayed,</hi> saith
the Prophet, <hi>Psal. 106. 30.</hi> All the <hi>weeping of the
whole congregation before the doore of the tabernacle</hi> (of
which we read <hi>Numb. 25. 6.)</hi> could do nothing
without that. O that God would put into the hearts
of all our Magistrates, not onely to appoint and keep
solemne and generall fasts, but also (by severe exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of the lawes) to remove the causes of all our
plagues. Our King and State (blessed be God)
have made good Lawes against idolatry, swearing,
prophanation of the Sabbath, murther, and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:4296:32"/>
but (alas) we want such as <hi>Phinehas,</hi> to
see the lawes executed upon any of these offendors;
and therefore it is no marvell though the plague be
not stayed. While these fowle sinnes are winked at,
and go unpunished, what hope can we have that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our owne prayers, or the prayers of all the
Saints upon earth, should prevaile with God for our
Land? Till the <hi>Achans</hi> be found out and punished,
(as found they may easily be, for <hi>they do</hi> every where
<hi>declare their sinne as Sodom, they hide it not,</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
speaketh, <hi>Esa. 3. 9.)</hi> but till they be punished, as
God did say to <hi>Ioshua, Icsh. 7. 10, 11. Get thee up, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

lyest thou thus upon thy face? Israel hath sinned;</hi>
so will He to us: why do you thus fast, and pray,
and make such shew of humiliation as you do? find
out the sinnes, and punish them that are the causes of
Mine anger, and then I wilbe appeased toward you,
and your Land.</p>
                  <p>Certainly one chiefe cause why our fasting and
praying hath done so little good, is because this
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h not beene done. Nay, many of these lewd
men that are guilty of these foule sinnes, intrude
themselves into our assemblies, and joyne with us
in these holy duties. And we know that <hi>the sacrifice
of the wicked is abomination unto the Lord, Prov. 15. 8.</hi>
Let me therefore exhort you (beloved) that as you
desire to please God in this profession of humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that you make, and to benefit your selves or your
brethren by your prayers; resolve both to forsake
every knowne sinne, and vow unto God this day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment
of life, in such particulars as thine owne
heart can tell thee thou hast most offended God by;
(and which of us all is it that hath not something to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:4296:33"/>
reforme?) remembring alwayes that speech of the
Prophet, <hi>Psal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 66. 18. If I regardiniquity in my heart;
the Lord will not heare me;</hi> as also 2. to do what lies
in thee to reforme others.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly and lastly. We must joyne workes of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
with our prayers. 1. Let no man thinke he shall
be a looser by that that he gives (out of conscience
towards God) unto the poore. <hi>He that hath pitie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the poore, lendeth unto the Lord</hi> (saith the Holy
Ghost, <hi>Prov. 19. 17.) and that that he hath given, will
He pay him againe.</hi> 2. Of all almes that is given,
that is best and most pleasing unto God, that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in our Church-assemblies: for, it is an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of God (and even a Sabbath-duty) that colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
should be made for the poore when we meet
together, as is plaine by that speech of the Apostle,
<hi>1 Cor. 16. 1, 2.</hi> And of that that is thus given, you
may have much more assurance, that it shalbe given
to them onely that have need, than you can have of
much of that that you give at your doores. 3. There
is great force in this worke of mercy to further the
good successe of our prayers: els would not the
Angell have said thus unto <hi>Cornelius, Acts 10. 4. Thy
prayers and thine almes are come up for a memoriall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God.</hi> His almes-deeds made his prayers
more available with God, than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
they would
have beene.</p>

sackcl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from hence conceive that we also are now bound to

                  <p>First, that in those dayes it was neither enjoyned,
nor used as a religious ceremony appropriated to
this part of Gods worship, but as a civill signe

wearing of blacke is now among us. So in that

heads, 1 King. 20. 32.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how should it be so much used in this so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
a part of Gods worship,<note place="margin">Object.</note> and enjoyned also by
the Lord, if it were meerely a civill thing, and no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
ceremony?</p>
                  <p>I answer:<note place="margin">Answ.</note> We are now enjoyned in our Church-assemblies
to weare such apparell as is comely, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and fit for our estate and condition; <hi>I will</hi> (saith
the Apostle, speaking of the behaviour of all Gods
people in the publike assemblies, <hi>1 Tim. 2. 9.) in like
manner also that women adorne themselves in modest ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell,
with shamefastnesse and sobriety;</hi> and yet is that
no Ecclesiasticall ceremony, no matter of religion,
but a thing meerly civill.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We must understand, that in these ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:4296:34"/>
things, that might be decent and fit in one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
(and consequently commanded of God) which
in another Country is utterly undecent, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
forbidden. It was a great sinne among the
Corinthians for a woman to come into the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
with her head uncovered; that is, without a
veile to cover her whole head, <hi>1 Cor. 11. 5.</hi> In our
congregations (because it is undecent) it were a sinne
for a woman to come so attired. In which respect,
though we have oft in the New Testament mention
of fasts both publike and private; of sackcloth used
in them, we have no mention at all.</p>
                  <p>Now this being premised for the understanding
of the words,<note place="margin">Nota. 3.</note> the thing we have to observe in them
for our instruction is this; that <hi>David</hi> in his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
prayer used these outward and bodily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises
as helpes to his prayer: and from this we
have to learne what we should do in the like case:
that is,</p>
                  <p>That in the dayes of our humiliation,<note place="margin">Doct. 3.</note> besides fervent
prayer, and the inward afflicting of the soule, there are
certaine outward and bodily exercises to be used by Gods
people.</p>
                  <p>As in our ordinary prayers there be certaine out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things may helpe us much, and consequently
may not be neglected; (as 1. fit time and place,
wherein we may be freest from distraction. Our
blessed Saviour himselfe <hi>in the morning before day,
went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
as we read, <hi>Mar. 1. 35.</hi> and commands us <hi>(Mat.
6. 6.)</hi> to go into a closet to make our private prayers,
and to shut the doore to us: and 2. fit gestures also;
as kneeling when we can. <hi>O come let us worship and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:4296:35"/>
fall downe; let us kneele before the Lord our maker,</hi> saith
the Prophet, <hi>Psal. 95. 6.</hi> and standing up when we
cannot conveniently kneele. The Publican (though
he were much humbled and dejected in himselfe)
stood when he prayed even in the Temple, as we
read, <hi>Luke 18. 13.</hi> For, that also is a signe of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and humility. When <hi>Eglon</hi> heard <hi>Ehud</hi> say, he
<hi>had a message to him from God: he arose out of his seat,
Iudg. 3. 20.)</hi> so in our extraordinary prayers there
be certaine outward and bodily exercises that may
helpe us much, and are therefore not to be negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by us. And those are of two sorts; some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in doing and performing certaine duties; and
some in forbearing some such things as at other
times we may use.</p>
                  <p>Foure things I find performed by Gods people
at the times of their extraordinary prayers, and
dayes of humiliation, specially such as have been
publike and solemne.</p>
                  <p>First, The reading and preaching of the Word.
Two notable examples we have for this. <hi>Neh. 9. 3.
They stood up in their place, and read in the Booke of the
Law of the Lord their God one fourth part of the day.</hi> And
how did they read? That you shall find <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 8.
<hi>They gave the sense, and caused them to understand the
reading.</hi> Yea they applied it so effectually, that it
wrought marvellously upon the peoples hearts, as
appeareth Verse 9. The other example is <hi>Ier. 36. 5, 6.
Ieremiah commanded Baru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h, saying, I am shut up, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
go into the house of the Lord: therefore go thou, and
read in the roll which thou hast written from my mouth,
the words of the Lord in the eares of the people, in the
Lords house; upon the fasting day.</hi> And why did they
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:4296:35"/>
use this? Not so much for the inlightning and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the judgement, as 1. for to worke upon
the heart, and further it in humiliation: for, the
Word is powerfull that way, <hi>Ier. 23. 29. Is not my
Word like a hammer that breaketh the rocke in peeces?</hi> It
is like <hi>Aarons</hi> rod, that is able to fetch water out of
the rocke, <hi>Exod. 17. 6.</hi> And 2. to quicken the heart
to fervent prayer: This reason <hi>Ieremy</hi> gives why he
would have preached to them on the day of their
fast; and when he could not do that, would needs
have <hi>Baruch</hi> read the Word to them, <hi>Ier. 36. 7. It may
be they will present their supplication before the Lord:</hi> this
will stirre them up to pray fervently.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I find singing of Psalmes used in a most
publike and solemne fast, <hi>2 Chron. 20. 19.</hi> For, as
there be Psalmes of all sorts, of mourning and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,
as well as of thanksgiving; so is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of singing them a singular meanes to stirre up
holy affections of all sorts, <hi>Ephes. 5. 18, 19. Be ye
filled with the Spirit: speaking to your selves in
Psalmes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I find Gods people have used to joyne
with their extraordinary prayers (as a meanes to
make them the more effectuall) almes-deeds and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to the poore, <hi>Acts 10. 4. Thy prayers and thine
almes-deeds are come up for a memoriall before God.</hi> And
no marvell: for, see what testimony our Saviour
gives unto this, <hi>Luke 11. 41. Give almes of such
things as ye have, and behold all things are cleane un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly and lastly, I find that in their solemne
fasts they have beene wont to examine and inquire
what foule sinnes have beene committed amongst
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:4296:36"/>
them, that might be the causes of Gods judgements;
and to censure and reforme them. This to have
beene the custome of Gods people, may appeare
by the fast that was kept in <hi>Iezrel, 1 King. 21. 8,—10.
Iesabel</hi> wrote to the Elders and Nobles there, to
proclaime a fast: (upon occasion pretended (as it
seemes) of some great judgement on the land, or on
that city, present, or feared) In this fast inquiry was
made (as it may appeare) what should be the cause
of that judgement. Two false witnesses step up,
(suborned for the nonce) and charge <hi>Naboth</hi> to be
the cause of that judgement; for he had blasphemed
God and the King. And indeed of all things that can
be done at a fast, this hath beene held by Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
the principall, and that that would give more
force to their prayers than any thing els. See it in
<hi>Ezra 10. 1,—3.</hi> so <hi>Ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. 9. 2. The seed of Israel</hi> (upon
the day of their fast) <hi>separated themselves from all
strangers.</hi> And Verse 38. they made a solemne <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
with God, and (Cap. 10. 29, 30.) bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by an oath <hi>to walke in Gods Law, and to observe,
and do all His commandements,</hi> and that they would no
more match with idolaters. Where this was not
done (by those whom it concerned) where no care
was taken to find out and amend those things that
did provoke God to wrath, the prayers of the best
men in the world could never prevaile much with
God. See a notable example of this, <hi>Iosh. 7.</hi> A bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
man than <hi>Ioshua</hi> could not pray; a more fervent

from this sinne. And as soone as <hi>Achan</hi> was

                     </gap>o be used in our extraordinary prayers, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in doing and performing of certaine duties.
There are some other helpes to be used which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in forbearing and wai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing our selves from some
things upon that day which at other times we may
lawfully use. Therefore the fast-day is called a day
of restraint, <hi>Ioel. 1. 14.</hi> &amp; <hi>Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>c. 7. 3.</hi> The Iewes say that
on every fast that they had kept (foure times a yeare
during the whole time of their captivi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y, <hi>Zac. 8. 19.)</hi>
they had <hi>separated themselves.</hi> Now the things
we must forbeare on the fast-day are five in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
                  <p>First, All manner of food; all kind of meat and
drinke whatsoever. So in the fast that <hi>Esther</hi> enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
they might <hi>neither eat nor drinke</hi> while the fast
lasted, <hi>Est. 4. 16.</hi> And so in the fast of <hi>Niniveh, Ion. 3.
7. Let them not taste any thing, let them not feed, nor
drinke water.</hi> So of <hi>Ezra</hi> (Chap. 10. 6.) it is said that
on the fast-day <hi>he did eat no bread, nor drinke water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, All costlinesse and neatnesse in our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell
and attire must be forborne on that day. See
such examples for this as are beyond all exception,
even of great Princes. In a private and domesticall
fast (I meane not a secret fast, of which our Saviour
saith <hi>Mat. 6. 17. When thou fast<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>st, annoint thine head,
and wash thy face)</hi> it is said of <hi>David, 2 Sam. 12. 20.</hi> and
of <hi>Esther,</hi> Chap. 5. 1. that when their fast was ended,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:4296:37"/>
they <hi>changed their apparell,</hi> and put on that that befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their degree; which argueth plainly, that while
their fast lasted they had forborne to weare it. And
in a publike fast we have the like example of the
King of <hi>Nin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>veh, Ion. 3. 6. He laid his robe from him,
and c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>vered himselfe with sackcloth.</hi> For, as bravery,
costlinesse, and neatnesse in apparell hath great cause
to puffe up our flesh, and make it proud: so the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of the costlinesse and neatnesse of our apparell,
(when it is voluntary) is a speciall meanes both to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
and increase the humiliation of the heart. So
<hi>Mephibosheth</hi> sheweth his sorrow for <hi>Davids</hi> trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<hi>2 Sam. 19. 24. He had neither trimmed his beard, nor
washed his clothes, from the day that the King departed,
till he came againe in peace.</hi> So <hi>Exod. 33. 4. When the
people had heard those evill tidings,</hi> (that God would
not go with them into Canaan) <hi>they mourned, and no
man did put on his ornaments:</hi> and this they did by
Gods expresse commandement, as appeares in the
n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>x<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Verse.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we must abstaine (while the fast lasteth)
from delights of all sorts, from all meanes of joy and
gladnesse, which at other times are most lawfull: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
from the delight which is taken in the mariage
bed, <hi>1 Co. 7. 5.</hi> even the new-maried couple must do
it, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 16. much more from musicke, <hi>Dan. 6. 18.</hi>
and from all recreations whatsoever. It is spoken
of therefore as a foule sinne, <hi>Esa. 58. 3. Behold in the
day of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>our fasting ye find pleasure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, We must also abstaine from the works
of our calling, not onely servil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; (as on other holy
dayes, <hi>Levit 23 7, 8, 21, 25, 35.)</hi> but on the Sabbath,
and on the fast day all workes are forbidden, <hi>Levit
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:4296:37"/>
16. 29,</hi> &amp; 23, 28, 31. and that upon no small penalty,
<hi>Levit. 23. 30. Whatsoever soule it bee that doth any
work in that same day, the same soule will I destroy from
among his people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fiftly, and lastly, We must also upon the fast day
make some abatement of our naturall rest, and sleep,
<hi>2 Sam. 12. 16. David fasted, and went in, and lay all
night upon the earth;</hi> and <hi>Ioel 1. 13. Ly all night in
sack-cloth, ye ministers of my God;</hi> which it was not
possible for them to doe without some abatement of
their ordinary rest, and sleep. And the reason of
this is evident, because as ordinary, and much sleep
is a great means of satisfaction, and contentment to
the body <hi>(I said my bed shall comfort me,</hi> saith <hi>Ioel 7. 13.
my couch shall ease my complaint)</hi> soe doth the want of it
afflict the body much, as appeareth also by <hi>Iobs</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.
<hi>VVearisome nights are appointed to me</hi> (saith he
<hi>Iob 7. 3, 4.) when I lye downe, Isay, when shall I arise,
and the night be gone? and I am fall of tossings to and fro
unto the dawning of the day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this separation, and restraint of our selves
from these foure things must continue during the
space of one whole day, that is foure and twenty
houres. No fast we read of in Scripture continued
for any lesse time. And we have expresse commaund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
we should keep it as a Sabbath, <hi>Levit. 16. 31. It
shall be a Sabbath of rest unto you.</hi> Yea in this very point
we should keep it as a Sabbath, <hi>Levit. 23. 32. It shall
begin in the ninth day</hi> (of the seventh mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>h) <hi>at even;
from even unto even shall ye celebrate your Sabbath.</hi> Now
before I proceed to give you the reasons why this
abstinence, and restraining of our selves in these
foure things should be so necessary upon the day of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:4296:38"/>
our fast, I must give you certain cautions to prevent
the mistaking of this Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>First;<note place="margin">Caution 1.</note> That this outward abstinence is not the
chief part of a true fast, not the chief help to our
prayers, the inward humiliation of the soule is farre
more acceptable to God, and hath more force to
make our prayers pierce the Heavens then all this.
<hi>Bodily exercise profiteth little</hi> (saith the Apostle <hi>1 Tim.
4. 8.</hi> and such are all these foure parts of abstinence
that you have heard of) <hi>But godlinesse</hi> (whereof the
inward afflicting of the soule, and mortifying of our
lusts is a chief part) <hi>is profitable unto all things. Rent
your hearts, and not your garments,</hi> saith the Prophet
<hi>Ioel 2. 13.</hi> Nay the restraining of our selves in these
foure things is in it selfe no service of God nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
at all unto him, further then as it is a help to
the inward humiliation of the heart, and even ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
by it. That that is said of the one of these
may bee fitly said of all, <hi>Mat. 15. 11. That which
goeth into the mouth defileth not a man:</hi> and <hi>Rom. 14.
17. The Kingdome of God</hi> (consisteth not in) <hi>meat or
drink.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Caution 2.</note> That these outward signes, and helpes
to humiliation must bee increased according to the
increase, and urgency of the cause. As there bee
degrees in Gods judgements on a land, or family, or
person, some more generall then other some, some
more extreame then other some, seven times more
grievous as the Lord speaketh, <hi>Levit. 26. 24.</hi> and
such as doe more deeply affect the heart; so ought
these outward signes, and helps of our humiliation,
bee proportionable thereunto. Whereas ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
the fasts wee read of lasted but a day <hi>(Levit. 23.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:4296:38"/>
32. from even to even. Iudg. 20. 26.</hi> they <hi>fasted that day
untill even. 2 Sam. 1. 12. they mourned, and wept, and
fasted untill even)</hi> the fast we read of, <hi>Esth. 4. 16.</hi> was
kept <hi>three dayes and three nights together.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any man shall aske me, doth not that example
bind us? I answer three things. 1. That we in these
Northerne Climates are not able to forbeare meat
so long as they in those Countries were. (Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
teacheth us that the Spaniard and Italian needs
not meat so much as we.) 2. We have not (blessed
be God) the like occasion. That judgement was so
extreme, generall, presently imminent, as they
might well hold out their fast so long with feeling,
and affection; which is the maine thing to be looked
unto in this case, and without hope, and likelihood
of that, the injoyning of the other were but grosse
hypocrisie, as is plain by that speech of our Saviour,
<hi>Matth. 15. 7, 8. 3.</hi> From that example we learne,
that though we cannot keepe so long a time without
any intermission as they did, yet when God shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
the causes and occasions of our humiliation,
we may and ought to increase and multiply our
fasts in that manner as the men of <hi>Iabesh Gilead</hi> did,
<hi>1 Sam. 31. 13.</hi> they <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>sted seven dayes.</hi> Which also ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth
this most Christian and religious decree of
our King and State, in injoyning (during this time of
so great calamity) a generall fast to be kept every
weeke.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Caution 3.</note> That this law of outward abstinence in
the dayes of our humiliation must give place to the
necessity of man; necessity (said I) yea even unto
decency and conveniency also in some sort. Though
we must on the fasting day abridge our selves in our
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:4296:39"/>
apparell, yet may we have respect to comlinesse in
our apparell even on that day. We may not disguise
our bodies, or make them ridiculous, as our Saviour
noteth it to have beene the fashion of hypocrites to
do. <hi>They disfigure their faces</hi> (saith He, <hi>Mat. 6. 16.)
that they may appeare unto men to fast.</hi> It is required e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of the Minister, and so likewise of other men, to
be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, comely and decent even that way, <hi>1 Tim.
3. 2.</hi> So though we must for the whole day of our
humiliation abstaine from all food, yet such as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
fast so long without evident danger 1. either of
their health, or 2 of making themselves unfit to
performe the spirituall duties of the day, may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
eat something upon the fast day. Two things
will make this evident.</p>
                  <p>First, The rest of the Sabbath (which is as stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly
injoyned as abstinence at a fast, yet) might be
lawfully broken for the preservation of a mans life,
as we see in <hi>Eliahs</hi> travell (1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 8.) five or sixe
Sabbaths together; yea for the preservation of the
life of a beast, <hi>Luke 14. 5.</hi> yea for the preservation
of the health of a beast, <hi>Luke 13. 15.</hi> For, God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
more in mercy, than in any externall workes
even of His owne s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rvice, <hi>Mat. 12. 7.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, This abstinence is injoyned but for a
helpe to our prayers, and other spirituall duties;
when once it ceaseth to be a helpe, and proves an
hinderance to them, then is it of no worth with
God. I grant that such as cannot thus abstaine, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
keepe a fast; but yet may they keepe a day of
humiliation in as acceptable and effectuall a manner,
as they that can fast best. Provided, 1. that they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use
not this liberty, and pretend necessity when
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:4296:39"/>
there is none; but remember that they have herein
to deale with God which knoweth their heart,
<hi>1 Thes. 2. 4. Gal. 5. 13. Brethren, ye are called unto liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
onely use not your liberty as an occasion to the flesh.</hi>
2. That that which they eat upon the day of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
be neither for quantity nor quality such, but
that they may still preserve in themselves such a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the want of food as may afflict nature, as we
see <hi>Daniel</hi> did, <hi>Dan. 10. 3. I eat no pleasant bread, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
came fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>sh nor wine within my mouth, neither did I
annoint my selfe at all, till three whole weekes were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for the reasons and grounds of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,<note place="margin">Reason</note>
why such bodily exercises (especially this
abstinence) must be used upon the dayes of our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation,
I need go no further than this; that God
hath ordained them in His Word, as you have heard;
and therefore we may be assured, 1. They are use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and profitable for us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For, whatsoever He
commands us to doe, is <hi>for our good, Deut. 10. 13.</hi>
2. That He will make them effectuall to His people
unto those ends He hath ordained them for. <hi>Teach
them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded
you</hi> (saith our Saviour, <hi>Mat. 28. 20.) and loe I am with
you alway even unto the end of the world.</hi> And those
ends are three principally.</p>
                  <p>First, to further and helpe forward the inward <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
humiliation of the heart, to make us the better to
feele what sinne is, and what it hath deserved at
Gods hands. For, as the full feeding and pleasing of
the body in these things, is a meanes to increase cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
<hi>Ier. 5. 7, 8. When I fed them to the full, then
they committed adultery,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>they were as fed horses in the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:4296:40"/>
morning,</hi> &amp;c. so the abridging of it in these things is
effectuall to weaken and abate the strength of sinne,
<hi>1 Cor. 9. 27. I keepe under my body, and bring it into sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</hi>
By this we take revenge of our selves, which
is a great helpe unto true repentance, as the Apostle
sheweth, <hi>2 Cor. 7. 11.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, To further and helpe forward the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency
of our hearts in prayer. This is evident by
that speech of Christ, <hi>Mar. 9. 29. This kind can come
forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, To professe and make outward prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
of our repentance and submission unto God,
and humble desire to be reconciled unto Him. And
even this is highly pleasing unto God, as we may see
in the example of <hi>Ahab, 1 King. 21. 29. Because he
humbleth himselfe before me, therefore I will not bring
the evill in his dayes;</hi> and of <hi>Rehoboam</hi> and his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<hi>They have humbled themselves</hi> (saith the Lord,
<hi>2 Chron. 12. 7.)</hi> therefore I will not destroy them:
and Verse 12. <hi>When Rehoboam humbled himselfe, the
wrath of the Lord turned from him;</hi> and yet had these
no truth of grace in them. In which respect
(Though 1. No man can please God in his fast, nor
find sound comfort to his soule in it, that is not in
his heart troubled for his sinne, doth not unfainedly
repent, that cannot pray, that doth not believe. <hi>We
know</hi> (saith the man that was borne blind, <hi>Ioh. 9. 31.)
that God heareth not sinners.</hi> And <hi>without faith it is
impossible to please God,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>Heb. 11. 6.</hi>
2. Though no man be fit to keep a private and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
fast, that is a novice in religion, and hath not
attained to some good measure of grace, for feare of
taking hurt, and being made the worse by it; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:4296:40"/>
to that speech of our Saviour, <hi>Luke 5. 36, 37.
The new piece will make the rent greater, the new wine
will burst the bottels.</hi> Yet) in publique and generall
calamities they may be injoyned to keepe a fast that
have no such measure of grace in them, as we see,
<hi>Ioel 1. 14. Gather the Elders, and all the inhabitants of
the land into the house of the Lord:</hi> &amp; 2 16. <hi>Gather the
children, and those that sucke the breasts.</hi> Yea it hath
g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eatly furthered the efficacy of the prayers of
Gods owne people, when in such a case all have
come (tag and rag, as we say) to joyne with them in
this service, as I noted to you the last day out of
<hi>Iudg. 20. 26.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If any man shall object,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Object.</note> 
                     <hi>God will not heare hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
and wicked men,</hi> Iob 27. 9. Will God heare his
cry? <hi>and</hi> if I regard iniquity in my heart <hi>(saith</hi> David,
Psal. 66. 18.) the Lord will not heare me.</p>
                  <p>I answer, It is true; such can have no assurance
that God will heare them or respect their prayers,<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
because they have no promise. <hi>Godlinesse hath the
promises,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>1 Tim. 4. 8.</hi> All Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
belong to the godly, and to them onely. But
yet for temporall blessings God hath oft had respect
to the cryes even of such as have had no truth of
grace; as is plaine <hi>Gen. 21. 17. God heard the voice
of Ishmael:</hi> and <hi>Psal. 78. 38. Many a time</hi> (upon their
prayers whom he had described, Vers. 37.) <hi>turned He
His anger away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For, 1. in this they were thus farre no hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
because they were heartily sensible of Gods
judgements, and desired unfainedly to be eased of
them. Therefore it is said, <hi>2 Chron. 12. 6. The Princes
of Israel and the King humbled themselves.</hi>

2. This taking to heart of Gods judgements, and
professing their humiliation, and their yeelding to
the commandement of authority in this case (as in
the dayes of the <hi>Iudges</hi> and <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> we heard all
the people did) these (I say) were good things, and
remainders of Gods image in them. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
the Holy Ghost saith, 2 <hi>Chron, 20. 12. In Iudah
the hand of God was to give them one heart, to do the
commandement of the King and of the Princes by the
Word of the Lord.</hi> And these remainders of His owne
image God loves wheresoever He sees them, <hi>Marke
10. 21. Iesus beholding him loved him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Use this Doctrine serveth unto, is,</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> For instruction to direct us how we should
keepe our fasts. Though this be a Doctrinall point,
and not so fit haply to worke upon our affections as
some other might be, and such as doth also concern
but the outside of the true fast, yet have I beene the
larger in it, because it may serve for a preparation to
all the fasts we shall keepe hereafter; and the fruit
and successe of our fasts depends on our performing
of them in that manner God hath appointed. Many
that are willing to obey God in this duty, may
through ignorance faile in the right manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
it, and so not onely lose their labour, but
offend God further, 1 <hi>Chron. 15. 13. The Lord our God</hi>
(said <hi>David) made a breach upon us, because we sought
Him not in due order.</hi> And though God have in our
fasts a principall respect to our hearts, 1 <hi>Sam. 16. 7.</hi>
yet lookes He also for the service of our bodies, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in such exercises of publike and solemne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
1 <hi>Cor. 6. 28. Glorifie God in your bodies,</hi> saith the
Apostle. And though these you have heard be not
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:4296:41"/>
the chief dutys to be performed at a fast, yet are they
duties commanded, and hee that makes not consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the least Commandement of God, can have
no comfort in his estate, <hi>Psal. 119. 6. Then shall I not be
ashamed when I have respect to all thy commandments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, For exhortation to us all to make
conscience of every one of these outward duties
that have beene commanded to us; that is</p>
                  <p>1. Of joyning with the congregation in hearing
the Word, even read aswell as preached. See what
a reverend respect Gods people shewed even to the
Word read, <hi>Nehem 8, 3. The eares of all the
people were attentive unto the booke of the Law;</hi> and ver.
5. <hi>When Ezra opened the booke</hi> (to read it) <hi>all the people
stood up.</hi> Make conscience to joine with the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in those prayers that are read aswell as in those
that are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceaved. For those that are read are holy, &amp;
good prayers, and all the congregation should make
their <hi>prayers and supplications with one accord,</hi> as they
did, <hi>Act. 1. 14.</hi> Hold thy selfe bound to joine with
the congregation in singing of Psalmes also. See
how well God shewed himselfe to bee pleased with
this duty, 2 <hi>Chron. 20. 22. When they began to sing,
and to praise; the Lord set ambushments against the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Ammon, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Of giving according to thy ability some
what to the poore, <hi>Luk. 21. 23.</hi> Christ tooke notice
of them that contributed, and praised the poore
widdow.</p>
                  <p>3. To make it a day of restraint in the matter of
food of all sorts, so farre as thy health will permit; in
the matter of thy apparell so farre as decency will
permit; in the matter of thy delights of all sorts;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:4296:42"/>
and in the matter of thy worldly affaires.</p>
                  <p>Yea 4. Of holding out in these duties a whole
day.</p>
                  <p>5. Take heed of hypocrisy, and thinking that
thy performance of these outward things will serve
thy turne, and merit at Gods hands. When our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
saw what <hi>an innumerable multitude of people
came to heare him, in so much that they trode one upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
(Luk. 12. 1.) hee began to say to his Disciples, first
of all, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees which is hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisy.</hi>
And this caveat we have all just cause to give
to you in such great assemblies as this is (specially at
our solemne feasts) take heed of hypocrisy, Rest not
in, nor blesse your selves in the deed you have done;
but referre these outward things unto those right
ends, which I have told you they were ordained for.
And remember alwayes that speach of the Apostle,
<hi>Rom. 2. 29. Hee is a lew which is one inwardly, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision</hi>
(so is humiliation also) <hi>is that of the heart, in
the spirit not in the letter, whose praise is not of men but of
God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> For reproofe of sundry abuses which
are chief causes why our fasts prevaile no more with
God.</p>
                  <p>First, Such are to bee reproved as refuse to joine
with Gods people in this duty, and will not separate
themselves from their profits, and delights, no not
so much as one day in a month, though God calls
them to it, and the King also commaunds them to
doe it. But like them of <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nasseh</hi> (of
whom we read, 2 <hi>Chron. 30. 10.)</hi> are ready to laugh
the officers to scorne, and to mocke them that in the
Kings name require them to doe it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:4296:42"/>
Let no man say, had we not better have their room
then their company? What good can wee hope to
receive by having such as they, to joyne with us in
our fasts? For (as you have heard) the coming of all in
this case, would do us good, and further our prayers;
and this open contempt that such men in all parts doe
shew, may make us all fare the worse. You there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that are officers doe what you can to restraine
them from their labours, and to bring them hither.
Remember that you are also comprehended in the
number of those servants to whom the charge is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<hi>Luk. 14. 23. Goe out, and compell them to come in
that my house may be filled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Such as doe come, and joyne with us
(though they doe that also but by the halves) but so
soone as they are gone forget the occasion of our
fasts, remember no longer the affliction of <hi>Ios<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ph,</hi>
give themselves as full liberty to all delights and jolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as if there were no judgement at all upon the land.
Marke well how God complaines of them that in a
time of common calamity, did give themselves li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
even in lawfull delights. Marke well that
speach, that you shall find, <hi>Esa. 22. 14. Surely this ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
shall not bee purged from you till yee dye, saith the
Lord of Hosts.</hi> Why what had they done? See that
verse, 13. <hi>Behold joy, and gladn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>sse, slaying of Oxen, and
killing of Sheep, eating of Flesh, and drinking of Wine.</hi>
Why what evill, or unlawfulnesse was there in all
this? True; but this was that that so much provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
the Lord that they gave themselves to this jollity
at such a time as <hi>the Lord God of Hosts did</hi> (by his
judgements) <hi>call them to weeping, and to mourning, to
baldnesse, and to girding with sack cloth;</hi> as wee read,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:4296:43"/>
verse 12. That they did this, with contempt of Gods
judgements, saying and resolving with themselves
thus profanely, and desperately, as verse 13. <hi>Let us
eate and drinke, for tomorrow we shall dye.</hi> And what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulnesse
was there in that which <hi>Amos</hi> so much
complaineth of <hi>Ames 6. 4. 6. In lying upon beds of lvory,</hi>
or in <hi>stretching themselves upon their couches,</hi> or in <hi>eating
the Lambs out of the flock, and the Calves out of the midst
of the stall;</hi> or in <hi>chaunting to the sound of the Viol, and
inventing to themselves instruments of musick like David;</hi>
or in <hi>drinking Wine in bowles, and annointing themselves
with the chiefe ointments?</hi> Were any of these things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull?
No, but because they did this in such a time,
as <hi>Ioseph</hi> (the Church of God) was in great affliction;
because they did hereby declare that they were <hi>not
grieved for the affliction of Ioseph;</hi> because they did by
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>se meanes <hi>put farre away from them the evill day,</hi> as
the Prophet speaketh, vers. 3. and made themselves
forgetfull, and senselesse of Gods judgement; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was the Lord so highly offended with them for
it. Consider of these places (well beloved) and you
will easily discerne, that in such evill times as these
are, in times of great calamity, either upon our selves
or upon our brethren, wee must all of us some what
abridge our selves both in our feasts, and in our bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
and in our lawf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll delights of all sorts whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
<hi>When the Lords sword is sharpened to make a sore
slaughter</hi> (saith the Prophet <hi>Eze. 21. 10.) when it is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bished
that it may glister</hi> (much lesse when wee see it
hath a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>eady made a great slaughter among our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
as we now see it hath, and is even dyed red with
their blood) <hi>should wee then make mirth?</hi> And if the
Lord will not allow us in such times the free use of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:4296:43"/>
our most lawfull delights, what will the Lord say
then to the mirth used even in this time of common
calamity in our alehouses, and at our wakes where
lewd men of all sorts <hi>assemble themselves by troupes,
Ier. 5. 7.</hi> to provoke one another to all kind of lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse?
Will there bee any hope our fasts shall doe
much good while our disordred wakes are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued,
and frequented so in such times as these are?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Such as having power in their hand doe
not endeavour to find out, and reforme the causes of
the plague. Though <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and all the Elders of Israel
should fall upon their faces, and cry never so fervent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
they can doe no good till <hi>Achan</hi> be found out, and
punished, <hi>Iosh. 7.</hi> And what hope then can we have to
prevaile in our fasts, while no care is taken to find out
<hi>Achan?</hi> The idolater is an <hi>Achan;</hi> and so is the
murtherer; and so is the adulterer, and so is the bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and so is the drunkard. And there is power
not in <hi>Ioshua</hi> onely, but in every officer among us, yea
in every man almost to find out our <hi>Achans,</hi> and
bring them to punishment. Our <hi>Achans</hi> are not so
close as that man was; our <hi>Achans</hi> do not hide their
accursed things as he did, <hi>Iosh. 7. 21.</hi> Endeavour
every one of you to finde them out and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
them, or else our fasts will bee
of small force with God.</p>

both to prosperity (a blessed, and comfortable estate)
and to adversity also, a wofull and afflicted state and
condition; and that not onely in the life to come but
even in this life also. For the first, See 3. <hi>Ioh. 2. I wish
thou maist prosper, and be in health even as thy soule pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spereth;</hi>
and for the other, See <hi>Psal. 31. 7. Thou hast

                  </p>
                  <p>Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, That as the prosperity, happines, &amp; glory
of the soule consisteth in inwardpeace, tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quility and
joy, <hi>Rom. 14. 17. The Kingdome of God is righteousnesse,
and peace and joy of the Holy Ghost;</hi> so that which hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:4296:44"/>
and afflicteth it is sorrow and feare, and such
like affections, which are therefore called the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and perturbations of the soule, <hi>Prov. 12. 25. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinesse
in the heart of man maketh it stoop,</hi> that is that
that humbleth it. Yea these affections of sorrow and
feare doe afflict the soule, and put it to paine even as
pricks, and wounds and the stinging of a Serpent
would doe the body. So it is said. <hi>Act. 2. 37. They
were pricked in their hearts,</hi> when by <hi>Peters</hi> sermon they
were brought to sound griefe of heart for sinne, and
feare of Gods wrath. So <hi>Prov. 23. 32.</hi> Sinne is said

                  <p>Thirdly, That sometimes the Lord himselfe doth
thus afflict, and humble the soule with sorrow, and
feare, <hi>Iob 5. 18. Hee woundeth, and his hands make
whole;</hi> and the strokes that hee gives prove usually
extreame, and intollerable, <hi>Psal. 51. 8. That the bones
that thou hast broken may rejoyce.</hi> The Lords strokes
broke his bones, <hi>Prov. 18. 14. A wounded spirit
who can beare?</hi> That is when the wound is given by
Gods hand, <hi>Heb. 10. 31. It is a fearefull thing to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hands of the living God;</hi> and sometimes Gods
people (for the preventing of this) have voluntarily
afflicted, and humbled their owne soules, by provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
themselves to sorrow, and feare whereby their
soules might bee humbled, knowing well, 1 <hi>Cor. 11.
31. If we would judge our selves we should not be judged
of the Lord.</hi> And so did <hi>David</hi> in this place, <hi>I humbled,</hi>
and afflicted <hi>my soule by fasting.</hi> So saith hee also, <hi>Psal.
69. 10. I wept and chastned my soule by fasting.</hi> And
this the Apostle in joines the faithfull to doe, <hi>Iam. 4.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:4296:45"/>
9. Be afflicted</hi> (he meanes not beare or suffer the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
God layeth upon you, but afflict your selves,
as appeares in the next words) <hi>and mourne and weep,
let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy into
heavinesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So then if wee would know the reason why <hi>David</hi>
did fast at this time,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>. 4.</note> it was to humble, and afflict his
soule, to work his soule to sorrow, and griefe: And
what meant hee in this his extraordinary prayer for
these men to afflict his soule thus? Surely it was to
make his prayer more available with God for them.
And from this his practise &amp; example, this Doctrine
ariseth for our instruction.</p>
                  <p>That the chief use of a religious fast is to humble,<note place="margin">Doct. 4.</note>
and afflict the soule with sorrow, and grief; and a
chief thing that makes our prayer effectuall with
God is the inward humiliation, and sorrow of our
soules from whence they do proceed. Two branches
there be (you see) of this doctrine, and I will handle
them distinctly.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">Branch. 1.</note> A religious fast serves chiefly to this end, to
humble, and afflict the soule. So <hi>Esa. 58. 5. The fast
that God hath chosen</hi> (is called) <hi>a day for a man to afflict
his soule in.</hi> This is a duty commanded upon the fast
day, <hi>Ioel 2. 13. Rend your hearts, and not your garments.</hi>
See how this is injoyned, <hi>Levit. 23. 29. Whatsoever
soule it bee that shall not be afflicted upon that day, shall bee
cut off from his people.</hi> So our Saviour gives this for a
reason why his Disciples could keep no fasts because
they <hi>could not mourne while the bridegroom was with
them, Math. 9. 15.</hi> So that no man can keepe a fast
well that cannot mourn, that hath not an humbled
and troubled soule in him on that day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:4296:45"/>
Therefore we read that Gods people in their fasts
were wont to weep much, and that not onely in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
and secret fasts, as <hi>Nehem. 14. I sate downe, and
wept, and mourned certaine dayes and fasted, and prayed
before the God of Heaven;</hi> but in publique also, <hi>Ezr.
10. 1. When Ezra prayed, and made confession of sinnes
weeping, and casting himselfe downe before the house of
God, there assembled unto him a very great congregation,
and the people wept very sore.</hi> Yea God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth his
people to doe so at such times. When God cals us to
keepe fasts he <hi>cals us to weeping, and to mourning, Esa,
22. 12.</hi> So <hi>Ioel 2. 12. Turne you to mee with all your
heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with
mourning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for the second branch of the Doctrine. A
chief thing that makes the prayers of Gods people at
a fast or at any other time most powerfull and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
with God, is the humiliation, and sorrow of
the soule, from which those prayers doe proceed.
See the proofe of this in the most powerfull fasts that
wee read of, <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>dg. 20. 26.</hi> In that fast wherein Israel
prevailed with God for successe against the <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi>
after two notable foils before, there were many
teares shed, <hi>all Israel wept before the Lord,</hi> yet were
there above ten thousand of as valiant men as ever
drew sword. In the fast that was kept in <hi>Samuels</hi> time
at <hi>Mizpeh,</hi> whereby Israel obtained a marvellous
victory against the Philistines, <hi>1 Sam. 7. 10. The Lord
thundred with a great thunder upon the Philistines on
that day,</hi> the people wept so aboundantly that they
are said, verse 6. <hi>to have drawne water</hi> (as by bucket
fuls) <hi>and to have powred it out before the Lord.</hi> Neither
hath this beene found true at fasts onely, but at all
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:4296:46"/>
times the more the heart of him that prayeth is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
the more power shall his prayer have with
God. See this in foure notable examples.</p>
                  <p>1. It was a powerfull prayer that <hi>Iacob</hi> made
when <hi>hee had power over the Angel, and prevailed,
Hos. 12. 4.</hi> But marke the story and you shall find he
was marvellously humbled, when hee did so marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
prevaile: Christ wrastled with him, and smote
his thigh out of joint, <hi>Gen. 32. 25.</hi> and <hi>Hos. 12. 4.</hi> it
is said <hi>he wept, and prayed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. It was a powerfull prayer that <hi>Hannah</hi> the
mother of <hi>Samuel</hi> made, when shee that was barren
by nature, obtained a sonne by it; but <hi>Anna</hi> was
greatly humbled, and afflicted in soule when shee
made that prayer, 1 <hi>Sam. 1. 10. She was in bitternesse
of soule, and prayed to the Lord, and wept sore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. It was a powerfull prayer that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> made
in his sicknesse, which reversed the sentence that
God had given him notice of, by his Prophet, and
procured fifteene yeeres more to bee added to his
life, 2 <hi>King. 20.</hi> But what was it, that made it so
powerfull? Surely it was the sorrow, and humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his heart. For so the Lord bids the Prophet
tell him, 2 <hi>King. 20. 5. I have heard thy prayer and have
seene thy teares.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Lastly, It was a most powerfull prayer
whereby <hi>Manasseh</hi> (one of the horriblest sinners
that ever lived) prevailed so farre that God was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
of him, and heard his supplication, 2 <hi>Chron.
33. 13.</hi> But when made hee that prayer? See verse
12. When <hi>he had humbled himselfe greatly before the
Lord.</hi> Therefore it is noted by the Prophet to bee
the ordinary course of the afflicted soule, that hee
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:4296:46"/>
may prevaile in his prayer, <hi>Lam. 3. 29. Hee putteth
his mouth in the dust, if so bee there may bee hope.</hi> To
breed hope in himselfe, that God will regard and
shew respect to his prayer, he abaseth, and humbleth
himselfe in the lowest manner that hee can. In so
much as upon these manifold experiments, Gods
people have growne wonderfully confident in this,
that when they could bring their hearts to this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation
and sorrow, their prayers then should cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
prevaile with God. See therefore how they
have pleaded teares even before God, <hi>Psal. 39. 12.
Heare my prayer O Lord, give care to my cry, hold not thy
peace at my teares,</hi> &amp; <hi>Psal. 6. 6. All the night long I
make my bed to swimme, I water my couch with my teares,</hi>
&amp; verse 8. <hi>The Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping.</hi>
As if he should have said, My teares cryed louder
then my tongue could doe, and the Lord had more
respect to my teares then to my words. The Lord
(I tell you) makes precious account of the teares of
his people, <hi>Psalm. 56. 8. Put thou my teares in thy bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
are they not in thy booke?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reasons,<note place="margin">Two sorts of reasons.</note> and grounds of this Doctrine are
worthy to bee inquired into; and the reason of two
things must bee inquired of. 1. What have beene
the causes of that sorrow, and humiliation that Gods
people have beene wont to afflict their soules with,
and which God hath had so much respect unto. 2.
What are the reasons why God hath had such delight
in this to see his people thus humbled, and afflicted in
their soules.</p>
                  <p>For the first, we shall find that the reason, &amp; ground
of the sorrow of Gods children, that God hath
beene so much delighted in, hath beene no wordly
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:4296:47"/>
thing. I deny not but they have also their worldly
sorrowes, but those make them never a whit the
more acceptable to God. Wee read of diverse that
have had their hearts afflicted, and humbled in great
measure, and yet their sorrow pleased God never a
whit, nor made their prayers ever a whit the more
powerfull with him. <hi>Nabals</hi> heart was heavy, and
sorrowfull enough, 1 <hi>Sam. 25. 37. It dyed within
him,</hi> for griefe, and feare, <hi>and became as a stone:</hi> and
so was <hi>Iudas</hi> his heart heavy enough, <hi>Mat. 27. 34.</hi>
And when <hi>Esau</hi> had lost the blessing, and birth-right
irrecoverably, <hi>Gen. 27. 34. He cryed out with a great
and exceeding bitter cry.</hi> Yea, even at fasts many have
afflicted their soules with sorrow, and pleased God
never a whit, nor prayed ever a whit the better, <hi>Esa.
58. 3. Wherefore have wee afflicted our soule and thou
takest no knowledge?</hi> &amp; <hi>Zach. 7. 3. Should I weep in the
fift month separating my selfe as I have done these so many
yeeres?</hi> The Lord denies not that they afflicted their
soules, and wept in their fasts, but saith, <hi>Zach. 7. 5.</hi>
they <hi>did it not unto him,</hi> they respected not the Lord,
but themselves in their sorrow, it was not a sorrow
according to God. Marke therefore the difference
of this sorrow of the godly, from the other in foure
grounds, and reasons of their sorrow.</p>
                  <p>First, The godly have afflicted their soules with
sorrow, for the afflictions of others out of a compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and fellow f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eling they have had of their mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
So did <hi>David</hi> heere. This pleaseth God well
as wee may see, in the comfort that <hi>Iob</hi> tooke in it,
<hi>Iob 30. 25. Did not I weep for him that was in trouble?
was not my soule grieved for the poore?</hi> So <hi>Ier. 13. 17.
Mine eye shall weep sore, and runne downe with teares,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:4296:47"/>
because the Lords flock is carried away captive.</hi> This
would please God well, if we could afflict our selves.
1. For that fearefull sicknesse, whereby God sweeps
away so many of our brethren, in so uncomfortable
a manner, they dye in our high wayes, and in our
fields without all meanes of comfort. 2. For the
poverty this brings on them that escape. 3. For the
captivity of the Lords flock in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and the <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The godly have afflicted their soules
with sorrow, when the Lord hath shewed himselfe
to be angry with them, either by threatning them by
his Word and Prophets, or by executing his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon them.</p>
                  <p>For the first, see two notable examples. The one,
<hi>Iudg. 2. 2, 5.</hi> When the Lord by his messenger had
chidden Israel, for making <hi>a league with the Cananites,
and not throwing down their altars;</hi> and threatned that
therefore <hi>he would not drive them out of their land, but
they should bee as thornes in their sides, and their Gods
should be a snare to them, they lift up their voice and wept,</hi>
and there was such weeping there, as the name of that
place was called <hi>Bochim.</hi> The other example is
<hi>Iosia,</hi> hee was humbled in his soule, and wept when
he but heard the Lords threats against Iuda, read out
of the booke of the Law, 2 <hi>Chron. 34. 27. Because
thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thy selfe
before the Lord thy God, when thou heardst his words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this place, and humbledst thy selfe before me, and
didst rent thy clothes, and weep before me, I have even
heard thee saith the Lord.</hi> Wherein also we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
how well God is pleased to see his people fall
into these passions of feare, and sorrow when he by
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:4296:48"/>
his word doth rebuke and threaten them. Which
the Lord also professeth, <hi>Esa. 66. 2. But to this man
will I looke, even to him that is poore, and of a contrite spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and trembleth at my Word.</hi> So when God hath
shewed himselfe to bee angry, and displeased with
them by executing any of his judgements upon
them, they have then beene wont, and it was their
duty then, to afflict their soules. <hi>If her father</hi> (saith
the Lord of <hi>Miriam, Num. 12. 14.) had but spit in her
face should shee not be ashamed seven dayes?</hi> See a plaine
proofe of this, 2 <hi>Chron. 7. 13. If I send pestilence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
my people, if my people shall humble themselves,
and pray, and seeke my face.</hi> Marke, not their owne
losse by the judgement should trouble them so much,
as Gods anger, and therefore in their prayer they
seeke Gods face, and favour above all things. And
this is very pleasing unto God, to see his people
humble themselves so under the strokes of his hand.
See a notable example of this, 2 <hi>Chron. 12. 3, 4.
Shishak King of Egypt came against Ierusalem with a
mighty Army, and tooke the fenced Cities that pertained
to Iudah, and came to Ierusalem.</hi> See what followed,
2 <hi>Chron. 12. 6. The Princes of Israel, and the King
humbled themselves, and they said, the Lord is righteous.</hi>
And what followed upon that, verse 7. <hi>And when
the Lord saw that they humbled themselves, the word of
the Lord came to Shemajah, saying, they have humbled
themselves, therefore I will not destroy them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When they have seene God dishonored
by the sins of others, then have they also mourned,
and afflicted their soules. <hi>Ieremy</hi> professeth, 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17.
<hi>If you will not heare, my soule shall weep in secret places
for your pride.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> professeth, that <hi>the Zeale
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:4296:48"/>
of Gods house</hi> (the inward vexation of his soule
through zealous sorrow, and indignation for the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
and profanation of Gods worship) <hi>had even
eaten him up,</hi> and consumed him, <hi>Psal. 69. 9.</hi> Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the foule sinnes that they have knowne in the
places (Townes, Congregations, Families,) where
themselves lived. So it is said of <hi>Lot, 2 Pet. 2. 8.
That righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing, and
hearing vexed his righteous soule from day to day, with
their unlawfull deeds.</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> saith, the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
should have done, 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 2. Ye are puffed up
and have not rather mourned.</hi> And see how highly
God is pleased with this when his people can mourn
for this cause, <hi>Ezek. 9. 4. And the Lord said unto
him (that was clothed with linen, and had the writers
inkhorne by his side) Goe through the midst of the City,
through the mids of Ierusalem, and set a marke upon the
foreheads of the men that sigh, and that cry for all the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
that be done in the midst thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly and lastly, The chief cause why they have
beene so given to mourning, and weeping, why they
have afflicted themselves so much, hath beene their
owne sinnes, whereby themselves have offended,
and dishonoured God. This <hi>David</hi> professeth was
the cause why his sorrow <hi>was continually before him,
he was sorry for his sinne, Psal. 38. 16. 17.</hi> This was
the cause why <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> wept so abundantly
that shee was able to wash Christs feet, with her
teares, shee was a sinner, <hi>Luk. 7. 37, 38.</hi> This sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
God wonderfully delights in more then in all
outward worship whatsoever, <hi>Psal. 51. 17. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
of God are a broken spirit, a broken and contrite
heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:4296:49"/>
Now come we to the second inquiry, to find out
the true causes and reasons of this, why God should
so much desire and delight to see His people hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with sorrow, to see them afflict and chasten
their soules in this manner. It is said of Him, that
<hi>He hath pleasure in the prosperity of His servants, Psal.
35 27.</hi> that <hi>He doth not afflict willingly, Lam. 3. 33.</hi>
that <hi>in all the afflictions of His people He is afflicted, Esa.
63. 9.</hi> And indeed it is true that our sorrowes in
themselves please not God, but onely in respect.</p>
                  <p>First, of the causes and fountaines from whence
they proceed; that is, 1. They are the worke of
His owne Spirit. It is the Spirit of God onely that
gives to any man such a fleshy and soft heart, as we
may see by that promise, <hi>Ezek. 11. 19. I will give
them one heart, and will put a new spirit within you: and
I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will
give them an heart of flesh:</hi> And <hi>I will powre upon them
my spirit, and they shall mourne abundantly,</hi> saith the
Lord, <hi>Zach. 12. 10.</hi> And God must needs take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in the worke of His owne grace and holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
2. These teares proceed from our love to
God. Kindnesse (you know) causeth teares more
than any thing els; so it is in this case. Christ saith
of the woman that wept so abundantly, that <hi>she loved
much, Luke 7. 47.</hi> And that which makes men most
of all to mourne for sinne, is the Spirit of grace,
which perswades us of Gods free love to us, and
that Christ was pierced by and for us, <hi>Zach. 12. 10.</hi>
And this (above many other workes of His Spirit)
God greatly delighteth in, 1 <hi>Cor. 8. 3. If any man
love God, the same is knowne of Him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, In respect of the end that this sorrow
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:4296:49"/>
tends unto, the issue and effect of it the Lord greatly
delighteth in it. He seeth we have need of it, 1 <hi>Pet.
1. 6. Now for a season (if need be) you are in heavinesse.</hi>
The Lord seeth it will do us much good, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
He is so well pleased with it, <hi>Eccles. 7. 3. By the
sadnesse of the countenance the heart is made better.</hi>
1. It makes us more capable of every grace of God,
and fitter to receive it. As the vessell that is full
can receive no good liquor, but all is spilt
that is powred upon it, and the emptier it is, the
more it will receive. So is it in this case, <hi>Iam. 4. 6.
God will give grace to the humble.</hi> For knowledge,
<hi>Psal. 25. 9. The meeke will He teach His way:</hi> and for
comfort, 2 <hi>Cor. 7. 6. God comforteth those that are cast
downe.</hi> 2. It worketh repentance unto salvation;
and the heart is never wont to be truly turned unto
God and changed, but the change begins here, 2 <hi>Cor.
7. 10. Godly sorrow worketh repentance unto salvation
not to be repented of.</hi> 3. It makes Christ and Gods
Word and Promises sweet unto us, and all Gods
mercies to relish well, as hunger makes us relish our
meat, and thirst our drinke, <hi>Prov. 27. 7. The full soule
loatheth an hony-combe, but to the hungry soule every
bitter thing is sweet.</hi> The prodigall, when he had
beene pinched with hunger, would have beene glad
with all his heart to have fared as his fathers servants
did, <hi>Luke 15. 19.</hi> O what sweetnesse found <hi>Paul</hi> in
Christ? <hi>I determined</hi> (saith he) <hi>not to know any thing
among you, save Iesus Christ, and Him crucified, 1 Cor.
2. 2.</hi> And what made his tast so good? He had been
deeply humbled in sense of his sinnes, as appeares
plainly by this, that he counted himselfe <hi>lesse than
the least of all Saints, Eph. 3. 8.</hi> and <hi>the chiefest of all</hi> the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:4296:50"/>
sinners that Christ came to save, 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 15.</hi> And
what sweetnesse did <hi>David</hi> find in Gods Word, and
promises, <hi>Psal. 119. 103. How sweet are thy words unto
my taste? Yea sweeter then hony to my mouth.</hi> And
how came he to this? O he had beene greatly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with sense of sinne as appeares, <hi>Psal. 40. 12. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
evils have compassed me about, mine iniquities
have taken hold upon me so that I am not able to looke up:
they are more then the haires of mine head, therefore my
heart faileth me.</hi> Yea this makes all Gods mercies
relish well, and our hearts to rejoyce, and be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for them; a farthing token, is to a very poore man
most acceptable. This we shall see in <hi>Iacobs</hi> example,
hee vowed great thankfulnesse to God if hee would
give him but <hi>bread to eate and raiment to put on,</hi> as wee
see, <hi>Gen. 28. 20.</hi> because hee was so humbled in the
sense of his owne unworthinesse, and could say, <hi>Gen.
32. 10. I am not worthy of the least of all thy mercies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. It makes them seeke to God more earnestly,
and pray more fervently. As it is said of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
himselfe, <hi>Luk. 22. 44.</hi> that <hi>being in an agony, he
prayed more earnestly;</hi> his inward abasement through
anguish of soule did adde much to the fervency of
his prayer; So it is also with all his members, they
never pray so fervently, as when they are most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
and afflicted in spirit: <hi>Lord in trouble have they
visited thee</hi> (saith the Prophet <hi>Esa. 26. 16.) they pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out a prayer when thy chastning was upon them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. And lastly, It makes a man fit to walke, and
converse with God, no man can be fit to doe so till
then, <hi>Mic. 6. 8.</hi> The Lord requires we should <hi>humble
our selves to walke with our God.</hi> We can never walke,
nor converse with God til we can humble our selves.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:4296:50"/>
And that both, 1. In respect of the Lord, who can
not delight to converse with any till he be humbled;
as no great man will be familiar with a saucy unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly
foole, that knowes not how to carry himselfe
before his betters, nor to give due respect unto him.
God cannot abide that <hi>flesh should glory in his presence,
1 Cor. 1. 29.</hi> &amp; 2 <hi>Sam. 22. 28. The afflicted people thou
wilt save: but thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou
maist bring them downe.</hi> The more we are humbled in
our selves, the more the Lord delights in us, to bee,
and converse with us. <hi>Though the Lord be high</hi> (saith
the Psalmist, <hi>Psal. 138. 6.) yet hath hee respect unto
the lowly, but the proud he knowes afarre of.</hi> And <hi>Esa. 57.
15. He will dwell with him that is of a contrite, and humble
spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. In respect of our selves wee are never fit to
walke with God, till we be truly humbled. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
serve God so as to please him till we can doe it
with reverence, and feare, <hi>Heb. 12. 28.</hi> Till then we
cannot heare the word as we should. <hi>All thy saints
are in thine hands</hi> (saith <hi>Moses, Deut. 33. 3.) and they
are humbled at thy feet, to receive thy words.</hi> Till then
we can never pray as we should. Till we can consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <hi>God is in the heaven</hi> (of high and incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
majesty) <hi>and we upon earth,</hi> base and vile worms,
wee shall bee apt to bee <hi>rash with our mouths, and our
heart will be hasty to utter any thing before God,</hi> as <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
speaketh, <hi>Eccle. 5. 2.</hi> Till then men will never
bee fearefull to offend him; no wee can never know
him nor our selves rightly till we have beene sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
humbled. <hi>I have heard of thee</hi> (saith <hi>Iob 42. 4.) by
the hearing of the eare, but now mine eye seeth thee. Iob</hi>
had a true, and saving knowledge of God before (as
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:4296:51"/>
he had also beene truly humbled in soule before)
but nothing to that he had, when God had thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
humbled him. And so it is said of <hi>Manasseh.
2 Chron. 33. 12. 13.</hi> That when he <hi>was in affliction,
and had humbled himselfe greatly; then Manasseh knew
that the Lord he was God.</hi> Till then we cannot yeeld
any acceptable and constant obedience unto
God. <hi>Ier. 44. 10. They are not humbled
even unto this day, neither have they feared,
nor walked in my Law, nor in my statutes,
that I set before you, and before
your fathers.</hi>

that <hi>David</hi> heere speaketh of, and hath beene com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
unto us in this Doctrine; that is, to be able
to afflict our owne soules with godly sorrow. And
for my better proceeding in handling of this use, and
for the help of your memory, and edification, I
will deliver unto you, 1. The motives whereby
you may be provoked to seeke this grace. 2. The
meanes you must use for the atteyning of it. 3. The
signes and tokens whereby you may discerne it.</p>
                  <p>First, Motives, I say; for you had need to have
forcible reasons shewed you why you should desire
it; none of us desire it as we ought, most men abhorre
all sorrow; they <hi>put farre away the evil day, Amos
6. 3.</hi> and give themselves to all meanes of mirth,
that they can devise <hi>Amos 6. 5, 6.</hi> And even in these
times wherein the Lord by so many meanes <hi>cals to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:4296:52"/>
mourning, and to weeping, behold joy, and gladnesse,</hi>
every where as it was in the Prophets time, <hi>Esa, 22.
12, 13. Every mans heart is in the house of mirth, Eccle.
7. 4.</hi> You had need therefore have forcible motives
given you to persuade you to seeke, and labour for
godly sorrow, for an afflicted and humbled heart. In
the stone of the kidny or bladder men need not be
persuaded to desire or seeke remedy, but in the stone
of the heart they doe.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">Motive 1.</note> Consider the examples of Gods servants,
whom God in his Word hath commended to us,
and whom <hi>we count happy men,</hi> as the Apostle spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
<hi>Iam. 5. 11.</hi> and we shall see they were men of
tender hearts, they were deeply humbled, and much
given to mourning and weeping for their sinnes,
<hi>David</hi> was much given to weeping for sinne, he spent
whole nights in weeping abundantly, <hi>Psal. 6. 6.</hi>
And <hi>Peter</hi> when he repented <hi>wept bitterly, Mat. 26.
75.</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> was so humbled all his dayes for the sins
he committed before his calling, that hee counted
himselfe not worthy to be called an Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor. 15
9</hi> Yea he judged himself <hi>lesse then the least of all Saints,
Ep. 3. 8.</hi> Yea they have been brought to the very point
&amp; brink of despaire, before they could come to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
So was <hi>Asaph</hi> when he cryed, <hi>Psal. 73, 26.
My flesh and my heart faileth.</hi> And so was <hi>Heman</hi>
when he complained, <hi>Psal. 88. 15. While I suffer thy
terrours, I am distracted.</hi> And so was <hi>David</hi> also
when he said thus in his prayer unto God, <hi>Psal. 40.
12. Mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so as
I am not able to looke up, they are more then the haires of
my head, therefore my heart faileth me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But these were fouler sinners (thou wilt say) then
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:4296:52"/>
ever thou wert. I will shew thee therefore examples
of such as whose sinnes were as small as thine. <hi>Iob</hi>
was never tainted with so fowle sinnes as thou hast
been; and yet his eyes were wont to <hi>poure out teares
unto God, 16. 20.</hi> He for that very forwardnesse
and impatiency he shewed in so great affliction <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred
himselfe, and repented in dust, and ashes, Iob 42.
6. Davids</hi> heart was so soft and tender, that it smote
him when he had but cut off the skirt of <hi>Sauls</hi> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
1 <hi>Sam. 24. 5.</hi> The poore man whose child
Christ dispossessed burst out into teares even for the
weakenesse of his faith, <hi>Mar. 9. 24. Paul</hi> was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellously
humbled even for his originall sinne, <hi>Rom.
7. 24. O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me
from the body of this death?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Consider these examples well, and thou must
needs conclude with thy selfe; 1. Surely it must
needs be a good thing; 2. Surely it must needs be a
necessary thing, that all Gods people have beene so
much given unto; Surely I have as much cause as
they had to weepe, and bee deeply humbled for my
sinnes.</p>
                  <p>But I will give thee another example farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then all these thy blessed Saviour that had no sin,
was much given to mourning, and weeping for the
the sinnes that thou, and such as thou art have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<hi>Mar. 3. 5.</hi> He mourned for the hardnesse
of the hearts, even of his enemies; <hi>He wept over Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,
Luc. 19. 41. His soule was exceeding sorrowfull,
unto death, Mat. 26. 38. He offred up prayers and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,
with strong crying, and teares, Heb. 5. 7.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Say not I have the lesse cause to grieve for my
sinnes, because hee grieved so much for them,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:4296:53"/>
                     <hi>Esay 53. 4. Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried
our sorrowes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For thou must become conformable unto him in
his sufferings, or thou shalt never have comfort in
them, <hi>Rom. 8. 29.</hi> &amp; 6. 5.</p>
                  <p>Say therefore to thine owne soule, if all Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
have beene so apt to weep and mourne, what
am I?</p>
                  <p>But before I proceede to the second Motive, two
questions and doubts must be ansvered, that may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
from the first.</p>
                  <p>Can I not be in the state of grace,<note place="margin">Object. 1.</note> unlesse I match
these examples, and be so tender hearted, and apt to
mourne as they?</p>
                  <p>I answer,<note place="margin">Answ. 1.</note> first thou mayest. All Gods children
have not beene humbled, nor broken in heart in the
same measure, and degree, and two reasons there be
of the difference.</p>
                  <p>First, In the persons themselves. Some of them
have beene more hainous sinners then others. And
according to the proportion of mens sins hath, and
must be the measure of mens humiliation. The hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouser
the sinne, the deeper, and of the longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
must the sorrow be.</p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Manaf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>es</hi> it is said, 2 <hi>Chron. 33. 12. He humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
greatly before God.</hi> Of <hi>David, Psal. 51. 8.</hi> that
his anguish and sorrow for sin, was like to the paine a
man feeleth that hath his bones broken. Of <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi>
that she wept so aboundantly as she could wash
Christs feet with her teares, <hi>Luc. 7. 38.</hi> Thinke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this thou that hast beene guilty of murther, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution,
whoredome, or such like hainous sinnes,
thy sorrow must be proportionable to the hainous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of thy sinnes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:4296:53"/>
The second reason of the difference is in the Lord,
who is the only worker &amp; giver of this grace. For as
in other graces he is pleased to give them in greater
measure to some of his elect, then to others, <hi>Mat. 13.
23.</hi> In some elect ground, the seed of the Word
yeelds but thirty, in some sixty, in some an hundred
fold. So is it in this.</p>
                  <p>Ordinarily the Lord useth by the spirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
and legal terrors to prepare men to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
and deeply to humble them, to give them
the spirit of bondage, <hi>Rom. 8. 15.</hi> But we read of
no such thing in the first conversion of <hi>Matthew:</hi>
though he had beene a Publican. For at his very first
conversion he made a great feast to Christ, <hi>Mat. 9. 9,
10.</hi> nor in those that <hi>Peter</hi> converted, for though
they were pricked in their hearts and deeply hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
before they beleeved, <hi>Act. 2. 37.</hi> Yet did their
sorrow, and feare continue nothing so long upon
them, as <hi>Davids</hi> did, they quickly attained to comfort
in the assurance of pardon, <hi>Act. 2. 41. 46</hi> Lydias e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xample
I doe of purpose omit, for shee (though shee
beleeved not in Christ till she heard <hi>Paul, Act. 16. 14.</hi>
yet) was converted, and feared God before Verse
13.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Answ. 2</note> Yet know this that all Gods elect. 1.
Find in themselves this humiliation even with legall
terrours at one time or other. For Christ was sent
to preach the Gospell to none, but <hi>to the broken-hearted,
to the captives, to the bruised, Luk. 4. 18.</hi> that
is to such as had the spirit of bondage, <hi>Rom. 8.
15.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. All Gods faithfull, and true hearted people
are in some true measure humbled, and can mourne,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:4296:54"/>
and afflict their soules for sinne, for they are all oft in
scripture stiled by this title. They are called <hi>the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
Psal. 34. 2. an afflicted and poore people, Zeph. 3. 12.
the poore of the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. 5. 3. Psal. 34 6, 3.</hi> They hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
bound to aime at the best marks, and to strive
to be like them that have most excelled in this grace
of brokennesse of spirit, &amp; ability to mourne for sin,
<hi>Phil. 3. 17. Brethren be followers together of mee, and
marke them that walke so, as ye have us for an ensample.</hi>
Thou art then in a wofull case if thou neither canst
mourne for thy sinne, nor strivest to doe it.</p>
                  <p>But yet there is a second question to be resolved.<note place="margin">Quest. 2.</note>
For we heare (may some say) that <hi>Iob,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> &amp;
<hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Hezechia,</hi> and <hi>Iosia,</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi>
have been much given to weeping, in their mourning
for sinne they have wept much. Can I not bee in the
state of grace, can I not have truely repented, nor
beene humbled for my sinne, unlesse I can doe
as they did, unlesse I can weepe for my
sinne?</p>
                  <p>I answer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <note place="margin">Answ. 1.</note> First, That the griefe, and mourning
for sinne be absolutely necessary unto unfained re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
teares are not alwayes so. And I will shew
you two reasons of the difference that is to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
betweene Gods people in this point.</p>
                  <p>First, The constitution of some mens bodyes
makes them much more unapt to weepe then others
are.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The very extreamity of griefe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
so oppresseth, and overwhelmeth mens hearts
(as <hi>David</hi> complaineth of himselfe, <hi>Psal. 143. 4. My
spirit is overwhelmed within me, my heart within mee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <pb n="91" facs="tcp:4296:54"/>
desolate)</hi> as they cannot ease themselves either by
words or teares. Gods people have beene oft in that
extreamity of griefe as they could not pray, I meane
not expresse in words the desires of their heart, but
with sighes, and groanings, <hi>Rom. 8. 26.</hi> In extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of sorrow some men cannot weepe. It is said of
<hi>David,</hi> and his company, 1 <hi>Sam. 30. 4. they had no
more power to weepe.</hi> So that I may say to thee that if
thou canst, by the signes that I shall by and by give
thee, approve that thou art able soundly to mourne,
and bee humbled for thy sinnes, though thou canst
not weepe for them, thou mayst be in the state of
grace for all that.</p>
                  <p>But secondly,<note place="margin">Answ. 2.</note> I answer, That if the constitution
of thy body will serve thee to weep for other things
and yet thou couldst never weep for thy sinnes, surely
thy case is fearefull. As to the man that can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
other things well enough, a tale, a play, but
a sermon, a chapter of the Bible, he cannot remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and excuseth the matter thus, my memory is
naught, I may say it is naught indeed with a witnes, it
is sinfully, it is damnably naught; so to thee that canst
weepe for other things but not for sinne, I may say,
flatter not thy selfe but strive to bee able to doe as
thou hearest other the good servants of God have
done, and that God hath beene so highly pleased
with them for, strive to bee able to weepe for thy
sinnes.</p>
                  <p>The second motive to persuade you to seeke for
this grace,<note place="margin">Motive 2.</note> is the consideration of the manifold pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
God hath made in his word to them that can
afflict their soules, and be rightly humbled for sinnes,
and the great benefite that this grace will bring with
it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:4296:55"/>
First,<note place="margin">Promise 1</note> This sorrow shall not be everlasting, <hi>Rev.
7. 17.</hi> but it shall end in comfort, <hi>Iohn 16. 20. Yee
shall be sorrowfull, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy,
Psal. 126. 5. They that sow in teares, shall reap in joy.
It is appointed unto them that mourne in Zion, that they
shall have the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ile of joy given them for their mourning,
the garment of praise for the spirit of heavines, Esa. 61. 3.</hi>
The Lord who is the father of mercies, &amp; God of all
consolation is cald a <hi>God that comforteth al those that are
cast downe, 2 Cor. 7. 6.</hi> Never found Gods people that
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort in Gods mercy &amp; in the assurance of the pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of their sins as when they have beene most humbled,
and able to weep most for their sinnes, <hi>Esa. 29. 19.
The meeke shall increase their joy in the Lord, and the poore
among men shall rejoyce in the holy one of Israel.</hi> The day
of humiliation when Gods people afflict their soules
before him, is called a day of attonement, <hi>Levit. 23.
27.</hi> For so is Gods promise, <hi>Zac. 13. 1. In that day
there shall be a fountaine opened to the house of David, and
to the inhabitants of Ierusalem, for sinne, and for unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, No man need feare hee shall bring himselfe
to desperation if he give way to this tendernesse of
heart, and sorrowing for sinne. For there is no such
medicine in the world to free thy heart from legall,
and desperate feares, and sorrowes, and to bring thy
heart to sweet peace, and comfort in God, as this is,
if thou couldst rightly mourne, and be humbled for
thy sinne. When those poore wretches that had cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
Christ, and were pricked in their hearts, with
intollerable feares, and sorrowes, and anguish of
soule for it, and cried out to the Apostles <hi>what shall we
doe? Act. 2. 37.</hi> Marke what remedy <hi>Peter</hi> prescribes
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:4296:55"/>
them, verse 38. <hi>Repent,</hi> saith he. Why? Did they not
repent already, of that they had done? Yes, with le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
repentance for endaungering themselves, but
his meaning is, repent and mourne that you have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
God. And indeed so is Gods promise. <hi>Esay
57. 15. I will dwell with him that is of a contrite, and
humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to
revive the heart of the contrite ones.</hi> He may be sure to
have his heart revived, and comforted that can be
humbled enough.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Yea there is no such remedy against
wordly sorrow as this; if when we feele our hearts
dejected with any sorrow for any worldly crosse, we
would labour to turne our heart from the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the crosse, to the consideration of our sinne
that hath beene the cause of it. And this remedy you
shall finde prescribed, <hi>Lam. 3. 39. Wherefore doth a
living man complaine,</hi> (chafe, and fret, and disquiet
himselfe) <hi>a man for the punishment of his sinnes? let us
search, and try our wayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I beseech you lay this second Motive to your hearts
every one of you.<note place="margin">Applic.</note> 1. Many of you never yet had any
comfort in God, in the assurance of the pardon of
your sinnes, never found sweetnesse in Christ nor in
Gods promises. 2. Many of you are much
disquieted with legall and desperate feares. 3.
Many of you are alwayes heavy hearted, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by reason of crosses you meet with, and
sometimes you know not why. And what is the
true cause of all this? You were never yet rightly
humbled for your sinnes. Why will you continue in
this uncomfortable estate? Learne to mourne and
weepe for thy sinnes, and that will help all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:4296:56"/>
The second promise made unto it,<note place="margin">Promise 2</note> and benefit this
sorrow will bring, is, that it will make us capable of,
and able to thrive in every saving grace. This benefit
you shall find pressed as a motive unto this, 1 <hi>Pet. 5.
5, 6. God giveth grace to the humble, humble your selves
therefore</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>under the mighty hand of
God. Iam. 4. 6, 7, 9. God giveth grace to the humble,
submit your selves therefore to God, bee afflicted, and
mourne and weep.</hi> Men use not to come to the rock
to be well grounded, and setled in grace till they have
digged deep, <hi>Luk. 6. 48.</hi> Such shall attaine to a cleare
and certaine, and sanctified knowledge of the truth,
<hi>Psal. 25. 9. The humble he will teach his way.</hi> Such shall
get power over their corruptions, 2 <hi>Cor. 7. 10. Godly
sorrow worketh repentance unto salvation not to be repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of. Eccle. 7. 3. Sorrow is better then laughter: for by
the sadnesse of the countenance, the heart is made better.</hi>
These teares are of a purging, and cleansing nature;
no sope, no nitre is so effectuall to get the spots, and
staines out of cloth, as these are to wash out the spots
of thy soule. That which <hi>Salomon</hi> saith of a slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer,
<hi>Prov. 25. 23. An angry countenance will drive
him away;</hi> may be said of this: if sinne be not cockerd,
and made much of, if we would shew our selves dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented,
sad, and heavy, while it tarrieth with us,
this would drive it away.</p>
                  <p>Take this also to heart,<note place="margin">Applic.</note> I pray you. 1 Many of you
complaine, or have just cause to complaine, you
thrive not in any saving grace, you are like Pharaohs
kine, though you live in never so good pasture, yet
are you still as ill favoured, and leane as ever you
were, <hi>Gen. 41. 19. 21.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Many of you are extreamely ignorant, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:4296:56"/>
unsetled in your religion, unstable soules, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
speakes, 2 <hi>Pet. 3. 16.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Many of you complaine you cannot overcome
nor get power over any corruption; you cry with
the Apostle (though not with that successe that hee
did) <hi>Rom. 7. 15. That which I doe I allow not; for what I
would that I doe not, but what I hate that doe I.</hi> Learne
to know the true cause of all this, you were never yet
rightly humbled for sinne. If thou couldst be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
and learne to mourne for thy sinne, God would
give thee more grace.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Promise 3</note> The Lord hath promised his speciall
protection, assistance and mercy in the evill day, the
day of his wrath, and judgements, unto such as are
rightly humbled, and can mourne for their sinnes,
<hi>Psal. 18. 27. Thou wilt save the afflicted people,</hi> and 34.
18. <hi>He saveth such as be of a contrite spirit, Iob 22. 29.
When men are cast downe then thou shalt say, there is a
lifting up, he shall save the humble person.</hi> And this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
God hath been wont to make good, one of these
three wayes.</p>
                  <p>1. Either by turning away the judgment that he
had threatned as 2 <hi>Chron. 32. 26. Hezechia humbled
himselfe for the pride of his heart (both he, and the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of Ierusalem) so that the wrath of the Lord came
not upon them in the dayes of Hezechia.</hi> Yea to shew
what sound humiliation is able to doe, the very coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfait
of it hath beene very effectuall this way for
the turning away of judgements, 2 <hi>Chron. 12. 12</hi>
When <hi>Rehoboam</hi> humbled himselfe, <hi>the wrath of the
Lord turned from him, so that he would not destroy him
altogether, and also in Iudah things went well.</hi> The like
we may see in the example of a worse man then hee,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:4296:57"/>
1 <hi>King. 21. 29. Seest thou how Ahab humbleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
before me? therefore I will not bring the evill in his
dayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or 2. by hiding his servants from the judgement,
and providing for their safety in the common calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as he did <hi>Iust Lot,</hi> that was <hi>vexed with the filthy
conversation of the Sodomites, 2 Pet. 2. 7.</hi> This our God
can doe, verse 9. <hi>The Lord knoweth how to deliver the
godly out of tentations;</hi> For <hi>to him belong the issues of
death, Psal. 68. 20.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or 3. (if he see it not good to do either of the former)
by sealing them, &amp; setting his mark upon them, giving
them by his spirit further assurance of his favour, and
strength of grace to indure the calamity (for that is
Gods seale, and marke, <hi>Ep. 1. 13.)</hi> and so did the Lord
with those humbled soules that went into captivity,
<hi>Ezek. 9. 4. Goe through the midst of the City, through
the midst of Ierusalem, and set a marke upon the foreheads
of the men that sigh, and that cry for all the abhominations
that be done in the midst thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Consider well of this benefit I pray you.<note place="margin">Applic:</note> 1.
We live now in an evill time: The plague hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
many thousands already; and we all may see
cause enough to feare, it may come neerer to every
one of us then yet it hath done.</p>
                  <p>2. The Lord doth also threaten us with the sword.
You have heard of the intentions of our enemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>
                  <p>3. All mens hearts are disquieted with feare; few
have any inward peace, and security in their minds.
Learne therefore to know how wee might remedy
this. Certainly if we could learne to afflict our selves
and mourne for our sinnes, we need not feare either
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:4296:57"/>
the plague, or the papists: God would be <hi>a refuge for
us, a refuge in times of trouble, Psal. 9. 9.</hi> O that Gods
people throughout the land could humble themselves
more for sin, for the sinnes of the land, and for their
owne sinnes. O that we could doe it, that are here
now. Remember what is said, <hi>Prov. 14. 26. In the
feare of the Lord is strong confidence, and his children shall
have a place of refuge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Promise 4</note> The Lord hath promised that the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of such shall prevaile mightily with him both
for themselves, and others. You know what is said

that this is the best way to prevent
the Lord from afflicting, and humbling
our soules with his owne hand, when
we have learned to humble, and afflict
our owne soules. For this is a certaine truth; sinne
will bring sorrow sooner or later, that cannot bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided.
Sinne is therefore called sorrow; because
sorrow is an inevitable effect, and consequent of it,
<hi>Eccl. 11.</hi> When he had said, verse 9. <hi>Rejoyce, O young
man in thy youth, and let thy heart cheere thee in the daies
of thy youth, and walke in the waies of thine heart, and in
the sight of thine eyes, but know thou, that for all these
things God will bring thee into judgement:</hi> he addes
verse 10. <hi>Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and
put away evill from thy flesh.</hi> When sinne hath gone
before, sorrow (even sorrow and affliction of soule
for sinne) will follow, <hi>Prov. 29. 6. In the transgression
of a wicked man there is a snare;</hi> that is, that that will
fill their hearts with deadly sorrow and heavinesse,
as appeares by the next words, <hi>but the righteous sing,
and rejoyce, Ier. 2. 19. Thine owne wickednesse shall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
thee, know therefore, and see that it is an evill thing,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:4296:59"/>
and bitter that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God, and
that my feare is not in thee.</hi> Thy sinnes certainly will
be bitter to thee one day, sooner or later. Take this
for an undoubted truth, thou must either temporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
heere or eternally hereafter in hell, lament, and
be waile, and weepe for thy sinnes, <hi>Luc. 13. 28. There
shall be weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth, when
ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Iacob, and all the
Prophets in the Kingdome of God, and your selves thrust
out.</hi> How much more when they shall see, and feele
the torments that are prepared in hell for them?
Now when God as an angry judge strikes, and afflicts
the soule with sorrow for sinne, even in this life; ô
that sorrow is terrible, and intolerable, when hee
smites the heart, he so sets it on as no man is able to
abide it, <hi>Heb. 10. 31. It is a fearefull thing to fall into the
hands of the living God, Prov. 18. 14. A wounded spirit</hi>
(that is, which God in his anger hath wounded) <hi>who
can beare? Nah. 1. 6. Who can stand before his indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
and who can abide in the fiercenesse of his anger? his
fury is powred out like fire, and the rocks are throwne down
by him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the best way to prevent the Lord from
wounding, and afflicting our soules, is to smite, and
afflict our owne hearts for our sinnes; the way to
prevent those intollerable, and everlasting sorrowes
which God in his fury will bring upon wicked men,
is to worke our hearts to this godly sorrow our
selves, and to humble our owne soules: this is plaine
by that speach of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 31. If
wee would judge our selves, wee should not bee judged
of the Lord,</hi> hee meanes as appeares in the next
verse.</p>
                  <p>

O thinke of this thou merry Greeke,<note place="margin">Applic.</note> that art all

that findest such joy, and sweetnesse in thy

breake jests upon religion, and the servants of
God, that thou canst set all the company on
laughing; the time will come when thy sinnes which
thou canst not abide to thinke of, shall be <hi>set in order
before thine eyes,</hi> that thou shalt not be able to looke
of from them, they shall never out of thy thought,
<hi>Psal. 50. 21.</hi> Thou that canst not abide to heare of
thy sinnes, nor to be told of them, nor reproved for
them by any of Gods servants, who are (as <hi>Elihu</hi>
speakes, <hi>Iob 33. 6, 7, 8.) in Gods stead unto thee, formed
out of the clay, aswell as thy selfe: whose terror need not

reproving thee for them, <hi>Psal. 50. 21. I will

reproving as is mentioned, <hi>Psal. 2. 5. Then shall hee
speake to them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure;</hi>
better to have an hundred of Gods poore
servants, to reprove thee, then to have the Lord doe
it. Thou that canst not abide to let any sadnesse or
sorrow for sinne to come neare thy heart, but hatest
sorrow as the Devill, and abandonest it from thee
with all thy might, doe what thou canst sooner or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it will seize upon thee. When Gods servants
(that have beene much given to mourning for sinne)
<hi>shall sing for joy of heart, thou shalt cry for sorrow of heart,
and howle for vexation of spirit, Esay 65. 14. Luke
6. 25. Woe unto you that laugh now; for ye shall mourne
and weepe.</hi>

it not much better for you to take paines with your
owne hearts to humble, and afflict them, then to leave
it to God to doe it in his wrath. You have heard hee
will certainly doe it if you doe it not, and the way
to prevent him from doing it, is to doe it your
selves.</p>
                  <p>And these are the motives that may stir up in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one of us a desire to seeke for this grace, of an
humbled and broken heart.</p>
                  <p>It followeth now,<note place="margin">Meanes of 2 sorts.</note> that I shew you the meanes
whereby you may atteine it. And these are of two
sorts.</p>
                  <p>1. Some such as wherein you must use the helpe
of others.</p>
                  <p>2. Some such as wherein you must be the agents
your selves.</p>
                  <p>Of the first sort,<note place="margin">1 Sort.</note> I will name to you, but
two.</p>
                  <p>The first is the ministery of the Word.<note place="margin">1.</note> If thou
wouldst have a soft heart, able to mourne for sinne,
thou must conscionably frequent the faithfull mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of the Word, strive to live under a forcible mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery,
such as will search thy heart. No meanes in
the world have ever wrought so mightily to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
humbling, and afflicting of the soule as this hath
done. By this meanes they that had crucified Christ,
and were so hardned in their sin, that when they saw
that wonderfull miracle, even the Apostles that were
poore Galileans speake in all languages the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
things of God, <hi>they mocked them, and said, these
men are full of wine, Act. 2. 13.</hi> were so pricked,
and wounded in their hearts, that they knew not
what to doe till the same hand that wounded them
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:4296:60"/>
had healed them againe, as you may read, <hi>Act. 2.
37, 41.</hi> And what was it that brought <hi>David</hi> to such
a saving sense of his sinne in numbring of the people,
that his heart smote him for it, and he cryed, <hi>I have
sinned greatly in that I have done, I have done very foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?

                        </gap>d</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
unto him, as you may see in the next words,
verse 11. <hi>For when David was up in the morning, the
Word of the Lord came unto the Prophet G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d, Davids Seer,
saying, &amp;c.</hi> and though it be said of <hi>Manasses, 2 Chron.
33. 12. that when he was in affliction he besought the Lord
his God, and humbled himselfe greatly before him:</hi> yet
if you looke into the 18. verse of that chap. you shall
find, he had a mightier and stronger meane to worke
that humiliation in his heart, then his affliction was,
the Lord had sent to him <hi>Seers, and Prophets that spake
unto him in the name of the Lord.</hi> His affliction was but
a subordinate meanes, to make him the better able to
receive profit by the word; the words and ministery
of the seers, was that that wrought this mighty work.
There is more force in the ministery of the Word,
to worke sound, and saving humiliation then in all
the afflictions in the world, <hi>Psal. 94. 12. Blessed is the
man whom thou chastenest, O Lord, and teachest him out
of thy Law.</hi> See a notable experiment of this in <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi>
and the Princes of Iudah, 2 <hi>Chron. 12. 2, 6.</hi>
When God had for their apostacy, sent <hi>Shishak</hi> King
of Egypt, with a mighty and invincible army against
them, and brought them thereby into extreame perill
and distresse, hee sent <hi>Shemaj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h</hi> the Prophet unto
them, to declare unto them the true cause of that
judgement, and to bring them to an effectuall sight
and sense of their sinne, and then (not before) <hi>they
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:4296:61"/>
humbled themselves, and confessed that the Lord was righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</hi>
Gods judgements and corrections without the
word, vse not to worke savingly. Indeed they serve,
1. to prepare and make the heart fitter to receive, and
profite by the word, 2. to stirre up those sparks, and
make them to burne, which the word had before cast
into the heart, and were covered as with ashes; but
without the word, they use not to worke savingly.
But the word even without affliction, hath done
mighty things this way, <hi>Ier. 23. 29. Is not my Word
like as a fire, saith the Lord? and like a hammer that
breaketh the rock in pieces?</hi> Wouldst thou then have
thy heart softned? Bring it to this fire, if it be as hard
as iron it will soften it, and make it plyable; bring
it to this anvile where the hammer smiteth, and it wil
breake it. For first this is ordained, and sanctified of
God to bee a glasse that will cleerly, and evidently
discover to us all our spots and deformities, as the
Apostle teacheth us, <hi>Iam. 1. 23.</hi> Secondly, God hath
promised to accompany this ordinance of his, with
the divine power and efficacy of his holy Spirit, <hi>I
will be with you</hi> (saith our Saviour, <hi>Mat. 28. 20.) unto
the end of the world.</hi> And therefore it is no marvell
though it be so mighty this way.</p>
                  <p>A likely matter will you say:<note place="margin">Object.</note> for where have you
harder, and profaner hearts, then such as are daily
beaten upon by this hammer?</p>
                  <p>I answer,<note place="margin">Answr. 1.</note> First, That the hardned, and reprobate
heart is made the harder by the strokes of this ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer
specially such hearts as once were softned, and are
growne hard againe: even as the Smiths iron is. To

                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:4296:61"/>
Secondly,<note place="margin">Answ. 2.</note> The true cause why so many heare us
daily, and their hearts are never a whit mollified by
it, is this, in many of our hearers the Lord works not
with us, no alas, in these dayes the Lord works with
us, but in few; and if he be not with us, if hee worke
not with us, we can doe nothing. When God bad
<hi>Moses</hi> take his rod, and smite the rock in Horeb, he
told him he would stand before him on the rock; and
then when God stood upon the rock <hi>Moses</hi> smote the
rock, and water gushed out of it aboundantly, <hi>Exod.
17. 5, 6.</hi> If God had not beene there, <hi>Moses</hi> smiting
the rock would have done nothing; so is it in this
case.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Ans. 3.</note> This I say, that such as God hath in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
ordained to give a soft heart unto, shall feele their
hearts mollified more by this then by any other
meanes. And if this will not soften thy heart, I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
thee nothing will doe it.</p>
                  <p>This being so;<note place="margin">Applic: 1.</note> Oh that we who are Gods ministers
would more diligently, &amp; carefully apply our selves
to this worke, and stir up our selves in our ministry
not onely to reprove sinne, but to doe it feelingly
and conscionably, so as may be most effectuall, to
bring Gods people to sound humiliation for sinne.
If we would bring them to lament for sinne, we must
mourne to them our selves, as our saviour speaketh,
<hi>Mat. 11. 17.</hi> and not by our Epicurisme, and riotous
lives proclaime unto them, that we are far from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
humbled soules, in our selves for our owne
sinnes.</p>
                  <p>And O that you that are Gods people,<note place="margin">2.</note> would seek
for, and desire this helpe from us in our ministry to
soften your hearts, and further you in this worke of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:4296:62"/>
humiliation of foule for sinne. Certainly you should
desire and seek for all good helpes this way. When
God denounced against his people the heavy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Babilonish captivity, and provokes them
to humiliation, and repentance for the preventing of
it. <hi>Consider yee</hi> (saith he, <hi>ler. 9. 17, 18.) and call for the
mourning women, that they may come, and send for cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
women that they may come, and let them make hast,
and take up a wailing for us that our eyes may runne down
with teares, and our eyelids gush out with waters.</hi> He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes
to the custome they had in funerals, and such
occasions of mourning to hire certain women, that
by their skill in singing dolefull songs might increase
their heavinesse, and make them more apt to mourn.
But his meaning is to teach them that in such a time
as that was, wherein they had also just cause to
mourne, and humble themselves, they should use all
the best helps they could to provoke themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
sorrow. And surely we should all learne to doe so
in this case, seeing humiliation for sinne is so necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and the ministry of the word is a singular meanes
to worke our hearts to it, we should therefore desire
(so far as the good order that God hath established
in his Church will permit) to heare such as whose
ministry is most powerfull, and effectuall for the soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of a hard heart.</p>
                  <p>The second meane wherein we must use the help
of others is the benefit of private admonition, and
reproofe. They that would have their hearts softned
to be able to mourne, and weepe for sin must not bee
unwilling to be admonished and reproved for sin in
private by some faithfull friend, either Minister or
other, but count it a great benefit, and desire it rather.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:4296:62"/>
First, certainly God hath given authority and a
straight charge to all his people to watch one over
another; and to call upon, and admonish, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
one another, <hi>Heb. 10. 24. Let us consider one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
to provoke unto love, and to good works. 2 Thes. 3.
15. Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a
brother. Levit. 19. 17. Thou shalt not hate thy brother in
thine heart, thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour,
and not suffer sinne upon him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, God hath sanctified and ordained this
for a meanes to reclaime poore sinners, to bring
them to a saving sight and sense of their sinne, and
keepe them from hardning their hearts in it,</hi> Matth.
18. 15. If thy brother shall trespasse against thee, go, and
tell him his fault betweene thee and him alone: if he shall
heare thee, thou hast gained thy brother; but if not, then
<hi>(Verse 16. 17.)</hi> take with thee one or two more, that in the
mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished.
And if he shall neglect to heare them, tell it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church; but if he neglect to heare the Church, let
him be to thee as a Heathen man, and a Publicane. <hi>As if
he had said, count not his case desperate till this
course have been taken with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God hath oft blessed this course won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully,
<hi>Mel. 3. 16. Then they that feared the Lord,
spake oft one to another, and the Lord hearkned,
and heard it, and a booke of remembrance was
written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that
thought upon his name.</hi> This was the meane whereby
Gods people were kept from the prophanenesse and
security of those times, and God was wonderfully
pleased with it. Yea many a heart hath been molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
this way, which the publique Ministry could
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:4296:63"/>
not soften. <hi>Nathans</hi> private dealing with <hi>David</hi>
prevailed more with him than all the publique
meanes he had enjoyed in a whole yeare, <hi>2 Sam.
12. 7. 13.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Count it therefore a great blessing of
God to thee to have such a friend or such a Minister
as will watch over thee, and deale thus privately
and plainely with thee: yea seeke for such friends.

No man holds himselfe bound to watch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

                  <p>For, though this (to speake proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
be the mighty work of God to humble and mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie
the heart of man, and make it able to mourne
for sinne, according to that promise <hi>Ezek. 11. 19. I
will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and I will give
them an heart of flesh;</hi> yet may we (after we are once
regenerated) do much to further this great worke of
God in our selves. Therefore we see <hi>David</hi> profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
here that <hi>he afflicted his owne soule:</hi> and <hi>Psal.

never be well done. And certainly, if we would do
what we might, our hearts would be much softer,
and better able to mourne for our sinnes, than
they are.</p>
                  <p>If any of you shall aske me,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> Why what can we do,
or what should we do to worke our hearts to this
godly sorrow?</p>
                  <p>I answer:<note place="margin">Answ.</note> There are foure principall things that
we may doe, and that we must do, if we would get
broken and humbled hearts. For, 1. We must
make choice of a fit time. 2. Of a fit place.
3. When we have so done, we must examine our
hearts seriously and impar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ially. 4. We must pray
to God for his assistance in this businesse.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">1. A fit time</note> We must take a fit time to go about this
worke. For, though this be but a matter of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
yet have Gods people found much helpe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
spirituall duties even in this. <hi>Daniel</hi> for his private
prayer made choice of the time that God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for the evening sacrifice, <hi>Dan. 9. 21.</hi> And so
did <hi>Cornelius,</hi> as will appeare if you compare <hi>Act.
10. 30.</hi> and 31. together. Our blessed Saviour made
choice of the evening for this purpose sometimes,
<hi>Mat. 14. 23.</hi> and sometimes of the morning early be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
day, <hi>Mar. 1. 35.</hi> And as all our time is not to be
spent in mourning; so are there some times and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
fitter for this purpose, and such as will yeeld us
more helpe in this worke, than other-some will do.
<hi>Eccles. 3. 4. There is a time to weepe, and a time to laugh;
a time to mourne, and a time to dance.</hi> And it is the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of a Christian, to discerne and take the fittest
time for this purpose. <hi>Eccles. 8. 5. A wise mans heart
discerneth both time and judgement,</hi> saith <hi>Salomon.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:4296:65"/>
Eph. 5. 15, 16. Walke not as fooles, but as wise men, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming
the time.</hi> The wisdome of a man (you see)
consisteth much in the husbanding of his time well,
and making choice of the fittest time fore every pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and action that he takes in hand.</p>
                  <p>And what times are the fittest (may you say) for
this purpose?</p>
                  <p>I answer, it is profitable for a man every day to be
doing somewhat in this worke, by observing his
owne wayes, and calling himselfe to an account for
them. For,</p>
                  <p>First, The Apostle tels us we are in danger to be
hardned through the deceitfulnesse of sinne if we do
not exhort or stirre up our selves daily, <hi>Heb. 3. 13.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The time of our death is very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine;
and such servants (we know) as have great
dealings for their master, and looke to be called to a
strict account they know not how soone, will looke
every day into their accounts, and have them in area<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse
continually. And surely this is our case; we
know not how soone our accounts will be called for,
<hi>Mar. 13. 35, 36. Watch ye therefore (for ye know not when
the master of the house will come) least comming suddenly,
he find you sleeping.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This would helpe us greatly in our daily
prayers unto God. The more sense and sorrow for
sinne we have when we pray, the more acceptable
certainly would our prayers be unto God. <hi>Psal. 34.</hi>
When <hi>David</hi> had said Vers. 17. <hi>The righteous cry, and
the Lord heareth them;</hi> he tels us Verse 18. what cries
and prayers of the righteous they be that the Lord
hath such respect unto. <hi>The Lord is nigh</hi> (saith he) <hi>to
them that are of a broken heart.</hi> If we would strive in
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:4296:65"/>
our daily prayers when wee make confession of our
sinnes to doe it with feeling, and not formally, it
would not onley make our prayers more effectuall
with God, but keepe our hearts from hardning, and
bring them to a good temper, <hi>Luk. 18. 13, 14.</hi> When
the Publican made confession of his sinnes with that
feeling, <hi>smiting upon his breast, and saying, God be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
to mee a sinner;</hi> It is said, <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ee went home to his house
justified rather then the other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, This daily accustoming our selves unto
this worke of calling our selves to account, and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
our hearts for our sinnes, would make it more
easy and familiar unto us, when we shall have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
occasion to betake our selves to it. That
which is said by the Prophet of the Lords chaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of us, may fitly be applyed to this chastening of
ourselves, <hi>Lam. 3. 27. It is good for a man that he beare
the yoke, in his youth;</hi> and to have beene accustomed
to stoop unto, and to beare patiently the Lords affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
hand. By this that hath beene said you see it is
good for us to be doing somewhat in this worke eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day.</p>
                  <p>Yet are there five speciall times,<note place="margin">Five times.</note> and seasons that
will yeeld us great helpe in this businesse more then
other times will doe.</p>
                  <p>The first fit time to worke our hearts to godly
sorrow, is presently after some fall we have received
some grosse sinne we have slipped into. A great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
it will be unto us, to humble our soules for it
presently and without delay.</p>
                  <p>For first, sinne newly committed may be better
knowne, and remembred, with all the circumstances
whereby it is aggravated. And that is a great helpe to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:4296:66"/>
the humiliation of the soule, as wee may perceive in
<hi>Davids</hi> speech, <hi>Psal. 51. 3. For I ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nowledge my trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,
and my si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>e is ever before me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The heart will not be so hardned by
sinne that is newly committed, but more easily
wrought upon, and softned then when sin hath lyen
long upon it. As a bone that is out of joint the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
it is neglected, will be set againe with more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
and paine. A Leopard may as soone leave his
spots, an Ethiopian his blacknesse as he can do his
sinne, that hath lyen long in it, <hi>Ier. 13. 23.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Another fit season for this worke is,
when wee prepare our selves to renew our covenant
with God in the holy Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>For 1. at that time God requires of us a speciall
care to examine our selves and call to mind our sins,
and to judge our selves for them, else it is not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
we should receive worthily, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 28. 29, 31.
When thou bringest thy gift to the altar</hi> (saith our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<hi>Mat. 5. 23.</hi> as at the Lords table we doe offer,
and present our selves unto God, our soules, and
bodyes as a holy, reasonable, and lively sacrifice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him) <hi>and there remembrest that thy brother hath ought
against thee.</hi> Teaching us that at that time specially
we should remember, and call to mind what our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and much more what our heavenly father hath
against us.</p>
                  <p>2. At that time men (if they have any spark of
grace in them) are apt to find in themselves some
stirrings of their affections unto goodnesse, some
motions of Gods spirit, some dispositions unto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
and remorse for sinne. Ministers that use to
deale privately with their people at that time shall
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:4296:66"/>
find them more easie to be wrought upon (and so shal
every man his own heart) then at other times. These
good motions should bee followed without delay.
As it is said that they that lay at the poole of Bethes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,
stroue to get in so soone as euer the Angell had
stirred the water, <hi>Iohn 5. 4.</hi> And <hi>Iosuah</hi> so soone as
God by a vision had stirred him up to search and find
out the sinne that had provoked God against Israel,
<hi>Iosh. 7. 16.</hi> went without delay immediatly about it.
So should we doe in this case. When we feele God
begins to soften our hearts, and to stirre up these
good dispositions to devotion in us, then should wee
set our selves seriously to this worke, of calling to
mind our sinnes, and bringing our hearts to sorrow
for them.</p>
                  <p>For 1. when God stirs up such motions he knocks
at the doore of our hearts, and sheweth himselfe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to enter in, <hi>Rev. 3. 20.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Satan will bee ready to quench the spirit in
these good motions. As it is said, he watched the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
to devoure it so soone as ever it should be borne,
<hi>Rev. 12. 4.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The dayes, and times wee set apart for
fasting, and prayer (upon whatsoever just occasion)
are a most fit season for us, to goe about this
work.</p>
                  <p>For 1. we find Gods people have had their hearts
wonderfully softned at such times. The Israelites in
the fast that they kept for successe against Benjamin,
came into the house of God, and wept, <hi>Iudg. 20. 26.</hi>
And in the fast they kept as <hi>Mispeh,</hi> they wept so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
that they are said, 1 <hi>Sam. 7. 6.</hi> to have
drawne water, as by buckets full, out of their
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:4296:67"/>
hearts, and to have poured it out before the
Lord.</p>
                  <p>2. This exercise of a religious fast is a great help,
and furtherance to this work. As wee see heere in
<hi>Davids</hi> example, <hi>Psal. 35. 13. I humbled my selfe with
fasting,</hi> &amp; 69. 10. <hi>I wept, and chastened my soule with
fasting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, When any judgements of God lye
heavy upon our selves or our brethren, that is a fit
season to goe about this work. When these men
were in misery <hi>David</hi> fell heere to afflicting of his
soule, <hi>Psal. 35. 13.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For 1. the Lord by every one of his judgements,
doth testify from Heaven that he hath matter against
us, as <hi>Nao<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>i</hi> saith, <hi>Ruth 1. 21. Why doe you call mee
Naomi, seeing the Lord</hi> (by taking away my husband
and my children) <hi>hath testified against me, and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
hath afflicted me?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <hi>God by his judgements doth call upon us to
examine our wayes, and humble our selves before
him,</hi> Hag. 1. 5, 6, 7. Now therefore saith the Lord of
Hosts, co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sider your wayes; yee have sowen much, and
brought in li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>le, thus saith the Lord of Hosts, consider your
wayes. <hi>And</hi> Esa. 22. 12. In that day did the Lord God of
Hosts call to weeping, and to mourning.</p>
                  <p>3. God by his judgements softneth the hearts
of men, and worketh in them more remorse, more
pronenesse and aptnes to repent then at other times,
<hi>Iob 23. 16. God maketh my heart soft</hi> (saith <hi>Iob) and the
Almighty troubleth mee.</hi> A man shall find himselfe
fitter to pray then, then at other times: and we should
take the advantage, and opportunity of this time for
it, <hi>Iam. 5. 13. Is any afflicted? let him pray.</hi> This hath
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:4296:67"/>
beene oft seene even in many notable hypocrites,
who (how profane soever their hearts have beene
at other times yet) in their affliction have found in
themselves a disposition to pray, and to repent, <hi>Psal.
78. 34. When he slew them then they sought him and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.</hi>
And <hi>Esa. 26. 16. Lord in trouble have they vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited
thee, they poured out a prayer when thy chastning was
upon them.</hi> And we find by experience that at such a
time a faithfull Minister may much better worke up.
on the hearts of men to bring them to remorse and
repentance then at another time. According to that
speach of <hi>Elihu, Iob 33. 22, 24. When a mans soule
draweth neere to the grave; if there bee then a messenger
with him, an interpreter, one of a thousand, to shew unto
man his uprightnesse, then he is gracious unto him.</hi> And
so speaketh <hi>David</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lso, <hi>Psal. 94. 12. Blessed is the man
whom thou chastnest ô Lord, and teachest him out of thy
Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a singular favour of God, when correction,
and instruction goe together. And herein wee are
bound to acknowledge the great mercy of God to
our Land, that (in the time of so generall, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
visitation as hath been upon it) he hath put it
into the Kings heart, to command so much preaching
that thereby the hearts of the people might bee effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
wrought upon, now the Lord hath so by his
judgement prepared them. And certainly if in such
a time the word doe not work upon mens hearts, it
will never doe them good.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, and lastly, When wee feele a secret pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sivenesse,
and sadnesse to come upon our hearts so as
they even melt within us like ground that thaweth
after a frost, so as we could even weepe abundantly,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:4296:68"/>
this is an excellent season, and opportunity, to bring
our hearts unto godly sorrow in.</p>
                  <p>For 1. sadnesse and heavinesse, maketh the heart
more apt to bee wrought to goodnesse, <hi>Eccle. 7. 3.
Sorrow is better then laughter, for by the sadnesse of the
countenance, the heart is made better.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. This is the way to turne the streame, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of our sorrow the right way, by making our sin
our greatest sorrow (as indeed it ought to bee) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is the onely just cause of all other our sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes,
<hi>Lam. 3. 39. 40. Wherefore doth a living man
complaine? a man for the punishment of his sinnes?
Let us search, and try our wayes and turne againe unto
the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And surely (to conclude this first point) in this we<note place="margin">Applic.</note>
have all cause to acknowledge our owne folly, and
to bee humbled for it; and to impute that want of
grace, and ability that is in us to mourne for our sins,
unto this, that wee have neglected these times, and
seasons whereby we might have beene so much hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
in this work.</p>
                  <p>We know the fittest seasons for the plowing, and
breaking up of our ground, and we carefully observe
them; but we know not, or care not to observe the
fittest seasons for the breaking up of the fallow
ground of our hearts, which (yet) concerneth us much
more then the other doth. <hi>Breake up your f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

(saith the Prophet <hi>Ier. 4. 3.) and sow not among
thornes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second thing wee must doe to worke our
hearts to godly sorrow is this;<note place="margin">2 A fit place.</note> after we have made
choise of a fit time to goe about this work, we must
also make choise of a fit place for it, even such as
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:4296:68"/>
wherein we may be most free from all distractions.
For though this also be but a circumstance yet may it
yeeld us some help in all exe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When wee have made choise of a fit
time, and a fit place also for this businesse, then must
we examine our hearts seriously, and impartially.
And in this examination two things are to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by us.</p>
                  <p>1. We must labour to find out, and call to mind
our sinnes, for which wee should bee hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</p>
                  <p>2. We must lay them to our hearts, and so consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and weigh with our selves the hainousnesse of
them, and aggravate them against our selves, that we
may be affected with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:4296:69"/>
For the first, Hee that desires to have his heart
humbled, and to bee able to mourne for his sinnes,
must labour by diligent search, and examination to
finde out his sinnes, and call them to mind, and set
them before his face. <hi>Bring it againe to mind ô yee
transgressours,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>Esa. 46. 8.</hi> Let not man
be affraid or unwilling to doe this. To commit sinne
is dangerous, and hurtfull to thy soule, but to call
thy sinnes to remembrance hath no danger in it, will
doe thee no hurt at all; to have an enemy, or a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
disease upon thee is dangerous, and hurtfull, but
to be aware of them, to know them, when thou hast
them, may doe thee much good. <hi>Iob</hi> knew this well
and therefore prayeth earnestly to God to helpe
him in this, <hi>Iob 13. 23. Make mee to know my trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,
and my sinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For 1. till then thou canst never truly mourne for
thy sin, and repent of it, <hi>Ier. 8. 6. No man repented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
of his wickednesse, saying what have I done?</hi> To
know in generall, and in grosse that thou art a sinner
wil never hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble thee aright, thou must know thy sins
in particular, or thou canst never truely repent. This
was that that humbled Gods people so, in the dayes
of<hi>Samuel, 1 Sam. 12. 19. Wee have added to allour o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sinnes, this evill, to aske a King.</hi> This was that that
humbled those 3000. mentioned, <hi>Act. 2. 36, 37.</hi>
and pricked them at the heart, God made knowne
to them their sinne in particular, even that hainous
sinne of crucifying the Lord of life.</p>
                  <p>2. It is profitable for us in another respect. For the
more carefull we are to remember our sinnes, and
call them to mind, the more ready will the Lord bee
to forget them, and cast them behind his back.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:4296:69"/>
This is plaine by that prayer <hi>David</hi> maketh, <hi>Psalm.
51. 1, 2, 3. Have mercy upon me ô God, wash me through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from my iniquity, for I know my transgressions, and
my sinne is ever before mee.</hi> But if thou strive to forget
them, never to thinke of them, to cast them behind
thy back, bee thou sure God will remember them,
and never have them out of his eye, <hi>Thou hast,</hi> (saith
<hi>Moses, Psal. 90. 8.) set our iniquities before thee, our
secret sinnes in the light of thy countenance).</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But thou wilt say to me.<note place="margin">Quest.</note> What sinnes should I call

are my sins innumerable?</p>
                  <p>I answer,<note place="margin">Answ. 1.</note> 1. The more sinnes thou canst call to
mind the better it will be for thee. This we may see,
<hi>Ezek. 20. 43.</hi> where this is promised as a singular
grace, God would worke in his peoples hearts. <hi>You
shall remember your wayes, and all your doings, you have
beene defiled and yee shall loath your selves in your owne
sight, for all your evils that ye have committed.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
also when the Lord prescribeth unto <hi>Aaron</hi>
the course hee should take in making an attonement
betweene God and the people, he tels him, <hi>Levit.

of the children of Israel, and all their transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in all their sinnes.</hi> And therefore it is good when
thou goest about this worke to take the helpe of the
glasse, set the glasse of Gods Law before thee,
and examine thy wayes according unto it. <hi>Rom.
3. 20. By the Law commeth the knowledge of
sinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:4296:70"/>
Secondly,<note place="margin">Answ. 2.</note> take heed thou dost not in thy exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
willingly forget or passe by any sinne: Either
1. out of a conceit that it is but small. For Gods curse

thou bearest to it, and loathnesse to leave it:

                  </p>

                     </gap>selfe
unto repentance, thinke oft of the sinnes of his
youth, <hi>Psalm. 25. 7. Remember not the sinnes of my
youth, nor my transgressions:</hi> So did <hi>Paul</hi> oft call to
mind his foulest sinnes, <hi>1 Tim. 1. 13. I was a blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and a persecuter.</hi> For the heart will sooner bee
brought to remorse, and sorrow by remembrance
of these then of smaller sinnes; which was the cause
why the Publicans, and Harlots those grosse sinners,
repented sooner then the civill Pharisees, <hi>Matth.
21. 32.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No hard matter for you that have beene adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,<note place="margin">Applic:</note>
blasphemers, persecuters, theeves, oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours,
drunkards, to bring your hearts unto god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sorrow, if you would take but a little paines
with them. You that have lived more civilly (as
that rich young man had done, that concerning
the Commandements of the second Table, could
say unto Christ, <hi>Matthew 19. 20. All these
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:4296:70"/>
things have I kept from my youth up)</hi> must take the more
paines in this work.</p>
                  <p>The second thing we must doe in this examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our selves, is this: When we have found
out, and called to mind our sinnes then must wee
consider, and weigh with our selves the hainous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of them, aggravate them against our selves,
and lay them so to heart as we may bee affected, and
moved to remorse, and sorrow for them. Men
are oft blamed for this, that they laid not their sinnes
to their heart, considered not so of them as to bee
affected with them, <hi>Esay 47. 7.</hi> The Caldeans are
blamed that they did not lay to their hearts the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
they had done to Gods people. And the
Iewes, <hi>Esay 57. 11.</hi> that they laid not to heart
their Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>Now the way to lay them to our heart, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
well the hainousnesse of them, and the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
whereby they are aggravated. <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>l</hi> did use
thus to aggravate his sinnes against himselfe, <hi>Ephe. 3.

                  </p>
                  <p>The circumstances whereby sinne is aggravated<note place="margin">Seven ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations of sinne.</note>
are many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will name a few of them.</p>
                  <p>First, Consider thy sinnes have beene commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
against many, and strong meanes of grace. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
what Christ saith, <hi>Matth. 11. 24.</hi> to
Capernaum because of this, <hi>I say unto thee, that it
shall bee more tolerable for the land of Sodom, in the day
of judgement then for thee.</hi> Oh! consider with thy
selfe that if the sinnes of Indians, and other barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
people that never enjoyed any ordinary meanes
of grace, shall justly be punished in Hell fire, as
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:4296:71"/>
doubtlesse they shall. For <hi>as many as have sinned
without Law, shall also perish without Law,</hi> saith the
Apostle, <hi>Rom. 2. 12.</hi> If the sinnes of Infants doe
justly deserve damnation, as certainly they doe.
<hi>Death hath raigned</hi> (saith he, <hi>Rom. 5. 14.) even o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them that have not sinned after the similitude of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams
transgression,</hi> that is not actually. What degree
and measure of punishment, and torment thinkest
thou, is most justly due to thy sinnes that have beene
committed against such meanes of grace as thou hast
enjoyed?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Thy sinnes have not beene commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
upon ignorance but against thy knowledge. And
if the elect Iewes were so pricked in heart for the
sinne they committed ignorantly, <hi>Act. 3. 17.</hi> how
much more cause hast thou? Remember what
Christ saith of this circumstance, <hi>Luk. 12. 47. That
servant which knew his Lords will and prepared not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with
many stripes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, How voluntary thou hast sinned, how
weake, and light the tentations have often beene
that have drawne thee to it, nay how thou hast
drawne, and provoked thy selfe to it. And say
thou to thine owne heart, If God were so much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
with <hi>Ahab</hi> though he had so strong a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter
as <hi>Iesabel</hi> his wife, <hi>I Kings 21. 25.</hi> Alas what
cause hath he to bee offended with mee, that have
beene mine owne tempter? Remember what the
Holy Ghost speaketh of this circumstance, <hi>Esay 33. 1
Woe to thee that spoilest, and wast not spoiled: &amp; 5. 18.
Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, &amp;
sin as it were with a cart rope.</hi>

how the Lord aggravates sinne by this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,

shall watch over their cities, every one that goeth out

are many, and their backslidings are increased.</hi> See what
weight this very circumstance gave unto <hi>Davids</hi>
sinne in the sense of his Conscience, <hi>Mine iniquities</hi>
(saith he, <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. 12.) <hi>are more then the haires of mine

                     </hi> If for one sinne <hi>Adam</hi> was so terrified that
he fled from God, <hi>Gen. 3. 8.</hi> what cause of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
have I, maist thou well say to thine owne
soule?</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, How oft thou hast relapsed, and fallen
backe againe into the same sin that thy heart hath
smitten thee for, and thou hast repented of, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted
with God that thou wouldst forsake it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
with the dogge, to that thou hast loathed, and
vomited up, 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 22.</hi> An arme once broken
cannot be cured without paine, but if often, the cure
will be more dangerous, and painefull. If thou hadst
broken thy promises, and covenants with men thou
wouldst count it a matter of infamy and shame unto
thee, what cause of shame is it then that thou hast
broken thy promises unto God? See also how this
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:4296:72"/>
circumstances doth aggravate sinne, <hi>Eccle. 5. 4. When
thou vowest a vow unto God deferre not to pay it, for hee

                  </p>
                  <p>Sixtly, How thou hast by thy sinne corrupted o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll, and thou canst not draw
them unto repentance? Indeed if thou canst truly
repent, this shall not hinder thy salvation that thou
hast beene a meane of the damning of others, for so
was <hi>Paul, Act. 26. 11.</hi> Yet must it needs be a heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaking
to thee, whensoever thou dost seriously
thinke of it all the dayes of thy life: and so was it
unto <hi>Paul,</hi> If thou hadst beene the meane to undoe
another in his outward estate, much more if thou
hadst taken away his life, it would be a just cause of

kindly, nor make it melt in godly sorrow as the true
consideration of this love of God, <hi>Psal. 130. 4. there
is forgivenesse with thee: that thou mayest bee feared.</hi> It
was not the crowing of the Cock twice, that made

cast upon him, <hi>Luke 22. 61, 62. The Lord turned, and
looked upon Peter, then Peter remembred the Word of the
Lord, and Peter went out, and wept bitterly.</hi> This was
that that wrought upon the heart of the prodigall,
<hi>Luk. 15. 18. I will arise, and goe to my father, and I will

                  <p>The fourth and last thing we must doe, to bring
our hearts unto this godly sorrow, is fervent
prayer.</p>
                  <p>For thou must 1. complaine to God of the hardnes

said of this grace also, <hi>Iam. 1. 5. If any of you lacke a

Ezek. 36. 26. I will take away the stony heart

David, and upon the inhabitants of Ierusalem, the spirit
of grace, and of supplications, and they shall looke upon mee
whom they have pierced, and they shall mourne for him as
one that mourneth for his onely sonne, and be in bitternesse
for him, as one that is in bitternesse for his first borne.</p>

you the signes and notes whereby wee
may bee able to discerne whether wee
have beene yet rightly humbled for our
sinnes, whether that sorrow for sinne, that we have
felt in our selves be unfeigned yea or no, whether it
be that saving sorrow of Gods elect, unto which all
these promises of comfort, and mercy that we have
heard of doe belong. And surely it is a matter of
great use and necessity to have notes given us out of
Gods Word to try our humiliation, and sorrow for
sinne by.</p>
                  <p>First, Because as it is certaine, our sinnes are not
pardoned unlesse we have truly repented of them,
<hi>Act. 5. 31. Christ giveth repentance to Israel, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse
of sinnes:</hi> Soe is it as certaine we never truly
repented of our sinnes, if wee have not unfeignedly
sorrowed and mourned for them, 2 <hi>Cor. 7. 10. God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sorrow worketh repentance unto salvation.</hi> Wee must
be made (though not equall, yet) <hi>conformable</hi> to
Christ <hi>in his death and passion;</hi> as the Apostle speaketh
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:4296:74"/>
                     <hi>Phil. 3. 10.</hi> or we shall never reigne with him. <hi>This
is a faithfull saying,</hi> (saith the Apostle, 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 11. 12.)
if wee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ee dead with him, wee shall also live with him, if
we suffer with him, wee shall also reigne with him.</hi> And
this was a cheif part of his passion wherein we must
be conformable unto him. When he suffred for our
sinnes, <hi>Mat. 26. 37. He began to be sorrowfull, and very
heavy,</hi> insomuch as he could not containe but must
needs acquaint his three Disciples with it, verse 38.
<hi>Then saith he unto them, my soule is exceeding sorrowfull,
even unto death.</hi> When he suffred for our sinnes hee
wept abundantly as the Apostle saith, <hi>Heb. 5. 7. He
offred up prayers and supplications with strong crying and
teares.</hi> We cannot sorrow and weepe in that measure
as he did for our sinnes, but we must sorrow in our
measure as he did, we must be made conformable to
him in his passion as you have heard, or wee shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have part in him. We must either mourne as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
did with a saving sorrow, <hi>Mat. 26. 75.</hi> or wee
shall mourne as <hi>Iudas</hi> did with a desperate sorrow,
<hi>Mat. 27. 3, 5.</hi> We must either now in this life mourn
for our sinn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s (as we have heard all Gods servants
have done) or we shall certainly herafter <hi>cry for sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
of heart,</hi> (as the Prophet speaketh, <hi>Esa. 65. 14.)
and houle for vexation of spirit</hi> in Hell where shall bee
nothing but <hi>weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth,</hi>
as our Saviour speaketh, <hi>Luk. 13. 28. where their
worme never dyeth,</hi> and the fire never shall be quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
<hi>Mar. 9. 44.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Because men are very apt to bee decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in this point and to thinke they have beene right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
humbled, and have rightly sorrowed for their
sinnes when indeed they have not. We read of the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:4296:75"/>
hypocrites expostulation with God, <hi>Esa.</hi> 58. 3. They
had afflicted their soules, and God tooke no knowledge of
it, <hi>&amp;</hi> Zach. 7. 3, 5. <hi>They had mourned, and wept in their
fasts,</hi> and the Lord saith of them they had not done it
unto him, they had their owne ends in it. Yea it is
certaine many hypocrites doe indeed mourne and
are exceedingly humbled sometimes. You know
the Lord giveth this testimony of <hi>Ahab</hi> himselfe that
he was humbled, 1 <hi>Kings 21. 29.</hi> And yet as good
never a whit as never the better, their sorrow and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation
is to no purpose at all, because it is not
sound, and sincere.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Because many of Gods children that are
indeed true mourners are apt to doubt of themselves
and to complaine their hearts are so hard, that they
cannot mourne for their sinnes, ô if they had soft,
and melting hearts that they could sorrow, that they
could weep for sinne they were in an happy case, but
(alas) they cannot.</p>
                  <p>Thus Gods Church, and people complaine unto
God, <hi>Es<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. 63. 17. O Lord why hast thou hardned our
heart?</hi> Seeing therefore it is as you see (in these three
respects) a matter of so great necessity to have a sure
direction given us out of Gods Word, how to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
that humiliation of soule and sorrow for sinne,
that is sincere and saving from that that is counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fait,
I will give you some principall notes of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
betweene them whereby they may be judged
of. And these are to bee referred to foure
heads.</p>
                  <p>The first is from the object of our sorrow and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation,<note place="margin">Signes of true humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</note>
the thing the matter that we are grieved,
and humbled for.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:4296:75"/>
The second from the measure, and degree of our
sorrow.</p>
                  <p>The third from the cause that breedeth it in us,
and fountaine from whence it floweth.</p>
                  <p>The fourth and last, from the effects and fruits
that proceed from it.</p>
                  <p>For the first, If we desire to know whether we
were ever yet rightly humbled, or whether we doe
still remaine in the hardnesse and impenitency of our
hearts we must examine what it is that hath troubled
us and made us to mourne.</p>
                  <p>First, He that is truly humbled mourneth for the
evill of sinne, rather then for the evill of punishment.
It is no ill signe to mourne, and to be humbled under
the judgements of God. Nay it is our duty to be so,
and a passing ill signe it is of an ungratious heart, not
to be affected with the judgements of God, not to be
troubled when the Lord sheweth himselfe to be
angry with us.</p>
                  <p>The Prophet complaineth of this as of a great
sinne, <hi>Ier. 5. 3. O Lord thou hast stricken them and they
have not grieved.</hi> It is said of Gods people, <hi>Ezr. 10.
9. that they trembled because of the great raine.</hi> And
<hi>David,</hi> and the Elders of Israel humbled themselves
greatly for the plague that God sent upon the land,
2 <hi>Sam. 24. 17.</hi> And so did <hi>Iehoshaphat,</hi> when God
threatned an invasion, 2 <hi>Chron. 20. 3.</hi> When the
state and government of the Kingdome of Israel, in
the dayes of <hi>Saul,</hi> was so broken and out of order,
had so many breaches in it that it did even shake and
totter as ready to fall, and come to ruine, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
complaineth, <hi>Psal. 60. 2.</hi> Gods people were so
troubled with the sensible token of Gods displeasure
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:4296:76"/>
that they were euen astonished with it, <hi>thou hast made
us to drinke the wine of astonishment,</hi> as the Prophet spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
verse 3. And certainly this is a dangerous signe,
that our people generally are given up of God to a
marvellous hardnesse of heart, that the Lord having
by all these tokens of his anger <hi>cald us to weeping and to
mourning,</hi> as the Prophet speaketh, <hi>Esa. 22. 12.</hi> we
have beene generally given to asmuch jollity in these
times as ever we were, <hi>Surely this iniquity shall not be
purged from you, till you dye, saith the Lord God of Hosts,</hi>
as it followeth there, verse 14. Yet though it be a
good thing to be humbled under Gods judgements,
this is not enough to prove our humiliation to bee
sound and sincere. Many an hypocrite hath gone so
farre. Thus farre <hi>Ahab</hi> went, ô how he was hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at the hearing of that fearefull judgement that
God threatned by the Prophet to bring upon him
and his house? 1 <hi>King. 21. 29. Seest thou how Ahab
humbleth himselfe?</hi> Thus farre <hi>Iehoram</hi> his sonne and
as bad a man almost as he went; when a grievous fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
was upon the land, he greatly humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
for though he were a King, he wore sackcloth,
not as his upper garment as the manner was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
their humiliation outwardly, but secretly next
his skin, 2 <hi>King. 6. 30.</hi> See how farre an hypocrite
may goe in humbling himselfe under Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
But the true repentant though he is humbled
for and can mourne for Gods judgements, yet, that is
neither the onely nor the chief cause of his sorrow,
his sinnes that have provoked God to those judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
trouble him most. <hi>I will declare mine iniquitie</hi>
(saith <hi>David Psal. 38. 18.) and be sory for my sinne.</hi> And
<hi>Ezek. 7. 16. They shall be on the mountaines like the

                     </gap>he is more troubled for
his sinne, then for the affliction that is upon him, as
wee shall see in that prayer of <hi>David, Psal. 25. 18.
Looke upon my affliction, and my paine, and forgive all my
sinnes.</hi> And so it is said of Gods people in <hi>Ezras</hi> time
when the Lord by a judgement of immoderate raine
had testified his displeasure against them, <hi>Ezra. 10. 9
They trembled because of this matter</hi> (their sinne in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
Idolaters) <hi>and for the great raine.</hi> Their sinne
was the chief thing they trembled for.</p>
                  <p>Let us then examine our sorrow by this first note,<note place="margin">Applic.</note>
alas, many blesse themselves in this that they have
beene much given to sorrow and heavinesse.</p>
                  <p>1. If sorrow be good (saith many a one) I have
had enough of that. Yea upon this they ground their
hope that they shall escape the wrath to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they have endured so much sorrow in this life.
I have had my punishment in this life, saith he. Alas
poore wretch of all thy sorrowes that thou hast en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured,
I may say as our Saviour doth in another case
<hi>Mat. 24. 8. All these are but the beginning of sorrows;</hi>
worldly sorrowes are but the beginning of hellish
sorrowes. <hi>The Devils also beleeve and tremble,</hi> after
this sort, as the Apostle speaketh, <hi>Iam. 2. 19.</hi> They
are troubled exceedingly (more then ever thou
couldst be) with the apprehension and sense of the
punishment, which they undoubtedly b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>leeve is
prepared for them.</p>
                  <p>2. Many of you are oft troubled with sadnesse
and heavinesse of heart, and can say as <hi>Iob 23. 16. God
maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me.</hi> O
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:4296:77"/>
that thou couldst turne the streame of thy sorrow the
right way from sorrowing for thy affliction to sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing
for thy sinne. One houre spent in sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for thy sin, will yeeld thee more true comfort,
then a thousand spent in sorrowing for thy affliction
will doe.</p>
                  <p>3. And we all now assembled to professe our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation
for the manifold tokens of Gods anger
upon his Church, and this land, must examine the
truth of our hearts in this, whether we can aswell
mourne for the sinnes of the land, as for the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God that are upon it, and are threatned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it. See a notable example of this in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi>
Chap. 1. when he heard of the great affliction, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
Gods people were in at Ierusalem, verse 3.
<hi>How the wals of Ierusalem were broken downe, and the
gates thereof burnt with fire, he sat downe and wept, and
mourned certaine dayes, and fasted and prayed before the
God of Heaven,</hi> as he saith, verse 4. But what is it,
that most humbled and troubled his heart in this his
fast? Surely not so much the judgement whereby
God had shewed himselfe to be angry with them, as
their sinnes whereby they had made him angry, as
you shall see verse 6. 7. and surely the sinnes of the
land ought to trouble us more then any of the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
either persent or imminent (though they bee
very great and fearefull.)</p>
                  <p>For 1. they give us cause to feare far heavier
then these be, and God hath said of England as hee
said once of the Kingdome of Iuda, <hi>Ezek. 21. 27.
I will overturne, everturne, overturne it, and it shall be no
more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. If it were not for the sinnes of the land, these
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:4296:77"/>
judgements would vanish, or doe us no hurt at all,
1 <hi>Cor. 15. 56. The sting of death is sinne.</hi> And of one
sinne, the sinne of Idolatry (specially being openly
committed, and alas, our land standeth guilty of that
and of many more) it is said, <hi>Exod. 32. 25. Moses saw</hi>
(though every blind foole could not see it) <hi>that the
people were naked, for Aaron had made them naked to
their shame before their enemies.</hi> Alas, the sinnes of
the land make us naked to our enemies abroad, and
to our treacherous, and bloudy Papists at home; do
what we can to defend and arme our selves, till our
sinnes be repented of, till they be removed we shall
be found to be a naked people. We cannot stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our enemies, till the accursed thing (till <hi>Ach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n</hi>)
betaken away, <hi>Iosh. 7. 13.</hi> and alas, we have many
<hi>Achans</hi> amongst us. So many of you therefore as
have hearts that can mourne, that can be humbled,
mourne for the sinnes of the land, and by the first
note approve unto God and to your owne hearts the
truth of your humiliation that you professe this
day. And so much for the first note.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He that is truly humbled mourneth
for sinne, not so much in respect to himselfe, of
the hurt, and danger that his sinne bringeth upon
himselfe, as in respect to God, because he is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
and dishonoured by his sinne. Saving sorrow
is therefore called, 2 <hi>Cor. 7. 10. Godly sorrow,</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> sorrow that respecteth God, and is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to <hi>worldly sorrow</hi> that respecteth onely the cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and miseries that sinne maketh us subject unto.</p>
                  <p>I graunt, 1. It is not unlawfull to bee troubled
for sinne, even out of respect to the punishment,
and misery that it will bring upon us. As a man may
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:4296:78"/>
have respect to this in his feare that keepeth him
from committing sinne; so may he also in his sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for it, after it is committed. <hi>Iob</hi> giveth this for
a reason why he durst not sinne. <hi>For destruction from
God</hi> (saith he, <hi>Iob 31. 23.) was a terrour to me.</hi> And so
doth <hi>Paul. 2 Cor. 5. 11. Knowing therefore the terrours
of the Lord, we persuade men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Sound and saving humiliation for sinne useth
to begin in this legall compunction and terror, which
hath respect onely to the misery that sinne bringeth
us to. And not one of an hundred doe ever come to
mourne for sinne in respect to God, till they have
first learned to mourne for sinne in respect to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
this prepareth, maketh way for, and draweth
in the other, as the prick of the needle doth the threed.
So it is said of those three thousand that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
by <hi>Peter, Act. 2. 37. that they were</hi> (first)
<hi>pricked in their hearts,</hi> that is with this legall sorrow
and feare. But though this bee a lawfull and good
thing to mourne, and be troubled for sinne, even in
respect of the misery it maketh us obnoxious unto,
yet is not this sufficient to prove our humiliation and
sorrow for sinne to be sound and sincere, for many
an hypocrite hath gone so farre, they have beene
greatly humbled and troubled for their sinnes. O
how <hi>Pharaoh</hi> complained and cried out of his sinne,
<hi>Exod. 9. 27. He saith to Moses and Aaron, I have sinned,
the Lord is righteous and I and my people are wicked.</hi> And
so did <hi>Iudas, Mat. 27. 3. 4. He repented himselfe, &amp; cryed
out,</hi> saying, <hi>I have sinned in that I have betrayed innocent
blood.</hi> Did not these men mourne for their sinnes
thinke you? Yes that they did, but it was not out of
any respect to God whom they had offended, but
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:4296:78"/>
onely out of respect to themselves and the hurt they
had done themselves thereby, as appeareth plainly
in their stories.</p>
                  <p>Now the true repentant though he be humbled
for his sinne in respect to himselfe, and the danger
and hurt that he feareth his sinne will doe him, yet
he resteth not there, but he is also humbled for his
sinne in respect to God; and chiefly because he hath
offended and dishonoured God by his sinne. This
was that that troubled <hi>David</hi> most, <hi>Psal. 51. 4. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thee, thee onely have I sinned.</hi> When God had
threatned heavy things against him by God he cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
(not as <hi>Pharaoh, Exod. 10. 17. Take away from mee
this death only but as) 2. Sam. 24. 10. I beseech thee ô
Lord take away the iniquity of thy servant.</hi> Yea he was
well content to beare that punishment, so his sinne
might be pardoned that he might have Gods favour
verse 17. <hi>Let thy hand I pray thee be against me, and my
fathers house.</hi> The punishment that his sinne hath
brought or is like to bring upon him troubleth the
true penitent nothing so much as the offending of
God and losse of his favour, <hi>Hee lamenteth after the
Lord,</hi> as it is said, Gods people did, 1 <hi>Sam. 7. 2.</hi> And
as he mourneth for his sinne in respect to God more
then to the punishment of his sinne, so doth hee joy
and take more comfort in the assurance of the pardon
of his sinne, then in deliverance from any judgement
whatsoever. This is the thing that <hi>David</hi> gloried in
<hi>Psal. 32. 5. Thou forgavest</hi> (not the punishment as the
old translation reads, but) <hi>the iniquity of my sinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O let us examine our selves by this second note<note place="margin">Applic.</note>
whether we have sorrowed for oursinnes in respect
unto God, or to our selves onely. Thy sinnes doe
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:4296:79"/>
trouble thee because thou knowest they deserve hell
and damnation, thou knowest they deserve Gods
curse in thy children, in thy estate, in every thing
thou takest in hand. Thou dost well in this, but if
this be the onely thing, or the chief thing that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
thy sinne such a burden to thy heart, thou hast
not yet repented aright. When those that heard
<hi>Peter</hi> were pricked in their hearts with these legall
sorrowes, and asked him what they should doe to
come to comfort, he bad them repent, <hi>Act. 2. 37.
38.</hi> As if he had said, This is a good preparative,
but this is not repentance.</p>
                  <p>This is a chief note of sincerity in every grace,
and so in this, when we doe that that God requireth,
when we mourne for our sinnes in respect unto God,
and not to our selves. Thus God upbraideth the
hypocrites, <hi>Zac. 7. 5. When yee fasted and mourned,
did yee it at all to mee, even to mee? Rom. 14. 6. He
that regardeth a day, regardeth it unto the Lord.</hi> I will
give you therefore three other notes to try this by
whether your sorrow for sinne be in respect to the
Lord because you have offended, and dishonoured
him, or noe.</p>
                  <p>First, Then your sinnes will trouble you aswell
in the days of health, and prosperity as in sicknes, and
affliction, else you doe no more then an hypocrite
may doe. For it is said of the wicked Israelites, <hi>Psal.
78. 34. When he slew them, then they sought him, and
returned and enquired early after God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Then you will be troubled for one
sinne aswell as for another, for every thing you
know to be a sinne, for God is offended and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
by one aswell as by another. <hi>Whosoever shall
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:4296:79"/>
keepe the whole Law</hi> (saith the Apostle, <hi>Iam. 2. 10.)
and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</hi> I doe not say
we should be troubled so much for one sinne as for
another, for God in his Law hath put a difference
betweene sinnes; and as some dutyes that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
of us, so some sinnes are weightier then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
(<hi>Mat. 23. 23. Iudgement, Mercy, and Fidelity</hi>
are called by our Saviour the <hi>weightier matters of the
Law</hi>) and it is made there the note of an hypocrite
to be more troubled for small sinnes then for great,
<hi>Matthew 23. 24. to straine at a gnat, and swallow a
camell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this is also certaine that he that is troubled for
sinne, because it is sinne in resepect unto God because
he is offended and dishonoured by it, will be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for one sinne aswell as for another. So we shall
find <hi>David</hi> was humbled, not for his adultery and
murder onely, but for all his sinnes, <hi>Psal. 51. 9. Hide
thy face from my sinnes; and blot out all mine iniquities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apostle speaking of the loose performing
of spirituall duties, of coming to the sacrament with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
due preparation saith, we must judge our selves
even for that, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 31.</hi> And saith that even for
this sinne God strucke many with sicknesse and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
because they would not judge themselves for
such sins God did judge them, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 30. Davids</hi>
heart smote him even for cutting of the lap of <hi>Sauls</hi>
garment, 1 <hi>Sam. 24. 5.</hi> When <hi>Saul</hi> counted the spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of <hi>Agag,</hi> and of the fattest of the cattell (special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for sacrifice) but a matter of nothing, <hi>Samuel</hi> telleth
him, <hi>disobedience to God is as bad as witchcraft and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
1 Sam. 15. 23.</hi> O therefore know thou art not
troubled for any sinne in respect to God, if thy very
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:4296:80"/>
unprofitablenes, idlenesse, peevishnesse, unconstancy,
playing fast and loose with God, do not trouble thee.</p>
                  <p>Yea the man whose heart is truly humbled for sin
is conscious of the sinfull depravation of his nature,
and is humbled for that (which is the root) asmuch
(if not much more) then for his actuall sinnes which
are the fruits of it. <hi>All sins that defile a man, come from
within from this fountaine, Mar. 7. 23. David</hi> was hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for this, <hi>Psal. 51. 5. Behold I was shapen in iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and in sinne did my mother conceive me.</hi> And so
<hi>Paul</hi> though he had lived a most innocent life even
before his calling to Christ, <hi>Phil. 3. 6.</hi> Yet see how
he was troubled even for this, <hi>Rom. 7. 14, 24.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If you be humbled for your sinne out of
respect to God, because God is offended, and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
by it then will you be able to mourne for the
sins of other men, for God is aswel offended and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured
by them as by your own. 1. I shewed you
before that the man that is truly hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled for the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God upon this land, will mourne more
for the sinnes of the land, then for the Iudgements
themselves. So must we, 2. bee able to mourne for
the sinnes of the places, and townes we dwell in, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if they be of note for religion. This is prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
as a duty, 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 2.</hi> Ye should have <hi>mourned, that
he that hath done this deed, might be taken away.</hi> This is
commended by the Holy Gost as a great vertue and
grace in <hi>Lot, 2 Pet. 2. 8. that in seeing and hearing, hee
vexed his righteous soule from day to day, with the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
deeds of the Sodomites.</hi> This hath a great promise of
speciall protection in the dayes of common calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<hi>Goe through the midst of the City, through the midst of
Ierusalem</hi> (saith the Lord to the man clothed in linen
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:4296:80"/>
with the writers inkhorne by his side, <hi>Ezek. 9. 4.)
and set a marke upon the foreheads of the men that sigh,
and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the
midst thereof. 3.</hi> For the sins especially of our owne
families, for they should trouble us most; <hi>Nehemiah</hi>
in his fast complained chiefly of his owne, and of the
sinnes of his fathers house, <hi>Neh. 16.</hi> And it is said that
when God should <hi>poure the spirit of grace and of suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations</hi>
upon his people, they should <hi>mourn every fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apart, Zac. 12 12.</hi> And <hi>Iob</hi> eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the feare that his
sons in their feasting might have sinned, offred burnt
offrings (which were alwayes accompanied with
profession of humiliation) for them, <hi>Iob 1. 5.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Certainly he that careth not how much lewdnes
there bee in the towne where he liveth,<note place="margin">Applic.</note> nor
in his owne family, and that is not unfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly
troubled for it nor endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to reforme it, was never yet
rightly humbled for any
sinne of his owne.</p>

                  <epigraph>
                     <bibl>Eccl. 11. 8.</bibl>
                     <q>But if a man live many yeeres, and rejoyce in them all;
yet let him remember the dayes of darkenesse, for they
shall be many. All that cometh is vanity.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He occasion of these words, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
they have upon that went
before is this. <hi>Salomon</hi> in the six first
verses of this Chapter, had earnestly
exhorted to the works of mercy and
charity, and enforced his exhortation by many
strong and perswasory arguments. In this verse and
that which goeth before it, hee concludes that
exhortation, with another forcible argument,
taken from the consideration of our future estate.
And the summe of his argument is, as if, he should
have said thus: <hi>Doe all that thou art able to doe, that
thou maist provide well for thy future estate.</hi> It is the very
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:4296:82"/>
same argument in effect which our blessed Saviour
useth to the same purpose, <hi>Luk. 12. 33. Sell that yee
have and give almes: provide your selves bagges that
wax not old, a treasure in the Heavens that faileth not,
where no theef approacheth, ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ther moth corrupteth.</hi> As
if he should say, bestow your goods so while you
live here, as you may have most use and comfort of
them in the life that is to come. As our Merchants
that trade into Turky or Persia will lay out their
mony there upon those commodities, that will bee
most beneficiall to them heere, when they shall come
home againe.</p>
                  <p>This argument <hi>Salomon</hi> propounds heere by way
of answer, to an objection that men (specially volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
men) are apt to make against all this that he had
said to perswade them to workes of charity and
mercy, and whereby they are made most backward
unto this duty. The Objection is set downe in the
7. verse, <hi>Truely the light is sweet and a pleasant thing
it is for the eyes to behold the sunne.</hi> Where it is to bee
observed (for the opening of the words) that by
light is meant, a pleasant and prosperous, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
life. For as our life is called in Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>the light of the living, Psal. 56. 13.</hi> because life
it selfe is sweet and comfortable to man; so is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
estate in this life oft set forth and resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
by this metaphore. When <hi>Eliphas</hi> would
perswade <hi>Iob</hi> how beneficiall a thing it would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him to returne unto the Almighty, not onely in
respect of spirituall and eternall, but even of worldly
and temporall blessings also, that he should be sure to
receive by it, he expresseth it thus, <hi>Iob 22. 28. thou shalt
decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee; and the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4296:82"/>
light shall shine upon thy wayes,</hi> that is thou shalt pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
in whatsoever thou takest in hand, and have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in it. <hi>The Iewes</hi> (saith the sacred Story, <hi>Est. 8.
16.</hi> upon the advancement of <hi>Mordecay,</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing
of <hi>Hamans</hi> letters) <hi>had light and gladnesse and
joy and honour.</hi> So that the Objection which the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous
man maketh, verse 7. is in effect thus much,
<hi>Certainly life is sweet, and it is a great happinesse, to live
plentifully, and prosperously, neatly, and pleasantly in this
world, which I can never doe, if I should not bee carefull to
keepe that I have, If I should hearken to thy counsaile, and
be so liberall and bountifull to the poore, as thou wouldst
have me to be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Objection <hi>Salomon</hi> gives answer to in this
verse. And in his answer 3. points are to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p>1. A supposition of two things, 1. Suppose
(saith he) <hi>that a man doe live many yeeres,</hi> which (yet)
no man (specially no voluptuous man) hath cause to
looke for, <hi>For what is your life?</hi> (saith the Apostle
<hi>Iam. 4. 14.) It is even a vapour that appeareth for a litle
time, and then vanisheth away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Suppose also that <hi>he rejoyce in them all;</hi> which
(yet) is more unlikely and (in a manner) impossible;
for all men (good and bad) are subject in their whole
life, to many occasions of sorrow, which they can by
no meanes avoid. <hi>Man is born unto trouble</hi> (saith <hi>Eliph.
Iob 5. 7. as the sparkes fly upward.</hi> Yea every day of mans
life, will bring forth some new occasion of sorrow
unto him, or other <hi>sufficient unto the day is the evill
thereof,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>Mat. 6. 34.</hi> Yea it is thus
even with the best men, <hi>all the day long have I beene
plagued</hi> (saith the Prophet, <hi>(Psal. 73. 14.) and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4296:83"/>
chastened every morning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then followes the 2. point to be observed in the
words, and that is <hi>a charge or admonition;</hi> as if he should
say, admit both those things that I have thus suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
yet for all that, I advise and charge him, <hi>Let
him remember the dayes of darkenesse.</hi> Wherein also
observe (for the opening of the words) 1. that <hi>by the
dayes of darkenesse</hi> he meanes all that time that we shall
spend in the estate of the dead. For though the godly
(in respect of their soules) be presently after death,
translated into Paradise, according to that speach of
our Saviour, <hi>Luk. 23. 43. this day shalt thou be with me
in Paradise;</hi> and there is no darknesse there, nothing
but light and comfort unspeakable, <hi>(the inheritance of
the Saints is in light,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>Col. 1. 12. In thy
presence is fulnesse of joy</hi> (saith <hi>David, Psal. 16. 11) at
thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore)</hi> yet (in
respect of the bodyes of all men) as this life is fitly
compared to <hi>light,</hi> so is the state of the dead unto
<hi>darknesse.</hi> And so speaketh <hi>Iob</hi> of it, <hi>Iob 10. 21. Before
I goe whence I shall not returne, even to the land of darknes
and to the shadow of death,</hi> that is before I dye: yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the souls also of all wicked men, shall after death
abide in darkenesse everlasting. And so their misery
is expressed, <hi>Mat. 22. 13. Cast him into outer
darknesse, there shall bee weeping and gnashing of
teeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Observe the reason why he would have
these <hi>dayes of darknesse</hi> to be remembred and thought
upon, <hi>because they are many,</hi> saith he, a great many more
then the time we can hope to spend here. In which
respect death is called, <hi>Ier. 51. 57. a perpetuall sleepe,</hi>
and we use to call our grave our long home. And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4296:83"/>
for this cause it behooves us to be more careful to
provide well for our future estate, then for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
life. As all wise men, will care more for, and
bestow more cost upon that house and land, which
they hold in free hold or by inheritance, then upon
that where they are but tenants at will, or hold for
term of life onely.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly and lastly, observe the conclusion which
he infers upon this admonition and charge, <hi>all that
cometh</hi> that man getteth and enjoyeth heere <hi>is vanity,</hi>
and emptinesse, no sound comfort or contentment of
heart is to be found in it.</p>
                  <p>The principall point then that is to be observed
(you see) in these words is the <hi>admonition and charge,</hi>
that <hi>Salomon</hi> gives heere, to <hi>remember the dayes of
darkenesse;</hi> and from thence this Doctrine ariseth for
our instruction: <hi>That it is profitable and necessary for all
men even in their best health, in their greatest prosperity, to
remember and thinke oft of their death, and of their future
estate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Two sorts of witnesses I will produce for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of this.</p>
                  <p>The first is of good men, who have thus judged
of the meditation of death.</p>
                  <p>This appeareth 1. by their practise; they have
beene wont to thinke much of their change. This
was <hi>Iobs</hi> daily meditation, <hi>All the dayes of my warfare,</hi>
(saith he, <hi>Iob 14. 14.</hi> for so I read it with sundry of the
best interpreters, <note n="*" place="margin">Vetus. Lat. Calvin, Pagnin. Vatablus, Arias Montanus.</note>) <hi>will I waite till my change come.</hi>
Neither did he onely in the times of his misery and
affliction thinke thus of his change and wait for it, but
in the dayes of his greatest prosperity also, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
by that which he saith, <hi>Iob 3. 25. the thing that I
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:4296:84"/>
greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid
of it come unto me.</hi> When he was in the height and
strength of his peace and health, hee lived in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
feare and expectation of a change.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It appeares that they judged it profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and necessary to thinke much of their end, by
the helps they were wont to use to keepe their death
alwayes in their remembrance.</p>
                  <p>For 1. they counted it their wisdome to visit the
sick, and goe oft to the house of mourning, even for
this purpose. <hi>The heart of the wise is in the house of
mourning,</hi> saith <hi>Salomon, Eccl. 7. 4.</hi> and why did they
account it their wisedome to do so? he had given us
the reason of that in the 2. verse <hi>for this is the end of all
men</hi> (saith he) <hi>and the living will lay it to his heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, to this end also they were wont to make
their sepulchers in their lifetime, so did <hi>Asa</hi> one of
the good <hi>Kings</hi> of Iuda, 2 <hi>Chro. 16. 14.</hi> and so did
good <hi>Iosia</hi> also, 2 <hi>Kings 23. 30.</hi> and so did <hi>Ioseph</hi> of
<hi>Arimathea, Mat. 27. 60.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly and lastly, they were wont in their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
earnestly to beg helpe of God this waye, <hi>Teach us
to number our dayes,</hi> say Gods people to God in their
prayer, <hi>Psal. 90. 12.</hi> that is, teach us to consider the
shortnesse and uncertainty of our life, as <hi>David</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
that prayer of <hi>Moses,</hi> in another prayer of his
to the same effect, <hi>Psal. 39. 4. Lord make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ee to know
mine end, and the number of my dayes what it is, that I may
know how fraile I am.</hi> Because they knew well, on the
one side, how usefull and necessary it was for them,
oft to thinke of the uncertainty and shortnesse of their
life, and on the other side how hard a thing it was for
them to keep this in their mind, how apt they were to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:4296:84"/>
grow forgetfull of it, therefore they did earnestly sue
unto God that by his Holy Spirit, he would please
to helpe them in this case. And this is my first sort of
witnesses.</p>
                  <p>The second is the Lord himselfe, for hee hath also
declared himselfe to judge so of the benefit and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of this meditation. 1. By that earnest charge
which our Saviour giveth to his Disciples concerning
this, <hi>Mar. 13. 35. Watch yee therefore, for ye know not
when the master of the house commeth, at even, or at mid-night,
or at the cockerowing, or in the morning,</hi> and verse
37. <hi>And what I say unto you, I say unto all;</hi> that is live in
a continuall expectation of your end and of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
you must bee called unto, because you know
not how soone and suddaine it may be.</p>
                  <p>2. By that patheticall with the Lord uttereth, <hi>Deu.
32. 29. O that they were wise, that they understood this,
that they would consider their latter end!</hi> He wisheth
his people would understand and consider also, think
and meditate seriously of their latter end, and he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
it a high point of wisdome for them, to doe
so.</p>
                  <p>I know well that the meditation and thought of
death is bitter to the flesh,<note place="margin">Object.</note> and useth to breed much
heavinesse and feare in the heart. And this is a chief
thing that makes men unwilling to entertaine
it.</p>
                  <p>But as many other bitter things are most wholsom
and soveraigne,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> even so is this. Thus doth <hi>Salomon</hi>
answer this very objection which hee knew men
would be apt to make, against that which he had said
shewing the benefit of going to those houses, where
people are mourning for the sicknesse or death of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:4296:85"/>
their friends. Alas, (will men say) if we should use
to doe so, we should never be merry, but sad, and
pensive, and melancholick. O saith he, <hi>Eccl. 7. 3.</hi> but
<hi>sorrow is better then laughter; for by the sadnesse of the
countenance, the heart is made better.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Three great benefits we may receive by thinking
oft and seriously of our latter end. Which may
serve for the Reasons and Grounds of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                  <p>1. This would season all our pleasures and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contents,<note place="margin">Reason 1</note> so as we should be kept from surfetting
of them. He that is perswaded of the necessity of
watching continually for the Lords comming, and
resolved to doe so, will keepe himselfe sober from
being overcome with the immoderate love of any
earthly thing. As he that knowes he must keepe
the watch in a besieged City, will be sure to keepe
himselfe from taking too much drink. <hi>Because the
time is short</hi> (saith the Apostle 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 29.) therefore
let him that rejoiceth, be as though he rejoiced not.</hi> As if
he should say, take heed of rejoycing too much in
any earthly thing, because our time here is but short.
Therefore our Saviour at a great feast, <hi>Mar. 14. 5.
8.</hi> fals into a meditation and speech of his death and
buriall.</p>
                  <p>And this was also (it seemes) the reason why sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
good men were wont to make their sepulchers
in their gardens the places of their greatest solace
and delight. So we read that <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>sses</hi> did after his
humiliation and repentance, 2 <hi>King. 21. 18.</hi> And so
did <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> also, as wee may see, <hi>Ioh.
19. 41.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, nothing would have more force then
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4296:85"/>
this to restraine us from sinne; and to breed in us a
care to please God in all things. This reason is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in that prayer; <hi>Psal. 90. 12. So teach us to number
our dayes, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdome.</hi> If
we could number our dayes well, and consider how
few they are like to be, this would make us apply
our hearts to wisdome and piety more seriously
than we do. Experience shewes this, even in the
worst men. O what Saints seeme many of them to
be in their extreme sicknesse? How fearfull are
they then to offend God in any thing? Nay, no
man (almost) is so desperately wicked, that durst do
any thing his conscience knew to be sinne, if he
thought he must die instantly, so soone as he had
done it. Durst any man give himselfe liberty to be
drunke, if he considered he might die while he is
drunke, as <hi>Elah</hi> did, 2 <hi>King. 16. 9, 10.</hi> Or durst any
man commit whoredome, if he could seriously
thinke of this, that God might strike him suddenly,
even while he is in that filthy act, as he did <hi>Zimri</hi>
and <hi>Cozby, Numb. 25. 8.</hi> Therefore also we shall find
this oft noted for a chiefe cause of many grosse sins
that men live in, even the wilfull forgetting of their
change, and putting it out of their mind. <hi>David</hi>
speaking of the prophane man <hi>Psal. 10. 4.</hi> who
<hi>through the pride of his countenance will not seeke after
God; God is not in all his thoughts;</hi> giveth this for a
reason of all this prophanenesse, Verse 6. <hi>He hath
said in his heart, I shall not be moved, I shall never be in
adversity.</hi> And the Prophet speaking of unjust and
cruell men that did oppresse the poore, gives this for
the reason of it, <hi>Amos 6. 3.</hi> because they did by all
meanes put out of their minds the thought of their
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:4296:86"/>
death, and the judgement that they must come unto,
<hi>Ye put farre away</hi> (saith he) <hi>the evill day, and cause the
seat of violence to come neare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly and lastly, nothing would be of more
force to worke in us a care to prepare our selves for
death, that it may not take us at unawares before we
be ready for it, then this, if we would oft and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
think of it. And this would be (doubtlesse) a
great benefit and advantage unto us. This is a point
of true wisdome, and ought to be the chiefe care of
every Christian, to provide, that he may die well.
<hi>Heare couns<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ll, and receive instruction</hi> (saith <hi>Salomon,
Proverb. 19. 20.) that thou maist be wise at thy latter end.</hi>
This is one maine end we should aime at in all our
hearing and seeking knowledge, that we may learne
to die well. This was the Apostles chiefe care, <hi>that
he might finish his course with joy, Act. 20. 24.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And on the other side, it is the most dangerous
and wofull negligence that a man can fall into, not to
prepare before hand, and provide that he may die
well. O it is a most miserable thing for death to take
us at unawares before we be ready. <hi>Take heed to your
selves</hi> (saith our Saviour, <hi>Luke 21 36.) that that come
not upon you unawares.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sudden death certainly is a kind of temporall
judgement, even unto the best men (and so farre
forth may be prayed against) because the best man is
not so well prepared for death in the time of his
health and prosperity, but he hath just cause to desire
and endeavour also to prepare himselfe better for it
before he die. True it is we should be at all times (as
Gods people were when they did eat the passeover,
<hi>Exod. 12. 11. with their loines girded, their shoes on their
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:4296:86"/>
feet, and their staves in their hand.)</hi> ready to passe from
this <hi>Egypt</hi> unto our heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi> But (though
every man should be, yet) no man is so well prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
at all times, as he ought to be. But sudden death
is to a wicked man that is not at all prepared for it,
more then a temporall judgement. Though a man
have made his will before-hand, and have it in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse
lying by him, yet may he esteeme it a good
temporall blessing, when his last sicknesse whereby
God visits him, is not so violent, but he may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to review it, and adde or alter some small things
in it before his death. And on the other side it may
justly be accounted a temporall judgement upon
him, when God takes him away with a dead Palsie
or Apoplexy that would disable him from doing so
much. And yet if he do die of such a disease, the
matter is not great, because he had made his will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and disposed of his maine estate according to
his mind. But it is (we know) a matter of great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and inconvenience for a rich man that hath not
made his will before, to be taken with such a sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
at his end. And even so is it in this case. Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
death is no such judgement to Gods child, who
is for the maine prepared for it, as it is to the wicked
man, who is not at all prepared for it. It is certainly a
dangerous and fearfull thing for a man to live
out of Gods favour, and void of grace, at any time;
but to die in that estate, is the very up-shot of all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery.
And so the Holy Ghost speaketh of it. <hi>Eliphaz</hi>
speaking of the extreme unhappinesse of wicked
men, he concludes it thus, <hi>Iob 4. 21. They even die
without wisdome,</hi> (saith he) as if he should say, <hi>and
what can be said more to prove them most wretched men?</hi>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:4296:87"/>
So speaketh the Prophet when he would describe
the misery of the man that hath gotten a great deale
of wealth by oppression and fraud, <hi>Ier. 17. 11. at his
end he shall be a foole,</hi> saith he; he shalbe utterly void
of true wisdome and grace, even when he dies. And
this must needs be so, because there is no possibility
of repenting and turning unto God, of recovering
his favour, or obtaining any grace from him after
death. He that dies without grace, must to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
presently so soone as he is dead, <hi>Heb. 9. 27.
And hell followes with death,</hi> saith the Holy Ghost,
<hi>Rev. 6. 8. q. d.</hi> they go hand in hand; as judgement is
immediately passed upon them that die out of Gods
favour, so hell is ready presently <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o receive them.</p>
                  <p>Now this Doctrine which you have heard thus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
and confirmed unto you,<note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> is of great use,</p>
                  <p>First, to reprove and condemne us all of great fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and madnesse. 1. None of us are so carefull to
nourish this thought and meditation in our hearts, so
desirous or willing to thinke of our death and future
estate as we ought to be. Nay, 2. Most of us do
wilfully refuse to thinke of death, but abandon this
thought by all meanes, and use our utmost endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to keep it out of our hearts; as the Persian
Kings were wont to keep all mourners out of their
gates, <hi>Esth. 4, 2.</hi> Nay, 3. (which is worst of all)
many of us for this very cause, will not think of our
end, but banish by all meanes this meditation out of
our hearts, that we may sinne the more freely. And
with those vile men (that I told you the Prophet
complaines of, <hi>Amos 6. 3.</hi>) we put farre away the
evill day of purpose, that we may cause the seat of
violence to come neare, that without feare and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4296:87"/>
checke of conscience we may run headlong into
all excesse of riot, that we can devise.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> this Doctrine serves to exhorte us
all to prepare for death. For that is the chief reason
(as we have heard) why we should remember and
thinke of it so oft. And this preparation consisteth
in two things principally.</p>
                  <p>First, We must labour to weane our hearts dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
from the overmuch love of all earthly things;
and inure our selves to beare willingly the daily and
ordinary crosses we are subject to in this life, nothing
makes us so unwilling and unfit to dye, as the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
love of earthly things. They are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
(certainly) Gods good blessings, and he doth
(of his goodnesse and bounty) allow us to use and
enjoy them, not for our necessity onely, but even
for our delight and comfort also <hi>he giveth us richly all
things to enjoy,</hi> saith the Apostle, 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 17.</hi> But
the love of them is a most deadly enemy to grace,
specially unto this grace of dying willingly and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably.
That which the Apostle saith of the <hi>love
of mony, 1 Tim. 6. 10.</hi> that it is <hi>the root of all evill,</hi> and
cause why many are even <hi>pierced thorow with many
sorrows,</hi> (the truth whereof is never more seene then
when they are to dye) may be likewise said of the
love of any other worldly thing. <hi>Love not the world</hi>
(saith the Apostle 1 <hi>Iohn 2. 15.) neither the things that
are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the
father is not in him.</hi> For this cause it was that our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Saviour, when he would prepare his disciples for
persecution &amp; death, bears so much upon these points</p>
                  <p>First, That they would take heed of esteeming
too highly of, or overloving any of the comforts of
this life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:4296:88"/>
Secondly, That they would learne to beare wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
the ordinary crosses God is pleased to exercise
them with. <hi>He that loveth father or mother</hi> (saith he,
<hi>Mat. 10. 37, 38.) more then me is not worthy of mee;
and he that loveth sonne or daughter more then me, is not
worthy of mee. And he that taketh not his crosse, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
after me, is not worthy of me. And he said to them
all (Luke 9. 23.) if any man will come after me, let him
deny himselfe, and take up his crosse daily and follow mee.</hi>
And so the Apostle saith of himselfe, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 31.</hi>
that he did <hi>dye daily;</hi> that is, by his willing forsaking
of the comforts of this life, and bearing of those dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
crosses that he was subject unto, he learned to dye
every day.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Our preparation for death consisteth
in our care to dispatch without delay and with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
those things of most importance which must
needs be done before we dye. Because we doe not
know how soone, nor how suddenly death may take
us.</p>
                  <p>Thus wee see the harvest man, and travailer that
are afraid to be benighted, are wont to doe. And
we have Christs owne example for this, <hi>I must worke
the works of him that sent me</hi> (saith he, <hi>Iohn 9. 4.) while
it is day, the night commeth when no man can
worke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And what is that businesse of importance (will
you say) that we must thus dispatch without delay,
if we would be well prepared to dye? Surely to
make this sure to our selves, that whensoever we
dye, our soules shall goe to Heaven: When this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
is once done, we shall be able to dye confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
and comfortably, when once <hi>we know</hi> (as the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:4296:88"/>
Apostle speaketh of himselfe and of others of the
faithfull also, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 1.) that if our earthly house of
this tabernacle were disolved, we have a building of God,
an house not made with hands, eternall in the Heavens,</hi>
then we may s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y as he also doth there, verse 8. <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are alwayes confident; knowing that whilest wee
are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord.</hi> It is
held a good point of wisdome, for a man (specially,
if he be one that hath much to dispose) to have his
will alwayes in a readinesse. And indeed so it is; for
it is commanded of God, <hi>set thine house in order,</hi> saith
the Lord by his Prophet unto <hi>Hezechia, Esa. 38. 1.
for thou must dye, and not live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But there is one thing more needfull then that is,
even to set oursoules in order, and to have them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in a readinesse. This is that <hi>one thing that is
needfull,</hi> of which our Saviour speaketh, <hi>Luke 10. 42.</hi>
It stands us upon to make our peace with God, and
to acquaint our selves well with him before we dye,
or else with what comfort can we goe unto him, and
appeare before him then, yea we had need do it now
in time of our health and without delay. <hi>Acquaint
thyselfe now with God</hi> (saith <hi>Eliphas</hi> to <hi>Iob 22. 21) and
make peace,</hi> I because death commeth upon many and
may doe upon us, sodenly, <hi>for man knoweth not his
times</hi> (saith <hi>Salomon, Eccl. 9. 12.) as the fishes that are
taken in an evill net, and as the birds that are caught in
the snare, so are the sonnes of men snared in an evill time,
when it cometh suddenly upon them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. When extremity of sicknesse comes, we shall
be most unfit then to set our soules in order, to begin
our acquaintance with God, or to make our peace
with him. <hi>Remember now thy Creatour</hi> (saith <hi>Salomon,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:4296:89"/>
Eccles. 12. 1.) in the dayes of thy youth, while the evill
dayes come not, nor the yeares drawnigh when thou shalt
say, I have no pleasure in them.</hi> He thought age an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
time to begin this worke in; but our last sicknesse
is (certainly) a more unfit time for it, than age is.
Then the mind of man is wont to be so distracted
and troubled, what with worldly cares for them that
he shall leave behind him, what with the extremity
of paines that use to accompany sicknesse; and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
with the terrours that rise from the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of his future estate, and from Satans temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that he is not made uncapable of comfort or
direction, by the best meanes that can bee
brought unto him. When <hi>Moses</hi> that excellent ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of God, <hi>one of a thousand,</hi> came to the Israelites
at such a time, though the message he brought to
them were as comfortable as any that they could
heare, yet could they receive no comfort or benefit
at all by it. <hi>Moses spake so</hi> (saith the text, <hi>Exod. 6. 9.)
unto the children of Israel; but they hearkned not unto
Moses, for anguish of spirit, and for cruell bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Admit we were never so able and fit to minde
this matter then, and to go about this weighty busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
admit we could be then more apt to seeke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
with God, than at any other time, yet
have we just cause to feare that (because we have
wilfully neglected this worke so long, and presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously
put it off till the last houre) the Lord (in his
righteous judgement) will refuse to be found of us at
that time. Thus we shall find the Lord hath threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to do, <hi>Prov. 1. 24, 26, 28, 29. Because I have called</hi>
(saith he) <hi>and ye refused, I have stretched out mine
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:4296:89"/>
hand, and no man regarded, I also will laugh at your ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity,
I will mocke when your feare commeth. Then
shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall
seeke me early, but they shall not find me; for that they
hated knowledge, and did not choose the feare of the
Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if you shall aske me, how may this be
done?</p>
                  <p>I answer, That he that would make this sure to
himselfe, that when he dies he shall go to heaven,
must do these three things.</p>
                  <p>1. He must repent of all his knowne sinnes. He
must call them to mind, bewaile them unfainedly,
confesse them to God, and crave earnestly of him
the pardon of them: and resolve with himselfe to
forsake them all. For, 1. <hi>Sinne is the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ing of
death,</hi> as the Apostle cals it, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 56.</hi> And if that
be once done away and forsaken, death can never
hurt a man, nor hath he any cause to feare it at all.
2. On the other side, no man can hope to go to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
with his sinnes unrepented of. <hi>Know ye not</hi> (saith
the Apostle 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 9.) that the unrighteous shall not
inherit the kingdome of God? Be not deceived; neither
fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate,
nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor theeves, nor
covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners
shall inherit the kingdome of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Any one of these sinnes unrepented of, will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exclude a man utterly out of the kingdome of
heaven. 3. Though it be dangerous for a man to
live in sinne, yet is it a matter of farre greater danger
to him to die in sinne, and to be over-taken by death
before he have repented of it. This our Saviour
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:4296:90"/>
noteth as the extreme unhappinesse of the wicked
Iewes, and repeats it often, <hi>Iohn 8. 21. 24.</hi> that they
should <hi>die in their sinnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Get good assurance (by a lively faith) that
Christ is thine, and then shalt thou be able to die in
peace, and in a certaine hope to go to heaven when
thou art dead. When old <hi>Simeon</hi> had seene Christ,
(whom he had waited for by faith, and longed to
see) and was thereby confirmed much in that faith
he had in him before; <hi>He blessed God an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> said, (Luke
2. 28, 29, 30.) Lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in
peace, for mine eyes have seene thy salvation.</hi> They that
have once seene and embraced Christ as he did, spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually
by faith, (I meane) and not corporally one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
shall die in peace; and none but they can do so.
For, 1. It is Christ onely that hath overcome
death for us, and taken away the sting of it. When
the Apostle had said 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 56.</hi> that <hi>sin is the sting
of death. But thanks be to God</hi> (saith he, Verse 57.)
<hi>which giveth us victory through our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
Death is overcome, so that it cannot hurt the true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
at all; but him that is nor in Christ, it will
sting unto death, even unto the second death. 2. We
can have no hope to come to heaven but onely
through him <hi>Christ is in you</hi> (saith the Apostle, <hi>Col.
1. 27.) the hope of glory.</hi> There is no hope to come to
glory, but onely by Christ. Nay, there is no hope
to come to glory through him, unlesse he be in us,
unlesse he dwell in us by a lively faith.</p>
                  <p>3. If thou wouldst be sure to go to heaven when
thou diest, labour whilest thou livest to lead an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable,
a godly and fruitfull life; even to do all
the good that God gives thee power and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:4296:90"/>
to do. <hi>As we have opportunity</hi> (saith the Apostle
<hi>Gal. 6. 10.</hi> which none of us can tell how soone it
may be taken from us) <hi>let us do good unto all men, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
unto them that are of the houshold of faith.</hi> See
what comfort <hi>Hezechia</hi> found in this when he was to
die. <hi>Remember now O Lord I beseech thee</hi> (saith he, <hi>Esa.
38. 3.) how I have walked before thee in truth and with a
perfect heart, &amp; have done that which is good in thy sight.</hi>

a holy life; and now doth he (even before the Lord)

good, that they be rich in good workes, ready to distribute,
willing to communicate; laying up in store for themselves
a good foundation against the time to come, that they may
lay hold on eternall life.</hi> Workes of charity (not as a
meritorious cause of salvation, but) as a sure evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that by a lively faith we have interest and title
to the merits of Christ, shalbe rewarded with stable
and durable riches in time to come, and will make a
man able with confidence of hope to lay hold on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life. And that which the Apostle saith of
certaine bad men, 2 <hi>Cor. 11. 15.</hi> that <hi>their end shalbe
according to their workes,</hi> may be said of all good men
also, <hi>their end shalbe according to their workes.</hi> A good
life will certainly end in a blessed and comfortable
death.</p>
                  <p>Foure things are wont to be objected against this,
which I will briefly give answer unto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:4296:91"/>
Experience sheweth daily that many do die wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,<note place="margin">Object. 1.</note>
and quietly, and comfortably also, that have
neither lived so unblameably and fruitfully, nor u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
any such means to prepare themselves for death,
as you have prescribed.</p>
                  <p>To this I answer,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> 1. That we may not thinke
that every one that dies quietly, and speakes glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
of his willingnesse to die, and of the peace and
comfort that he finds in the assurance of his salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
doth die happily and comfortably indeed. For,
the Holy Ghost speaks of some that were most w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>c<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and wretched men, that <hi>have no bands in their
death, Psal. 73. 4.</hi> In outward things all things (aswell
in death as in life) fall alike to good and bad, as <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
saith, <hi>Eccles. 9. 2. 2.</hi> We have just cause to
suspect the peace and quietnesse of conscience that
seemes to be in that man, that was never troubled
nor disquieted in his mind for his sinnes. Because
<hi>the spirit of bondage</hi> and <hi>feare</hi> useth to go before <hi>the
spirit of adoption</hi> and comfort, as is plaine by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
speech, <hi>Rom. 8. 15. 3.</hi> And lastly, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
a grievous judgement of God, and such as we
should all tremble at, to see a man that hath beene in
his whole life time notoriously wicked, to have no
sight at all nor trouble of mind for his sinnes before
he dies. Our Saviour pronounceth them to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
men. <hi>Mat. 5. 3, 4, 6.</hi> that are so <hi>poore in spirit,</hi> that
they <hi>mourne for it,</hi> and <hi>hunger and thirst after righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.</hi>
And if this be a blessed thing in every child
of God (how unblameable and civill soever his life
hath been) at all times (even in the time of his best
health and prosperity) to see and feele in himselfe so
just cause of mourning and trouble of mind, as
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4296:91"/>
breeds in him an unsatiable desire after the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
of God in Christ; then must it needs be a
most wofull and cursed thing in a man that hath
been notoriously wicked, to be void of all sight and
sense of his sinnes, of all trouble of mind for them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
then when he is summoned by sicknesse and
death to appeare before the judgement-seat of God;
to go to hell in a sleep, and never to have his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
awakened till he come there. And indeed so
the Prophet speaketh of this as of a most dreadfull
judgement of God, when he gives up wicked men
unto this blindnesse and senslesnesse of heart. <hi>The
Lord hath powred out upon you</hi> (saith he, <hi>Esa. 29. 10.)
the spirit of deepe sleepe, and hath closed your eyes,</hi> so
as you cannot see nor be sensible of your owne
estate.</p>
                  <p>But we see also on the other side in daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
(say some) that many who have seemed most
religious in all their life time,<note place="margin">Ob. 2.</note> and carefull to live
well, have (yet) shewed very great unwillingnesse
and feare to die; more a great deale then other men
usually do.</p>
                  <p>To this I have two things to answer. First,<note place="margin">Ans. 1.</note> that
it is indeed possible enough, even for a faithfull and
godly man to feele in himselfe an unwillingnesse and
feare to die. Good <hi>Hezechia wept sore, Esa. 38. 3.</hi>
when the Prophet brought him word in his sicknesse
that <hi>he must die and not live:</hi> and <hi>David</hi> also prayed
oft against death, and that he might live still, <hi>Psal. 6.
4, 5.</hi> and 30. 8, 9. and 88. 9, 12. It is with many of
Gods people in this case, as it was with <hi>Lot</hi> when he
would leave Sodom. Though <hi>Lot</hi> had so small
comfort in Sodom while he lived in it, 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 8.</hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:4296:92"/>
yet see how unwilling he was to part with it, <hi>Gen.
19. 16.</hi> He lingred so, that the Angels were faine to
pull him out (as it were) by strong hand: <hi>they laid
hold upon his hand</hi> (saith the sacred text) the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mercifull unto him, and brought him forth, and
set him without the City. Some unwillingnesse to
die our Saviour tels <hi>Peter</hi> he should find in himselfe,
even then when he should suffer martyrdome for his
sake. <hi>When thou shalt be old</hi> (saith he, <hi>Ioh. 21. 18.) thou
shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee,
and carie thee whither thou wouldest not.</hi> And there is
good reason to be given for this. For, 1. Death
being a great enemie to the nature of man, and even
the dissolution of it, there must needs be in all men
(naturally) some feare of it. Such as haue beene
long, and inward, and deare friends, cannot part for
adieu (as we say) without much unwillingnesse, and
expression of griefe; as we see in the example of <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>
and <hi>David, 1 Sam. 20. 41.</hi> And where were ever
found in the world so long &amp; inward &amp; dear friends,
as the soule and body have beene? 2. Who can
thinke of his personall appearance before the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
of God without some feare? 3. Lastly, the
best of Gods servants, though they know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that when they die they shall not <hi>come into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation</hi>
(as our Saviour speaketh, <hi>Iohn 5. 24.) but
are already passed from death unto life;</hi> and therefore
have no just cause (in respect of their future estate) to
feare death at all, but rather to welcome it, and to
rejoyce in it, yet are they regenerated, and (conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently)
do believe but in part. And though the
spirit (the regenerate part) <hi>indeed be willing</hi> (as our
Saviour speaketh, <hi>Mat. 26. 41.</hi>) yet <hi>the flesh</hi> (the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4296:92"/>
part) will be apt to shew it selfe <hi>weake</hi> and
unwilling to die.</p>
                  <p>But then I answer secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> that there is no man
that hath lead a godly life, but 1. He discernes and
bewailes his owne corruption in this his unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnesse
to die; he yeelds not to it, but strives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it by all meanes; and even in this case finds in
himselfe that combate betweene the flesh and the
spirit, that the Apostle speakes of <hi>Gal. 5. 17. The flesh
lus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh;
and these are contrary the one to the other. 2.</hi> He doth in
the end overcome this corruption; and is (by Gods
grace) made most willing and desirous to die, before
God cals and takes him away, according to that gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
promise made unto all Gods people, to all
that have been carefull to serve and please him, <hi>Psal.
29. 11. The Lord will give strength unto his people, the
Lord will blesse his people with peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then there is yet another thing objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this that hath been said touching the assurance<note place="margin">Object. 3.</note>
they may have to die happily and well, that have
been carefull to live religiously and well; namely,
that many who have beene most precisely religious,
have not onely beene void of comfort when they
should die, but full of terrour in their conscience,
calling in question the truth of their faith, and of
whatsoever goodnesse hath seemed to be in them,
apt to despaire utterly of the mercy of God in
Christ.</p>
                  <p>My answer to this objection must consist of three
branches.<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>1.<note place="margin">1.</note> It is possible indeed even for a man that hath
lived a most innocent and holy life, to expresse in his

                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:4296:94"/>
last sicknesse much terrour, and to breake forth into
speeches that tend unto desperation, and even unto
blasphemy also against God. For, 1. There is
no disease so violent and extreme, but the child of
God may be subject unto it, and die of it also aswell
as any other man. <hi>All things come alike to all</hi> in this
respect, as <hi>Salomon</hi> speaketh, <hi>Eccl. 9. 2.</hi> And these
things that are objected (as causlesse feares and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
ravings, blasphemies, fierce speeches and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
both against themselves and others) are
knowne to be the very naturall effects of some vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and extreme diseases. 2. It cannot be denyed
but that Satan also is wont to shew the uttermost of
his fury and power against Gods servants in their
last sicknesse. The last combate that they have with
him, is wont to be the sharpest of all other. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
telleth us <hi>Col. 2. 15.</hi> that our blessed Saviour
<hi>spoiled the principalities and powers, and made a shew of
them openly, triumphing over them in his crosse.</hi> All
<hi>the principalities and powers</hi> of hell did then set upon
him, and shewed their uttermost strength and rage
against him. This Christ did fore-see, and told his
Disciples of also before hand, <hi>The prince of this world
commeth</hi> (saith he, <hi>Iohn 14. 30.) and hath nothing in me:</hi>
as if he should say, I know well that Satan in my pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
(which is now at hand) will come and assault me
with all his forces, but <hi>he hath nothing</hi> (nothing of
his owne, no corruption at all) <hi>in me,</hi> and therefore
shall lose his labour, and do me no hurt at all. And
as he did with Christ our head, so hath he been wont
to deale also with the best of his members and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
even to set upon them most fiercely in their
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ast sicknesse: and that for two causes. 1. Because
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:4296:94"/>
he sees his time and opportunity that he can have
with them is now so short, <hi>having great wrath</hi> (saith
the voice from heaven, <hi>Rev. 12. 12.) because he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that he hath but a short time. 2.</hi> Because he
knoweth we are then (through paines, and feares,
and distempers of body and mind) like to be most
weake and unable to resist him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, though godly men may have such
conflicts with Satan, and experience of his most fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
assaults upon their death-beds; yet the Lord, <hi>the
God of peace is wont to tread downe Satan under their feet,</hi>
(as the Apostle speakes, <hi>Rom. 6. 20.</hi>) before they
die. He useth to make them (even in this life) <hi>mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
then conquerours</hi> over that <hi>distresse and anguish</hi> which
his assaults hath brought them unto. <hi>In all these we
are more than conquerours</hi> (saith he, <hi>Rom. 8. 37.) through
him that loved us.</hi> Yea the experience of many of
Gods servants hath proved, that these bitter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts
of theirs have ended in more abundance of
peace and comfort, than ever they found in their
lives before; and that not inwardly onely in their
owne feeling; but God hath made them able also
to expresse it outwardly, to the exceeding comfort
and admiration of them that have beene about
them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly and lastly, although it should so fall out,
that the Lord (for the further hardning of wicked
men, or for some other causes best knowne to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<hi>whose judgements are unsearchable, and his wayes
past finding out,</hi> as the Apostle speaketh, <hi>Rom. 11.
33.</hi>) should take away any of his servants in these
fearfull fits and conflicts, and utterly disable them
from expressing by word or gesture the victory over
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:4296:95"/>
them, and the comfort that they have ended in; yet
are we to rest confidently assured of this, that every
one that hath lead a good and godly life, doth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
die blessedly and comfortably, though we
cannot perceive it. Because we are to <hi>walke by faith
and not by sight,</hi> as the Apostle teacheth us, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 7.</hi>
and more credit is to be given to the word of God,
than to all sense and experience of men: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whatsoever we heare them speake, or see in the
manner of their death, we should resolve with <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Eccl. 8. 12. Yet surely, I know that it shall be well with
them that feare God, which feare before him.</hi> For the
Lord hath expresly said of every godly man, <hi>Prov.
14. 32. The righteous hath hope in his death.</hi> And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
us <hi>Psal. 37. 37.</hi> to <hi>marke the perfect man, and
behold the upright,</hi> assuring us that <hi>the end of that man
is peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth and last thing that may be objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
that which hath been said,<note place="margin">Object. 4.</note> is this; if the death
of all the godly be so blessed and happy, why hath
there beene such mourning and lamentation for their
death among Gods people, as we see there was both
in the old Testament for the death of <hi>Iacob, Gen. 50.
10.</hi> and of <hi>Samuel, 1 Sam. 25. 1.</hi> and of many more:
and in the new Testament also, for the death of <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
Acts 8. 2.</hi> and of <hi>Tabitha, Acts 9. 36.</hi> and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
others?</p>
                  <p>To this I answer,<note place="margin">Answ. 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. That the happinesse of the godly in their death
makes nothing against our mourning for them; but
it is both lawfull and fit for us to mou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ne for the
death of our Christian friends, (for all that.) 1. Out
of the respect we owe unto them, and out of that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:4296:95"/>
love and affection we are bound to shew unto them.
And the Apostle noteth it <hi>(Rom. 1. 31.)</hi> for a signe of
one that is given up of God to <hi>a reprobate mind,</hi> to be
void of <hi>natural affection</hi> towards them that God hath
linked him unto. 2. Out of respect to our selves, and
therein unto the Lord also: for, we are to take it for
an argument of Gods displeasure against us for our
sinne; when he deprives us of such friends as were
his good instruments of our comfort any way. So
<hi>Naomi,</hi> when God had taken from her her husband
and her two sonnes, said <hi>Ruth 1. 21.</hi> that <hi>the Lord had
testified against her, and the Almighty had afflicted
her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> though it be lawfull and fit we should
mourne for the death of our Christian friends, yet
may we not mourne for them immoderately, but
take heed that we exceed not this way. <hi>They that
weepe</hi> (saith the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 30.) should be as
though they wept not.</hi> They must take heed their
hearts be not too much taken up and oppressed with
griefe: <hi>I would not have you to be ignorant brethren</hi>
(saith he 1 <hi>Thess. 4. 13.) concerning them which are
asleepe, that ye sorrow not even as others which have no
hope.</hi> And we should moderate our griefe in this
case, 1. Out of our respect unto the Lord, who is
the doer of this. It is he that gives, and it is he also
that takes away our friends from us. This quieted
<hi>Iobs</hi> mind, and moderated his sorrow when he had
lost all his sonnes and daughters; <hi>The Lord gave, and
the Lord hath taken away,</hi> saith he, <hi>Iob 1. 21.</hi> It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
us all to stoope and submit our selves to his
will in all things, and to say with old <hi>Ely, 1 Sam. 3.
18. It is the Lord, let him do what seemeth him good.</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:4296:96"/>
And immoderate sorrow in any of our losses, must
needs argue a kind of murmuring and impatiency a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God. 2. Out of our respect unto our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
friends whom we mourne for: for death is to
them (we know) a great advantage: <hi>to die is their
gaine,</hi> as the Apostle speaketh, <hi>Phil. 1. 21.</hi> Death
makes them happy and blessed, <hi>Write, blessed are the
dead which die in the Lord,</hi> saith the voice from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<hi>Rev. 14. 13.</hi> For, 1. Death puts an end to all
their sorrowes, afflictions and tentations that they
were vexed with continually in this life; now <hi>they
rest from their labours, Rev. 14. 13. 2.</hi> Death puts
an end to all their infirmities, which they so much
complained of; and perfecteth their sanctification,
which they so much longed after while they lived:
<hi>The spirits of just men</hi> (saith the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 23.
when they are once separated from their bodies and
translated to heaven, and not before then) <hi>are made
perfect. 3.</hi> And lastly, <hi>their workes follow them,
Rev. 14. 13.</hi> Death puts them in possession of their
eternall happinesse, and of that blessednesse where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
God hath promised to reward their obedience,
and all that care they have had to please him. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the least thing that any child of God hath
done in love and obedience unto him, shall not be
forgotten, nor unrewarded of God: no not the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulnesse,
and diligence, and faithfulnesse of a poore
servant to his master. <hi>Knowing</hi> (saith the Apostle to
such, <hi>Col. 3. 24.) that of the Lord ye shall receive the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of inheritance; for ye serve the Lord Christ.</hi> And
<hi>whosoever</hi> (saith our Saviour, <hi>Mat. 10. 42.) shall give
to drinke unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water
onely in the name of a Disciple, verily I say unto you, he
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:4296:96"/>
shall in no wise lose his reward.</hi> But this reward is many
times not given to Gods servants in this life. When
the <hi>even</hi> is once <hi>come,</hi> and we have done working,
then will the Lord of the vineyard (as we read <hi>Mat.
20. 8.</hi>) give unto all his labourers the wages he hath
covenanted to give unto them.</p>
                  <p>Now because of this great advantage and benefit
that (in all these three respects) comes to our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
friends by their death, we faile much in the love
we pretend to have borne unto them, if we mourne
immoderately for their departure from us. Old
<hi>Barzillai</hi> was willing (even out of his love to his
sonne) to part with him, and forgo the great helpe
and comfort he might have had from him in his age,
because of the great preferment he knew it would be
to his sonne to leave him, and live with <hi>David</hi> in his
court, 2 <hi>Sam. 19. 37.</hi> And what comparison is there
betweene that preferment and this, that every child
of God is advanced unto by his death? 3. And
lastly, out of respect unto ourselves, we should mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
our griefe for the departure of our Christian
friends; because we have not quite lost them, but we
shalbe sure to enjoy them againe, with much more
content and comfort in their society than ever we
did here. By this consideration <hi>David</hi> moderated
his sorrow for the death of his child, 2 <hi>Sam. 12. 23. I
shall go to him, but he shall not returne unto me.</hi> For,
though we shall not know one another, nor enjoy
the society and company one of another in the life
to come in that naturall and carnall manner as we
did in this life; yet shall we certainly rejoyce much
more one in another, than ever we did in this world.
And this comfort that the faithfull shall have in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:4296:97"/>
heaven in their mutuall society, is oft mentioned in
the holy Scripture as one part and degree of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
happinesse that they shall enjoy there.
<hi>They shall sit downe with Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob</hi>
(saith our Saviour, <hi>Matthew 8. 11.) in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

your hearts in this truth, that the man that lives a
godly and fruitfull life, may be sure to die happily
and comfortably; and none but he. And thus much
also shall serve to have been spoken at this time.
Let us now praise God for his mercy, and
commend this that we have heard

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Hope the world will not blame
me, for increasing the crowd of
Englishwriters, with which, it is
so much troubled: nor censure me
of folly for thrusting this little
Booke into the throng, where it
is like to be smoothered, if I may
be admitted to put in this plea. To the first, that
<pb facs="tcp:4296:101"/>
as a dutifull sonne, in honour of my deare fathers
Name and memory, I strive for some place for this
Monument, which may be some meanes to perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
the same in Gods Church: as a faithfull Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor,
I am carefull to discharge this part of his
(though but nuncupative) will, to endeavour the
publishing of this, and some other of his Workes,
which himselfe intended and had prepared for the
presse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To the latter, I plead, that though it be
in it selfe but small, yet will it finde in the throng, a
booke to which it is neerely allyed, a childe of the
same Authors braine and heart (the Lectures on
Saint <hi>Iohn 4.</hi>) which having found free and speedy
passage, will make way for this, and easily procure
it welcome and entertainment, where it selfe hath
found the like; and I presume elsewhere also: for
somuch as the company of this may be procured at
a farre easier charge then the former, and as it
hath one already to lead the way, so (God willing)
ere long (I hope) it shall be seconded by another of
later b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>th, but greater growth. It no way becometh
me to commend this, or any other worke of his (let
me rather strive to imitate him my selfe, then to
commend him, or any thing of his to others) his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
name will commend them. And least under that
name, the reader should suspect he may bee abused:
<pb facs="tcp:4296:101"/>
I heere solemnly promise, that what is or shall be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by
me published under his name, shall not be loose notes
(that have beene taken by some ignorant Scribe)
nor shall it be made up with additions, and alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

                  <p>And as for publishing these Sermons, I have
good reason, so for dedicating them, to your selfe.
The occasion of them was that heavy Visitation,
which was then upon your City; the drift of one
part of them, was to moove his auditors, to commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serate
the (then) wofull estate of it, to you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as a Citizen (of no meane note) have I directed
them, but principally to you as my Patrone I have
not, nor expect anything of mine owne worthy pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique
view: this I owne not as Authour, but as
Heire to the Authour: and it being in mine hands,
I thought it my duty (being the first booke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I had to
dispose of) to present it first into those hands,
which freely bestowed the Presentation to this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage
upon me. I have beene for above these foure
yeeres, covetous of some faire opportunity to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to the world, my thankfull acknowledgement
of your favour to me; and to give publique testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of your worthy and exemplary integrity, in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
the trust reposed in you (to dispose of this
<pb facs="tcp:4296:102"/>
Benefice) without respect to your owne gaine, or
pleasuring of your friends, neglecting bribes of
breath or money. You intended not to enrich your
selfe by this part of the Churches Patrimony, nor to
make up other losses by gaining by this. It was
your care not onely to shunne the grievous sinne of
Simony and corruption, but to avoide all suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it, you passed by the neere relation of kindred,
the importunate solicitation of freinds, the mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of great Personages, and were pleased in your
choice to crave the direction of your pious, learned
and most industrious Pastour, the great blessing and
ornament of your City and Parish: his love (which
I may never forget, though I shall not in
any degree requite) induced him to nominate mee,
your confidence in his judgement and uprightnesse,
made you upon his commendation to make choice of
mee a meere straunger, for your Clarke. Never
had any Parson or Parish more cause thankfully
to acknowledge the religious care, and pious inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
of a Patrone, then wee heere have:
or take any occasion to lay this your good worke
open to wide report, and to propound you as
a patterne, to them that are entrusted with
such charges. I doe and shall praise GOD,
as long as I live, for raising you (beyond
<pb facs="tcp:4296:102"/>
my thoughts and expectations) an instrument of
so great good to mee: by your meanes hee hath
freed mee from those snares, wherein many of our
coate are (in these corrupt times) intangled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I doe
not eate the bread of (either direct or indirect)
Simony, but that which by GODS providence,
your uncorrupt hand hath reached out to mee, a
morsell of which will give mee more content,
then abundance of the former sort. I doubt not,
but GOD will aboundantly requite your kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to his house, that hee will blesse you in your
Merchandise, and exchanges, who have beene so
carefull not to make Merchandise of the Soules of
men, or to make sale of the Patrimony of the
Church, and portion of GODS Ministers;
that hee will continue and increase your comfort
in your hopefull children, who have beene so faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

that hee will blesse you in your Soule with
Spirituall and Heavenly graces and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,

so carefull to provide for this place. For
all which (as I hope) soe I shall continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
