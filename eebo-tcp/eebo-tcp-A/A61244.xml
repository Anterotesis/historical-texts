         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough the difference between Men and other
living Creatures be very great, yet happly he that
should say that he could shew little less between
Man and Man would not speak more than he
might prove. What proportion doth one bear to
a thousand? and yet it is a common Proverb, <hi>One Man is
worth a thousand, when as a thousand are not worth one.</hi> This difference
hath dependence upon the different abilities of their Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals;
which I reduce to the being, or not being a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher;
in regard that Philosophy as being the proper food of
such as live by it, distinguisheth a Man from the common Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the Vulgar in a more or less honourable degree accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the variety of that diet. In this sence he that hath the
highest looks, is of highest quality; and the turning over of
the great Volume of Nature, which is the proper Object of
Philosophy is the way to make one look high: in which Book,
although whatsoever we read, as being the Work of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, is therefore most proportionate; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that is more absolute and noble wherein we more
plainly deserne his art and skill. The <hi>Constitution</hi> of the <hi>Vnivers,</hi>
among all Physical points that fall within Humane Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
may, in my opinion, be preferred to the Precedency:
for if that in regard of universal extent it excell all others, it
ought as the Rule and Standard of the rest to goe before
them in Nobility. Now if ever any persons might challenge
to be signally distinguished for Intellectuals from other men,
<pb facs="tcp:96976:4"/>
               <hi>Ptolomey</hi> and <hi>Copernicus</hi> were they that have had the honour to
see farthest into, and discourse most profoundly of the <hi>Worlds
Systeme.</hi> About the Works of which famous Men these Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
being chiefly conversant, I conceived it my duty to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
them only to <hi>Your Highness.</hi> For laying all the weight
upon these two, whom I hold to be the Ablest Wits that
have left us their Works upon these Subjects; to avoid a Sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisme
in Manners, I was obliged to address them to Him, who
with me, is the Greatest of all Men, from whom they can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
either Glory or Patrociny. And if these two persons
have so farre illuminated my Understanding as that this my
Book may in a great part be confessed to belong to them, well
may it also be acknowledged to belong to <hi>Your Highness,</hi> unto
whose Bounteous Magnificence I owe the time and leasure I
had to write it, as also unto Your Powerful Assistance, (never
weary of honouring me) the means that at length I have had
to publish it. May <hi>Your Highness</hi> therefore be pleased to accept
of it according to Your accustomed Goodness; and if any
thing shall be found therein, that may be subservient towards
the information or satisfaction of those that are Lovers of
Truth; let them acknowledge it to be due to <hi>Your Self,</hi> who are
so expert in doing good, that Your Happy Dominion cannot

                        <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Athematical Learning</hi> (to speak nothing touching the necessity &amp; delight thereof; hath bin so sparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imparted to our Countrymen in their native English, especially the nobler and sublimer part,
that in Compliance with the <hi>Solicitations</hi> of several of my noble and learned Friends, and the <hi>Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi>
of such as are Mathematically disposed, more especially those, who either want Time or
Patience to look into the vulgar and unstudied Languages, I did adventure upon this Work of Collecting &amp; Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
from amongst the excellent Pieces that are so abounding in the Italian and French Tongues, some of those
that my own observation and the intimation of Friends were most usefull and desired, and with all most wanting
in their Own.</p>
                  <p>I was, indeed, at first seriously Conscious, and am now, by experience, fully convinced how disproportionate the
weight of the Enterprize is to the weakness of the Vndertaker, but yet the Passion I ever had to be subservient to
my Friends and Compatriots in their Inquisition after these Sublime Studies, and a Patience which I owe to the
Flegme that is predominant in my Constitution, joyned with a nine-years conversence in these Languages, as also an
unhappy and long Vacation that the persecutions of the late Tyrants gave me from more advantagious employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
so prevailed with me, that I resolved to improve even my very Confinement to <hi>serve</hi> those Friends, whom, as
the Times then stood, I could not <hi>see.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Book being for Subject and Design intended chiefly for Gentlemen, I have bin as careless of using a studied
Pedantry in my Style; as careful in contriving a pleasant and beautiful Impression. And when I had considered
the hazard, and computed the charge of the undertaking, I found it to exceed the ability of a private Purse, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of mine, that had bin so lately emptied by the hand of violent enemies, and perfidious friends; not to
make mention here of the Sums that a Loyal Reflexion upon my Princes Affairs had at the same time drawn
from me; and judg'd that the most safe, easy, and reasonable way was to invite those Persons who had appeared
desirous of the Book, to be contributary to their own Contentment, by subscribing towards the charge of this Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blication.</p>
                  <p>And for the better management of the Work, I joyned to my self a Printer, whose Genius having rendered
him Mathematical, and my overtures of profit having interessed his diligence, I was induced to promise my self a
more than common Assistance from him: and at his door I with reason lay all miscarriages that concerns his
Profession in the Business.</p>
                  <p>In this Work I found more than ordinary Encouragement from that publick spirited Person the Reverend and
Learned Dr. <hi>Thomas Barlow,</hi> Provost of Queens Colledge <hi>Oxford,</hi> and <hi>Margaret</hi> Professor in that Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
as also from those two able Mathematicians and my Reall Friends Major <hi>Miles Symner,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Robert
Wood</hi> of Trinity Colledge <hi>Dublin,</hi> and some few others whose Modesty hath expresly enjoin'd me a concealment
of their Names.</p>
                  <p>Well, at length I have got to the end of my first Stage; and if I have not rid Post, let my excuse be that my long
stay for my Warrant caused me to set out late; and being ill mounted, and in a road full of rubbs, I could not with
any safety go faster; but hope to get it up in the next Stage, for in that I intend to shift my Horses.</p>
                  <p>The names of those Authors and Treatices which I judged would most grace our Language, and gratify Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
are particularly exprest in the General Title of the two Tomes. Distinct Tomes they are as consisting of
several Pieces: Collections I call them, because they have bin so published, disperst, and worn out of Print, that
they very rarely meet in one hand: and Translations I own them to be, as not pretending to any thing more than
the disposure and conversion of them: those Tracts only excepted which compose the second Part of the second
Tome.</p>
                  <p>The first Book which offers it self to your view in this Tome is that singular and unimitable Piece of Reason
and Demonstration the Systeme of <hi>Galileo.</hi> The subject of it is a new and Noble p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rt of Astronomy, to wit the
Doctrine and Hypothesis of the Mobility of the Earth and the Stability of the Sun; the History whereof I shall
hereafter give you at large in the Life of that famous Man. Only this by the by; that the Reader may not wonder
why these Dialogues found so various entertainment in Italy (for he cannot but have heard that though they have
been with all veneration valued, read &amp; applauded by the Iudicious, yet they were with much detestation persecuted,
suppressed &amp; exploded by the Superstitious) I am to tell him that our Author having assigned his intimate Friends
<hi>Salviati</hi> and <hi>Sagredo</hi> the more successfull Parts of the Challenger, and Moderater, he made the famous Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator
<hi>Simplicius</hi> to personate the Peripatetick. The Book coming out, and Pope <hi>Urban</hi> the <hi>VIII.</hi> taking his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to be concern'd as having in his private Capacity bin very positive in declaiming against the Samian Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,
and now (as he supposed) being ill delt with by <hi>Galileo</hi> who had summed up all his Arguments, and put
them into the mouth of <hi>Simplicius;</hi> his Holiness thereupon conceived an implacable Displeasure against our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
and thinking no other revenge sufficient, he employed his Apostolical Authority, and deals with the Consistory
to condemn him and proscribe his Book as Heretical; prostituting the Censure of the Church to his private revenge.
This was <hi>Galileo</hi>'s fortune in <hi>Italy:</hi> but had I not reason to hope that the English will be more hospitable, on the
account of that Principle which induceth them to be civil to (I say not to dote on) Strangers, I should fear to be
charged with imprudence for appearing an Interpreter to that great Philosopher. And in this confidence I shall
forbear to make any large Exordium concerning him or his Book: &amp; the rather in regard that such kind of Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deries
become not the Gravity of the Subject; as also knowing how much (coming from me) they must fall short of
the Merits of it, or him: but principally because I court only persons of Judgement &amp; Candor, that can distinguish
between a Native Beauty, and spurious Vernish. This only let me premise, though more to excuse my weakness in
the menaging, than to insinuate my ability in accomplishing this so arduous a Task, that these profound Dialogues
have bin found so uneasy to Translate, that neither affectation of Novelty could induce the French, nor the
Translating humour perswade the Germans to undertake them. This difficulty, as I conceived, was charged either
upon the Intricacy of this manner of Writing, or upon the singular Elegance in the stile of <hi>Galileo,</hi> or else upon the
<pb facs="tcp:96976:8"/>
miscarriage of the unfortunate <hi>Mathias Berneggeius</hi> who first attempted to turn them into Latine for the benefit
of the Learned World.</p>
                  <p>I shall not presume to Censure the Censure which the Church of Rome past upon this Doctrine and its Assertors.
But, on the contrary, my Author having bin indefinite in his discourse, I shall forbear to exasperate, and attempt
to reconcile such persons to this Hypothesis as devout esteem for Holy Scripture, and dutifull Respect to Canonical
Injunctions hath made to stand off from this Opinion: and therefore for their sakes I have at the end of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues
by way of supplement added an Epistle of <hi>Galileo</hi> to Her Most Serene Highness <hi>Christina Lotharinga</hi> the
Grand Dutchesse Mother of <hi>Tuscany;</hi> as also certain Abstracts of <hi>John Kepler,</hi> Mathematician to two Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
and <hi>Didacus à Stunica</hi> a famous Divine of Salamanca, with an Epistle of <hi>Paulo Antonio Foscarini</hi> a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Carmelite of Naples, that shew the Authority of Sacred Scripture in determining of Philosophical and Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Controversies: hoping that the ingenious &amp; impartial Reader will meet with full satisfaction in the same.
And least what I have spoken of the prohibiting of these Pieces by the Inquisition may deterre any scrupulous
person from reading of them, I have purposely inserted the Imprimatur by which that Office licenced them. And
for a larger account of the Book or Author, I refer you to the Relation of his Life, which shall bring up the Reare
in the Second Tome.</p>
                  <p>What remains of this, is that Excellent Discourse of D. <hi>Benedetto Castelli Abbate di San Benedetto Aloysio,</hi>
concerning the Mensuration of Running Waters, with other Treatises of that Learned Prelate, &amp; of the Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent
<hi>Corsini.</hi> Some may alledge, and I doe confess that I promised to publish the Life of <hi>Galileo</hi> in this place:
But the great miscarriages of Letters from some Friends in Italy and else where, to whom I am a Debtor for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Remarques, &amp; from whom I daily expect yet greater Helps concerning the History of that famous Personage:
these disappointments, I say, joyned with the undeniable Request of some Friends, who were impatient to see <hi>Castelli</hi>
in English, together with a consideration of the disproportionate Bulk that would otherwise have bin betwixt the
two Volumes, perswaded me to this exchange. This deviation from my Promise I hope is Venial, and for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piating
of it I plead Supererrogation: having in each Tome made so large Aditions (though to my great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense)
that they make neer a third part more than I stood by promise bound to Publish. That this is so will appear by
comparing the Contents I here prefix with the Advertisment I formerly Printed. For not to mention those Epitomes
of <hi>Kepler</hi> and <hi>à Stunica,</hi> the whole second and following Books of <hi>Castelli,</hi> were not come to my hands at the time of
my penning that Paper; yet knowing how imperfect the Volume would be without them, they being partly a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
to the Theoremes and Problemes which the Abbot had formerly Printed, and partly experiments that
had procured him and his Doctrine a very great Reputation, knowing this I say, I apprehended a necessity of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
them with the rest: and hope that if you think not the service I have done therein worth your acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
you will yet at least account the encrease of my expence a sufficient extenuation of the Trespass that those
Additions have forced me to commit upon your Patience in point of Time.</p>
                  <p>As for the second Tome, I have only this to assure the Generous Readers; 1 that I am very confident I shall
be much more punctual in publishing that, than (for the reasons above related.) I was able to be in setting forth
this: 2 that they shall not be abused in advancing of their moneys, (as hath bin used in the like case) by selling
the remaining Copyes at an under rate; and 3 that I have a very great care that no disesteem may by my means a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
unto this way of publishing Books, for that it is of excellent use in ushering Great and Costly Volumes into
the World.</p>
                  <p>To say nothing of the disadvantages of Translations in general, this of mine doubtless is not without it's Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
and oversights: but those of the Printer discounted, I hope the rest may be allowed me upon the score of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Imbecilitie.</hi> The truth is, I have assumed the Liberty to note the Mistakes in the Florid Version of <hi>Bernegge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
in the Margent, not so much to reproach him, as to convince those who told me that they accounted my pains
needless, having his Latine Translation by them. The like they said of the whole two Tomes: but they thereby caused
me to question their Understanding or Veracity. For some of the Books were yet never extant: As for instance;
the Mechanicks of Monsieur <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> a Manuscript which I found amongst the many other Rarities that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
the well-chosen Library of my Learned and Worthy Friend Dr. <hi>Charles Scarburgh;</hi> the Experiments of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
and the Life of <hi>Galileo,</hi> both my own: Others were included in Volumes of great price, or so dispersed that
they were not to be purchased for any money; as those of <hi>Kepler, à Stunica, Archimedes, Tartaglia,</hi> and the Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks
of <hi>Galileo:</hi> And the remainder, though easyer to procure, were harder to be understood; as <hi>Tartaglia</hi> his notes
on <hi>Archimedes, Torricellio</hi> his Doctrine of Projects, <hi>Galileo</hi> his Epistle to the Dutchesse of <hi>Tuscany,</hi> and above all
his Dialogues <hi>de Motu;</hi> (never till now done into any Language) which were so intermixt of Latine and Italian,
that the difficulty of the Stile, joyned with the intricatnesse of the Subject rendered them Unpleasant, if not wholly
Vnintelligible, to such as were not absolute Masters of both the Tongues.</p>
                  <p>To conclude; according to the entertainment that you please to afford these Collections, I shall be encouraged to
proceed with the Publication of a large Body of Hydrography; declaring the History, Art, Lawes, and Apendages
of that Princely Study of Navigation, wherein I have omitted nothing of note that can be found either in <hi>Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
Fournier, Aurigarius, Nonius, Snellus, Marsennus, Baysius, Morisetus, Blondus, Wagoner,</hi> abroad, or learnt

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here was published some years since in <hi>Rome</hi> a salutiferous Edict, that, for
the obviating of the dangerous Scandals of the present Age, imposed a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Silence upon the Pythagorean Opinion of the Mobility of the Earth.
There want not such as unadvisedly affirm, that that Decree was not the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of a sober Scrutiny, but of an illinformed Passion; &amp; one may hear some mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that Consultors altogether ignorant of Astronomical Observations ought not
to clipp the Wings of Speculative Wits with rash Prohibitions. My zeale can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
keep silence when I hear these inconsiderate complaints. I thought fit, as being thoroughly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with that prudent Determination, to appear openly upon the Theatre of the World as a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the naked Truth. I was at that time in <hi>Rome;</hi> and had not only the audiences, but applauds of
the most Eminent Prelates of that Court; nor was that Decree Published without Previous Notice given
me thereof. Therefore it is my resolution in the present case to give Foraign Nations to see, that this
point is as well understood in <hi>Italy,</hi> and particularly in <hi>Rome,</hi> as Transalpine Diligence can imagine
it to be: and collecting together all the proper Speculations that concern the <hi>Copernican Systeme,</hi>
to let them know, that the notice of all preceded the Censure of the <hi>Roman Court;</hi> and that there
proceed from this Climate not only Doctrines for the health of the Soul, but also ingenious Discoveries
for the recreating of the Mind.</p>
                  <p>To this end I have personated the <hi>Copernican</hi> in this Discourse; proceeding upon an Hypothesis
purely Mathematical; striving by all artificial wayes to represent it Superiour, not to that of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mobility
of the Earth absolutely, but according as it is mentioned by some, that retein no more, but the
name of <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> and are content, without going farther, to adore Shadows, not philosophizing
with requisit caution, but with the sole remembrance of four <hi>Principles,</hi> but badly understood.</p>
                  <p>We shall treat of three principall heads. First I will endeavour to shew that all Experiments that can
be made upon the Earth are insufficient means to conclude it's Mobility, but are indifferently applicable
to the Earth moveable or immoveable: and I hope that on this occasion we shall discover many obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
passages unknown to the Ancients. Secondly we will examine the Coelestiall <hi>Phoenomena</hi>
that make for the <hi>Copernican Hypothesis,</hi> as if it were to prove absolutely victorious; adding by the
way certain new Observations, which yet serve only for the Astronomical Facility, not for Natural
Necessity. In the third place I will propose an ingenuous Fancy. I remember that I have said many
years since, that the unknown Probleme of the Tide might receive some light, admitting the Earths
Motion. This Position of mine passing from one to another had found charitable Fathers that
adopted it for the Issue of their own wit. Now, because no stranger may ever appear that defending him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with our armes, shall charge us with want of caution in so principal an Accident, I have thought
good to lay down those probabilities that would render it credible, admitting that the Earth did
move. I hope, that by these Considerations the World will come to know, that if other Nations have
Navigated more than we, we have not studied less than they; &amp; that our returning to assert the Earths
Stability, and to take the contrary only for a Mathematical <hi>Capriccio,</hi> proceeds not from inadvertency
of what others have thought thereof, but (had we no other inducements) from those Reasons that Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Religion, the Knowledge of the Divine Omnipotency, and a consciousness of the incapacity of mans
Vnderstanding dictate unto us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:96976:9"/>
With all I conceived it very proper to express these conceits by way of Dialogue, which, as not being
bound up to the riggid observance of Mathematical Laws, gives place also to Digressions that are
sometimes no less curious than the principal Argument.</p>
                  <p>I chanced to be several years since, at several times, in the Stupendious Citty of <hi>Venice,</hi> where I
conversed with <hi>Signore Giovan Francesco Sagredo</hi> of a Noble Extraction, and piercing wit. There
came thither from <hi>Florence</hi> at the same time <hi>Signore Filippo Salviati,</hi> whose least glory was the Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
of his Blood, and Magnificence of his Estate: a sublime Wit that fed not more hungerly upon
any pleasure than on elevated Speculations. In the company of these two I often discoursed of these
matters before a certain Peripatetick Philosopher who seemed to have no geater obstacle in understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Truth, than the Fame he had acquired by Aristotelical Interpretations.</p>
                  <p>Now, seeing that inexorable Death hath deprived <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Florence</hi> of those two great Lights in
the very Meridian of their years, I did resolve, as far as my poor ability would permit, to perpetuate
their lives to their honour in these leaves, bringing them in as Interlocutors in the present Controversy.
Nor shall the Honest Peripatetick want his place, to whom for his excessive affection towards the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
of <hi>Simplicius,</hi> I thought fit, without mentioning his own Name, to leave that of the Author
he so much respected. Let those two great Souls, ever venerable to my heart, please to accept this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
Monument of my never-dying Love; and let the remembrance of their Eloquence assist me in
delivering to Posterity the Considerations that I have promised.</p>
                  <p>There casually happened (as was usuall) several discourses at times between these Gentlemen, the
which had rather inflamed than satisfied in their wits the thirst they had to be learning; whereupon
they took a discreet resolution to meet together for certain dayes, in which all other business set aside,
they might betake themselves more methodically to contemplate the Wonders of God in Heaven, and in
the Earth: the place appointed for their meeting being in the Palace of the Noble <hi>Sagredo,</hi> after the
due, but very short complements; <hi>Signore Salviati</hi> began in this manner.</p>

that we should to day discourse
the most distinctly, and particularly we
could possible, of the natural reasons, and
their efficacy that have been hitherto al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
on the one or other part, by the
maintainers of the Positions, <hi>Aristotelian,</hi>
and <hi>Ptolomaique;</hi>

of the <hi>Copernican Systeme:</hi> And because
<hi>Copernicus</hi> placing the Earth among the moveable Bodies of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
comes to constitute a Globe for the fame like to a Planet; it
would be good that we began our disputation with the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of what, and how great the energy of the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
is, when they demonstrate, that this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96976:11"/>
Since that it is necessary to introduce in Nature,<note place="margin">Coelestial substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are in alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary that be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, art necessary in the opinion of <hi>Aristotle.</hi>
                           </note> substances
different betwixt themselves, that is, the Coelestial, and Elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
that impassible and immortal, this alterable and corruptible.
Which argument <hi>Aristotle</hi> handleth in his book <hi>De Coelo,</hi> insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
it first, by some discourses dependent on certain general as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions,
and afterwards confirming it with experiments and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
demonstrations: following the same method, I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound,
and freely speak my judgement, submitting my self to
your censure, and particularly to <hi>Simplicius,</hi> a Stout Champion
and contender for the <hi>Aristotelian</hi> Doctrine.</p>
                        <p>And the first Step of the <hi>Peripatetick</hi> arguments is that,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Aristotle</hi> maketh the World perfect, because it hath the threefold demensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> where <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi>
proveth the integrity and perfection of the World, telling
us, that it is not a simple line, nor a bare superficies, but a body
adorned with Longitude, Latitude, and Profundity; and because
there are no more dimensions but these three; The World having
them, hath all, and having all, is to be concluded perfect. And
again, that by simple length, that magnitude is constituted, which
is called a Line, to which adding breadth, there is framed the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies,
and yet further adding the altitude or profoundity, there
results the Body, and after these three dimensions there is no
passing farther, so that in these three the integrity, and to so speak,
totality is terminated, which I might but with justice have requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Aristotle</hi> to have proved to me by necessary consequences, the
rather in regard he was able to do it very plainly, and speedily.</p>

                        <p>What say you to the excellent demonstrations in the
2. 3. and 4. Texts,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Aristotles</hi> demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to prove the dimensions to be three and no more.</note> after the definition of <hi>Continual?</hi> have you it
not first there proved, that there is no more but three dimensions,
for that those three are all things, and that they are every where?
And is not this confirmed by the Doctrine and Authority of the
<hi>Pythagorians,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The number three celebrated amongst the <hi>Pythagorians</hi>
                           </note> who say that all things are determined by three, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
middle, and end, which is the number of All? And where
leave you that reason, namely, that as it were by the law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
this number is used in the sacrifices of the Gods? And why
being so dictated by nature, do we atribute to those things that
are three, and not to lesse, the title of all? why of two is it said
both, and not all, unless they be three? And all this Doctrine you
have in the second Text. Afterwards in the third, <hi>Ad pleniorem
scientiam,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Omne, Totum &amp; Perfectum.</note> we read that <hi>All,</hi> the <hi>Whole,</hi> and <hi>Perfect,</hi> are formally
one and the same; and that therefore onely the <hi>Body,</hi> amongst
magnitudes is perfect: because it is determined by three, which is
All, and being divisible three manner of waies, it is every way di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible;
but of the others, some are dividible in one manner, and
some in two, because according to the number affixed, they have
their division and continuity, and thus one magnitude is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
one way,<note place="margin">Or Solid.</note> another two, a third, namely the Body, every way.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96976:11"/>
Moreover in the fourth Text; doth he not after some other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
prove it by another demonstration? <hi>Scilicet,</hi> That no tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
is made but according to some defect (and so there is a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
or passing from the line to the superficies, because the line is
defective in breadth) and that it is impossible for the perfect to
want any thing, it being every way so; therefore there is no tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
from the Solid or Body to any other magnitude. Now
think you not that by all these places he hath sufficiently proved,
how that there's no going beyond the three dimensions, Length,
Breadth, and Thickness, and that therefore the body or solid,
which hath them all, is perfect?</p>

                        <p>To tell you true, I think not my self bound by all these
reasons to grant any more but onely this, That that which hath
beginning, middle, and end, may, and ought to be called perfect: But
that then, because beginning, middle, and end, are Three, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Three is a perfect number, and hath a faculty of conferring
<hi>Perfection</hi> on those things that have the same, I find no inducement
to grant; neither do I understand, nor believe that, for example,
of feet, the number three is more perfect then four or two, nor do
I conceive the number four to be any imperfection to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
and that they would be more perfect if they were three.
Better therefore it had been to have left these subtleties to the
<hi>Rhetoricians,</hi> and to have proved his intent, by necessary demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for so it behoves to do in demonstrative sciences.</p>

                        <p>You seem to scorn these reasons, and yet it is all the

                        <p>That the <hi>Pythagorians</hi> had the science of numbers in

spread amongst the vulgar; and this with a discretion and subtlety
resembling that of the prudent young man, that to be freed
from the importunity of his inquisitive Mother or Wife, I know

contrived that story, which afterwards brought her and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

unobserved; and for the more easie understanding thereof,
we will take this Pen and Ink, which I see already prepared for
such occasions,<note place="margin">A Geometrical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of the triple dimension.</note> and describe a few figures. And first we will note
[Fig. 1. <hi>at the end of this Dialog.]</hi> these two points AB, and draw
from the one to the other the curved lines, ACB, and ADB, and the
right line AB, I demand of you which of them, in your mind, is
that which determines the distance between the terms AB, &amp; why?</p>

                        <speaker>SAGR.</speaker>
                        <p>I should say the right line, and not the crooked, as well
because the right is shorter, as because it is one, sole, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate,
whereas the others are infinit, unequal, and longer; and my
determination is grounded upon that, That it is one, and certain.</p>

                        <p>We have then the right line to determine the length be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the two terms; let us add another right line and parallel to
AB, which let be CD, <hi>[Fig. 2.]</hi> so that there is put between them a
superficies, of which I desire you to assign me the breadth, therefore
departing from the point A, tell me how, and which way you will
go, to end in the line CD, and so to point me out the breadth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
between those lines; let me know whether you will
terminate it according to the quantity of the curved line AE, or
the right line AF, or any other.</p>

                        <p>According to the right AF, and not according to the

                        <p>But I would take neither of them, seeing the right line
AF runs obliquely; But would draw a line, perpendicular to C
D, for this should seem to me the shortest, and the properest of
infinite that are greater, and unequal to one another, which may be

produced from the term A to any other part of the opposite line
CD.</p>

                        <p>Your choice, and the reason you bring for it in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is most excellent; so that by this time we have proved that
the first dimension is determined by a right line, the second name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the breadth with another line right also, and not onely right,
but withall, at right-angles to the other that determineth the
length, and thus we have the two dimensions of length and
breadth, definite and certain. But were you to bound or termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
a height, as for example, how high this Roof is from the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that we tread on, being that from any point in the Roof,
we may draw infinite lines, both curved, and right, and all of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
lengths to infinite points of the pavement, which of all these
lines would you make use of?</p>

                        <speaker>SAGR.</speaker>
                        <p>I would fasten a line to the Seeling, and with a plummet
that should hang at it, would let it freely distend it self till it
should reach well near to the pavement, and the length of such a
thread being the streightest and shortest of all the lines, that could
possibly be drawn from the same point to the pavement, I would
say was the true height of this Room.</p>

                        <p>Very well, And when from the point noted in the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by this pendent thread (taking the pavement to be levell
and not declining) you should produce two other right lines, one
for the length, and the other for the breadth of the superficies of
the said pavement, what angles should they make with the said
thread?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SAGR.</speaker>
                        <p>They would doubtless meet at right angles, the said
lines falling perpendicular, and the pavement being very plain and
levell.</p>
                     </sp>

                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>Therefore if you assign any point, for the term from whence
to begin your measure; and from thence do draw a right line, as
the terminator of the first measure, namely of the length, it will
follow of necessity, that that which is to design out the largeness
or breadth, toucheth the first at right-angles, and that that which is
to denote the altitude, which is the third dimension, going from the
same point formeth also with the other two, not oblique but right
angles, and thus by the three perpendiculars, as by three lines, one,
certain, and as short as is possible, you have the three dimensions
AB length, AC breadth, and AD height; and because, clear it
is, that there cannot concurre any more lines in the said point, so
as to make therewith right-angles, and the dimensions ought to
be determined by the sole right lines, which make between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
right-angles; therefore the dimensions are no more but
three, and that which hath three hath all, and that which hath all,
is divisible on all sides, and that which is so, is perfect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

of the whole,<note place="margin">Parts of the world are two, according to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial and Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary contrary to one another.</note> let us descend to the consideration of its parts,
which <hi>Aristotle,</hi> in his first division, makes two, and they very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
and almost contrary to one another; namely the Coelestial,
and Elementary: that ingenerable, incorruptible, unalterable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passible,
&amp;c. and this exposed to a continual alteration, mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
&amp;c. Which difference, as from its original principle, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives
from the diversity of local motions, and in this method he
proceeds.</p>
                        <p>Leaving the sensible, if I may so speak, and retiring into the
Ideal world, he begins Architectonically to consider that nature
being the principle of motion,<note place="margin">Local motion of three kinds, right, circular, &amp; mixt.</note> it followeth that natural bodies be
indued with local motion. Next he declares local motion to be
of three kinds, namely, circular, right, and mixt of right and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular:
and the two first he calleth simple,<note place="margin">Circular, and streight motions are simple, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding by simple lines.</note> for that of all lines the
circular, and right are onely simple; and here somewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining
himself, he defineth anew, of simple motions, one to be
circular, namely that which is made about the <hi>medium,</hi> and the
other namely the right, upwards, and downwards; upwards, that
which moveth from the <hi>medium;</hi> downwards, that which goeth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>medium.</hi> And from hence he infers, as he may by and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
consequence,<note place="margin">Ad medium, à <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96976:13"/>
is its motion. Having confirmed these motions, he proceeds saying,
that of natural bodies some being simple, and some composed of
them (and he calleth simple bodies those, that have a principle
of motion from nature, as the Fire and Earth) it follows that
simple motions belong to simple bodies, and mixt to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound;
yet in such sort, that the compounded incline to the part
predominant in the composition.</p>

                        <p>You and <hi>Aristotle</hi> together would at first take me a
little out of the sensible World,<note place="margin">The definition of Nature, either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, or unseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, produced by <hi>Aristotle.</hi>
                           </note> to tell me of the <hi>Architecture,</hi>
wherewith it ought to be fabricated; and very appositly begin to
tell me, that a natural body is by nature moveable, nature being
(as elsewhere it is defined) the principle of motion. But here I
am somewhat doubtfull why <hi>Aristotle</hi> said not that of natural bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
some are moveable by nature, and others immoveable, for
that in the definition, nature is said to be the principle of Motion,
and Rest; for if natural bodies have all a principle of motion,
either he might have omitted the mention of Rest, in the definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of nature: or not have introduced such a definition in this place.
Next, as to the declaration of what <hi>Aristotle</hi> intends by simple
motions, and how by Spaces he determines them, calling those sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that are made by simple lines, which are onely the right, and
circular,<note place="margin">The Helix about the Cylinder may be said to be a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple line.</note> I entertain it willingly; nor do I desire to tenter the
instance of the Helix, about the Cylinder; which in that it is in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
part like to it self, might seemingly be numbred among sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
lines. But herein I cannot concurre, that he should so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
simple motions (whilst he seems to go about to repeat the
same definition in other words) as to call one of them the motion
about the <hi>medium,</hi> the others <hi>Sursum &amp; Deorsum,</hi> namely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and downward; which terms are not to be used, out of the
World fabricated, but imply it not onely made, but already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
by us; for if the right motion be simple, by the simplicity
of the right line, and if the simple motion be natural, it is made on
every side, to wit, upwards, downwards, backwards, forwards, to
the right, to the left, and if any other way can be imagined, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
it be straight, it shall agree to any simple natural body; or
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96976:14"/>
if not so, then the supposion of <hi>Aristotle</hi> is defective.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Aristotle</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modates the rules of <hi>Architecture</hi> to the frame of the World, and not the frame to the rules.</note> It appears
moreover that <hi>Aristotle</hi> hinteth but one circular motion alone to
be in the World, and consequently but one onely Center, to
which alone the motions of upwards and downwards, refer. All
which are apparent proofs, that <hi>Aristotles</hi> aim is, to make white
black, and to accommodate <hi>Architecture</hi> to the building, and not
to modle the building according to the precepts of <hi>Arthitecture:</hi>
for if I should say that Nature in Universal may have a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Circular Motions, and by consequence a thousand Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
there would be also a thousand motions upwards, and
downwards. Again he makes as hath been said, a simple motion,
and a mixt motion, calling simple, the circular and right; and
mixt, the compound of them two: of natural bodies he calls some
simple (namely those that have a natural principle to simple mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
and others compound: and simple motions he attributes
to simple bodies, and the compounded to the compound; but by
compound motion he doth no longer understand the mixt of right
and circular, which may be in the World; but introduceth a mixt
motion as impossible, as it is impossible to mixe opposite motions
made in the same right line, so as to produce from them a motion
partly upwards, partly downwards; and, to moderate such an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity,
<note place="margin">Right motion some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times simple, and sometimes mixt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Arist.</hi>
                           </note> and impossibility, he asserts that such mixt bodies move
according to the simple part predominant: which necessitates
others to say, that even the motion made by the same right line is
sometimes simple, and sometimes also compound: so that the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of the motion, is no longer dependent onely on the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of the line.</p>

                        <p>How? Is it not difference sufficient, that the simple and

                        <p>Well, <hi>Simplicius;</hi> But put case the simplicity for this
cause was changed, besides that there would be a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
mixt motions, you would not be able to determine the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
nay farther, if the greater or lesse velocity be able to alter
the simplicity of the motion, no simple body should move with a
simple motion; since that in all natural right motions, the veloci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is ever encreasing, and by consequence still changing the simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
which as it is simplicity, ought of consequence to be immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and that which more importeth, you charge <hi>Aristotle</hi> with
another thing, that in the definition of motions compounded, he
hath not made mention of tardity nor velocity, which you now
insert for a necessary and essential point. Again you can draw
no advantage from this rule, for that there will be amongst the
mixt bodies some, (and that not a few) that will move swiftly,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96976:14"/>
and others more slowly than the simple; as for example, Lead, and
Wood, in comparison of earth; and therefore amongst these mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which call you the simple, and which the mixt?</p>

                        <p>Very well, and yet <hi>Simplicius</hi> a little before you said,
that the simple, and compound motions, discovered which were
mixt, and which were simple bodies; now you will have me by
simple and mixt bodies, come to know which is the simple, and
which is the compound motion: an excellent way to keep us igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
both of motions and bodies. Moreover, you have also a little
above declared, how that a greater velocity did not suffice, but
you seek a third condition for the definement of simple motion, for
which <hi>Aristotle</hi> contented himself with one alone, namely, of the
simplicity of the Space, or <hi>Medium:</hi> But now according to you,
the simple motion, shall be that which is made upon a simple line,
with a certain determinate velocity, by a body simply moveable.
Now be it as you please, and let us return to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the mixt motion to be that compounded of the right, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
but produceth not any body, which naturally moveth with
such a motion.</p>

                        <p>I come again to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who having very well, and
Methodically begun his discourse, but having a greater aim to
rest at, and hit a marke, predesigned in his minde, then that to
which his method lead him, digressing from the purpose, he comes
to assert, as a thing known and manifest, that as to the motions
directly upwards or downwards, they naturally agree to Fire, and
Earth; and that therefore it is necessary, that besides these bodies,
which are neer unto us, there must be in nature another, to which
the circular motion may agree: which shall be so much the more
excellent by how much the circular motion is more perfect, then the
streight, but how much more pefect that is than this, he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
from the greatness of the circular lines perfection above the
right line;<note place="margin">The circular line perfect, according to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and but the right im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and why.</note> calling that perfect, and this imperfect; imperfect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
if infinite it wanteth a termination, and end: and if it be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
there is yet something beyond which it may be prolonged.
This is the basis, ground work, and master-stone of all the Fabrick
of the <hi>Aristotelian</hi> World, upon which they superstruct all their
other properties, of neither heavy nor light, of ingenerable incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible,
exemption from all motions, some onely the local, &amp;c.
And all these passions he affirmeth to be proper to a simple body
that is moved circularly; and the contrary qualities of gravity,
levity, corruptibility, &amp;c. he assigns to bodies naturally moveable
in a streight line, for that if we have already discovered defects in

built thereon. I deny not, that this which <hi>Aristotle</hi> hitherto
hath introduced, with a general discourse dependent upon univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
primary principles, hath been since in process of time, re-inforced
with particular reasons, and experiments; all which it would be
necessary distinctly to consider and weigh; but because what hath
been said hitherto presents to such as consider the same many and
no small difficulties, (and yet it would be necessary, that the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
principles and fundamentals, were certain, firm, and establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that so they might with more confidence be built upon) it
would not be amiss, before we farther multiply doubts, to see if
haply (as I conjecture) betaking our selves to other waies, we may
not light upon a more direct and secure method; and with better
considered principles of Architecture lay our primary fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.
Therefore suspending for the present the method of <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi>
(which we will re-assume again in its proper place, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
examine;<note place="margin">The world is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to be perfectly ordinate.</note>) I say, that in the things hitherto affirmed by
him, I agree with him, and admit that the World is a body enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all dimensions, and therefore most perfect; and I add, that as
such, it is necessarily most ordinate, that is, having parts between
themselves, with exquisite and most perfect order disposed; which
assumption I think is not to be denied, neither by you or any
other.</p>

                        <p>Who can deny it? the first particular (of the worlds
dimensions) is taken from <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself, and its denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                        <p>This principle then established,<note place="margin">Streight motion impossible in the world exactly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate.</note> one may immediately
conclude, that if the entire parts of the World should be by their
nature moveable, it is impossible that their motions should be
right, or other than circular; and the reason is sufficiently easie,
and manifest; for that whatsoever moveth with a right motion,
changeth place; and continuing to move, doth by degrees more
and more remove from the term from whence it departed, and
from all the places thorow which it successively passed; and if
such motion naturally suited with it, then it was not at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
in its proper place; and so the parts of the World were
not disposed with perfect order. But we suppose them to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
ordinate, therefore as such, it is impossible that they should
by nature change place, and consequently move in a right moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<note place="margin">Right motion nature infinite.</note> Again, the right motion being by nature infinite, for that
the right line is infinite and indeterminate, it is impossible that

nor essaies to move whither it is impossible to arrive. And if any
one should yet object, that albeit the right line, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the motion by it is producible <hi>in infinitum,</hi> that is to say, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate;
yet nevertheless Nature, as one may say, arbitrarily
hath assigned them some terms, and given natural instincts to
its natural bodies to move unto the same; I will reply, that this

at liberty doth move;<note place="margin">A moveable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a state of rest, shall not move unless it have an inclination to some particular place.</note> provided withal, that it have an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to some particular place; for should it stand indifferently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
to all, it would remain in its rest, not having greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement
to move one way than another. From the having of
this inclination necessarily proceeds,<note place="margin">The moveable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celerates its moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, going towards the place whither it hath an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that
it in its moving shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
increase its acceleration, and beginning with a most slow
motion, it shall not acquire any degree of velocity, before it
shall have passed thorow all the degrees of less velocity, or grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
tardity: for passing from the state of quiet (which is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
degree of tardity of motion) there is no reason by which
it should enter into such a determinate degree of velocity,<note place="margin">The moveable pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from rest, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thorow all the degrees of tardity.</note> before
it shall have entred into a less, and into yet a less, before it entred
into that: but rather it stands with reason, to pass first by those
degrees nearest to that from which it departed, and from those to
the more remote;<note place="margin">Rest the infinite degree of tardity.</note> but the degree from whence the moveable
began to move, is that of extreme tardity, namely of rest.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96976:16"/>
Now this acceleration of motion is never made,<note place="margin">The moveable doth not accelerate, save only as it approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nearer to us term.</note> but when the
moveable in moving acquireth it; nor is its acquist other than an
approaching to the place desired, to wit, whither its natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
attracts it, and thither it tendeth by the shortest way;
namely, by a right line. We may upon good grounds therefore
say, That Nature, to confer upon a moveable first constituted in
rest a determinate velocity, useth to make it move according to
a certain time and space with a right motion.<note place="margin">Nature, to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of velocity, made it move in a right line.</note> This presupposed,

which he had determined to confer such a certain velocity, which
it ought afterwards to retain perpetually uniform; we may with

motion, and that it afterwards being arrived to that intended de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of velocity,<note place="margin">Vniform velocity convenient to the circular motion.</note> he converted its right, into a circular motion,

how it of necessity ensues, that a moveable departing

                        <p>By what I collect from our discourse, a great part of
your scruple lieth in that it should in a time, and that very short,
pass thorow those infinite degrees of tardity precedent to any ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity,
acquired by the moveable in that time: and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we go any farther, I will seek to remove this difficulty, which
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96976:16"/>
shall be an easie task; for I reply, that the moveable passeth by
the aforesaid degrees,<note place="margin">The moveable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from rest passeth thorow all degrees of velocity without staying in any.</note> but the passage is made without staying in
any of them; so that the passage requiring but one sole instant
of time, and every small time containing infinite instants, we shall
not want enough of them to assign its own to each of the infinite
degrees of tardity; although the time were never so short.</p>

to be an inclining plain exquisitely polished, and hard, upon

                        <p>This I think to be the proper definition of equal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

                        <p>We will add moreover this other:<note place="margin">Velocities are said to be equal, when the spaces passed are proportionate to their time.</note> and call that equal
velocity, when the spaces passed have the same proportion, as the
times wherein they are past, and it is a more universal definition.</p>

                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>It is so: for it comprehendeth the equal spaces past in
equal times, and also the unequal past in times unequal, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate
to those spaces. Take now the same Figure, and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the conceipt that you had of the more hastie motion, tell me
why you think the velocity of the Cadent by CB, is greater
than the velocity of the Descendent by CA?</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SIMPL.</speaker>
                        <p>I think so; because in the same time that the Cadent
shall pass all CB, the Descendent shall pass in CA, a part less
than CB.</p>

                        <p>True; and thus it is proved, that the moveable moves
more swiftly by the perpendicular, than by the inclination. Now
consider, if in this same Figure one may any way evince the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conceipt, and finde that the moveables were equally swift
by both the lines CA and CB.</p>

                        <p>The definition I gave you, was, that moveables may
be called equally swift, when the spaces passed are proportional
to the times in which they passed; therefore to apply the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the present case, it will be requisite, that the time of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent
by CA, to the time of falling by CB, should have the
same proportion that the line CA hath to the line CB; but I
understand not how that can be, for that the motion by CB is
swifter than by CA.</p>

                        <p>And yet you must of necessity know it. Tell me a little,
do not these motions go continually accelerating?</p>

                        <p>They do; but more in the perpendicular than in the
inclination.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>But this acceleration in the perpendicular, is it yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
such in comparison of that of the inclined, that
two equal parts being taken in any place of the said perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and inclining lines, the motion in the parts of the perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
is alwaies more swift, than in the part of the inclination?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SAGR.</speaker>
                        <p>I say not so: but I could take a space in the inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in which the velocity shall be far greater than in the like space
taken in the perpendicular; and this shall be, if the space in the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96976:18"/>
perpendicular should be taken near to the end C, and in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
far from it.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>You see then, that the Proposition which saith, that
the motion by the perpendicular is more swift than by the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
holds not true universally, but onely of the motions,
which begin from the extremity, namely from the point of rest:
without which restriction, the Proposition would be so deficient,
that its very direct contrary might be true; namely, that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the inclining plane is swifter than in the perpendicular:
for it is certain, that in the said inclination, we may take a space
past by the moveable in less time, than the like space past in the
perpendicular. Now because the motion in the inclination is in
some places more, in some less, than in the perpendicular; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in some places of the inclination, the time of motion of the
moveable, shall have a greater proportion to the time of the motion
of the moveable, by some places of the perpendicular, than the
space passed, to the space passed: and in other places, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of the time to the time, shall be less than that of the
space to the space. As for example: two moveables departing
from their quiescence, namely, from the point C, one by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
CB, [in <hi>Fig. 4.]</hi> and the other by the inclination CA,
in the time that, in the perpendicular, the moveable shall have
past all CB, the other shall have past CT lesser. And therefore
the time by CT, to the time by CB (which is equal) shall have
a greater proportion than the line CT to CB, being that the
<hi>same</hi> to the <hi>less,</hi> hath a greater proportion than to the <hi>greater.</hi>
And on the contrary, if in CA, prolonged as much as is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site,
one should take a part equal to CB, but past in a shorter
time; the time in the inclination shall have a less proportion to
the time in the perpendicular, than the space to the space. If
therefore in the inclination and perpendicular, we may suppose
such spaces and velocities, that the proportion between the said
spaces be greater and less than the proportion of the times; we
may easily grant, that there are also spaces, by which the times
of the motions retain the same proportion as the spaces.</p>

                        <p>I am already freed from my greatest doubt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that to be not onely possible, but necessary, which I but
now thought a contradiction: but nevertheless I understand not
as yet, that this whereof we now are speaking, is one of these
possible or necessary cases; so as that it should be true, that the
time of descent by CA, to the time of the fall by CB, hath the
same proportion that the line CA hath to CB; whence it may
without contradiction be affirmed, that the velocity by the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
CA, and by the perpendicular CB, are equal.</p>

                        <p>Content your self for this time, that I have removed
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96976:18"/>
your incredulity; but for the knowledge of this, expect it at
some other time, namely, when you shall see the matters concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
local motion demonstrated by our <hi>Academick;</hi> at which
time you shall find it proved, that in the time that the one movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
falls all the space CB, the other descendeth by CA as far
as the point T, in which falls the perpendicular drawn from the
point B: and to find where the same Cadent by the perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
would be when the other arriveth at the point A, draw from
A the perpendicular unto CA, continuing it, and CB unto the
interfection, and that shall be the point sought. Whereby you
see how it is true, that the motion by CB is swifter than by the
inclination CA (supposing the term C for the beginning of the
motions compared) because the line CB is greater than CT,
and the other from C unto the intersection of the perpendicular
drawn from A, unto the line CA, is greater than CA, and
therefore the motion by it is swifter than by CA. But when we
compare the motion made by all CA, not with all the motion
made in the same time by the perpendicular continued, but with
that made in part of the time, by the sole part CB, it hinders
not, that the motion by CA, continuing to descend beyond, may
arrive to A in such a time as is in proportion to the other time,
as the line CA is to the line CB. Now returning to our first
purpose; which was to shew, that the grave moveable leaving
its quiescence, passeth descending by all the degrees of tardity,
precedent to any whatsoever degree of velocity that it acquireth,
re-assuming the same Figure which we used before, let us remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that we did agree, that the Descendent by the inclination C<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>A,
and the Cadent by the perpendicular CB, were found to have
acquired equal degrees of velocity in the terms B and A: now to
proceed, I suppose you will not scruple to grant, that upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
plane less steep than AC; as for example, AD [in <hi>Fig. 5.]</hi>
the motion of the descendent would be yet more flow than in the
plane AC. So that it is not any whit dubitable, but that there
may be planes so little elevated above the Horizon AB, that the
moveable, namely the same ball, in any the longest time may
reach the point A, which being to move by the plane AB, an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
time would not suffice: and the motion is made always more
slowly, by how much the declination is less. It must be therefore
confest, that there may be a point taken upon the term B, so near
to the said B, that drawing from thence to the point A a plane,
the ball would not pass it in a whole year. It is requisite next
for you to know, that the <hi>impetus,</hi> namely the degree of velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
the ball is found to have acquired when it arriveth at the
point A, is such, that should it continue to move with this self-same
degree uniformly, that is to say, without accelerating or retarding;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96976:19"/>
in as much more time as it was in coming by the inclining plane, it
would pass double the space of the plane inclined: namely (for
example) if the ball had past the plane DA in an hour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
to move uniformly with that degree of velocity which it
is found to have in its arriving at the term A, it shall pass in an
hour a space double the length DA; and because (as we have
said) the degrees of velocity acquired in the points B and A, by
the moveables that depart from any point taken in the perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
CB, and that descend, the one by the inclined plane, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the said perpendicular, are always equal: therefore the
cadent by the perpendicular may depart from a term so near to B,
that the degree of velocity acquired in B, would not suffice (still
maintaining the same) to conduct the moveable by a space dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the length of the plane inclined in a year, nor in ten, no nor
in a hundred. We may therefore conclude, that if it be true,
that according to the ordinary course of nature a moveable, all
external and accidental impediments removed, moves upon an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
plane with greater and greater tardity, according as the
inclination shall be less; so that in the end the tardity comes to be
infinite, which is, when the inclination concludeth in, and joyneth
to the horizontal plane; and if it be true likewise, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of velocity acquired in some point of the inclined plane, is
equal to that degree of velocity which is found to be in the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
that descends by the perpendicular, in the point cut by a
parallel to the Horizon, which passeth by that point of the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
plane; it must of necessity be granted, that the cadent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
from rest, passeth thorow all the infinite degrees of tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
and that consequently, to acquire a determinate degree of
velocity, it is necessary that it move first by right lines, descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by a short or long space, according as the velocity to be acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
ought to be either less or greater, and according as the plane
on which it descendeth is more or less inclined; so that a plane
may be given with so small inclination, that to acquire in it the
assigned degree of velocity, it must first move in a very great space,
and take a very long time; whereupon in the horizontal plane, any
how little soever velocity, would never be naturally acquired,
since that the moveable in this case will never move: but the
motion by the horizontal line,<note place="margin">The circular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired naturally, without right mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion precede it. Circular motion perpetually uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</note> which is neither declined or incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
is a circular motion about the centre: therefore the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
motion is never acquired naturally, without the right motion
precede it; but being once acquired, it will continue perpetually
with uniform velocity. I could with other discourses evince and
demonstrate the same truth, but I will not by so great a digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
interrupt our principal argument: but rather will return to
it upon some other occasion; especially since we not assumed the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96976:19"/>
same, not to serve for a necessary demonstration, but to adorn a
<hi>Platonick</hi> Conceit; to which I will add another particular obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of our <hi>Academick,</hi> which hath in it something of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Let us suppose amongst the decrees of the divine <hi>Architect,</hi>
a purpose of creating in the World these Globes, which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
continually moving round, and of assigning the centre of
their conversions; and that in it he had placed the Sun immoveable,
and had afterwards made all the said Globes in the same place,
and with the intended inclinations of moving towards the Centre,
till they had acquired those degrees of velocity, which at first see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
good to the same Divine Minde; the which being acquired,
we lastly suppose that they were turned round, each in his Sphere
retaining the said acquired velocity: it is now demanded, in
what altitude and distance from the Sun the place was where the
said Orbs were primarily created; and whether it be possible that
they might all be created in the same place? To make this inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigation,
we must take from the most skilfull Astronomers the
magnitude of the Spheres in which the Planets revolve, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the time of their revolutions: from which two cognitions is
gathered how much (for example) <hi>Jupiter</hi> is swifter than <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne;</hi>
and being found (as indeed it is) that <hi>Jupiter</hi> moves more
swiftly, it is requisite, that departing from the same altitude, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>
be descended more than <hi>Saturne,</hi> as we really know it is, its
Orbe being inferiour to that of <hi>Saturne.</hi> But by proceeding for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
from the proportions of the two velocities of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and
<hi>Saturne,</hi> and from the distance between their Orbs, and from the
proportion of acceleration of natural motion, one may finde in
what altitude and distance from the centre of their revolutions,<note place="margin">The magnitude of the Orbs, and the velocity of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Planets, answer proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, as if descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the same place.</note>
was the place from whence they first departed. This found out,
and agreed upon, it is to be sought, whether <hi>Mars</hi> descending
from thence to his Orb, the magnitude of the Orb, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity
of the motion, agree with that which is found by calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and let the like be done of the <hi>Earth,</hi> of <hi>Venus,</hi> and of
<hi>Mercury;</hi> the greatness of which Spheres, and the velocity of
their motions, agree so nearly to what computation gives, that it
is very admirable.</p>

                        <p>The operation indeed is long and difficult; nor could
I be certain to finde it so readily; therefore we shall refer it to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
time, and for the present we will return to our first propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal,
going on there where we made digression; which, if I well
remember, was about the proving the motion by a right line of no
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96976:20"/>
use, in the ordinate parts of the World; and we did proceed to
say, that it was not so in circular motions, of which that which is
made by the moveable in it self,<note place="margin">Finite and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate circular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions disorder not the parts of the World.</note> still retains it in the same place,
and that which carrieth the moveable by the circumference of a
circle about its fixed centre, neither puts it self, nor those about it
in disorder; for that such a motion primarily is finite and terminate
(though not yet finished and determined) but there is no point
in the circumference,<note place="margin">In the circular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, every point in the circumference is the begining and end.</note> that is not the first and last term in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation;
and continuing it in the circumference assigned it, it
leaveth all the rest, within and without that, free for the use of
others, without ever impeding or disordering them. This being
a motion that makes the moveable continually leave, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
arrive at the end;<note place="margin">Circular motion onely is uniform.</note> it alone therefore can primarily be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niform;
for that acceleration of motion is made in the moveable,
when it goeth towards the term, to which it hath inclination;
and the retardation happens by the repugnance that it hath to
leave and part from the same term; and because in circular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the moveable continually leaves the natural term, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
moveth towards the same, therefor, in it, the repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and inclination are always of equal force: from which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
results a velocity, neither retarded nor accelerated, <hi>i. e.</hi> an
uniformity in motion. From this conformity, and from the being
terminate,<note place="margin">Circular motion may be continued perpetually.</note> may follow the perpetual continuation by successively
reiterating the circulations; which in an undeterminated line,
and in a motion continually retarded or accelerated, cannot na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
be.<note place="margin">Right motion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not naturally be perpetual.</note> I say, naturally; because the right motion which is
retarded, is the violent, which cannot be perpetual; and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celerate

there be none, it cannot be moved to it, because nature moves
not whether it is impossible to attain. I conclude therefore, that
the circular motion can onely naturally consist with natural bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,

and that the right, at the most that can be said for it, is

way to their natural state. Hence, me thinks, it may ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
be concluded, that for maintenance of perfect order amongst

circularly,<note place="margin">Rest onely, and circular motion are apt to conserve or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> these of necessity are immoveable: there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

And I do not a little wonder with my self, that <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
who held that the Terrestrial globe was placed in the centre of
the World, and there remained immoveable, should not say, that

                        <p>The most that you can pretend from this your Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
were it granted to be true, is that, like as the parts of the
Earth removed from the whole, namely, from the place where
they naturally rest, that is in short reduced to a depraved and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered
disposure, return to their place spontaneously, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
naturally in a right motion, (it being granted, that <hi>eadem
sit ratio totius &amp; partium</hi>) so it may be inferred, that the
Terrestrial Globe removed violently from the place assigned
it by nature,<note place="margin">It is questionable whether descending weights move in a right line.</note> it would return by a right line. This, as I have
said, is the most that can be granted you, and that onely for want
of examination; but he that shall with exactness revise these
things, will first deny, that the parts of the Earth, in returning to
its whole, move in a right line, and not by a circular or mixt; and
really you would have enough to do to demonstrate the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as you shall plainly see in the answers to the particular reasons
and experiments alledged by <hi>Ptolomey</hi> and <hi>Aristotle.</hi> Secondly,
If another should say that the <hi>parts</hi> of the Earth, go not in their
motion towards the Centre of the World, but to unite with its
<hi>Whole,</hi> and that for that reason they naturally incline towards the
centre of the Terrestrial Globe, by which inclination they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire
to form and preserve it, what other <hi>All,</hi> or what other Centre
would you find for the World,<note place="margin">The Earth speri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal by the conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of its parts to its Centre.</note> to which the whole Terrene
Globe, being thence removed, would seek to return, that so the
reason of the <hi>Whole</hi> might be like to that of its <hi>parts?</hi> It may be
added, That neither <hi>Aristotle,</hi> nor you can ever prove, that the
Earth <hi>de facto</hi> is in the centre of the Universe; but if any Centre
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96976:21"/>
may be assigned to the Universe,<note place="margin">The Sun more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably in the centre of the Vniverse, than the Earth.</note> we shall rather find the Sun
placed in it, as by the sequel you shall understand.</p>
                        <p>Now, like as from the consentaneous conspiration of all the
parts of the Earth to form its whole, doth follow, that they with
equal inclination concurr thither from all parts;<note place="margin">Natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the parts of all the globes of the World to go to their centre.</note> and to unite
themselves as much as is possible together, they there spherically
adapt themselves; why may we not believe that the Sun, Moon,
and other mundane Bodies, be also of a round figure, not by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than a concordant instinct, and natural concourse of all the
parts composing them? Of which, if any, at any time, by any
violence were separated from the whole, is it not reasonable to
think, that they would spontaneously and by natural instinct re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn?
and in this manner to infer, that the right motion agreeth
with all mundane bodies alike.</p>

                        <p>Certainly, if you in this manner deny not onely the
Principles of Sciences, but manifest Experience, and the Senses
themselves, you can never be convinced or removed from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
which you once conceit, therefore I will choose rather to
be silent (for, <hi>contra negantes principia non est disputandum</hi>)
than contend with you. And insisting on the things alledged by
you even now (since you question so much as whether grave move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables
have a right motion or no) how can you ever rationally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<note place="margin">The right motion of grave bodies manifest to sense.</note> that the parts of the Earth; or, if you will, that ponderous
matters descend towards the Centre, with a right motion; when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
if from a very high Tower, whose walls are very upright and
perpendicular, you let them fall, they shall descend gliding and
sliding by the Tower to the Earth, exactly in that very place
where a plummet would fall, being hanged by a line fastned above,
just there, whence the said weights were let fall? is not this a
more than evident argument of the motions being right, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Centre?<note place="margin">Arguments of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle,</hi> to prove that grave bodies move with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to arrive at the centre of the Vniverse.</note> In the second place you call in doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the parts of the Earth are moved, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> affirms, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Centre of the World; as if he had not rationally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
it by contrary motions, whilst he thus argueth; The
motion of heavie bodies is contrary to that of the light: but the
motion of the light is manifest to be directly upwards, namely,
towards the circumference of the World, therefore the motion of
the heavie is directly towards the Centre of the World: and it
happens <hi>per accidens,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Heavie bodies move towards the centre of the Earth <hi>per accidens.</hi>
                           </note> that it be towards the centre of the Earth,
for that this striveth to be united to that. The seeking in the
next place, what a part of the Globe of the Sun or Moon would
do, were it separated from its whole, is vanity; because that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
that is sought,<note place="margin">To seek what would follow upon an impossibility, is folly.</note> which would be the consequence of an impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility;
in regard that, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> also demonstrates, the coelestial
bodies are impassible, impenetrable, and infrangible; so that such
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96976:21"/>
a case can never happen:<note place="margin">Coelestial bodies neither heavie nor light, according to <hi>Aristotle.</hi>
                           </note> and though it should, and that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated

                           <hi>Simplicius,</hi> we are here familiarly discoursing among
our selves, to investigate some truth; I shall not be displeased
that you discover my errors; and if I do not follow the mind of
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> freely reprehend me, and I shall take it in good part.
Onely give me leave to expound my doubts, and to reply some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to your last words, telling you, that <hi>Logick,</hi> as it is well
understood, is the Organe with which we philosophate; but as it
may be possible, that an Artist may be excellent in making Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
but unlearned in playing on them, thus he might be a great
Logician, but unexpert in making use of <hi>Logick;</hi> like as we have
many that theorically understand the whole Art of Poetry, and
yet are unfortunate in composing but meer four Verses; others
enjoy all the precepts of <hi>Vinci</hi>
                           <note n="*" place="margin">A famous <hi>Italian</hi> Painter.</note>, and yet know not how to paint
a Stoole. The playing on the Organs is not taught by them who
know how to make Organs, but by him that knows how to play
on them: Poetry is learnt by continual reading of Poets: Limn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is learnt by continual painting and designing: Demonstration
from the reading of Books full of demonstrations, which are the
Mathematical onely, and not the Logical. Now returning to our
purpose, I say, that that which <hi>Aristotle</hi> seeth of the motion of
light bodies, is the departing of the Fire from any part of the
Superficies of the Terrestrial Globe, and directly retreating from
it, mounting upwards; and this indeed is to move towards a
circumference greater than that of the Earth; yea, the same <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi>
makes it to move to the concave of the Moon, but that
this circumference is that of the World, or concentrick to it, so
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96976:22"/>
that to move towards this, is a moving towards that of the World,
that he cannot affirm, unless he supposeth, That the Centre of the
Earth,<note place="margin">Paralogism of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle,</hi> in proving the Earth to be in the Centre of the World.</note> from which we see these light ascendent bodies to depart,
be the same with the Centre of the World; which is as much as
to say, that the terrestrial Globe is constituted in the midst of the
World: which is yet that of which we were in doubt, and which
<hi>Aristotle</hi> intended to prove. And do you say that this is not a
manifest <hi>Paralogism?</hi>

                        <p>This Argument of <hi>Aristotle</hi> appeared to me deficient
also, and <hi>non</hi>-concludent for another respect; though it were
granted, that that Circumference, to which the Fire directly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,
be that which includeth the World: for that in a circle,
not onely the centre, but any other point being taken, every move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
which departing thence, shall move in a right line, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
any whatsoever part, shall without any doubt go towards
the circumference, and continuing the motion, shall also arrive
thither; so that we may truly say, that it moveth towards the
circumference: but yet it doth not follow, that that which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
by the same line with a contrary motion, would go towards
the centre, unless when the point taken were the centre it self,
or that the motion were made by that onely line, which produced
from the point assigned, passeth thorow the centre. So that to
say, that Fire moving in a right line, goeth towards the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the World, therefore the parts of the Earth which by
the same lines move with a contrary motion, go towards the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
of the World, concludeth not, unless then when it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposed,
that the lines of the Fire prolonged pass by the centre
of the World; and because we know certainly of them, that they
pass by the centre of the Terrestrial Globe (being perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
to its superficies, and not inclined) therefore to conclude, it
must be supposed, that the centre of the Earth is the same with
the centre of the World; or at least, that the parts of the Fire
and Earth descend not, save onely by one sole line which passeth
by the centre of the World. Which nevertheless is false, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to experience, which sheweth us, that the parts of
Fire, not by one line onely, but by infinite, produced from the
centre of the Earth towards all the parts of the World, ascend
always by lines perpendicular to the Superficies of the Terrestri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Globe.</p>

                        <p>You do very ingeniously lead <hi>Aristotle</hi> to the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience,
<hi>Sagredus,</hi> shewing his manifest equivoke; but
withal you add another inconsistency. We see the Earth to be
spherical, and therefore are certain that it hath its centre, to which
we see all its parts are moved; for so we must say, whilst their
motions are all perpendicular to the Superficies of the Earth; we
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96976:22"/>
mean, that as they move to the centre of the Earth, they move to
their <hi>Whole,</hi> and to their Universal Mother: and we are still far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
so free, that we will suffer our selves to be perswaded, that
their natural instinct is,<note place="margin">Grave bodies may more rationally be affirmed to tend to the Centre of the Earth, than of the Vniverse.</note> not to go towards the centre of the Earth,
but towards that of the Universe; which we know not where to
find, or whether it be or no; and were it granted to be, it is but
an imaginary point, and a nothing without any quality. As to
what <hi>Simplicius</hi> said last, that the contending whether the parts
of the Sun, Moon, or other coelestial Body, separated from their
<hi>Whole,</hi> should naturally return to it, is a vanity, for that the case
is impossible; it being clear by the Demonstrations of <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
that the coelestial Bodies are impassible,<note place="margin">The conditions and attributes which differ the coelestial bodies from Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary, depend on the motions assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them by <hi>Arist.</hi>

that the circular motion is peculiar to Coelestial Bodies, and
affirmed, that it is agreeable to all Bodies naturally moveable, it
is behoofull upon necessary consequence to say, either that the
attributes of generable, or ingenerable, alterable, or unalterable,

all worldly bodies, namely, as well to the Coelestial as to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementary;

that that circular motion which you assign to Coelestial Bodies,
suiteth also to the Earth, from which, supposing that the rest of
your discourse were concludent, will follow one of these three
things, as I told you a little before, and shall repeat; namely,
either that the Earth it self is also ingenerable, and incorruptible,
as the Coelestial bodies; or that the Coelestial bodies are, like as
the Elementary generable, alterable &amp;c. or that this difference of
motion hath nothing to do with Generation and Corruption.
The discourse of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and yours also contain many Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
not to be lightly admitted, and the better to examine them,
it will be convenient to reduce them to the most abstracted and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96976:23"/>
distinct that can be possible; and excuse me <hi>Sagredus,</hi> if haply
with some tediousness you hear me oft repeat the same things,
and fancie that you see me reassume my argument in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
circle of Disputations. You say Generation and Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are onely made where there are contraries; contraries
are onely amongst simple natural bodies, moveable with contrary
motions; contrary motions are onely those which are made by
a right line between contrary terms; and these are onely two,
that is to say, from the <hi>medium,</hi> and towards the <hi>medium;</hi> and
such motions belong to no other natural bodies, but to the <hi>Earth,</hi>
the <hi>Fire,</hi> and the other two Elements: therefore Generation
and Corruption is onely amongst the Elements. And because
the third simple motion, namely, the circular about the <hi>medium,</hi>
hath no contrary, (for that the other two are contraries, and one
onely, hath but onely one contrary) therefore that natural body
with which such motion agreeth, wants a contrary; and having
no contrary is ingenerable and incorruptible, &amp;c. Because where
there is no contrariety, there is no generation or corruption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
But such motion agreeth onely with the Coelestial bodies; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
onely these are ingenerable,<note place="margin">Its easier to prove the Earth to move, than that corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries.</note> incorruptible, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And to
begin, I think it a more easie thing, and sooner done to resolve,
whether the Earth (a most vast Body, and for its vicinity to us,
most tractable) moveth with a speedy motion, such as its revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
about its own axis in twenty four hours would be, than it
is to understand and resolve, whether Generation and Corruption
ariseth from contrariety, or else whether there be such things as
generation, corruption and contrariety in nature. And if you,
<hi>Simplicius,</hi> can tell me what method Nature observes in working,
when she in a very short time begets an infinite number of flies
from a little vapour of the Must of wine, and can shew me which
are there the contraries you speak of, what it is that corrupteth,
and how; I should think you would do more than I can; for I
profess I cannot comprehend these things. Besides, I would ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
gladly understand how, and why these corruptive contraries are
so favourable to Daws, and so cruel to Doves; so indulgent to
Stags, and so hasty to Horses, that they do grant to them many
more years of life, that is, of incorruptibility, than weeks to these.
Peaches and Olives are planted in the same soil, exposed to the
same heat and cold, to the same wind and rains, and, in a word,
to the same contrarieties; and yet those decay in a short time,
and these live many hundred years. Furthermore, I never was
thorowly satisfied about this substantial transmutation (still keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
within pure natural bounds) whereby a matter becometh so
transform'd, that it should be necessarily said to be destroy'd, so
that nothing remaineth of its first being, and that another body
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96976:24"/>
quite differing there-from should be thence produced;<note place="margin">Bare transposition of parts may repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent bodies under diverse asp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

fancy to my self a body under one aspect, and by and by under
another very different, I cannot think it impossible but that it may
happen by a simple transposition of parts, without corrupting or
ingendring any thing a-new; for we see such kinds of Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoses
dayly: so that to return to my purpose, I answer you,
that inasmuch as you go about to perswade me that the Earth can
not move circularly by way of corruptibility and generability,
you have undertook a much harder task than I, that with argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
more difficult indeed, but no less concluding, will prove
the contrary.</p>

which, as it delights me much, for that I also am gravel'd with
the same doubts; so I fear that you can never conclude the same,
without altogether digressing from your chief design: therefore
if it be permitted to proceed in our first argument, I should think
that it were convenient to remit this question of generation and
corruption to another distinct and single conference; as also, if
it shall please you and <hi>Simplicius,</hi> we may do by other particular
questions which may fall in the way of our discourse; which I
will keep in my mind to propose, and exactly discuss them some
other time. Now as for the present, since you say, that if <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
deny circular motion to the Earth in common with other
bodies Coelestial, it thence will follow, that the same which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falleth
the Earth, as to its being generable, alterable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will
hold also of Heaven, let us enquire no further if there be such
things in nature, as generation and corruption, or not; but let
us return to enquire what the Globe of the Earth doth.</p>

Coelestial Bodies, for that they are ingenerable and incorruptible,
have in Nature their contraries, which are those Bodies that be

generable and corruptible.</p>

circularly, to which motion no other motion is contrary, want
contrariety, and therefore they are incorruptible.</p>

                        <p>Fair and softly, <hi>Simplicius;</hi> this contrariety whereby
you say some simple Bodies become corruptible, resides it in the
same Body which is corrupted, or else hath it relation to some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
I say, if, for example, humidity by which a piece of Earth
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96976:25"/>
is corrupted, resides it in the same Earth or in some other bodie,
which must either be the Air or Water? I believe you will grant,
that like as the Motions upwards and downwards, and gravity
and levity, which you make the first contraries, cannot be in the
same Subject, so neither can moist and dry, hot and cold: you
must therefore consequently acknowledg that when a bodie cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth,
<note place="margin">Contraries which are the causes of corruption, reside not in the same bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that corrupteth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </note> it is occasioned by some quality residing in another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to its own: therefore to make the Coelestial Body become
corruptible, it sufficeth that there are in Nature, bodies that have
a contrariety to that Coelestial body; and such are the Elements,
if it be true that corruptibility be contrary to incorruptibility.</p>

                        <p>This sufficeth not, Sir; The Elements alter and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
because they are intermixed, and are joyn'd to one another,
and so may exercise their contrariety;<note place="margin">Coelestial Bodies touch, but are not touched by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements.</note> but Coelestial bodies are
separated from the Elements, by which they are not so much as
toucht, though indeed they have an influence upon the Elements.
It is requisite, if you will prove generation and corruption in Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
bodies, that you shew, that there resides contrarieties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them.</p>

                        <p>See how I will find those contrarieties between them.
The first fountain from whence you derive the contrariety of the
Elements, is the contrariety of their motions upwards and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards:
it therefore is necessary that those Principles be in like
manner contraries to each other,<note place="margin">Gravity &amp; levity, rarity and density, are contrary qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</note> upon which those motions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend:
and because that is moveable upwards by lightness,
and this downwards by gravity, it is necessary that lightness and
gravity are contrary to each other: no less are we to believe those
other Principles to be contraries, which are the causes that this is
heavy, and that light: but by your own confession, levity and
gravity follow as consequents of rarity and density; therefore
rarity and density shall be contraries:<note place="margin">The stars infinitely surpass the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the rest of Heaven in density.</note> the which conditions or
affections are so amply found in Coelestial bodies, that you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
the stars to be onely more dense parts of their Heaven:
and if this be so, it followeth that the density of the stars exceeds
that of the rest of Heaven, by almost infinite degrees:
which is manifest, in that Heaven is infinitely transparent, and
the stars extremely opacous; and for that there are there above
no other qualities, but more and less density and rarity, which
may be causes of the greater or less transparency. There being
then such contrariety between the Coelestial bodies, it is necessary
that they also be generable and corruptible, in the same manner
as the Elementary bodies are; or else that contrariety is not the
cause of corruptibility,<note place="margin">Rarity &amp; density in Coelestial bodies, is different from the rarity &amp; den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of the elements.</note> 
                           <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>There is no necessity either of one or the other, for
that density and rarity in Coelestial bodies, are not contraries to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96976:25"/>
each other, as in Elementary bodies; for that they depend not
on the primary qualities, cold and heat, which are contraries; but
on the more or less matter in proportion to quantity: now much
and little, speak onely a relative opposition, that is, the least of
oppositions, and which hath nothing to do with generation and
corruption.</p>

on which, again, dependeth the contrarieties for generation

rarenesses which under the same quantity, or (if you will) mass

heat and cold have nothing to do in this affair: and you shall

as to local scituation, that then there is no other but the circular
motion, and rest; for as to the motion by a right line, I see not
how it can be of use for any thing, but to reduce to their natural
constitution, some integral bodies, that by some accident were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd
and separated from their whole, as we said above.</p>
                        <p>Let us now consider the whole Terrestrial Globe, and enquire
the best we can, whether it, and the other Mundane bodies are to
conserve themselves in their perfect and natural disposition. It
is necessary to say, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> that it rests and keeps perpetually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable
in its place; or else that continuing always in its place,
it revolves in its self; or that it turneth about a Centre, moving
by the circumference of a circle.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Arist.</hi> &amp; <hi>Ptolomey</hi> make the Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial Globe immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable.</note> Of which accidents, both <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
and <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> and all their followers say, that it hath ever
observed, and shall continually keep the first, that is, a perpetual
rest in the same place.<note place="margin">It is better to say, that the Terrestri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Globe naturally resteth, than that it moveth directly downwards.</note> Now, why, I pray you, ought they not
to have said, that its natural affection is to rest immoveable, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than to make natural unto it the motion<note n="*" place="margin">The word is, <hi>all' ingiù,</hi> which the Latine version ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth <hi>sursùm,</hi> which is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors sense.</note> downwards, with
which motion it never did or shall move? And as to the motion
by a right line, they must grant us that Nature maketh use of it
to reduce the small parts of the Earth, Water, Air, Fire, and every
other integral Mundane body to their <hi>Whole,</hi> when any of them
by chance are separated, and so transported out of their proper
place; if also haply, some circular motion might not be found
to be more convenient to make this restitution. In my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
this primary position answers much better, even according
to <hi>Aristotles</hi> own method, to all the other consequences, than
to attribute the straight motion to be an intrinsick and natural
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96976:26"/>
principle of the Elements. Which is manifest, for that if I aske
the <hi>Peripatetick,</hi> if, being of opinion that Coelestial bodies are
incorruptibe and eternal, he believeth that the Terrestial Globe
is not so, but corruptible and mortal, so that there shall come a
time, when the Sun and Moon and other Stars, continuing their
beings and operations, the Earth shall not be found in the
World, but shall with the rest of the Elements be destroyed
and annihilated, I am certain that he would answer me, no:
therefore generation and corruption is in the parts and not in the
whole;<note place="margin">Right Motion with more reason attributed to the parts, than to the whole Elements.</note> and in the parts very small and superficial, which are,
as it were, incensible in comparison of the whole masse. And
because <hi>Aristotle</hi> deduceth generation and corruption from the
contrariety of streight motions, let us remit such motions to the
parts, which onely change and decay, and to the whole Globe
and Sphere of the Elements, let us ascribe either the circular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or a perpetual consistance in its proper place: the only
affections apt for perpetuation, and maintaining of perfect order.
This which is spoken of the Earth, may be said with the same
reason of Fire, and of the greatest part of the Air; to which
Elements,<note place="margin">The Peripateticks improperly assign those motions to the Elements for Natural, with which they never were moved, and those for Preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural with which they alwayes are moved.</note> the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> are forced to ascribe for intrinsical
and natural, a motion wherewith they were never yet moved,
nor never shall be; and to call that motion preternatural to them,
wherewith, if they move at all, they do and ever shall move.
This I say, because they assign to the Air and Fire the motion
upwards, wherewith those Elements were never moved, but
only some parts of them, and those were so moved onely in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the recovery of their perfect constitution, when they were
out of their natural places; and on the contrary they call the
circular motion preternatural to them, though they are thereby
incessantly moved: forgeting, as it seemeth, what <hi>Aristotle</hi> oft in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcateth,
that nothing violent can be permanent.</p>

                        <p>What hath been spoken hitherto, serves to clear up
unto us which of the two general discourses carrieth with it most
of probability, I mean that of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> which would perswade
us, that the sublunary bodies are by nature generable, and corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore most different from the essence of Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
bodies, which are impassible, ingenerable, incorruptible,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> drawn from the diversity of simple motions; or else this of
<hi>Salviatus,</hi> who supposing the integral parts of the World to be
disposed in a perfect constitution, excludes by necessary conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96976:27"/>
the right or straight motion of simple natural bodies, as
being of no use in nature, and esteems the Earth it self also to
be one of the Coelestial bodies adorn'd with all the prerogatives
that agree with them; which last discourse is hitherto much
more likely, in my judgment, than that other. Therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve,
<hi>Simplicius,</hi> to produce all the particular reasons, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and observations, as well Natural as Astronomical, that
may serve to perswade us that the Earth differeth from the Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial

World, and what ever else excludes its moving like to the Planets,
as <hi>Jupiter</hi> or the <hi>Moon, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Salviatus</hi> will be pleased to

                        <p>See here for a begining, two most convincing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to demonstrate the Earth to be most different from the
Coelestial bodies. First, the bodies that are generable, corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible,
alterable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are quite different from those that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generable,
incorruptible, unalterable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Earth is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable,
corruptible, alterable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Coelestial bodies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generable,
incorruptible, unalterable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore the Earth
is quite different from the Coelestial bodies.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SAGR.</speaker>
                        <p>By your first Argument you spread the Table with the
same Viands, which but just now with much adoe were voided.</p>

                     <sp>

                        <p>Hold a little, Sir, and take the rest along with you,
and then tell me if this be not different from what you had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
In the former, the <hi>Minor</hi> was proved <hi>à priori,</hi> &amp; now you see
it proved <hi>à posteriori:</hi> Judg then if it be the same. I prove the
<hi>Minor,</hi> therefore (the <hi>Major</hi> being most manifest) by sensible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                              <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                           </gap> that in the Earth there are made conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
generations, corruptions, alterations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which neither our
senses, nor the traditions or memories of our Ancestors, ever saw
an instance of in Heaven; therefore Heaven is unalterable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and the Earth alterable,<note place="margin">Heaven immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, because there never was any mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation seen in it.</note> 
                           <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore different from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
I take my second Argument from a principal and essential
accident, and it is this. That body which is by its nature ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
and deprived of light,<note place="margin">Bodies naturally lucid, are different from those which are by nature ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure.</note> is divers from the luminous and shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
bodies; but the Earth is obscure and void of light, and the
Coelestial bodies splendid, and full of light; <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> Answer
to these Arguments first, that we may not heap up too many,
and then I will alledge others.</p>

and decaying; winds, rains, tempests, storms arising; and
in a word, the aspect of the Earth to be perpetually metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing;
none of which mutations are to be discern'd in the Coelestial

are seen on the Earth neer at hand, cannot, by reason of the too
great distance, be seen in <hi>America,</hi> much lesse can you see them
in the Moon, which is so many hundred times more remote:
And if you believe the alterations in <hi>Mexico</hi> upon the report of
those that come from thence, what intelligence have you from
the Moon, to assure you that there is no such alterations in it?
Therefore, from your not seeing any alterations in Heaven,
whereas, if there were any such, you could not see them by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of their too great distance, and from your not having intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
thereof, in regard that it cannot be had, you ought not
to argue, that there are no such alterations; howbeit, from the
seeing and observing of them on Earth, you well argue that
therein such there are.</p>

                        <p>I will shew so great mutations that have befaln on

might very well have been observed here below.<note place="margin">The Mediterrani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Sea made by the separation of <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> and <hi>Calpen.</hi>
                           </note> We find in
very antient records, that heretofore at the Streights of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi>
the two great Mountains <hi>Abila,</hi> and <hi>Calpen,</hi> were continued to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by certain other lesse Mountains, which there gave check

to the Ocean: but those Hills, being by some cause or other se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated,
and a way being opened for the Sea to break in, it made
such an inundation, that it gave occasion to the calling of it since
the Mid-land Sea: the greatness whereof considered, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
aspects the surfaces of the Water and Earth then made, had it
been beheld afar off, there is no doubt but so great a change
might have been discerned by one that was then in the Moon;
as also to us inhabitants of the Earth, the like alterations would
be perceived in the Moon; but we find not in antiquity, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

                        <p>That so great alterations have hapned in the Moon, I
dare not say, but for all that, I am not yet certain but that such
changes might occur; and because such a mutation could onely
represent unto us some kind of variation between the more clear,
and more obscure parts of the Moon, I know not whether we
have had on Earth observant Selenographers, who have for any
considerable number of years, instructed us with so exact Seleno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy,
as that we should confidently conclude, that there hath
no such change hapned in the face of the Moon; of the figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of some, that it represents an humane face; of others, that
it is like the muzle of a Lyon; and of others, that it is <hi>Cain</hi> with

because that in the Moon, or other Coelestial bodies, no
such alterations are seen, as discover themselves on Earth, is a bad

a little altereth the Text of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and the other <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticks,</hi>
who say, they hold the Heavens unalterable, for that
they see therein no one star generate or corrupt, which is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
a less part of Heaven, than a City is of the Earth, and yet
innumerable of these have been destroyed, so as that no mark of
them hath remain'd.</p>

                        <p>I verily believed otherwise, and conceited that <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicius</hi>
dissembled this exposition of the Text, that he might not
charge his Master and Consectators, with a notion more absurd
than the former. And what a folly it is to say the Coelestial
part is unalterable, because no stars do generate or corrupt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in?
What then? hath any one seen a Terrestrial Globe corrupt, and
another regenerate in its place? And yet is it not on all hands
granted by Philosophers, that there are very few stars in Heaven
less than the Earth,<note place="margin">Its no less impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a star to corrupt, than for the whole Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial Globe.</note> but very many that are much bigger? So
that for a star in Heaven to corrupt, would be no less than if the
whole Terrestrial Globe should be destroy'd. Therefore, if for
the true proof of generation and corruption in the Universe, it be
necessary that so vast bodies as a star, must corrupt and regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
you may satisfie your self and cease your opinion; for I
assure you, that you shall never see the Terrestrial Globe or any
other integral body of the World, to corrupt or decay so, that
having been beheld by us for so many years past, they should so
dissolve, as not to leave any footsteps of them.</p>

demonstrate it: For this is the usual course in demonstrative Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

what ever was the method of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and whether his arguing <hi>à

before all discourses; besides, as to the Arguments <hi>à


priori</hi> their force hath been already examined. Now returning
to my purposed matter, I say, that the things in our times dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
in the Heavens, are, and have been such, that they may
give absolute satisfaction to all Philosophers; forasmuch as in
the particular bodies, and in the universal expansion of Heaven,
there have been, and are continually, seen just such accidents as
we call generations and corruptions, being that excellent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomers
have observed many Comets generated and dissolved
in parts higher than the Lunar Orb, besides the two new Stars,
<hi>Anno</hi> 1572,<note place="margin">New stars disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in Heaven.</note> and <hi>Anno</hi> 1604, without contradiction much higher
than all the Planets; and in the face of the Sun it self, by help
of the <hi>Telescope,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Spots generate and dissolve in the face of the Sun.</note> certain dense and obscure substances, in sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
very like to the foggs about the Earth, are seen to be
produced and dissolved; and many of these are so vast, that
they far exceed not only the Mediterranian Streight, but all
<hi>Affrica</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi> also.<note place="margin">Solar spots are bigger than all <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi> and <hi>Affrick.</hi>
                           </note> Now if <hi>Aristotle</hi> had seen these things,
what think you he would have said, and done <hi>Simplicius?</hi>

unlesse they would deprive themselves of their guide, leader, and

what saith he to the new Stars, <hi>Anno</hi> 1572, and 1604, and to

the Solar spots? for as to the Comets, I for my own particular
little care to make them generated under or above the Moon;
nor did I ever put much stresse on the loquacity of <hi>Tycho;</hi> nor
am I hard to believe that their matter is Elementary, and that
they may elevate (sublimate) themselves at their pleasure, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
meeting with any obstacle from the impenetrability of the
<hi>Peripatetick</hi> Heaven, which I hold to be far more thin, yielding,
and subtil than our Air; and as to the calculations of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallaxes,
first, the uncertainty whether Comets are subject to
such accidents, and next, the inconstancy of the observations,
upon which the computations are made, make me equally sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
both those opinions:<note place="margin">

                        <p>As to the new Stars, <hi>Anti-Tycho</hi> extricates himself
finely in three or four words; saying, That those mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
new Stars are no certain parts of the Coelestial bodies, and
that the adversaries, if they will prove alteration and genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in those superior bodies, must shew some mutations that
have been made in the Stars described so many ages past, of
which there is no doubt but that they be Coelestial bodies,
which they can never be able to do: Next, as to those mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which some affirm, to generate and dissipate in the face of
the Sun, he makes no mention thereof; wherefore I conclude,
that he believed them fictious, or the illusions of the Tube, or
at most, some petty effects caused by the Air, and in brief, any
thing rather than matters Coelestial.</p>

the opposition of these importunate spots which are started up
to disturb the Heavens, and more than that, the <hi>Peripatetick</hi>
Philosophy? It cannot be but that you, who are so resolute a

                        <p>I have heard sundry opinions about this particular.
One saith: <q>They are Stars which in their proper Orbs,<note place="margin">Sundry opinions touching the Solar spots.</note> like as
<hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> revolve about the Sun, and in passing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it, represent themselves to us obscure; and for that they
are many, they oft happen to aggregate their parts together,
and afterwards seperate again</q>. Others believe them to be
äerial impressions; others, the illusions of the chrystals; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
other things: But I incline to think, yea am verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
That they are an aggregate of many several opacous
bodies, as it were casually concurrent among themselves. And
therefore we often see, that in one of those spots one may
number ten or more such small bodies, which are of irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:96976:30"/>
figures, and seem to us like flakes of snow, or flocks of
wooll, or moaths flying: they vary fire amongst themselves,
and one while sever, another while meet, and most of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
the Sun, about which, as about their Centre, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
move. But yet, must we not therefore grant, that
they are generated or dissolved, but that at sometimes they are
hid behind the body of the Sun, and at other times, though
remote from it, yet are they not seen for the vicinity of the
immeasurable light of the Sun; in regard that in the eccentrick
Orb of the Sun, there is constituted, as it were, an Onion, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of many folds one within another, each of which, being
<note n="*" place="margin">The Original saith <hi>[tempestata si muove]</hi> which the Latine Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (mistaking <hi>Tempestata,</hi> a word in Heraldry, for <hi>Tempestato,</hi>) ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth <hi>[incitata movetur]</hi> which signifieth a violent transportmeut, as in a storm, that of a Ship.</note> studded with certain small spots, doth move; and albeit their
motion at first seemeth inconstant and irregular, yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
it is said at last, to be observed that the very same spots,
as before, do within a determinate time return again. This
seemeth to me the fittest answer that hath been found to assigne
a reason of that same appearance, and withal to maintain the
incorruptability and ingenerability of the Heavens; and if this
doth not suffice; there wants not more elevated wits, which will
give you other more convincing.</p>

and conceits, wherewith you flatter your self, that there can be
any men so much more learned, read, and versed in Authors,
than we, that in despite of nature, they should be able to
make that become true, which is false. And seeing that of all
the opinions that have been hitherto alledged touching the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of these Solar spots, this instanced in by you, is in your
judgment the truest, it followeth (if this be so) that all the rest
are false; and to deliver you from this also, which doubtlesse is a
most false <hi>Chimaera,</hi> over-passing infinite other improbabilities
that are therein,<note place="margin">An Argument that necessarily proveth the Solar spots to generate and dissolve.</note> I shall propose against it onely two experiments;
one is, that many of those spots are seen to arise in the midst of
the Solar ring, and many likewise to dissolve and vanish at a great
distance from the circumference of the Sun; a necessary Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:96976:30"/>
that they generate and dissolve; for if without generating
or corrrupting, they should appear there by onely local motion,
they would all be seen to enter,<note place="margin">A conclusive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, that the spots are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous to the body of the Sun.</note> and pass out by extreme cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference.
The other observation to such as are not situate in
the lowest degree of ignorance in Perspective, by the mutation
of the appearing figures, and by the apparent mutations of the
velocity of motion is necessarily concluding, that the spots are
contiguous to the body of the Sun, and that touching its superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
they move either with it or upon it, and that they in no wise
move in circles remote from the same.<note place="margin">The motion of the spots towards the circumference of the Sun appears slow.</note> The motion proves
it, which towards the circumference of the Solar Circle,
appeareth very slow, and towards the midst, more swift; the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
of the spots confirmeth it,<note place="margin">The figure of the spots appears nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row towards the circumference of the Suns <hi>discus,</hi> &amp; why.</note> which towards the circumference
appear exceeding narrow in comparison of that which they seem
to be in the parts nearer the middle; and this because in the
midst they are seen in their full luster, and as they truly be; and
towards the circumference by reason of the convexity of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bous
superficies, they seem more compress'd: And both these
diminutions of figure and motion, to such as know how to observe
and calculate them exactly, precisely answer to that which should
appear, the spots being contiguous to the Sun, and differ irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileably
from a motion in circles remote, though but for smal
intervalls from the body of the Sun; as hath been diffusely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
by our<note n="*" place="margin">Under this word <hi>Friend,</hi> as also that of <hi>Academick,</hi> &amp; <hi>Common Friend, Galilaeus</hi> modestly conceals himself throughout these Dialogues.</note> Friend, in his Letters about the Solar spots,
to <hi>Marcus Velserus.</hi> It may be gathered from the same muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of figure, that none of them are stars, or other bodies of
spherical figure; for that amongst all figures the sphere never
appeareth compressed, nor can ever be represented but onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
round; and thus in case any particular spot were a round
body, as all the stars are held to be, the said roundness would as
well appear in the midst of the Solar ring, as when the spot is near
the extreme: whereas, its so great compression, and shewing its
self so small towards the extreme, and contrariwise, spatious and
large towards the middle, assureth us,<note place="margin">The Solar spots are not spherical, but flat like thin plates.</note> that these spots are flat
plates of small thickness or depth, in comparison of their length
and breadth. Lastly, whereas you say that the spots after their
determinate periods are observed to return to their former aspect,
believe it not, <hi>Simplicius,</hi> for he that told you so, will deceive
you; and that I speak the truth, you may observe them to be hid
in the face of the Sun far from the circumference; nor hath your
Observator told you a word of that compression, which necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
argueth them to be contiguous to the Sun. That which he
tells you of the return of the said spots, is nothing else but what
is read in the forementioned Letters, namely, that some of them
may sometimes so happen that are of so long a duration, that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96976:31"/>
they cannot be dissipated by one sole conversion about the Sun,
which is accomplished in less than a moneth.</p>

                        <p>I remember very well where we left. We were
upon the answer of <hi>Anti-Tycho,</hi> to the objections against the
immutability of the Heavens, among which you inserted this
of the Solar spots, not spoke of by him; and I believe you
intended to examine his answer to the instance of the New
Stars.</p>

                        <p>Now I remember the rest, and to proceed, Methinks
there are some things in the answer to <hi>Anti-Tycho,</hi> worthy of
reprehension. And first, if the two New Stars, which he can do
no less than place in the uppermost parts of the Heavens, and
which were of a long duration, but finally vanished, give him no
obstruction in maintaining the inalterability of Heaven, in that
they were not certain parts thereof, nor mutations made in the
antient Stars, why doth he set himself so vigorously and earnestly
against the Comets, to banish them by all ways from the Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial
Regions? Was it not enough that he could say of them
the same which he spoke of the New stars? to wit, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
they were no certain parts of Heaven, nor mutations made
in any of the Stars, they could no wise prejudice either Heaven,
or the Doctrine of <hi>Aristotle?</hi> Secondly, I am not very well satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
of his meaning; when he saith that the alterations that should
be granted to be made in the Stars, would be destructive to the
prerogative of Heaven; namely, its incorruptibility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
this, because the Stars are Coelestial substances, as is manifest
by the consent of every one; and yet is nothing troubled that
the same alterations should be made<note n="*" place="margin">Extra Stellas.</note> without the Stars in the rest
of the Coelestial expansion. Doth he think that Heaven is no
Coelestial substance? I, for my part, did believe that the Stars
were called Coelestial bodies, by reason that they were in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
or for that they were made of the substance of Heaven;
and yet I thought that Heaven was more Coelestial than they; in
like sort, as nothing can be said to be more Terrestrial, or more
fiery than the Earth or Fire themselves. And again, in that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
made any mention of the Solar spots, which have been evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
demonstrated to be produced, and dissolved, and to be
neer the Sun, and to turn either with, or about the same, I have
reason to think that this Author probably did write more for others
pleasure, than for his own satisfaction; and this I affirm, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as he having shewn himself to be skilful in the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
it is impossible but that he should have been convinced by
Demonstrations, that those substances are of necessity contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
with the body of the Sun, and are so great generations and
corruptions, that none comparable to them, ever happen in the
Earth: And if such, so many, and so frequent be made in the
very Globe of the Sun, which may with reason be held one of the
noblest parts of Heaven, what should make us think that others
may not happen in the other Orbs.</p>

which, such conditions would be superfluous; in regard that the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:96976:33"/>

things more general, I believe that the Lunar Globe is far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from the Terrestrial, though in some things they agree. I will
recount first their resemblances, and next their differences. The
Moon is manifestly like to the Earth in figure,<note place="margin">The <hi>First</hi> resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance between the Moon and Earth; which is that of figure; is proved by the manner of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing illuminated by the Sun.</note> which undoubtedly
is spherical, as may be necessarily concluded from the aspect of its
surface, which is perfectly Orbicular, and the manner of its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the light of the Sun, from which, if its surface were flat,
it would come to be all in one and the same time illuminated, and
likewise again in another instant of time obscured, and not those
parts first, which are situate towards the Sun, and the rest succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively,
so that in its opposition, and not till then, its whole
apparent circumference is enlightned; which would happen quite
contrary, if the visible surface were concave; namely, the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
would begin from the parts opposite or averse to the Sun.<note place="margin">The <hi>Second</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity is the Moons being opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous as the Earth.</note>
Secondly she is as the Earth, in her self obscure and opacous, by
which opacity it is enabled to receive, and reflect the light of the

                              </gap> as the Earth.</note> which were it not so, it could not do. Thirdly, I hold its
matter to be most dense and solid as the Earth is, which I clearly
argue from the unevenness of its superficies in most places, by means
of the many eminencies and cavities discovered therein by help of
the <hi>Telescope:</hi> of which eminencies there are many all over it, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
resembling our most sharp and craggy mountains, of which
you shall there perceive some extend and run in ledges of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
miles long; others are contracted into rounder forms; and
there are also many craggy, solitary, steep and cliffy rocks. But
that of which there are frequentest appearances, are certain Banks
(I use this word, because I cannot thing of another that better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
them) pretty high raised, which environ and inclose fields
of several bignesses, and from sundry figures, but for the most part
circular; many of which have in the midst a mount raised pretty
high, and some few are replenished with a matter somewhat ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure,
to wit, like to the great spots discerned by the bare eye, and
these are of the greatest magnitude; the number moreover of those
that are lesser and lesser is very great, and yet almost all circular.
Fourthly,<note place="margin">Fourthly, The Moon is distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished into two different parts for clarity and obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as the Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial Globe into Sea and Land. The surface of the Sea would shew at a distance more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure than that of the Earth.</note> like as the surface of our Globe is distinguished into two
principal parts, namely, into the Terrestrial and Aquatick: so in
the Lunar surface we discern a great distinction of some great fields
more resplendant, and some less: whose aspect makes me believe,
that that of the Earth would seem very like it, beheld by any one
from the Moon, or any other the like distance, to be illuminated
by the Sun: and the surface of the sea would appear more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure,
and that of the Earth more bright. Fifthly, like as we from
the Earth behold the Moon, one while all illuminated, another
while half;<note place="margin">Fiftly, Muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of figures in the Earth, like to those of the Moon, and made with the same periods.</note> sometimes more, sometimes less; sometimes horned,
sometimes wholly invisibly; namely, when its just under the Sun
beams; so that the parts which look towards the Earth are dark:
Thus in every respect, one standing in the Moon would see the
illumination of the Earths surface by the Sun, with the same
periods to an hair, and under the same changes of figures.

                        <p>Stay a little, <hi>Salviatus;</hi> That the illumination of
the Earth, as to the several figures, would represent it self to a person
placed in the Moon, like in all things to that which we discover in
the Moon, I understand very well, but yet I cannot conceive how
it shall appear to be done in the same period; seeing that that
which the Suns illumination doth in the Lunar superficies in a
month, it doth in the Terrestrial in twenty four hours.</p>

                        <p>Its true, the effect of the Sun about the illuminating
these two bodies, and replenishing with its splendor their whole
surfaces, is dispatch'd in the Earth in a Natural day, and in the
Moon in a Month; but the variation of the figures in which the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:96976:35"/>
illuminated parts of the Terrestrial superficies appear beheld from
the Moon, depends not on this alone, but on the divers aspects
which the Moon is still changing with the Sun; so that, if for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
the Moon punctually followed the motion of the Sun, and
stood, for example, always in a direct line between it and the
Earth, in that aspect which we call Conjunction, it looking always
to the same Hemisphere of the Earth which the Sun looks unto,
she would behold the same all light: as on the contrary, if it should
always stay in Opposition to the Sun, it would never behold the
Earth, of which the dark part would be continually turn'd towards
the Moon, and therefore invisible. But when the Moon is in
Quadrature of the Sun, that half of the Terrestrial Hemisphere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to the sight of the Moon which is towards the Sun, is lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous;
and the other towards the contrary is obscure: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the illuminated part of the Earth would represent it self to the
Moon in a semi-circular figure.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SAGR.</speaker>
                        <p>I clearly perceive all this, and understand very well,
that the Moon departing from its Opposition to the Sun, where it
saw no part of the illumination of the Terrestrial superficies, and
approaching day by day nearer the Sun, she begins by little and
little to discover some part of the face of the illuminated Earth;
and that which appeareth of it shall resemble a thin sickle, in regard
the figure of the Earth is round: and the Moon thus acquiring by
its motion day by day greater proximity to the Sun, successively
discovers more and more of the Terrestrial Hemisphere enlightned,
so that at the Quadrature there is just half of it visible, insomuch
that we may see the other part of her: continuing next to proceed
towards the Conjunction, it successively discovers more and more
of its surface to be illuminated, and in fine, at the time of Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
seeth the whole Hemisphere enlightned. And in short, I
very well conceive, that what befalls the Inhabitants of the Earth,
in beholding the changes of the Moon, would happen to him that
from the Moon should observe the Earth; but in a contrary order,
namely, that when the Moon is to us at her full, and in Opposition
to the Sun, then the Earth would be in Conjunction with the Sun,
and wholly obscure and invisible; on the contrary, that position
which is to us a Conjunction of the Moon with the Sun, and for
that cause a Moon silent and unseen, would be there an Opposition
of the Earth to the Sun, and, to so speak, <hi>Full Earth,</hi> to wit, all
enlightned. And lastly, look what part of the Lunar surface ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to us from time to time illuminated, so much of the Earth
in the same time shall you behold from the Moon to be obscured:
and look how much of the Moon is to us deprived of light, so much
of the Earth is to the Moon illuminated. In one thing yet these
mutual operations in my judgment seem to differ, and it is, that it
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:96976:35"/>
being supposed, and not granted, that some one being placed in the
Moon to observe the Earth, he would every day see the whole
Terrestrial superficies, by means of the Moons going about the
Earth in twenty four or twenty five hours; but we never see but
half of the Moon, since it revolves not in it self, as it must do to
be seen in every part of it.</p>

                        <p>So that this, befals not contrarily, namely, that her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving
in her self, is the cause that we see not the other half of
her, for so it would be necessary it should be, if she had the Epicy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.

no more than half<note place="margin">All the Earth seeth half onely of the Moon, &amp; the half onely of the Moon seeth all the Earth.</note> the Moon, whereas from the Moon one may see
all the Earth; and on the contrary, all the Earth seeth the Moon, and
but onely half of it seeth the Earth? For the inhabitants, to so speak,
of the superior Hemisphere of the Moon, which is to us invisible,
are deprived of the sight of the Earth: and these haply are the
<hi>Anti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>thones.</hi> But here I remember a particular accident, newly
observed by our <hi>Academian,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">From the Earth we see more than half the Lunar Globe.</note> in the Moon, from whch are gathered
two necessary consequences; one is, that we see somewhat more
than half of the Moon; and the other is, that the motion of the
Moon hath exact concentricity with the Earth: and thus he finds
the <hi>Phoenomenon</hi> and observation. When the Moon hath a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
and natural sympathy with the Earth, towards which
it hath its aspect in such a determinate part, it is necessary that the
right line which conjoyns their centers, do passe ever by the same
point of the Moons superficies; so that, who so shall from the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Earth behold the same, shall alwayes see the same
<hi>Discus</hi> or Face of the Moon punctually determined by one and
the same circumference; But if a man be placed upon the Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial
surface, the ray which from his eye passeth to the centre of the
Lunar Globe, will not pass by the same point of its superficies, by
which the line passeth that is drawn from the centre of the Earth
to that of the Moon, save onely when it is vertical to him: but
the Moon being placed in the East, or in the West, the point of
incidence of the visual ray, is higher than that of the line which
conjoyns the centres; and therefore the observer may discern
some part of the Lunar Hemisphere towards the upper circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and alike part of the other is invisible: they are discerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and undiscernable, in respect of the Hemisphere beheld from
the true centre of the Earth: and because the part of the Moons
circumference, which is superiour in its rising, is nethermost in its
setting; therefore the difference of the said superiour and inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:96976:36"/>
our parts must needs be very observable; certain spots and other
notable things in those parts, being one while discernable, and
another while not. A like variation may also be observed towards
the North and South extremities of the same <hi>Discus</hi> (or Surface)
according as the Moons position is in its greatest North or South
Latitude; For, if it be North, some of its parts towards the
North are hid, and some of those parts towards the South are
discovered, and so on the contrary. Now that these consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are really true,<note place="margin">Two spots in the Moon, by which it is perceived that she hath respect to the centre of the Earth in her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> is verified by the <hi>Telescope,</hi> for there be in
the Moon two remarkable spots, one of which, when the Moon
is in the meridian, is situate to the Northwest, and the other is
almost diametrically opposite unto it; and the first of these is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
even without the <hi>Telescope;</hi> but the other is not. That to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Northwest is a reasonable great spot of oval figure, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from the other great ones; the opposite one is lesse, and
also severed from the biggest, and situate in a very cleer field; in
both these we may manifestly discern the foresaid variations, and
see them one after another; now neer the edge or limb of the
Lunar <hi>Discus,</hi> and anon remote, with so great difference that
the distance betwixt the Northwest and the circumference of the
<hi>Discus</hi> is more than twice as great at one time, as at the other;
and as to the second spot (because it is neerer to the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence)
such mutation importeth more, than twice so much in the
former. Hence its manifest, that the Moon, as if it were drawn
by a magnetick vertue, constantly beholds the Terrestrial Globe
with one and the same aspect, never deviating from the same.</p>

But returning to our first discourse,<note place="margin">Sixthly, The Earth and Moon interchangeably do illuminate.</note> I say for the sixth resemblance
betwixt the Moon and Earth, that as the Moon for a great part
of time, supplies the want of the Suns light, and makes the
nights, by the reflection of its own, reasonable clear; so the
Earth, in recompence, affordeth it when it stands in most need,
by reflecting the Solar rayes, a very cleer illumination, and so
much, in my opinion, greater than that which cometh from her to
us, by how much the superficies of the Earth is greater than that
of the Moon.</p>

the cause of an accident, which I have a thousand times thought
upon,<note place="margin">Light reflected from the Earth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Moon.</note> but could never find out. You would say, that the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
light which is seen in the Moon, especially when it is horned,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:96976:36"/>
comes from the reflection of the light of the Sun on the Supersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of the Earth and Sea; and that light is more clear, by how
much the horns are lesse, for then the luminous part of the Earth,
beheld by the Moon, is greater, according to that which was
a little before proved; to wit, that the luminous part of the Earth,
exposed to the Moon, is alway as great as the obscure part of
the Moon, that is visible to the Earth; whereupon, at such time
as the Moon is sharp-forked, and consequently its tenebrous part
great, great also is the illuminated part of the Earth beheld from
the Moon, and its reflection of light so much the more potent.</p>

In a word, it is a great pleasure to speak with persons judicious

that which remains.<note place="margin">Seventhly, The Earth and Moon do mutually eclipse.</note> For a seventh conformity, take their reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal
responsion as well to injuries, as favours; whereby the

light, and eclipsed, doth by way of revenge, in like manner, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose

                        <p>Amongst the resemblances by you recited, in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
you make betwixt the Earth and Moon, I find that I can
admit none confidently save onely the first, and two others; I
grant the first, namely, the spherical figure; howbeit, even in
this there is some kind of difference, for that I hold that of the
Moon to be very smooth and even, as a looking-glasse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
we find and feel this of the Earth to be extraordinary montu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and rugged; but this belonging to the inequality of superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
it shall be anon considered, in another of those Resemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
by you alledged; I shall therefore reserve what I have to say
thereof, till I come to the consideration of that. Of what you
affirm next, that the Moon seemeth, as you say in your second
Resemblance, opacous and obscure in its self, like the Earth; I
admit not any more than the first attribute of opacity, of which
the Eclipses of the Sun assure me. For were the Moon transpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
the air in the total obscuration of the Sun, would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
so duskish, as at such a time it is, but by means of the
transparency of the body of the Moon, a refracted light would
passe through it, as we see it doth through the thickest clouds. But
as to the obscurity, I believe not that the Moon is wholly depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of light, as the Earth; nay, that clarity which is seen in the
remainder ot its <hi>Discus,</hi> over and the above the small crescent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened

and not a reflection of the Earth,<note place="margin">The second clarity of the Moon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed to be its native light.</note> which I esteem unable, by

                        <p>The question which you have so casually started, is one
of the most difficulty that is disputed in Philosophy; and I have
on that subject most excellent conceits of a very learned Doctor
of <hi>Padoua,</hi> but it is not now time to enter upon them. Therefore
returning to our purpose, I say that the Moon, in my opinion, is
much more solid than the Earth, but do not infer the same, as you
do,<note place="margin">The superficies of the Moon more sleek than any Looking-glass.</note> from the cragginess and montuousity of its superficies; but
rather from the contrary, namely, from its aptitude to receive (as
we see it experimented in the hardest stones) a polish and lustre
exceeding that of the smoothest glass, for such necessarily must
its superficies be, to render it apt to make so lively reflection of
the Suns rays. And for those appearances which you mention,
of Mountains, Cliffs, Hills, Valleys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are all illusions:
and I have been present at certain publick disputes, where I have
heard it strongly maintained against these introducers of novelties,<note place="margin">The eminencies and cavities in the Moon are illusions of its opacous and perspicuous parts.</note>
that such appearances proceed from nothing else, but from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal
distribution of the opacous and perspicuous parts, of which
the Moon is inwardly and outwardly composed: as we see it
often fall out in chrystal, amber, and many other precious stones
of perfect lustre; in which by reason of the opacity of some parts,
and the transparency of others, there doth appear several conca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities
and prominencies. In the fourth resemblance, I grant, that
the superficies of Terrestrial Globe beheld from afar, would make
two different appearances, namely, one more clear, the other more
dark; but I believe that such diversity would succeed quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to what you say; that is, I hold that the surface of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
would appear lucid, because that it is smooth and transparent;
and that of the Earth would appear obscure, by reason of its o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
and scabrosity, ill accommodated for reflecting the light of
the Sun. Concerning the fifth comparison, I grant it wholly, and
am able, in case the Earth did shine as the Moon, to show the
same to any one that should from thence above behold it, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:96976:38"/>
by figures answerable to those which we see in the Moon:
I comprehend also, how the period of its illumination and varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of figure, would be monthly, albeit the Sun revolves round
about it in twenty four hours: and lastly, I do not scruple to
admit, that the half onely of the Moon seeth all the Earth, and
that all the Earth seeth but onely half of the Moon. For what
remains, I repute it most false, that the Moon can receive light
from the Earth, which is most obscure, opacous, and utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt
to reflect the Suns light, as the Moon doth reflect it to us: and
as I have said, I hold that that light which we see in the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Moons face (the splendid crescents subducted) by the
illumination, is the proper and natural light of the Moon, and no
easie matter would induce me to believe otherwise. The seventh,
touching the mutual Eclipses, may be also admitted; howbeit
that is wont to be called the eclipse of the Sun, which you are
pleased to phrase the eclipse of the Earth. And this is what I
have at this time to say in opposition to your seven congruities
or resemblances, to which objections, if you are minded to make
any reply, I shall willingly hear you.</p>

seems to me, that there still remains in controversie between us, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
conditions, which I made common betwixt the Moon &amp; Earth,
and they are these; You esteem the Moon to be smooth and polisht,
as a Looking-glass, and as such, able to reflect the Suns light; and
contrarily, the Earth, by reason of its montuosity, unable to make
such reflection: You yield the Moon to be solid and hard, and that
you argue from its being smooth and polite, and not from its being
montuous; and for its appearing montuous, you assign as the
cause, that it consists of parts more and less opacous and perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous.
And lastly, you esteem that secondary light, to be proper
to the Moon, and not reflected from the Earth; howbeit you
seem not to deny the sea, as being of a smooth surface, some
kind of reflection. As to the convincing you of that error, that
the reflection of the Moon is made, as it were, like that of a
Looking-glass, <hi>I</hi> have small hope, whilst <hi>I</hi> see, that what hath
been read in the<note n="*" place="margin">Il Saggiatore, <hi>&amp;</hi> Lettere Solari, <hi>two Treatises of</hi> Galilaeus.</note>

                           <hi>I</hi> have perused the same so superficially, according to

and those which I have sometime read in the fore-said
Books, by which I well remember, that I was then perfectly
satisfied, although the conclusions, at first sight seem'd unto me
strange Paradoxes. We enquire <hi>Simplicius,</hi> whether to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a reflection of light, like that which we receive from the
Moon, it be necessary that the superficies from whence the refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
commeth, be so smooth and polite, as the face of a Looking-Glasse,
or whether a superficies not smooth or polisht, but rough
and uneven, be more apt for such a purpose. Now supposing
two reflections should come unto us, one more bright, the other
lesse, from two superficies opposite unto us, I demand of you,
which of the two superficies you think would represent it self to
our sight, to be the clearest, and which the obscurest.</p>

Now hang the glasse yonder, against that same Wall, on which

See yonder two superficies beaten by the Sun, namely, the Wall

                        <p>Why look you, there it is upon the opposite Wall, just

                        <p>Look on it your self, for I have no mind at this time,
to dazle my eyes; and I know very well, without seeing it,
that it there appears as splendid and bright as the Sun it self, or
little lesse.</p>

                        <p>What say you therefore, is the reflection of a Glasse
lesse powerful than that of a Wall? I see, that in this opposite
Wall, where the reflection of the other illuminated Wall comes,
together with that of the Glasse, this of the Glasse is much
clearer; and I see likewise, that, from this place where I stand,
the glasse it self appears with much more lustre than the Wall.</p>

                        <p>You have prevented me with your subtlety; for I stood
in need of this very observation to demonstrate what remains.
You see then the difference which happens betwixt the two refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
made by the two superficies of the Wall and Glasse, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>t
in the self-same manner, by the rayes of the Sun; and you
see, how the reflection which comes from the Wall, diffuseth it
self towards all the parts opposite to it, but that of the Glasse
goeth towards one part onely, not at all bigger than the Glasse
it self: you see likewise, how the superficies of the Wall, beheld
from what part soever, alwayes shews it self of one and the same
cleernesse, and every way, much clearer than that of the Glasse,
excepting only in that little place, on which the Glasses reflection
reverberates, for from thence indeed the Glasse appears much more
lucid than the Wall. By these so sensible, and palpable experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
my thinks one may soon come to know, whether the
reflection which the Moon sends upon us, proceed as from a
Glasse, or else, as from a Wall, that is, from a smooth superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
or a rugged.</p>

                        <p>If I were in the Moon it self, I think I could not with
my hands more plainly feel the unevennesse of its superficies, than
I do now perceive it, by apprehending your discourse. The Moon
beheld in any posture, in respect of the Sun and us, sheweth us
its superficies, touch't by the Suns rayes, alwayes equally clear;
an effect, which answers to an hair that of the Wall, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
from what place soever, appeareth equally bright, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
from the Glasse, which from one place onely appeareth lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid,
and from all others obscure. Moreover, the light which
cometh to me from the reflection of the Wall, is tollerable,
and weak, in comparison of that of the Glasse, which is little
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:96976:39"/>
lesse forcible and offensive to the sight, than that primary and
direct light of the Sun. And thus without trouble do we behold
the face of the Moon; which were it as a Glasse, it appearing to
us by reason of its vicinity, as big as the Sun it self, its splendor
would be absolutely intollerable, and would seem as if we beheld
another Sun.</p>

than it produceth. I will oppose you with an instance,
which I see not well how you can easily resolve. You insist upon it
as a grand difference between the Moon and Glasse, that it emits
its reflection towards all parts equally, as doth the Wall; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Glasse casts it upon one onely determinate place; and from
hence you conclude the Moon to be like to the Wall, and not to
the Glasse:<note place="margin">Flat Looking-glasses cast forth the reflection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards but one place, but the spherical every way.</note> But I must tell you, that that same Glasse casts its
reflection on one place onely, because its surface is flat, and the
reflex rayes being to depart at angles equal to those of the rayes
of incidence, it must follow that from a plane or flat superficies,
they do depart unitedly towards the same place; but in regard
that the superficies of the Moon is not plain, but spherical, and
the incident rayes upon such a superficies, being to reflect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
at angles equal to those of the incidence towards all parts,
by means of the infinity of the inclinations which compose the
spherical superficies, therefore the Moon may send forth its reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
every way; and there is no necessity for its repercussion upon one
place onely, as that Glasse which is flat.</p>

                        <p>And here also I believe, that you very much deceive your
felf. But I come to the first objection moved by <hi>Salviatus;</hi> and
I consider, that to make a body appear unto us luminous, it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth
not that the rayes of the illuminating body fall upon it,
but it is moreover requisite that the reflex rayes arrive to our
eye; as is manifestly seen in the example of that Glasse, upon
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:96976:40"/>
which, without question, the illuminating rayes of the Sun do
come; yet neverthelesse, it appears not to us bright and shining,
unlesse we set our eye in that particular place, where the refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
arriveth. Now let us consider what would succeed, were
the glasse of a spherical figure; for without doubt, we should
find, that of the reflection made by the whole surface illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that to be but a very small part, which arriveth to the eye
of a particular beholder; by reason that that is but an incoside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
particle of the whole spherical superficies, the inclination
of which casts the ray to the particular place of the eye; whence
the part of the spherical superficies, which shews it self shining
to the eye, must needs be very small; all the rest being repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
obscure. So that were the Moon smooth, as a Looking-glasse,
<note place="margin">The Moon if it were smooth, like a spherical glasse, would be invisible.</note> a very small part would be seen by any particular eye to
be illustrated by the Sun, although its whole Hemisphere were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to the Suns rayes; and the rest would appear to the eye of
the beholder as not illuminated, and therefore invisible; and
finally, the whole Moon would be likewise invisible, for so much
as that particle, whence the reflection should come, by reason of
its smalnesse and remotenesse, would be lost. And as it would be
invisible to the eye, so would it not afford any light; for it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
impossible, that a bright body should take away our
darknesse by its splendor, and we not to see it.</p>

he is not either very apprehensive of, or satisfied with this which
you, with admirable proof, and absolute truth have spoken.
And yet I now call to mind, that I can by another experiment
remove all scruple. I have seen above in a Chamber, a great
spherical Looking-glasse; let us send for it hither, and whilest it
is in bringing, let <hi>Simplicius</hi> return to consider, how great the
clarity is which cometh to the Wall here, under the penthouse,
from the reflection of the flat glasse.</p>

                        <p>I will deliver you my thoughts thereof, but I cannot
tell how you may be pleas'd therewith. And first, that lively
splendor which you see upon the glass, and which you think occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieth
a good part thereof, is nothing near so great, nay is very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
small; but its liveliness occasioneth in your eye, (by means
of the reflection made on the humidity of the extream parts of the
eye-brows, which distendeth upon the pupil) an adventitious irradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
like to that blaze which we think we see about the flame of
a candle placed at some distance; or if you will, you may
resemble it to the adventitious splendor of a star;<note place="margin">The small body of the stars fringed round about with rays, appeareth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much bigger than plain and naked, and in its native clarity</note> for if you should
compare the small body <hi>v. g.</hi> of the <hi>Canicula,</hi> seen in the day time
with the <hi>Telescope,</hi> when it is seen without such irradiation, with
the same seen by night by the eye it self, you will doubtless com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
that being irradiated, it appeareth above a thousand
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:96976:41"/>
times bigger than the naked and real body: and a like or greater
augmentation doth the image of the Sun make, which you see in
that glass. I say greater, for that it is more lively than the star,
as is manifest from our being able to behold the star with much
less offence, than this reflection of the glass. The reverberation
therefore which is to dispere it self all over this wall, cometh from
a small part of that glass, and that which even now came from
the whole flat glass dispersed and restrain'd it self to a very small
part of the said wall. What wonder is it then, that the first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
very lively illuminates, and that this other is almost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible?</p>

                        <p>I find my self more perplexed than ever, and there
presents it self unto me the other difficulty, how it can be that
that wall, being of a matter so obscure, and of a superficies so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polish'd,
should be able to dart from it greater light, than a glass
very smooth and polite.</p>

                        <p>Greater light it is not, but more universal; for as to
the degree of brightness, you see that the reflection of that small
flat glass, where it beamed forth yonder under the shadow of the
penthouse, illuminateth very much; and the rest of the wall which
receiveth the reflection of the wall on which the glass is placed,
is not in any great measure illuminated, as was the small part on
which the reflection of the glass fell. And if you would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the whole of this business, you must consider that the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies
of that wall's being rough,<note place="margin">The reflex light of uneven bodies, is more universal than that of the smooth, &amp; why.</note> is the same as if it were compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of innumerable small superficies, disposed according to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
diversities of inclinations: amongst which it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
happens, that there are many disposed to send forth their
reflex rays from them into such a place, many others into another:
and in sum, there is not any place to which there comes not very
many rays, reflected from very many small superficies, dispersed
throughout the whole superficies of the rugged body, upon which
the rays of the Sun fall. From which it necessarily follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
That upon any, whatsoever, part of any superficies,
opposed to that which receiveth the primary incident rays,
there is produced reflex rays, and consequently illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
There doth also follow thereupon, That the same
body upon which the illuminating rays fall, beheld from
whatsoever place, appeareth all illuminated and shining: and
therefore the Moon, as being of a superficies rugged and

                        <p>Ingenuously confessing my dullness of apprehension,
I must tell you, that I understand not any thing of this your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
save onely what concerns the gilt plate: and if you permit
me to speak freely, I have a great conceit that you also understand
not the same, but have learnt by heart those words written by some
one out of a desire of contradiction, and to shew himself more intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
than his adversary; but it must be to those, which to appear
also more wise, applaud that which they do not understand, and
entertain a greater conceit of persons, the less they are by them
understood: and the writer himself may be one of those (of which
there are many) who write what they do not understand,<note place="margin">Some write what they understand not, and therefore understand not what they write.</note> and
consequently understand not what they write. Therefore, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
the rest, I reply, as to the gilt plate, that if it be flat and
not very big, it may appear at a distance very bright, whilst a great
light beameth upon it, but yet it must be when the eye is in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
line, namely in that of the reflex rays: and it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
the more shining, if it were <hi>v. g.</hi> of silver, by means of its
being burnished, and apt through the great density of the metal,
to receive a perfect polish. And though its superficies, being very
well brightned, were not exactly plain, but should have various in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
yet then also would its splendor be seen many ways;
namely, from as many places as the various reflections, made by
the several superficies,<note place="margin">Diamonds ground to divers sides, &amp; why.</note> do reach: for therefore are Diamonds
ground to many sides, that so their pleasing lustre might be beheld
from many places. But if the Plate were very big, though it should
be all plain, yet would it not at a distance appear all over shining:
and the better to express my self, Let us suppose a very large gilt
plate exposed to the Sun, it will shew to an eye far distant, the
image of the Sun, to occupy no more but a certain part of the said
plate; to wit, that from whence the reflection of the incident
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:96976:42"/>
solar rays come: but it is true that by the vivacity of the light, the
said image will appear fringed about with many rays, and so will
seem to occupie a far greater part of the plate, than really it doth.
And to shew that this is true, when you have noted the particular
place of the plate from whence the reflection cometh, and concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
likewise how great the shining place appeared to you, cover the
greater part of that same space, leaving it only visible about the
midst; and all this shall not any whit diminish the apparent splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
to one that beholds it from afar; but you shall see it largely
dispers'd upon the cloth or other matter, wherewith you covered
it. If therefore any one, by seeing from a good distance a small
gilt plate to be all over shining, should imagine that the same
would also even in a plate as broad as the Moon, he is no less de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
than if he should believe the Moon to be no bigger than
the bottom of a tub. If again the plate were turn'd into a sphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
superficies, the reflection would be seen strong in but one sole
particle of it; but yet by reason of its liveliness, it will appear
fringed about with many glittering rays: the rest of the Ball would
appear according as it was burnished;<note place="margin">Silver <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

do not reflect any image; but if they be in any part burnish'd, they
become in that place presently obscure: and in them one may see the
representation of any thing as in Looking-glasses. And that chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
obscurity, proceeds from nothing else but the smoothing and
plaining of a fine grain, which made the superficies of the silver
rough, and yet such, as that it reflected the light into all parts,
whereby it seemed from all parts equally illuminated: which
small unevennesses, when they come to be exquisitely plained by
the burnish, so that the reflection of the rays of incidence are all
directed unto one determinate place; then, from that same place,
the burnish'd part shall shew much more bright and shining than
the rest which is onely whitened by boyling; but from all other
places it looks very obscure. And note, that the diversity of

strong, as it doth being mountainous, and in sum, full of
eminencies and great cavities. But these Philosophers will never
yield it to be lesse polite than a glasse; but far more, if more it
can be imagined; for they esteeming that to perfect bodies perfect
figures are most sutable; it is necessary, that the sphericity of those
Coelestial Globes be most exact; besides, that if they should
grant me some inequality, though never so small, I would not
scruple to take any other greater; for that such perfection consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

that the same superficies happen to be by the same light more or less

upon the other: and exposing both these parts to the reflection of
the light of that opposite Wall, you see how this side which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
the rayes obliquely, is lesse shining than this other, where
the reflection fals at right angles; and observe, that as I by

which being of a spherical figure, if its superficies were smooth, as
this paper, the parts of its hemisphere illuminated by the Sun,
which are towards its extremity, would receive much less light,
than the middle parts; the rays falling upon them most obliquely,
and upon these at right angles; whereupon at the time of full
Moon, when we see almost its whole Hemisphere illuminated, the
parts towards the midst, would shew themselves to us with more
splendor, than those others towards the circumference: which is
not so in effect. Now the face of the Moon being represented
to me full of indifferent high mountains, do not you see how their
tops and continuate ridges, being elevated above the convexity of
the perfect spherical superficies, come to be exposed to the view
of the Sun, and accommodated to receive its rays much less ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely,

it is also true, that betwixt those mountains all the valleys would
become obscure, by reason of the vast shadows, which in that
time would be cast from the mountains, whereas the parts towards
the middle, though full of valleys and hills, by reason they have
the Sun elevated, would appear without shadow, and therefore
more lucid by far than the extreme parts, which are no less diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

                        <p>But when the Moon is opposite to the Sun, what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is there between the tract of the rayes of your sight, and
that motion which the Suns rayes make?</p>

                        <p>Now I understand you; for you would say, that the
rayes of the sight and those of the Sun, moving by the same lines,
we cannot perceive any of the obscure valleys of the Moon. Be
pleased to change this your opinion, that I have either simulation
or dissimulation in me; for I protest unto you, as I am a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
that I did not guesse at this solution, nor should I have
thought upon it, without your help, or without long study.</p>

                        <p>The resolutions, which between you two have been
alledged touching this last doubt, hath, to speak the truth, satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me also. But at the same time this consideration of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
rayes accompanying the rayes of the Sun, hath begotten in me
another scruple, about the other part, but I know not whether I
can expresse it right, or no: for it but just now comming into my
mind, I have not yet methodized it to my mind: but let us see if
we can, all together, make it intelligible. There is no question,
but that the parts towards the circumference of that polish't, but not
burnish't Hemisphere, which is illuminated by the Sun, receiving the
rayes obliquely, receive much fewer thereof, than the middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
parts, which receive them directly. And its possible, that a
tract or space of <hi>v. g.</hi> twenty degrees in breadth, and which is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the extremity of the Hemisphere, may not receive more rays
than another towards the middle parts, of but four degree broad:
so that that doubtless will be much more obscure than this; and
such it will appear to whoever shall behold them both in the face,
or (as I may say) in their full magnitude. But if the eye of the
beholder were constituted in such a place, that the breadth of the
twenty degrees of the obscure space, appeared not to it longer
than one of four degrees, placed in the midst of the Hemisphere,
I hold it not impossible for it to appear to the said beholder e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
clear and lucid with the other; because, finally, between
two equal angles, to wit, of four degrees apiece, there come to
the eye the reflections of two equal numbers of rayes: namely,
those which are reflected from the middlemost space, four degrees
in breadth, and those reflected from the other of twenty degrees,
but seen by compression, under the quantity of four degrees: and
such a situation shall the eye obtain, when it is placed between the
said Hemisphere, and the body which illuminates it; for then the
sight and rayes move in the same lines. It seemeth not impossible
therefore, but that the Moon may be of a very equal superficies;
and that neverthelesse, it may appear when it is at the full, no less
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:96976:44"/>
light in the extremities, than in the middle parts.</p>

                        <p>The doubt is ingenious and worthy of consideration;
and as it but just now came into your mind unawares, so I will
like wise answer with what first comes into my thoughts, and it may
happily fall out, that by thinking more upon it, I may stumble
upon a better reply. But before, that I labyrinth my self any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it would be necessary, that we assure our selves by some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,
whether your objection prove in effect, what it seemeth
to conclude in appearance; and therefore taking once more the
same paper, and making it to incline, by bending a little part
thereof upon the remainder, let us try whether exposing it to the
Sun, so that the rayes of light fall upon the lesser part directly,
and upon the other obliquely; this which receiveth the rayes direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appeareth more lucid; and see here by manifest experience,
that it is notably more clear. Now if your objection be conclusive,
it will follow, that stooping with our eye so, that in beholding
the other greater part, less illuminated, in compression or fore-shortning,
it appear unto us no bigger than the other, more shining;
and that consequently, it be not beheld at a greater angle than
that; it will necessarily ensue, I say, that its light be encreased, so
that it do seem to us as bright as the other. See how I behold, and
look upon it so obliquely, that it appeareth to me narrower than
the other; but yet, notwithstanding its obscurity, doth not to
my perceiving, at all grow clearer. Try now if the same succeed
to you.</p>

                        <p>I have look't upon it, and though I have stooped with

                        <p>We are hitherto confident of the invalidity of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection;
In the next place, as to the solution, I believe, that, by
reason the Superficies of this paper is little lesse than smooth, the
rayes are very few, which be reflected towards the point of inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
in comparison of the multitude, which are reflected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the opposite parts; and that of those few more and more
are lost, the nearer the visive rayes approach to those lucid rayes
of incidence; and because it is not the incident rayes, but those
which are reflected to the eye, that make the object appear lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous;
therefore, in stooping the eye, there is more lost than got,
as you your self confesse to have seen in looking upon the obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
part of the paper.</p>

                        <p>This is most certain, but yet it doth not of corruptible
become incorruptible, but still remains corruptible, though of a
much longer duration.<note place="margin">Corruptibility ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of more or lesse; so doth not incorruptibili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is capable of being more or lesse such, and we may
properly say this is lesse corruptible than that; as for example, the
<hi>Jasper,</hi> than the <hi>Pietra Sirena;</hi> but incorruptibility admits not
of more, or lesse, so as that it may be said this is more incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
than that,<note place="margin">The perfection of figure, operateth in corruptible bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but not in the eternal.</note> if both be incorruptible and eternal. The diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of figure therefore cannot operate: save onely in matters ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of more or lesse duration; but in the eternal, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be other than equally eternal, the operation of figure ceaseth.
And therefore, since the Coelestial matter is not incorruptible by
figure, but otherwayes no man needs to be so solicitous for this
perfect sphericity; for if the matter be incorruptible, let it have
what figure it will, it shall be alwayes such.</p>

                        <p>But I am considering another thing,<note place="margin">If the spherical fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure conferreth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, all bodies would be eternal.</note> and say, that if
we should grant the spherical figure a faculty of conferring incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptibility,
all bodies of whatsoever figure, would be incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
forasmuch as if the rotund body be incorruptible, corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
would then subsist in those parts which alter the perfect ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tundity;
as for instance, there is in a <hi>Die</hi> a body perfectly round,
and, as such, incorruptible; therefore it remaineth that those an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
be corruptible which cover and hide the rotundity; so that
the most that could happen, would be, that those angles, and
(to so speak) excrescencies, would corrupt. But if we proceed to a
more inward consideration, that in those parts also towards the
angles, there are comprised other lesser bals of the same matter;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:96976:45"/>
and therefore they also, as being round, must be also incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible;
and likewise in the remainders, which environ these eight
lesser Spheres, a man may understand that there are others: so
that in the end, resolving the whole <hi>Die</hi> into innumerable balls,
it must necessarily be granted incorruptible. And the same dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
and resolution may be made in all other figures.</p>

                        <p>Your method in making the conclusion, for if <hi>v. g.</hi> a
round Chrystal were, by reason of its figure, incorruptible; namely,
received from thence a faculy of resisting all internal and external
alterations, we should not find, that the joyning to it other Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stal,
and reducing it <hi>v. g.</hi> into a Cube, would any whit alter it
within, or without; so as that it would thereupon become lesse
apt to resist the new ambient, made of the same matter, than it
was to resist the other, of a matter different; and especially, if
it be true, that corruption is generated by contraries, as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
saith; and with what can you enclose that ball of Crystal,
that is lesse contrary to it, than Crystal it self? But we are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware

my self of a matter much more commodious for the representing
such effects; which is such, that I verily believe, that that Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
would give any price for it; and it is the mother of Pearl, which
is wrought into divers figures, and though it be brought to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
evennesse, yet it seemeth to the eye in several parts, so vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously

                        <p>This invention is truly ingenious; and that which hath
not been done already, may be done in time to come; and if
there have been produced other Jems, and Crystals, which have
nothing to do with the illusions of the mother of Pearl, these may
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:96976:45"/>
be produced also; in the mean time, that I may not prevent any
one, I will suppresse the answer which might be given, and onely
for this time betake my self to satisfie the objections brought by
<hi>Simplicius.</hi> I say therefore, that this reason of yours is too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and as you apply it not to all the appearances one by one;
which are seen in the Moon, and for which my self and others
are induced to hold it mountainous, I believe you will not find
any one that will be satisfied with such a doctrine; nor can I think,
that either you, or the Author himself, find in it any greater
quietude,<note place="margin">The apparent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evennesses of the Moon cannot be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitated by way of more and less opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city &amp; perspicuity.</note> than in any other thing wide from the purpose. Of the
very many several appearances which are seen night by night in
the course of Moon, you cannot imitate so much as one, by making
a Ball at your choice, more or less opacous and perspicuous, and
that is of a polite superficies;<note place="margin">The various a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects of the Moon, imitable with any opacous matter.</note> whereas on the contrary, one may
make Balls of any solid matter whatsoever, that is not transparent,
which onely with eminencies and cavities, and by receiving the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination
several ways, shall represent the same appearances and
mutations to an hair,<note place="margin">Various appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from which the Moons montuosity is argued.</note> which from hour to hour are discovered in
the Moon. In them you shall see the ledges of Hills exposed to
the Suns light, to be very shining, and after them the projections
of their shadows very obscure; you shall see them greater and less,
according as the said eminencies shall be more or less distant from
the confines which distinguish the parts of the Moon illuminated,
from the obscure: you shall see the same term and confine, not
equally distended, as it would be if the Ball were polish'd, but
craggie and rugged. You shall see beyond the same term, in the
dark parts of the Moon many bright prominencies, and distinct
from the rest of the illuminations: you shall see the shadows a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid,
according as the illumination gradually riseth, to demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
by degrees, till they wholly disappear; nor are there any of
them to be seen when the whole Hemisphere is enlightned. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
on the contrary, in the lights passage towards the other He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misphere
of the Moon, you shall again observe the same eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
that were marked, and you shall see the projections of their
shadows to be made a contrary way, and to decrease by degrees:
of which things, once more I say, you cannot shew me so much as
one in yours that are opacous and perspicuous.</p>

the Moon resembleth that pillar of Clouds and pillar of Fire,
which guided the <hi>Israelites;</hi> which at the presence of the Sun,
appeared like a Cloud, but in the night was very glorious. Thus
I have by day observed the Moon amidst certain small Clouds,<note place="margin">The Moon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held in the day time, is like to a little cloud.</note>

we behold it in the dark mantle of Heaven; and in the day

it for granted that I have answered you already, and said, that it

dead of night. And this is the cause, <hi>Simplicius,</hi> which makes
you believe that the Earth doth not shine like the Moon; but if
you could see the Earth illuminated, whilst you were in some dark
place, like our night, you would see it shine brighter than the
Moon. Now if you desire that the comparison may proceed
well, you must compare the light of the Earth, with that of the
Moon seen in the day time, and not with the same by night: for
it is not in our power to see the Earth illuminated, save onely in
the day. Is it not so?</p>

                        <p>And forasmuch as you your self have already confessed
to have seen the Moon by day among some little white Clouds,
and very nearly, as to its aspect, resembling one of them; you did
thereby grant,<note place="margin">Clouds are no less apt than the Moon to be illuminated by the Sun.</note> that those Clouds, which yet are Elementary
matters, are as apt to receive illumination, as the Moon, yea
more, if you will but call to mind that you have sometimes seen
some Clouds of vast greatness, and as perfect white as the Snow;
and there is no question, but that if such a Cloud could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
so luminous in the deep of night, it would illuminate the
places near about it, more than an hundred Moons. If therefore
we were assured that the Earth is illuminated by the Sun, like one
of those Clouds, it would be undubitable, but that it would be no
less shining than the Moon. But of this there is no question to
be made, in regard we see those very Clouds in the absence of
the Sun, to remain by night, as obscure as the Earth: and that
which is more, there is not any one of us, but hath seen many
times some such Clouds low, and far off, and questioned whether
they were Clouds or Mountains: an evident sign that the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
are no less luminous than those Clouds.<note place="margin">A wall illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Sun, compared to the Moon shineth no less than it.</note>

assured you thereof: for I taught you not that the Moon shews
lighter by night than by day, but you understood it of your self;

the Moon: you knew also, that the illumination of the Earth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

of granting, that the dark part of the Earth may illuminate
the dark part of the Moon, with no less a light than that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

                        <p>I have sometimes seen it of the colour of brass, and a

                        <p>How then can that light be so natural, which you see so
cleer in the close of the twilight, notwithstanding the impediment
of the great and contiguous splendor of the crescents; and which
again, in the more obscure time of night, all other light removed,
appears not at all?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SIMPL.</speaker>
                        <p>I have heard of some that believed that same light to
be participated to these crescents from the other Stars, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
from <hi>Venus,</hi> the Moons neighbour.</p>

                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>And this likewise is a vanity; because in the time of
its total obscuration, it ought to appear more shining than ever;
for you cannot say, that the shadow of the Earth intercepts the
sight of <hi>Venus,</hi> or the other Stars. But to say true, it is not at
that instant wholly deprived thereof, for that the Terrestrial He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misphere,
which in that time looketh towards the Moon, is that
where it is night, that is, an intire privation of the light of the Sun.
And if you but diligently observe, you will very sensibly perceive,
that like as the Moon, when it is sharp-horned, doth give very little
light to the Earth; and according as in her the parts illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
by the Suns light do encrease: so likewise the splendor to
our seeming encreaseth, which from her is reflected towards us;
thus the Moon, whilst it is sharp-forked, and that by being between
the Sun and the Earth, it discovereth a very great part of the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial
Hemisphere illuminated, appeareth very clear: and depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the Sun, and passing towards the<note n="*" place="margin">By the Moons two <hi>Quadratures</hi> you are to understand its first and last quarters, as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strologers call them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

loseth more and more of the view of the luminous part of the
Earth: and yet it should succeed quite contrary, if that light were
its own, or communicated to it from the Stars; for then we should
see it in the depth of night, and in so very dark an ambient.</p>

                        <p>Stay a little; for I just now remember, that I have
read in a little modern tract, full of many novelties; <q>That this
secondary light is not derived from the Stars, nor innate in the
Moon, and least of all communicated by the Earth, but that it is
received from the same illumination of the Sun,<note place="margin">The secondary light of the Moon caused by the Sun, according to some.</note> which, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Lunar Globe being somewhat transparent, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trateth
thorow all its body; but more livelily illuminateth the
superficies of the Hemisphere exposed to the rays of the Sun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and its profundity imbuing, and (as I may say) swallowing that
light, after the manner of a cloud or chrystal, transmits it, and
renders it visibly lucid. And this (if I remember aright) he
proveth by Authority, Experience and Reason; citing <hi>Cleomedes,
Vitellion, Macrobius,</hi> and a certain other modern Author: and
adding, That it is seen by experience to shine most in the days
nearest the Conjunction, that is, when it is horned, and is chiefly
bright about its limb. And he farther writes, That in the Solar
Ecclipses, when it is under the <hi>Discus</hi> of the Sun, it may be seen
translucid, and more especially towards its utmost Circle. And
in the next place, for Arguments, as I think, he saith, That it not
being able to derive that light either from the Earth, or from the
Stars, or from it self, it necessarily follows, that it cometh from
the Sun. Besides that, if you do but grant this supposition, one
may easily give convenient reasons for all the particulars that
occur. For the reason why that secundary light shews more
lively towards the outmost limb, is, the shortness of the space
that the Suns rays hath to penetrate, in regard that of the lines
which pass through a circle, the greatest is that which passeth
through the centre, and of the rest, those which are farthest from
it, are always less than those that are nearer. From the same
principle, he saith, may be shewn why the said light doth not
much diminish. And lastly, by this way the cause is assigned
whence it comes, that that same more shining circle about the
utmost edge of the Moon, is seen at the time of the Solar Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse,
in that part which lyeth just under the <hi>Discus</hi> of the Sun,
but not in that which is beside the <hi>Discus:</hi> which happeneth
because the rays of the Sun pass directly to our eye, through the
parts of the Moon underneath: but as for the parts which are
besides it, they fall besides the eye.</q>

experiments, and manifest circumstances, that the same proceeded
from the reflection of the Earth, and from nothing else: and the more

light is clearer about the utmost limb than in the middle
parts, so as to form, as it were, a ring or circle more bright than
the rest of its space or contence. True it is, indeed, that looking
on the Moon at the time of twilight, at first sight there is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
of such a circle, but by an illusion arising from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of confines that bound the Moons <hi>Discus,</hi> which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
by means of this secondary light; forasmuch as on the part
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:96976:49"/>
towards the Sun it is bounded by the lucid horns of the Moon,
and on the other part, its confining term is the obscure tract of the
twilight; whose relation makes us think the candor of the Moons
<hi>Discus</hi> to be so much the clearer; the which happens to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuscated
in the opposite part, by the greater clarity of the cres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents;

                        <p>Oh! how is this (as I believed) inadvertency of his,
changed into a lie, bordering on rashnesse; for that every one
may frequently make proof of the contrary. That in the next
place,<note place="margin">The Moons <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> in a solar E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse can be seen onely by privation.</note> at the Suns Eclipse, the Moons <hi>Discus</hi> is seen otherwayes
than by privation, I much doubt, and specially when the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse
is not total, as those must necessarily have been, which
were observed by the Author; but if also he should have discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
somewhat of light, this contradicts not, rather favoureth our
opinion; for that at such a time, the whole Terrestrial Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphere
illuminated by the Sun, is opposite to the Moon, so that
although the Moons shadow doth obscure a part thereof, yet this
is very small in comparison of that which remains illuminated.
That which he farther adds, that in this case, the part of the
limb, lying under the Sun, doth appear very lucid, but that
which lyeth besides it, not so; and that to proceed from the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the solar rayes directly through that part to the eye, but
not through this, is really one of those fopperies, which disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the other fictions, of him which relates them: For if it be
requisite to the making a secondary light visible in the lunar <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
that the rayes of the Sun came directly through it to our
eyes, doth not this pitiful Philosopher perceive, that we should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
see this same secondary light, save onely at the Eclipse of the
Sun? And if a part onely of the Moon, far lesse than half a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
by being remote from the Suns <hi>Discus,</hi> can deflect or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate
the rayes of the Sun, so that they arrive not at our eye;
what shall it do when it is distant twenty or thirty degrees, as it is
at its first apparition? and what course shall the rayes of the Sun
keep, which are to passe thorow the body of the Moon, that
they may find out our eye?<note place="margin">The Author of the Book of conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, accommodates the things to his purposes, and not his purposes to the things.</note> This man doth go successively consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
what things ought to be, that they may serve his purpose,
but doth not gradually proceed, accommodating his conceits to
the things, as really they are. As for instance, to make the light
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:96976:49"/>
of the Sun capable to penetrate the substance of the Moon, he
makes her in part diaphanous, as is <hi>v. g.</hi> the transparence of a cloud,
or crystal: but I know not what he would think of such a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparency,
in case the solar rayes were to passe a depth of clouds
of above two thousand miles; but let it be supposed that he
should boldly answer, that might well be in the Coelestial, which
are quite other things from these our Elementary, impure, and
feculent bodies; and let us convict his error by such wayes, as
admit him no reply, or (to say better) subter-fuge. If he will
maintain, that the substance of the Moon is diaphanous, he
must say that it is so, whilest that the rayes of the Sun are to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate
its whole profundity, that is, more than two thousand
miles; but that if you oppose unto them onely one mile, or
lesse, they should no more penetrate that, than they penetrate
one of our mountains.</p>

of our Author tendeth, and what necessity there is, that he
must grant the matter of the Moon to be most perforable by the
rayes of the Sun, in a depth of two thousand miles, but more
opacous than one of our mountains, in a thicknesse of one mile
onely.</p>

                        <p>The very mountains of the Moon themselves are a
proof thereof, which percussed on one side of the Sun, do cast
on the contrary side very dark shadows, terminate, and more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
by much, than the shadows of ours; but had these moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
been diaphanous, we could never have come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of any unevennesse in the superficies of the Moon, not have
seen those luminous montuosities distinguished by the terms which
separate the lucid parts from the dark: much lesse, should we see
this same term so distinct, if it were true, that the Suns light did
penetrate the whole thicknesse of the Moon; yea rather, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Authors own words, we should of necessity discern the
passage, and confine, between the part of the Sun seen, and the
part not seen, to be very confused, and mixt with light and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:96976:50"/>
darknesse; for that that matter which admits the passage of the
Suns rayes thorow a space of two thousand miles, must needs be
so transparent, that it would very weakly resist them in a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth,
or lesser part of that thicknesse; neverthelesse, the term
which separateth the part illuminated from the obscure, is inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and as distinct, as white is distinct from black; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
where the Section passeth through the part of the Moon,
that is naturally more clear and montanous; but where the old
spots do part, which are certain plains, that by means of their
spherical inclination, receive the rayes of the Sun obliquely,
there the term is not so distinct, by reason of the more dimme il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination.
That, lastly, which he saith, how that the secondary
light doth not diminish and languish, according as the Moon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth,
but conserveth it self continually in the same efficacy;
is most false; nay it is hardly seen in the quadrature, when, on
the contrary, it should appear more splendid, and be visible after
the <hi>crepusculum</hi> in the dark of night. Let us conclude therefore,
that the Earths reflection is very strong upon the Moon; and that,
which you ought more to esteem, we may deduce from thence an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
admirable congruity between the Moon and Earth; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<note place="margin">The Earth may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally operate upon Coelestial bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, with its light.</note> that if it be true, the Planets operate upon the Earth by their
motion and light, the Earth may probably be no lesse potent in
operating reciprocally upon them with the same light, and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
motion also. And though it should not move, yet may
it retain the same operation; because, as it hath been proved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
the action of the light is the self same, I mean of the light
of the Sun reflected; and motion doth nothing, save only vary
the aspects, which fall out in the same manner, whether we make
the Earth move, and the Sun stand still, or the contrary.</p>

that those very things favour you, which you produce against
your self. For if separation and distance are accidents sufficient to
perswade with you a great diversity of natures, it must follow that
proximity and contiguity import similitude.<note place="margin">Affinity between the Earth &amp; Moon in respect of their vicinity.</note> Now how much more
neerer is the Moon to the Earth, than to any other of the Coelestial

(and you shall have other Philosophers bear you company)
that there is a very great affinity betwixt the Earth and Moon.

                        <p>It rests, that we say something touching the solidity of
the Moon, which I argued from its being exquisite smooth and
polite, and you from its montuosity. There is another scruple al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
comes into my mind, from an opinion which I have, that the
Seas reflection ought by the equality of its surface, to be rendered
stronger than that of the Earth, whose superficies is so rough and
opacous.</p>

                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>As to the first objection; I say, that like as among the
parts of the Earth,<note place="margin">Solidity of the Lunar Globe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from its being montainous.</note> which all by their gravity strive to approach the
nearest they can possible to the center, some of them alwayes are
more remote from it than the rest, as the mountains more than
the valleys, and that by reason of their solidity and firmnesse
(for if they were of fluid, they would be even) so the seeing some
parts of the Moon to be elevated above the sphericity of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
parts, argueth their hardnesse; for it is probable that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Moon is reduced into a spherical form by the harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
conspiration of all its parts to the same sentense. Touching
the second doubt, my thinks that the particulars already observed
to happen in the Looking-glasses, may very well assure us, that the
reflection of light comming from the Sea,<note place="margin">The Seas refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of light much weaker than that of the Earth.</note> is far weaker than that
which cometh from Land; understanding it alwayes of the
universal reflection; for as to that particular, on which the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
being calm, casteth upon a determinate place, there is no
doubt, but that he who shall stand in that place, shall see a very
great reflection in the water, but every way else he shall see the
surface of the Water more obscure than that of the Land;<note place="margin">An experimen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

prove it to your senses, let us go into yonder Hall, and power
forth a little water upon the Pavement. Tell me now, doth not
this wet brick shew more dull than the other dry ones? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
it doth, and will so appear, from what place soever you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
it, except one onely, and this is that way which the light
cometh, that entereth in at yonder window; go backwards
therefore by a little and a little.</p>

                        <p>Here I see the west part shine more than all the rest of

                        <p>That moisture hath done no more but filled those little
cavities which are in the brick with water, and reduced its super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies
to an exact evenesse; whereupon the reflex rayes issue
unitedly towards one and the same place; but the rest of the
pavement which is dry, hath its protuberances, that is, an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
variety of inclinations in its smallest particles; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the reflections of the light scatter towards all parts, but more
weakly than if they had gone all united together; and therefore,
the same sheweth almost all alike, beheld several wayes, but far
lesse clear than the moistned brick. I conclude therefore, that the
surface of the Sea, beheld from the Moon, in like manner, as it
would appear most equal, (the Islands and Rocks deducted) so it
would shew lesse clear than that of the Earth, which is montanous
and uneven. And but that I would not seem, as the saying is,
to harp too much on one string, I could tell you that I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in the Moon that secondary light which I told you came to
her from the reflection of the Terrestrial Globe, to be notably
more clear two or three dayes before the conjunction,<note place="margin">The secondary light of the Moon clearer before the conjunction, than after.</note> than after,
that is, when we see it before break of day in the East, than
when it is seen at night after Sun-set in the West; of which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
the cause is, that the Terrestrial Hemisphere, which looks
towards the Eastern Moon, hath little Sea, and much Land, to
wit, all <hi>Asia,</hi> whereas, when it is in the West, it beholds very
great Seas, that is, the whole <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean as far as <hi>America:</hi>

                        <p>So that perhaps you believe, those great spots disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered

                        <p>This which you ask me, is the beginning of those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruities which I esteem to be between the Moon and the
Earth, out of which it is time to dis-ingage our selves, for we
have stayed too long in the Moon. I say therefore, that if there
were in nature but one way onely, to make two superficies illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Sun, to appear one more clear than the other, and
that this were by the being of the one Earth, and the other Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
it would be necessary to say that the surface of the Moon
were part earthy and part aquatick; but because we know many
wayes to produce the same effect (and others there may be which
we know not of;) therefore I dare not affirm the Moon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
of one thing more than another: It hath been seen already
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:96976:51"/>
that a silver plate boiled, being toucht with the Burnisher, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
of white obscure; that the moist part of the Earth shews
more obscure than the dry; that in the tops of Hills, the woody
parts appear more gloomy than the naked and barren; which
hapneth because there falleth very much shadow among the Trees,
but the open places are illuminated all over by the Sun. And this
mixtion of shadow hath such operation, that in tufted velvet, the
silk which is cut, is of a far darker colour than that which is not
cut, by means of the shadows diffused betwixt thred and thred,
and a plain velvet shews much blacker than a Taffata, made of the
same silk. So that if there were in the Moon things which should
look like great Woods, their aspect might represent unto us the
spots which we discover; alike difference would be occasioned, if
there were Seas in her: and lastly, nothing hindreth, but that those
spots may really be of an obscurer colour than the rest; for thus
the snow makes the mountains shew brighter.<note place="margin">The obscurer parts of the Moon are plains, and the more bright moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous.</note> That which is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
observed in the Moon is, that its most obscure parts are all
plains, with few rises and bancks in them; though some there be;
the rest which is of a brighter colour, is all full of rocks, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
hillocks of spherical and other figures; and in particular, round
about the spots are very great ledges of mountains.<note place="margin">Long ledges of mountains about the spots of the Moon.</note> That the
spots be plain superficies, we have assured proof, in that we see,
how that the term which distinguisheth the part illuminated from
the obscure, in crossing the spots makes the intersection even, but
in the clear parts it shews all craggy and shagged. But I know not
as yet whether this evennesse of superficies may be sufficient of it
self alone, to make the obscurity appear, and I rather think not.
Besides, I account the Moon exceeding different from the Earth;
for although I imagine to my self that those are not idle and dead
Regions,<note place="margin">There are not generated in the Moon things like to ours, but if there be any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, they are very different.</note> yet I affirm not, that there are in them motion and life,
much less that there are bred plants, animals or other things like
to ours; but, if such there be, they should nevertheless be very
different, and remote from our imagination. And I am induced so
to think, because in the first place, I esteem that the matter of the
Lunar Globe consists not of Earth and Water; and this alone
sufficeth to take away the generations and alterations resembling
ours:<note place="margin">The Moon not composed of Water and Earth.</note> but now supposing that there were in the Moon, Water and
Earth, yet would they not produce plants and animals like to
ours;<note place="margin">Those aspects of the Sun necessary for our generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are not so in the Moon.</note> and this for two principal reasons: The first is, that unto our
productions there are required so many variable aspects of the Sun,
that without them they would all miscarry: now the habitudes of
the Sun towards the Earth are far different from those towards
the Moon. We as to the diurnal illumination, have, in the greater
part of the Earth, every twenty four hours part day, and part
night, which effect in the Moon is monethly: and that annual decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:96976:52"/>
and elevation of the Sun in the Zodiack,<note place="margin">Natural dayes in the Moon are of a Moneth long.</note> by which it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
diversity of Seasons, and inequality of dayes and nights,
are finished in the Moon in a moneth; and whereas the Sun to us
riseth and declineth so much,<note place="margin">To the Moon the Sun ascendeth and declineth with a difference of ten degrees, and to the Earth of forty se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven degrees.</note> that from the greatest to the least al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
there is a difference of almost 47 degrees, for so much is
the distance from one to the other Tropick; this is in the Moon
but ten degrees only, or little more; namely, as much as the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Latitudes of the Dragon on each side the Ecliptick. Now
consider what effect the Sun would have in the torrid Zone, should
it continually for fifteen dayes together beam forth its Rayes upon
it; which without all question would destroy plants, herbs,
and living creatures: and if it should chance that there were any
production, it would be of herbs, plants, and creatures very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

with ours, of many that have been sought out for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction

one alone; and that also, not because we have certain obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation

Moreover, if I was demanded what my first apprehension, and pure
natural reason dictated to me concerning the production of things
like or unlike there above, I would alwayes reply, that they are
most different, and to us altogether unimaginable, for so me thinks
the riches of Nature, and the omnipotence of our Creator and

                        <p>Your discourse is very concluding; in confirmation of
which we have the example of those who understand, or have
known some thing, which the more knowing they are, the more
they know, and freely confesse that they know little; nay, the

openly professed to know that he knew nothing.</p>

of all men, whose knowledg is limited; <hi>Socrates</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
that he knew nothing in relation to absolute wisdome,
which is infinite; and because of infinite, much is the same part,
as is little, and as is nothing (for to arrive <hi>v. g.</hi> to the infinite
number, it is all one to accumulate thousands, tens, or ciphers,)
therefore <hi>Socrates</hi> well perceived his wisdom to be nothing, in
comparison of the infinite knowledg which he wanted. But yet,
because there is some knowledg found amongst men, and this
not equally shared to all, <hi>Socrates</hi> might have a greater share
thereof than others, and therefore verified the answer of the

this and that are nothing in comparison of the Divine Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.

understanding amongst the greatest (if you make it not the

a little before you said with <hi>Socrates,</hi> that he had no knowledg at

                        <p>You argue very cunningly, but to reply to your obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
I must have recourse to a Philosophical distinction, and say
that the understanding is to be taken too ways,<note place="margin">Man understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth very well <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensivè,</hi> but little <hi>extensivè.</hi>
                           </note> that is <hi>intensivè,</hi> or
<hi>extensivè;</hi> and that <hi>extensivè,</hi> that is, as to the multitude of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligibles,
which are infinite, the understanding of man is as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
though he should understand a thousand propositions; for
that a thousand, in respect of infinity is but as a cypher: but taking
the understanding <hi>intensive,</hi> (in as much as that term imports) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensively,
that is, perfectly some propositions, I say, that humane wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
understandeth some propositions so perfectly, and is as abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
certain thereof, as Nature her self; and such are the pure
Mathematical sciences, to wit, Geometry and Arithmetick: in which
Divine Wisdom knows infinite more propositions, because it knows
them all; but I believe that the knowledge of those few compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
by humane understanding, equalleth the divine, as to the
certainty <hi>objectivè,</hi> for that it arriveth to comprehend the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
thereof, than which there can be no greater certainty.</p>

                        <p>These are common notions, and far from all umbrage
of temerity, or boldness, and detract not in the least from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
of divine wisdom; as it nothing diminisheth the omnipotence

of some passion of the Circle, which hath infinite, beginning
from one of the most simple, and taking that for its definition,
do proceed with argumentation to another, and from that to a
third, and then to a fourth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Divine Wisdom, by the
apprehension of its essence comprehends, without temporary raci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocination,
all these infinite passions; which notwithstanding, are
in effect virtually comprised in the definitions of all things;<note place="margin">Definitions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein virtually all the passions of the things defined.</note> and, to
conclude, as being infinite, perhaps are but one alone in their nature,
and in the Divine Mind; the which neither is wholly unknown to
humane understanding,<note place="margin">Infinite Passions are perhaps but one onely.</note> but onely be-clouded with thick and
grosse mists; which come in part to be dissipated and clarified,
when we are made Masters of any conclusions, firmly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated,
and so perfectly made ours, as that we can speedily run
through them; for in sum, what other, is that proposition, that
the square of the side subtending the right angle in any triangle,
is equal to the squares of the other two, which include it, but
onely the Paralellograms being upon common bases, and between
parallels equal amongst themselves? and this, lastly, is it not the
same, as to say that those two superficies are equal, of which
equal parts applyed to equal parts,<note place="margin">The discourses which humane reason makes in a certain time, the Divine Wisdom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solveth in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that is, hath them alwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</note> possesse equal place? Now
these inferences, which our intellect apprehendeth with time and a
gradual motion, the Divine Wisdom, like light, penetrateth in
an instant, which is the same as to say, hath them alwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:
I conclude therefore, that our understanding, both as to
the manner and the multitude of the things comprehended by us,
is infinitely surpast by the Divine Wisdom; but yet I do not so
vilifie it, as to repute it absolutely nothing; yea rather, when I
consider how many and how great misteries men have understood,
discovered, and contrived, I very plainly know and understand
the mind of man to be one of the works, yea one of the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:96976:57"/>
of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> and <hi>Copernicus,</hi> and which of their opinions is
the more probable and rational; that, which affirmeth the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Coelestial bodies to be ingenerable, incorruptible, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable,
impassible, and in a word, exempt from all kind of change,
save that of local, and therefore to be a <hi>fifth essence,</hi> quite different
from this of our Elementary bodies, which are generable, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible,
alterable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or else the other, which taking away such
deformity from the parts of the World, holdeth the Earth to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the same perfections as the other integral bodies of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse;
and esteemeth it a moveable and erratick Globe, no lesse
than the Moon, <hi>Jupiter, Venus,</hi> or any other Planet: And lastly,
maketh many particular parallels betwixt the Earth and Moon;
and more with the Moon, than with any other Planet; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by reason we have greater and more certain notice of it, as
being lesse distant from us. And having, lastly, concluded this
second opinion to have more of probability with it than the first,
I should think it best in the subsequent discourses to begin to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
whether the Earth be esteemed immoveable, as it hath
been till now believed by most men, or else moveable, as some
ancient <hi>Philosophers</hi> held, and others of not very recesse times,

burst with holding in my self from laughing outright, for you

                        <p>I am content. I found one day, at home in his house, at
<hi>Venice,</hi> a famous Phisician, to whom some flockt for their studies,
and others out of curiosity, sometimes came thither to see certain A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomies
diffected by the hand of a no lesse learned, than careful
and experienced Anatomist.<note place="margin">The original of the Nerves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> and according to Phisicians.</note> It chanced upon that day, when I was
there, that he was in search of the original and rise of the Nerves,
about which there is a famous controversie between the <hi>Galenists</hi>
and <hi>Peripateticks;</hi> and the Anatomist shewing, how that the great
number of Nerves departing from the Brain, as their root, and
passing by the nape of the Neck, distend themselves afterwards
along by the Back-bone, and branch themselves thorow all the
Body; and that a very small filament, as fine as a thred went to
the Heart; he turned to a Gentleman whom he knew to be a <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripatetick</hi>
Philosopher, and for whose sake he had with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
exactnesse, discovered and proved every thing, and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of him, if he was at length satisfied and perswaded that the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of the Nerves proceeded from the Brain, and not from the
Heart?<note place="margin">The ridiculous answer of a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the original of the Nerves.</note> To which the Philosopher, after he had stood musing a
while, answered; you have made me to see this businesse so
plainly and sensibly, that did not the <hi>Text</hi> of <hi>Aristotle</hi> assert the
contrary, which positively affirmeth the Nerves to proceed from
the Heart, I should be constrained to confesse your opinion to be
true.</p>

about the original of the Nerves is not yet so proved and

contradictors; but that which you say, doth not at all lessen the
extravagance of the answer of that <hi>Peripatetick,</hi> who against
such sensible experience produced not other experiments, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

                           <hi>Aristotle</hi> had not gained so great authority, but for
the force of his Demonstrations, and the profoundnesse of his
arguments; but it is requisite that we understand him, and not
onely understand him, but have so great familiarity with his
Books, that we form a perfect <hi>Idea</hi> thereof in our minds, so as
that every saying of his may be alwayes as it were, present in our
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:96976:58"/>
memory for he did not write to the vulgar, nor is he obliged to
spin out his Sillogismes with the trivial method of disputes; nay
rather, using a freedome, he hath sometimes placed the proof
of one Proposition amongst Texts, which seem to treat of quite
another point;<note place="margin">Requisites to fit a man to philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phate well after the manner of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle.</hi>
                           </note> and therefore it is requisite to be master of all
that vast <hi>Idea,</hi> and to learn how to connect this passage with that,
and to combine this Text with another far remote from it; for it
is not to be questioned but that he who hath thus studied him,
knows how to gather from his Books the demonstrations of every
knowable deduction, for that they contein all things.</p>

and there in <hi>Aristotle,</hi> give you no trouble in collecting them,
but that you perswade your self to be able by comparing and
connecting several small sentences to extract thence the juice of
some desired conclusion,<note place="margin">A cunning way to gather Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy out of any book whatsoever.</note> so this, which you and other egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

But what talk I of <hi>Virgil,</hi> or any other Poet? I have a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

all the Sciences, and with very little study, one may gather
out of it a most perfect <hi>Idea,</hi> and this is the <hi>Alphabet;</hi> and there
is no doubt but that he who knows how to couple and dispose
aright this and that vowel, with those, or those other consonants,
may gather thence the infallible answers to all doubts, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
from them the principles of all Sciences and Arts, just in the
same manner as the Painter from divers simple colours, laid seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally

Nay, farther, it is necessary, that none of the things to be imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

would be able therewith to represent all things; for should there

                        <p>You state not the matter rightly, <hi>Simplicius;</hi> There

And you, pray you tell me, are you for your part so simple, as
not to know that had <hi>Aristotle</hi> been present, to have heard the
Doctor that would have made him Author of the <hi>Telescope,</hi> he
would have been much more displeased with him, than with those,
who laught at the Doctor and his Comments? Do you question
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:96976:59"/>
whether <hi>Aristotle,</hi> had he but seen the novelties discovered in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
would not have changed his opinion, amended his Books,
and embraced the more sensible Doctrine; rejecting those silly
Gulls, which too scrupulously go about to defend what ever he
hath said; not considering, that if <hi>Aristotle</hi> were such a one as
they fancy him to themselves, he would be a man of an untracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
wit, an obstinate mind, a barbarous soul, a stubborn will,
that accounting all men else but as silly sheep, would have his
Oracles preferred before the Senses, Experience, and Nature her
self? They are the Sectators of <hi>Aristotle</hi> that have given him this
Authority, and not he that hath usurped or taken it upon him;
and because it is more easie for a man to sculk under anothers
shield than to shew himself openly, they tremble, and are affraid
to stir one step from him; and rather than they will admit some
alterations in the Heaven of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> they will impertinently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

they are to his reputation and credit; and how that the
more they go about to encrease his Authority, the more they
diminish it; for whilest I see them obstinate in their attempts
to maintain those Propositions which I palpably discover to
be manifestly false; and in their desires to perswade me that
so to do, is the part of a Philosopher; and that <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself
would do the same, it much abates in me of the opinion that he
hath rightly philosophated about other conclusions, to me more
abstruse: for if I could see them concede and change opinion in
a manifest truth, I would believe, that in those in which they
should persist, they may have some solid demonstrations to me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,

too much of their own and <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s repuatation in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing,
that they had not understood this or that conclusion found
out by some other man; would it not be a less evil for them to
seek for it amongst his Texts, by laying many of them together,
according to the art intimated to us by <hi>Simplicius?</hi> for if his

may be therein discovered.</p>

thinks you rehearse in too Ironical a way; for it is not long since
that a very eminent Philosopher having composed a Book <hi>de animà,</hi>
wherein, citing the opinion of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> about its being or not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
immortal, he alledged many Texts, (not any of those hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
quoted by <hi>Alexander ab Alexandro:</hi> for in those he said, that
<hi>Aristotle</hi> had not so much as treated of that matter, much less de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
any thing pertaining to the same, but others) by himself
found out in other more abstruse places, which tended to an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
sense: and being advised, that he would find it an hard
matter to get a Licence from the Inquisitors,<note place="margin">A brave resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a certain <hi>Peripatetick</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher.</note> he writ back unto

he would not much scruple to change the Doctrine of <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
and with other expositions, and other Texts to maintain the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
opinion, which yet should be also agreeable to the sense of

                        <p>Let our contemplation begin therefore with this consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
that whatsoever motion may be ascribed to the Earth,
it is necessary that it be to us, (as inhabitants upon it, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
partakers of the same) altogether imperceptible, and as if
it were not at all, so long as we have regard onely to terrestrial
things;<note place="margin">The motions of the Earth are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible to its inhabitants.</note> but yet it is on the contrary, as necessary that the same
motion do seem common to all other bodies, and visible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
that being separated from the Earth, participate not of the
same. So that the true method to find whether any kind of motion
may be ascribed to the Earth, and that found, to know what it
is, is to consider and observe if in bodies separated from the
Earth,<note place="margin">The Earth can have no other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than those which to us appear commune to all the rest of the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, the Earth excepted.</note> one may discover any appearance of motion, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
suiteth to all the rest; for a motion that is onely seen, <hi>v. gr.</hi>
in the <hi>Moon,</hi> and that hath nothing to do with <hi>Venus</hi> or <hi>Jupiter,</hi>
or any other Stars, cannot any way belong to the Earth, or to
any other save the Moon alone. Now there is a most general and
grand motion above all others, and it is that by which the Sun,
the Moon,<note place="margin">The Diurnal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, seemeth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune to all the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse, save onely the Earth excepted.</note> the other Planets, and the Fixed Stars, and in a word,
the whole Universe, the Earth onely excepted, appeareth in our
thinking to move from the East towards the West, in the space of
twenty four hours; and this, as to this first appearance, hath no
obstacle to hinder it, that it may not belong to the Earth alone,
as well as to all the World besides, the Earth excepted; for the
same aspects will appear in the one position, as in the other.
Hence it is that <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> argue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Motion attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Earth.</note> as having hit upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,

argue not against any other than this <hi>Diurnal</hi> Motion; save onely

                        <p>I very well perceive the necessity of your illation: but
I meet with a doubt which I know not how to free my self from,
and this it is, That <hi>Copernicus</hi> assigning to the Earth another mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
beside the Diurnal, which, according to the rule even now laid
down, ought to be to us, as to appearance, imperceptible in the
Earth, but visible in all the rest of the World; me thinks I may
necessarily infer, either that he hath manifestly erred in assigning
the Earth a motion, to which there appears not a general corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence
in Heaven; or else that if there be such a congruity
therein, <hi>Ptolomy</hi> on the other hand hath been deficient in not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing
this, as he hath done the other.</p>

                        <p>You have good cause for your doubt: and when we
come to treat of the other Motion, you shall see how far <hi>Coper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi>
excelled <hi>Ptolomey</hi> in clearness and sublimity of wit, in that
he saw what the other did not, I mean the admirable harmony
wherein that Motion agreed with all the other Coelestial Bodies.
But for the present we will suspend this particular, and return to
our first consideration; touching which I will proceed to propose
(begining with things more general) those reasons which seem to
favour the mobility of the Earth,<note place="margin">Why the diurnal motion more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably should belong to the Earth, than to the rest of the Vniverse.</note> and then wait the answers which
<hi>Simplicius</hi> shall make thereto. And first, if we consider onely
the immense magnitude of the Starry Sphere, compared to the
smalness of the Terrestrial Globe, contained therein so many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of times; and moreover weigh the velocity of the motion
which must in a day and night make an entire revolution thereof,
I cannot perswade my self, that there is any man who believes it
more reasonable and credible, that the Coelestial Sphere turneth
round, and the Terrestrial Globe stands still.</p>

                        <speaker>SAGR.</speaker>
                        <p>If from the universality of effects, which may in nature
have dependence upon such like motions, there should indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
follow all the same consequences to an hair, aswell in one <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis</hi>
as in the other; yet I for my part, as to my first and general
apprehension, would esteem, that he which should hold it more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
to make the whole Universe move, and thereby to salve the
Earths mobility, is more unreasonable than he that being got to
the top of your Turret, should desire, to the end onely that he
might behold the City, and the Fields about it, that the whole
Country might turn round, that so he might not be put to the
trouble to stir his head. And yet doubtless the advantages would
be many and great which the <hi>Copernican Hypothesis</hi> is attended
with, above those of the <hi>Ptolomaique,</hi> which in my opinion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembleth,
nay surpasseth that other folly; so that all this makes
me think that far more probable than this. But haply <hi>Aristotle
Ptolomey,</hi> and <hi>Simplicius</hi> may find the advantages of their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steme,
which they would do well to communicate to us also, if
any such there be; or else declare to me, that there neither are or
can be any such things.</p>

                        <p>For my part, as I have not been able, as much as I have
thought upon it, to find any diversity therein; so I think I have
found, that no such diversity can be in them: in so much that I
esteem it to no purpose to seek farther after it.<note place="margin">Motion, as to the things that equally move thereby, is as if it never were, &amp; so far operates as it hath relation to things deprived of motion.</note> Therefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve:
Motion is so far Motion, and as Motion operateth, by how
far it hath relation to things which want Motion: but in those
things which all equally partake thereof it hath nothing to do, and
is as if it never were. And thus the Merchandises with which a
ship is laden, so far move, by how far leaving <hi>London,</hi> they pass

to <hi>Syria</hi> is as much as nothing; and nothing-altereth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
which is between them: and this, because it is common to
all, and is participated by all alike: and of the Cargo which is in
the ship, if a Bale were romag'd from a Chest but one inch onely,
this alone would be in that Cargo, a greater Motion in respect of
the Chest, than the whole Voyage of above three thousand miles,
made by them as they were stived together.</p>

common to many moveables, is idle, and as it were, null as to the
relation of those moveables between themselves, because that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselves they have made no change: and that it is ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
onely in the relation that those moveables have to other
things, which want that motion, among which the habitude is
changed: and we having divided the Universe into two parts, one
of which is necessarily moveable, and the other immoveable; for
the obtaining of whatsoever may depend upon, or be required
from such a motion, it may as well be done by making the Earth
alone, as by making all the rest of the World to move: for that
the operation of such a motion consists in nothing else, save in
the relation or habitude which is between the Coelestial Bodies,

you should say that it is to no purpose for the Sun to pass from one

                        <p>How then, is there no contrariety in circular motions.
These motions, being made upon the superficies of the Earth or
Water, which are, as you know, spherical, come to be circular.
Can you tell, <hi>Simplicius,</hi> which those circular motions be, that
are not contrary to each other? They are (if I mistake not) those
of two circles, which touching one another without, one thereof
being turn'd round, naturally maketh the other move the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<note n="*" place="margin">As you see in a Mill, wherein the implicated cogs set the wheels on mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</note> way; but if one of them shall be within the other, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible

they should not justle one another.</p>

                        <p>But be they contrary, or not contrary, these are but
alterations of words; and I know, that upon the matter, it would
be far more proper and agreeable with Nature, if we could salve
all with one motion onely, than to introduce two that are (if you
will not call them contrary) opposite; yet do I not censure this
introduction (of contrary motions) as impossible; nor pretend I
from the denial thereof, to inferre a necessary Demonstration,
but onely a greater probability,<note place="margin">A third confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the same Doctrine.</note> of the other. A third reason
which maketh the <hi>Ptolomaique Hypothesis</hi> lesse probable is, that it
most unreasonably confoundeth the order, which we assuredly
see to be amongst those Coelestial Bodies, the circumgyration of
which is not questionable,<note place="margin">The greater Orbs make their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions in greater times.</note> but most certain. And that Order is,
that according as an Orb is greater, it finisheth its revolution in a
longer time, and the lesser, in shorter. And thus <hi>Saturn</hi> descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
a greater Circle than all the other Planets, compleateth the
same in thirty yeares: <hi>Jupiter</hi> finisheth his; that is lesse, in
twelve years: <hi>Mars</hi> in two: The Moon runneth thorow hers, so
much lesse than the rest, in a Moneth onely. Nor do we lesse
sensibly see that of the <hi>Medicean Stars,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The times of the <hi>Medicean</hi> Planets conversions.</note> which is nearest to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi>
to make its revolution in a very short time, that is, in four
and forty hours, or thereabouts, the next to that in three dayes and
an half, the third in seven dayes, and the most remote in sixteen.
And this rate holdeth well enough, nor will it at all alter, whilest
we assign the motion of 24 hours to the Terrestrial Globe, for it
to move round its own center in that time; but if you would have
the Earth immoveable, it is necessary, that when you have past
from the short period of the Moon, to the others successively
bigger, until you come to that of <hi>Mars</hi> in two years, and from
thence to that of the bigger Sphere of <hi>Jupiter</hi> in twelve years, and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:96976:63"/>
from this to the other yet bigger of <hi>Saturn,</hi> whose period is of
thirty years, it is necessary, I say, that you passe to another
Sphere incomparably greater still than that, and make this to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
an entire revolution in twenty four hours.<note place="margin">The motion of 24 hours ascribed to the highest Sphere disorders the period of the inferiour.</note> And this yet is
the least disorder that can follow. For if any one should passe
from the Sphere of <hi>Saturn</hi> to the Starry Orb, and make it so
much bigger than that of <hi>Saturn,</hi> as proportion would require, in
respect of its very slow motion, of many thousands of years, then
it must needs be a <hi>Salt</hi> much more absurd, to skip from this to
another bigger, and to make it convertible in twenty four hours.
But the motion of the Earth being granted, the order of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods
will be exactly observed, and from the very slow Sphere of
<hi>Saturn,</hi> we come to the fixed Stars, which are wholly immovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<note place="margin">The fourth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.</note> and so avoid a fourth difficulty, which we must of necessity ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
if the Starry Sphere be supposed moveable, and that is the
immense disparity between the motions of those stars themselves;<note place="margin">Great disparity amongst the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar fixed stars, if their Sphere be moveable.</note>
of which some would come to move most swiftly in most vast cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
others most slowly in circles very small, according as those
or these should be found nearer, or more remote from the Poles;
which still is accompanied with an inconvenience, as well because
we see those, of whose motion there is no question to be made,
to move all in very immense circles; as also, because it seems to
be an act done with no good consideration, to constitute bodies,
that are designed to move circularly, at immense distances from
the centre, and afterwards to make them move in very small cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.
And not onely the magnitudes of the circles, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the velocity of the motions of these Stars, shall be most
different from the circles and motions of those others,<note place="margin">The fifth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.</note> but
(which shall be the fifth inconvenience) the self-same Stars
shall successively vary its circles and velocities:<note place="margin">The motions of the fixed stars would accelerate and grow slow in divers times, if the starry Sphere were moueable.</note> For that
those, which two thousand years since were in the Equinoctial,
and consequently did with their motion describe very vast cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
being in our dayes many degrees distant from thence, must
of necessity become more slow of motion, and be reduced to
move in lesser circles, and it is not altogether impossible but that
a time may come, in which some of them which in aforetime had
continually moved, shall be reduced by uniting with the Pole, to
a state of rest, and then after some time of cessation, shall return
to their motion again; whereas the other Stars, touching whose
motion none stand in doubt, do all describe, as hath been said,
the great circle of their Orb, and in that maintain themselves
without any variation.<note place="margin">The sixth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.</note> The absurdity is farther enlarged (which
let be the sixth inconvenience) to him that more seriously exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the thing, in that no thought can comprehend what ought to
be the solidity of that immense Sphere, whose depth so stedfastly
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:96976:63"/>
holdeth fast such a multitude of Stars, which without ever chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
site among themselves, are with so much concord carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
with so great disparity of motions. Or else, supposing the
Heavens to be fluid, as we are with more reason to believe, so
as that every Star wandereth to and fro in it, by wayes of its
own, what rules shall regulate their motions, and to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
so, as that being beheld from the Earth, they appear as if
they were made by one onely Sphere? It is my opinion, that they
might so much more easily do that, and in a more commodious
manner, by being constituted immoveable, than by being made
errant, by how much more facile it is to number the quarries in the
Pavement of a <hi>Piazza,</hi> than the rout of boyes which run up and
down upon them.<note place="margin">The Seventh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.</note> And lastly, which is the seventh instance, if
we attribute the Diurnal Motion to the highest Heaven, it must be
constituted of such a force and efficacy, as to carry along with
it the innumerable multitude of fixed Stars, Bodies all of vast
magnitude, and far bigger than the Earth; and moreover all the
Spheres of the Planets; notwithstanding that both these and those
of their own nature move the contrary way. And besides all this,
it must be granted, that also the Element of Fire, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
part of the Air, are likewise forcibly hurried along with the
rest, and that the sole little Globe of the Earth pertinaciously
stands still, and unmoved against such an impulse; a thing, which
in my thinking, is very difficult; nor can I see how the Earth, a
pendent body,<note place="margin">The Earth a pendent Body, and equilibrated in a fluid <hi>Medium</hi> seems unable to resist the rapture of the Diurnal Motion.</note> and equilibrated upon its centre, exposed indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
to either motion or rest, and environed with a liquid <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient,</hi>
should not yield also as the rest, and be carried about.
But we find none of these obstacles in making the Earth to move;
a small body, and insensible, compared to the Universe, and
therefore unable to offer it any violence.</p>

attempt whether I can better methodize them, and gather

and peradventure, the proceeding by interrogations may help me
the more easily to expresse my self. Therefore I demand first of <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicius,</hi>
whether he believeth, that divers motions may natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

but one sole motion, and no more; the rest all happen acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
and by participation; like as to him that walketh upon the

by participation that which carrieth him to his Port, whither he

                        <p>This then resides not in them, and not residing in

                        <p>For this purpose Astronomers, and Philosophers have
found another high Sphere, above all the rest, without Stars, to
which Natural agreeth the Diurnal Motion; and this they call

and hugely vast, without other motions or communicated raptures,
with leaving to each Sphere its sole and simple motion, without

it is necessary that they do, depending all upon one sole principle,
all things proceed orderly, and correspond with most perfect har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,

primary and more general inducements which give us to believe
that the diurnal conversion may not altogether without probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

likelihood.<note place="margin">One single ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, or sound demonstration ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth down all ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments meerly probable.</note> And in regard I know very well, that one sole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,

                        <p>I will first say something in general upon all these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
together, and then I will descend to some particulars.
It seems that you universally bottom all you say upon the greater
simplicity and facility of producing the same effects, whilst you
hold, that as to the causing of them, the motion of the Earth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
serveth <hi>as well</hi> as that of all the rest of the World, the Earth
deducted: but as to the operations, you esteem that much easier
than this. To which I reply, that I am also of the same opinion,
so long as I regard my own not onely finite, but feeble power;
but having a respect to the strength of the <hi>Mover,</hi> which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
its no lesse easie to move the Universe, than the Earth,
yea than a straw. And if his power be infinite,<note place="margin">Of an infinite power one would think a greater part should rather be imploy'd than a lesse.</note> why should he not
rather exercise a greater part thereof than a lesse? Therefore,
I hold that your discourse in general is not convincing.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>If I had at any time said, that the Universe moved not
for want of power in the <hi>Mover,</hi> I should have erred, and your
reproof would have been seasonable; and I grant you, that to
an infinite power, it is as easie to move an hundred thousand, as
one. But that which I did say, concerns not the Mover, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hath respect to the Moveables; and in them, not onely to
their resistance, which doubtlesse is lesser in the Earth, than in
the Universe; but to the many other particulars, but even now
considered. As to what you say in the next place, that of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
power it is better to exercise a great part than a small: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:96976:65"/>
that of infinite one part is not greater than another, since
both are infinite;<note place="margin">Of infinity, one part is no bigger than another, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are comparatively un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal.</note> nor can it be said, that of the infinite number,
an hundred thousand is a greater part than two, though that be
fifty thousand times greater than this; and if to the moving of
the Universe there be required a finite power, though very great
in comparison of that which sufficeth to move the Earth onely;
yet is there not implied therein a greater part of the infinite power,
nor is that part lesse infinite which remaineth unimploy'd. So that
to apply unto a particular effect, a little more, or a little lesse
power, importeth nothing; besides that the operation of such
vertue, hath not for its bound or end the Diurnal Motion onely;
but there are several other motions in the World, which we
know of, and many others there may be, that are to us unknown.
Therefore if we respect the Moveables, and granting it as out of
question, that it is a shorter and easier way to move the Earth,
than the Universe; and moreover, having an eye to the so many
other abreviations, and facilities that onely this way are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
an infallible Maxime of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> which he teacheth us,
that, <hi>frustra fit per plura, quod potest fieri per pauciora,</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
it more probable that the Diurnal Motion belongs to the
Earth alone, than to the Universe, the Earth subducted.</p>

                        <p>In reciting that Axiom, you have omitted a small
clause, which importeth as much as all the rest, especially in our
case, that is to say, the words <hi>aequè bene.</hi> It is requisite therefore
to examine whether this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> doth <hi>equally well</hi> satisfie in all
particulars, as the other.</p>

                        <p>The knowledg whether both these positions do <hi>aequè
bene,</hi> satisfie, may be comprehended from the particular exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the appearances which they are to satisfie; for hitherto
we have discoursed, and will continue to argue <hi>ex hypothesi,</hi>
namely, supposing, that as to the satisfaction of the appearances,
both the assumptions are equally accomodated.<note place="margin">In the Axiome <hi>Frustra fit per plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, &amp;c.</hi> the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>aeque benè,</hi> is superfluous.</note> As to the clause
which you say was omitted by me, I have more reason to suspect
that it was superfluously inserted by you. For the expression <hi>aequè
bene,</hi> is a relative that necessarily requireth two terms at least,
for a thing cannot have relation to its self, nor do we say, <hi>v. gr.</hi>
rest to be <hi>equally good,</hi> as rest. And because, when we say, <hi>that
is done in vain by many means, which may be done with fewer,</hi>
we mean, that that which is to be done, ought to be the same
thing, not two different ones; and because the same thing can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be said to be done as well as its self; therefore, the addition
of the Phrase <hi>aequè bene</hi> is superfluous, and a relation, that hath
but one term onely.</p>

                        <p>That disposition is not new, but very old; and that
you may see it is so, <hi>Aristotle</hi> confuteth it; and his confutations

                           <q>First if the Earth moveth either in it self about its
own Centre, or in an Excentrick Circle, it is necessary that that
same motion be violent; for it is not its natural motion, for
if it were, each of its parts would partake thereof; but each
of them moveth in a right line towards its Centre. It being
therefore violent and pteternatural, it could never be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al:

<hi>Prmum Mobile</hi> excepted: Whence it would be necessary that
the Earth also do move with two motions; and if that should
be so, it would inevitably follow, that mutations should be
made in the Fixed Stars, the which none do perceive; nay
without any variation, the same Stars alwayes rise from towards
the same places, and in the same places do set. Thirdly, the
motion of the parts is the same with that of the whole, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
tendeth towards the Centre of the Universe; and for the
same cause rest, being arrived thither. He thereupon moves the
question whether the motion of the parts hath a tendency to
centre of the Universe, or to the centre of the Earth; and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
that it goeth by proper instinct to the centre of the Universe,
and <hi>per accidence</hi> to that of the Earth; of which point we largely
discoursed yesterday. He lastly confirmeth the same with a fourth
argument taken from the experiment of grave bodies, which fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from on high, descend perpendicularly unto the Earths surface;
and in the same manner <hi>Projections</hi> shot perpendicularly upwards,
do by the same lines return perpendicularly down again, though
they were shot to a very great height. All which arguments neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
prove their motion to be towards the Centre of the Earth,
which without moving at all waits for, and receiveth them. He
intimateth in the last place that the Astronomers alledg other
reasons in confirmation of the same conclusions, I mean of the
Earths being in the Centre of the Universe, and immoveable;
and instanceth onely in one of them, to wit, that all the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi>
or appearances that are seen in the motions of the Stars,
perfectly agree with the position of the Earth in the Centre;
which would not be so, were the Earth seated otherwise.</q>

which falling downwards from on high, move by a right line,
that is perpendicular to the surface of the Earth, an argument
which is held undeniably to prove that the Earth is immoveable:
for in case it should have the diurnal motion, a Tower, from the
top of which a stone is let fall, being carried along by the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Earth, in the time that the stone spends in falling, would
be transported many hundred yards Eastward, and so far distant

which effect they back with another experiment;<note place="margin">Which is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a body let fall from the round top of a Ship.</note> to wit, by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

be let fall from the same place when the ship is under sail, it shall
light as far from the former place, as the ship hath run in the time
of the leads descent; and this for no other reason, than because
the natural motion of the ball being at liberty is by a right line to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the centre of the Earth.<note place="margin">The second ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument taken from a Projection shot very high.</note> They fortifie this argument with
the experiment of a projection shot on high at a very great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;
as for example, a ball sent out of a Cannon, erected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
to the horizon, the which spendeth so much time in as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
and falling, that in our parallel the Cannon and we both
should be carried by the Earth many miles towards the East, so

would fall as far West,<note place="margin">The third argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment taken from the shots of a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, towards the East, and towards the West<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </note> as the Earth had run East. They againe
adde a third, and very evident experiment, <hi>scilicet,</hi> that shooting a
bullet point blank (or as Gunners say, neither above nor under me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal)
out of a Culverin towards the East, and afterwards another,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:96976:66"/>
with the same charge, and at the same elevation or disport towards
the West, the range towards the West should be very much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then the other towards the East: for that whil'st the ball goeth
Westward, and the Peece is carried along by the Earth Eastward,
the ball will fall from the Peece as far distant as is the aggregate of
the two motions, one made by it self towards the West, and the
other by the Peece carried about by the Earth towards the East;
and on the contrary, from the range of the ball shot Eastward you
are to substract the space the Peece moved, being carried after it.
Now suppose, for example, that the range of the ball shot West
were five miles, and that the Earth in the same parallel and in the
time of the Bals ranging should remove three miles, the Ball in this
case would fall eight miles distant from the Culverin, namely, its
own five Westward, and the Culverins three miles Eastward: but
the range of the shot towards the East would be but two miles
long, for so much is the remainder, after you have substracted
from the five miles of the range, the three miles which the Peece
had moved towards the same part. But experience sheweth the
Ranges to be equal, therefore the Culverin, and consequently the
Earth are immoveable.<note place="margin">This argument is confirmed by two shots towards the South and towards the North.</note> And the stability of the Earth is no lesse
confirmed by two other shots made North and South; for they
would never hit the mark, but the Ranges would be alwayes wide,
or towards the West, by meanes of the remove the mark would
make, being carried along with the Earth towards the East, whil'st
the ball is flying.<note place="margin">And it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise confirmed by two shots towards the East, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the West.</note> And not onely shots made by the Meridians,
but also those aimed East or West would prove uncertain; for
those aim'd East would be too high, and those directed West too
low, although they were shot point blank, as I said. For the
Range of the Ball in both the shots being made by the Tangent,
that is, by a line parallel to the Horizon, and being that in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal
motion, if it be of the Earth, the Horizon goeth continually
descending towards the East, and rising from the West (therefore
the Oriental Stars seem to rise, and the Occidental to decline) so
that the Oriental mark would descend below the aime, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the shot would fly too high, and the ascending of the West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern
mark would make the shot aimed that way range too low; so
that the Peece would never carry true towards any point; and for
that experience telleth us the contrary, it is requisite to say, that
the Earth is immoveable.</p>

                        <p>It is requisite that upon this occasion I relate unto you
some accidents that befell me, so soon as I first began to hear speak
of this new doctrine. Being very young, and having scarcely fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
my course of Philosophy, which I left off, as being set upon
other employments, there chanced to come into these parts a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Foreigner of <hi>Rostock,</hi> whose name, as I remember, was <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianus
Vurstitius,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Christianus Vur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitius</hi> read certain Lectures touching the opinion of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernicus,</hi> &amp; what ensued thereupon.</note> a follower of <hi>Copernicus,</hi> who in an <hi>Academy</hi>
made two or three Lectures upon this point, to whom many flock't
as Auditors; but I thinking they went more for the novelty of the
subject than otherwise, did not go to hear him: for I had conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with my self that that opinion could be no other than a solemn
madnesse. And questioning some of those who had been there, I
perceived they all made a jest thereof, execpt one, who told me
that the businesse was not altogether to be laugh't at, and because
this man was reputed by me to be very intelligent and wary, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
that I was not there, and began from that time forward as
oft as I met with any one of the <hi>Copernican</hi> perswasion, to demand
of them, if they had been alwayes of the same judgment; and of as
many as I examined, I found not so much as one, who told me not
that he had been a long time of the contrary opinion, but to have
changed it for this, as convinced by the strength of the reasons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the same: and afterwards questioning them, one by one, to
see whether they were well possest of the reasons of the other side,
I found them all to be very ready and perfect in them;<note place="margin">The followers of <hi>Copernicus</hi> were all first against that opinion, but the Sectators of <hi>Aristotle</hi> &amp; <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy,</hi> were never of the other side.</note> so that I
could not truly say, that they had took up this opinion out of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
vanity, or to shew the acutenesse of their wits. On the
contrary, of as many of the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> and <hi>Ptolomeans</hi> as I
have asked (and out of curiosity I have talked with many) what
pains they had taken in the Book of <hi>Copernicus,</hi> I found very
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:96976:67"/>
few that had so much as superficially perused it; but of those
whom, I thought, had understood the same, not one; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
I have enquired amongst the followers of the <hi>Peripatetick</hi>
Doctrine, if ever any of them had held the contrary opinion, and
likewise found none that had. Whereupon considering that there
was no man who followed the opinion of <hi>Copernicus,</hi> that had
not been first on the contrary side, and that was not very well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the reasons of <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy;</hi> and, on the
contrary, that there is not one of the followers of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> that
had ever been of the judgment of <hi>Copernicus,</hi> and had left that,
to imbrace this of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> considering, I say, these things, I
began to think, that one, who leaveth an opinion imbued with
his milk, and followed by very many, to take up another owned
by very few, and denied by all the Schools, and that really
seems a very great Paradox, must needs have been moved, not
to say forced, by more powerful reasons. For this cause, I am
become very curious to dive, as they say, into the bottom of this
businesse, and account it my great good fortune that I have met
you two, from whom I may without any trouble, hear all that
hath been, and, haply, can be said on this argument, assuring
my self that the strength of your reasons will resolve all scruples,
and bring me to a certainty in this subject.</p>

Centre of the Universe, the Coelestial bodies all move, or else,
Whether the Starry Sphere and the Sun standing still in the Centre,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:96976:68"/>
the Earth is without the same, and owner of all those motions that

                        <p>And these two conclusions, are they not of such a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

                        <p>You insist upon <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who cannot speak. Yet I
tell you,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Aristotle</hi> would either refute his adversaries argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or would alter his opinion.</note> that if <hi>Aristotle</hi> were here, he would either yield him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be perswaded by us, or refuting our arguments, convince
us by better of his own. And you your self, when you heard the
experiments of the Suns related, did you not acknowledg and
admire them, and confesse them more concludent than those of
<hi>Aristotle?</hi> Yet neverthelesse I cannot perceive that <hi>Salviatus,</hi>
who hath produced them, examined them, and with exquisite
care scan'd them, doth confesse himself perswaded by them; no
nor by others of greater force, which he intimated that he was
about to give us an account of. And I know not on what grounds
you should censure Nature, as one that for many Ages hath
been lazie, and forgetful to produce speculative <hi>wits;</hi> and
that knoweth not how to make more such, unlesse they be such
kind of men as slavishly giving up their judgments to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> do
understand with his brain, and resent with his senses. But let us
hear the residue of those reasons which favour his opinion, that
we may thereupon proceed to speak to them; comparing and
weighing them in the ballance of impartiality.</p>

him, as if I were his <hi>Zany;</hi> but what hath been effected in
my private thoughts by these arguments which I seem to alledg in
his favour, I would not have you to judg by what I say, whil'st
I am in the heat of acting my part in the Fable; but after I have
laid by my disguise, for you may chance to find me different
from what you see me upon the Stage. Now let us go on.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ptolomy</hi> and his followers produce another experiment like to
that of the Projections,<note place="margin">An argument taken from the Clouds, and from Birds.</note> and it is of things that being separated
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:96976:69"/>
from the Earth, continue a good space of time in the Air, such
as are the Clouds, Birds of flight; and as of them it cannot be
said that they are rapt or transparted by the Earth, having no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hesion
thereto, it seems not possible, that they should be able to
keep pace with the velocity thereof; nay it should rather seem
to us, that they all swiftly move towards the West: And if
being carried about by the Earth, passe our parallel in twenty
four hours, which yet is at least sixteen thousand miles, how can
Birds follow such a course or revolution? Whereas on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
we see them fly as well towards the East, as towards the
West,<note place="margin">An argument taken from the air which we feel to beat upon us when we run a Horse at full speed.</note> or any other part, without any sensible difference. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
if when we run a Horse at his speed, we feel the air beat
vehemently against our face, what an impetuous blast ought we
perpetually to feel from the East, being carried with so rapid a
course against the wind? and yet no such effect is perceived. Take
another very ingenious argument inferred from the following ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment.
<note place="margin">An argument taken from the whirling of circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar motion, which hath a faculty to extrude and dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate.</note> The circular motion hath a faculty to extrude and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipate
from its Centre the parts of the moving body, whensoever
either the motion is not very slow, or those parts are not very
well fastened together; and therefore, if <hi>v. g.</hi> we should turn
one of those great wheels very fast about, wherein one or more
men walking, crane up very great weights, as the huge massie
stone, used by the Callander for pressing of Cloaths; or the
fraighted Barks which being haled on shore, are hoisted out of
one river into another; in case the parts of that same Wheel so
swiftly turn'd round, be not very well joyn'd and pin'd together,
they would all be shattered to pieces; and though many stones or
other ponderous substances, should be very fast bound to its outward
Rimme, yet could they not resist the impetuosity, which with
great violence would hurl them every way far from the Wheel,
and consequently from its Centre. So that if the Earth did move
with such and so much greater velocity, what gravity, what tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of lime or plaister would keep together Stones, Buildings, and
whole Cities, that they should not be tost into the Air by so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitous
a motion? And both men and beasts, which are not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened
to the Earth, how could they resist so great an <hi>impetus?</hi>
Whereas, on the other side, we see both these, and far lesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistances
of pebles, sands, leaves rest quietly on the Earth, and
to return to it in falling, though with a very slow motion. See
here, <hi>Simplicius,</hi> the most potent arguments, taken, to so speak,
from things Terrestrial; there remain those of the other kind,
namely, such as have relation to the appearances of Heaven,
which reasons, to confesse the truth, tend more to prove the
Earth to be in the centre of the Universe, and consequently, to
deprive it of the annual motion about the same, ascribed unto it
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:96976:69"/>
by <hi>Copernicus.</hi> Which arguments, as being of somewhat a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

                        <p>The first Argument alledged by <hi>Simplicius,</hi> if I well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
it, was this. The Earth cannot move circularly, because
such motion would be violent to the same, and therefore not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual:
that it is violent, the reason was: Because, that had it been
natural, its parts would likewise naturally move round, which is
impossible, for that it is natural for the parts thereof to move with a
right motion downwards. To this my reply is, that I could glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wish,<note place="margin">The answer t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

                              <hi>Aristotles</hi> first ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</note> that <hi>Aristotle</hi> had more cleerly exprest himself, where he
said; That its parts would likewise move circularly; for this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
circularly is to be understood two wayes, one is, that every
particle or atome separated from its <hi>Whole</hi> would move circularly
about its particular centre, describing its small Circulets; the other
is, that the whole Globe moving about its centre in twenty four
hours, the parts also would turn about the same centre in four and
twenty hours. The first would be no lesse an impertinency, than
if one should say, that every part of the circumference of a Circle
ought to be a Circle; or because that the Earth is Spherical, that
therefore every part thereof be a Globe, for so doth the <hi>Axiome</hi>
require: <hi>Eadem est ratio totius, &amp; partium.</hi> But if he took it in
the other sense, to wit, that the parts in imitation of the <hi>Whole</hi>
should move naturally round the Centre of the whole Globe in
twenty four hours, I say, that they do so; and it concerns you,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:96976:70"/>
instead of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> to prove that they do not.</p>

                        <p>This is proved by <hi>Aristotle</hi> in the same place, when he
saith, that the natural motion of the parts is the right motion
downwards to the centre of the Universe; so that the circular
motion cannot naturally agree therewith.</p>

                        <p>Doth not he say that the circular motion of the Earth

                        <p>But if that which is violent cannot be eternal,<note place="margin">That which is violent, cannot be eternal, and that which cannot be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, cannot be natural.</note> then by
conversion, that which cannot be eternal, cannot be natural: but
the motion of the Earth downwards cannot be otherwise eternal;

the Earth move with a circular motion, this may be eternal to it,

                        <p>Therefore you may see how of your own accord you
have confessed it impossible that any moveable should move eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
in a right line,<note place="margin">Right motion cannot be eternal, and consequently cannot be natural to the Earth.</note> in regard that right motion, whether it be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
or downwards, is by you your self bounded by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference

be eternal, yet forasmuch as the right motion is not of its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
eternall, but most<note n="*" place="margin">Terminatissimo.</note> terminate, it cannot naturally suit with
the Earth. Nay, as was said<note n="*" place="margin">By this expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he every where means the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Dialogue, or <hi>Giornata.</hi>
                           </note> yesterday, <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself is
constrained to make the Terrestrial Globe eternally immoveable.
When again you say, that the parts of the Earth evermore move
downwards, all impediments being removed, you egregiously equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate;
for then, on the other side they must be impeded, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
and forced, if you would have them move; for, when they
are once fallen to the ground, they must be violently thrown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
that they may a second time fall; and as to the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
these only hinder its arrival at the centre; but if there were
a <hi>Well,</hi> that did passe thorow and beyond the centre, yet would not
a cold of Earth passe beyond it, unlesse inasmuch as being trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by its <hi>impetus,</hi> it should passe the same to return thither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and in the end there to rest. As therefore to the defending,
that the motion by a right line doth or can agree naturally neither
to the Earth, nor to any other moveable, whil'st the Universe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
its perfect order, I would have you take no further paines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it, but (unlesse you will grant them the circular motion)
your best way will be to defend and maintain their immobility.</p>

                        <p>I alwayes carry it about with me: See here it is, and
I know the place perfectly well, which is in <hi>lib. 2. De Coelo, cap.
16.</hi> Here it is, <hi>Text 97. Preterea omnia, quae feruntur latione

if it be so, there would of necessity be alterations and conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
made amongst the fixed Stars. But no such thing is seen to
be done, but the same Star doth alwayes rise and set in the same
place. In all this I find not any falacy, and my thinks the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                        <p>And this new reading of the place hath confirmed me
in the fallacy of the Sillogisme, and moreover, discovered ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
falsity. Therefore observe. The Positions, or if you will,
Conclusions, which <hi>Aristotle</hi> endeavours to oppose, are two; one
is that of those, who placing the Earth in the midst of the World,
do make it move in it self about its own centre. The other is of
those, who constituting it far from the middle, do make it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
with a circular motion about the middle of the Universe.
And both these Positions he conjointly impugneth with one and
the same argument. Now I affirm that he is out in both the one
and the other impugnation; and that his error against the first
Position is an Equivoke or Paralogisme;<note place="margin">

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:96976:71"/>
mobile</hi>) therefore the Earth moving about its own centre,
being placed in the middle, must of necessity have two byasse,
and foreslow. But if this were so, it would follow, that there
should be a variation in the rising and setting of the fixed Stars,
which we do not perceive to be done: Therefore the Earth doth
not move, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here is the Paralogisme, and to discover it, I will
argue with <hi>Aristotle</hi> in this manner. Thou saist, oh <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
that the Earth placed in the middle of the World, cannot move
in it self (<hi>i. e.</hi> upon its own <hi>axis</hi>) for then it would be requisite
to allow it two byasses; so that, if it should not be necessary to
allow it more than one Byas onely, thou wouldest not then hold
it impossible for it to move onely with that one; for thou would'st
unnecessarily have confined the impossibility to the plurality of
byasses, if in case it had no more but one, yet it could not move
with that. And because that of all the moveables in the World,
thou makest but one alone to move with one sole byas; and all
the rest with more than one; and this same moveable thou af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmest
to be the first Sphere, namely, that by which all the fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and erratick Stars seem harmoniously to move from East to
West, if in case the Earth may be that first Sphere, that by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
with one byas onely, may make the Stars appear to move
from East to West, thou wilt not deny them it: But he that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth,
that the Earth being placed in the midst of the World,
moveth about its own Axis, ascribes unto it no other motion,
save that by which all the Stars appear to move from East to West;
and so it cometh to be that first Sphere, which thou thy self ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgest
to move with but one byas onely. It is therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
oh <hi>Aristotle,</hi> if thou wilt conclude any thing, that thou
demonstrate, that the Earth being placed in the midst of the
World, cannot move with so much as one byas onely; or else,
that much lesse can the first Sphere have one sole motion; for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
thou doest in thy very Sillogisme both commit the falacy,
and detect it, denying, and at that very time proving the same
thing. I come now to the second Position, namely, of those
who placing the Earth far from the midst of the Universe, make
it moveable about the same; that is, make it a Planet and erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Star; against which the argument is directed, and as to
form is concludent, but faileth in matter. For it being granted,
that the Earth doth in that manner move, and that with two by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asses,
yet doth it not necessarily follow that though it were so,
it should make alterations in the risings and settings of the fixed
Stars, as I shall in its proper place declare. And here I could
gladly excuse <hi>Aristotle;</hi> rather I could highly applaud him for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
light upon the most subtil argument that could be produced
against the <hi>Copernican Hypothesis;</hi> and if the objection be inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:96976:72"/>
and to outward appearance most powerful, you may see
how much more acute and ingenious the solution must be, and
not to be found by a wit lesse piercing than that of <hi>Copernicus;</hi>
and again from the difficulty in understanding it, you may argue
the so much greater difficulty in finding it. But let us for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
suspend our answer, which you shall understand in due time
and place, after we have repeated the objection of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and
that in his favour, much strengthened. Now passe we to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotles</hi>
third Argument,<note place="margin">The answer to the third argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> touching which we need give no farther
reply, it having been sufficiently answered betwixt the discourses
of yesterday and to day: In as much as he urgeth, that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of grave bodies is naturally by a right line to the centre; and
then enquireth, whether to the centre of the Earth, or to that
of the Universe, and concludeth that they tend naturally to the
centre of the Universe, but accidentally to that of the Earth.
Therefore we may proceed to the fourth,<note place="margin">The answer to the fourth argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> upon which its requisite
that we stay some time, by reason it is founded upon that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment,
from whence the greater part of the remaining argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
derive all their strength. <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith therefore, that it is
a most convincing argument of the Earths immobility, to see
that projections thrown or shot upright, return perpendicularly
by the same line unto the same place from whence they were shot
or thrown. And this holdeth true, although the motion be of a
very great height; which could never come to passe, did the
Earth move: for in the time that the projected body is moving
upwards and downwards in a state of separation from the Earth,
the place from whence the motion of the projection began, would
be past, by means of the Earths revolution, a great way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the East, and look how great that space was, so far from
that place would the projected body in its descent come to the
ground. So that hither may be referred the argument taken from
a bullet shot from a Canon directly upwards; as also that other
used by <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> of the grave bodies that falling
from on high, are observed to descend by a direct and perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
line to the surface of the Earth. Now that I may begin to unite
these knots, I demand of <hi>Simplicius</hi> that in case one should deny
to <hi>Ptolomy</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> that weights in falling freely from on
high, descend by a right and perpendicular line, that is, directly
to the centre, what means he would use to prove it?</p>

that Tower or other altitude, is upright and perpendicular, and
sheweth us that that stone, or other grave body, doth slide along
the Wall, without inclining a hairs breadth to one side or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

it was let fall.</p>

                        <p>But if it should happen that the Terrestrial Globe did
move round, and consequently carry the Tower also along with
it, and that the stone did then also grate and slide along the side of
the Tower, what must its motion be then?</p>

                        <p>In this case we may rather say its motions: for it
would have one wherewith to descend from the top of the Tower
to the bottom, and should necessarily have another to follow the
course of the said Tower.</p>

                        <p>So that its motion should be compounded of two, to
wit, of that wherewith it measureth the Tower, and of that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wherewith it followeth the same: From which composition
would follow, that the stone would no longer describe that simple
right and perpendicular line, but one transverse, and perhaps not
streight.</p>

                        <p>I can say nothing of its non-rectitude, but this I know
very well, that it would of necessity be transverse, and different
from the other directly perpendicular, which it doth describe, the

                        <p>I would, in favour of <hi>Simplicius,</hi> defend <hi>Aristotle</hi> if it
were possible, or at least better satisfie my self concerning the
strength of your illation. You say, that the seeing the stone rake
along the Tower, is not sufficient to assure us, that its motion is
perpendicular (which is the middle term of the Syllogism) unless
it be presupposed, that the Earth standeth still, which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
to be proved: For that if the Tower did move together
with the Earth, and the stone did slide along the same, the motion
of the stone would be transverse, and not perpendicular. But I
shall answer, that should the Tower move, it would be impossible
that the stone should fail gliding along the side of it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
from its falling in that manner the stability of the Earth is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.</p>

                        <speaker>SIMPL.</speaker>
                        <p>It is so; for if you would have the stone in descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to grate upon the Tower, though it were carried round by
the Earth, you must allow the stone two natural motions, to wit,
the straight motion towards the Centre, and the circular about
the Centre, the which is impossible.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Aristotles</hi> defense then consisteth in the impossibilitie,
or at least in his esteeming it an impossibility, that the stone should
move with a motion mixt of right and circular: for if he did
not hold it impossible that the stone could move to the Centre,
and about the Centre at once, he must have understood, that it
might come to pass that the cadent stone might in its descent, race
the Tower as well when it moved as when it stood still; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
he must have perceived, that from this grating nothing
could be inferred touching the mobility or immobility of the
Earth. But this doth not any way excuse <hi>Aristotle;</hi> aswell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he ought to have exprest it, if he had had such a conceit, it
being so material a part of his Argument; as also because it can
neither be said that such an effect is impossible, nor that <hi>Aristotle</hi>
did esteem it so. The first cannot be affirmed, for that by and
by I shall shew that it is not onely possible, but necessary: nor
much less can the second be averred,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Aristotle</hi> admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that the Fire moveth directly upwards by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent by participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> for that <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself
granteth fire to move naturally upwards in a right line, and to
move about with the diurnal motion, imparted by Heaven to the
whole Element of Fire, and the greater part of the Air: If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he held it not impossible to mix the right motion upwards,
with the circular communicated to the Fire and Air from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave
of the Moon, much less ought he to account impossible the
mixture of the right motion downwards of the stone, with the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:96976:73"/>
circular which we presuppose natural to the whole Terrestrial
Globe, of which the stone is a part.</p>

                        <p>I see no such thing: for if the element of Fire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
round together with the Air, it is a very easie, yea a necessary
thing, that a spark of fire which from the Earth mounts upwards,
in passing thorow the moving air, should receive the same motion,
being a body so thin, light, and easie to be moved: but that a
very heavy stone, or a Canon bullet, that descendeth from on
high, and that is at liberty to move whither it will, should suffer
it self to be transported either by the air or any other thing, is
altogether incredible. Besides that, we have the Experiment,
which is so proper to our purpose, of the stone let fall from the
round top of the Mast of a ship, which when the ship lyeth still,
falleth at the Partners of the Mast; but when the ship saileth, falls
so far distant from that place, by how far the ship in the time of
the stones falling had run forward; which will not be a few fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms,
when the ships course is swift.</p>

                        <p>There is a great disparity between the case of the Ship
and that of the Earth,<note place="margin">The disparity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the fall of a stone from the round top of a ship, and from the top of a tower.</note> if the Terrestrial Globe be supposed to have

of the Ship, as it is not natural to it, so the motion of all those
things that are in it is accidental, whence it is no wonder that the
stone which was retained in the round top, being left at liberty,
descendeth downwards without any obligation to follow the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Ship. But the diurnal conversion is ascribed to the
Terrestrial Globe for its proper and natural motion, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
it is so to all the parts of the said Globe; and, as being
impress'd by nature, is indelible in them; and therefore that stone
that is on the top of the Tower hath an intrinsick inclination of
revolving about the Centre of its <hi>Whole</hi> in twenty four hours, and
this same natrual instinct it exerciseth eternally, be it placed in any
state whatsoever. And to be assured of the truth of this, you
have no more to do but to alter an antiquated impression made
in your mind; and to say, Like as in that I hitherto holding it to
be the property of the Terrestrial Globe to rest immoveable about
its Centre, did never doubt or question but that all whatsoever
particles thereof do also naturally remain in the same state of rest:
So it is reason, in case the Terrestrial Globe did move round by
natural instinct in twenty four hours, that the intrinsick and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
inclination of all its parts should also be, not to stand still, but
to follow the same revolution. And thus without running into
any inconvenience, one may conclude, that in regard the motion
conferred by the force of<note n="*" place="margin">That you may not suspect my transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or wonder what Oars have to do with a ship, you are to know that the Author intends the Gallies used in the Mediterrane.</note> Oars on the Ship, and by it on all the
things that are contained within her, is not natural but forreign, it
is very reasonable that that stone, it being separated from the ship,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:96976:74"/>
do reduce its self to its natural disposure, and return to exercise
its pure simple instinct given it by nature.<note place="margin">The part of the Air inferiour to the higher moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains doth follow the motion of the Earth.</note> To this I add, that
it's necessary, that at least that part of the Air which is beneath the
greater heights of mountains, should be transported and carried
round by the roughness of the Earths surface; or that, as being
mixt with many Vapours, and terrene Exhalations, it do na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
follow the diurnal motion, which occurreth not in the
Air about the ship rowed by Oars: So that your arguing
from the ship to the Tower hath not the force of an illation;
because that stone which falls from the round top of the Mast,
entereth into a <hi>medium,</hi> which is unconcern'd in the motion
of the ship: but that which departeth from the top of the Tower,
finds a <hi>medium</hi> that hath a motion in common with the whole Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial
Globe; so that without being hindred, rather being assisted
by the motion of the air, it may follow the universal course of the
Earth.</p>

                        <p>I cannot conceive that the air can imprint in a very

suppose of two hundred weight, the motion wherewith its self is
moved, and which it doth perhaps communicate to feathers, snow,

being exposed to any the most impetuous wind, is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
removed an inch from its place; now consider with your self
whether the air will carry it along therewith.</p>

                        <p>There is great difference between your experiment and
our case. You introduce the wind blowing against that stone,
supposed in a state of rest, and we expose to the air, which already
moveth, the stone which doth also move with the same velocity;
so that the air is not to conferr a new motion upon it, but onely
to maintain, or to speak better, not to hinder the motion already
acquired: you would drive the stone with a strange and preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
motion, and we desire to conserve it in its natural. If
you would produce a more pertinent experiment, you should say,
that it is observed, if not with the eye of the forehead, yet with
that of the mind, what would evene, if an eagle that is carried by
the course of the wind, should let a stone fall from its talons;
which, in regard that at its being let go, it went along with the
wind, and after it was let fall it entered into a <hi>medium</hi> that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with equal velocity, I am very confident that it would not be
seen to descend in its fall perpendicularly, but that following the
course of the wind, and adding thereto that of its particular gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
it would move with a transverse motion.</p>

tell me, <hi>Simplicius,</hi> do you really believe, that the Experiment of

evene in the Terrestrial Globe?</p>

                        <p>As yet I am of that opinion; and though you have
alledged some small disparities, I do not think them of so great

                        <p>I rather desire that you would continue therein, and
hold for certain, that the effect of the Earth would exactly answer
that of the ship: provided, that when it shall appear prejudicial to
your cause, you would not be humorous and alter your thoughts.
You may haply say, Forasmuch as when the ship stands still, the
stone falls at the foot of the Mast, and when she is under sail, it
lights far from thence, that therefore by conversion, from the stones
falling at the foot is argued the ships standing still, and from its
falling far from thence is argued her moving; and because that
which occurreth to the ship, ought likewise to befall the Earth:
that therefore from the falling of the stone at the foot of the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is necessarily inferred the immobility of the Terrestrial Globe.
Is not this your argumentation?</p>

the ascertaining whether the vessel doth stand still or move?</p>

remit the same to their Predecessors, without ever arriving at one
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:96976:75"/>
that had made the experiment: for whoever shall examine the
same, shall find the event succeed quite contrary to what hath

move, and with what velocity? But take notice that I instanced
in a Ball exactly round, and a plain exquisitely polished, that all
external and accidental impediments might be taken away. And
so would I have you remove all obstructions caused by the Airs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance

                        <p>I very well understand your meaning, and as to your
demand, I answer, that the Ball would continue to move <hi>in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitum,</hi>
if the inclination of the plain should so long last, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
with an accelerating motion; for such is the nature of
ponderous moveables, that <hi>vires acquirant eundo:</hi> and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
the declivity was, the greater the velocity would be.</p>

                        <speaker>SIMPL.</speaker>
                        <p>Not spontaneously; but being drawn, or violently

                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>And in case it were thrust forward by the impression of

its motion be?</p>

                        <speaker>SIMPL.</speaker>
                        <p>The motion would go continually decreasing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarding,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:96976:76"/>
as being contrary to nature; and would be longer or
shorter, according to the greater or less impulse, and according to
the greater or less acclivity.</p>

                        <p>It seems, then, that hitherto you have explained to me
the accidents of a moveable upon two different Planes; and that
in the inclining plane, the grave moveable doth spontaneously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend,
and goeth continually accelerating, and that to retain it in
rest, force must be used therein: but that on the ascending plane,
there is required a force to thrust it forward, and also to stay it in
rest, and that the motion impressed goeth continually diminishing,
till that in the end it cometh to nothing. You say yet farther,
that in both the one and the other case, there do arise differences
from the planes having a greater or less declivity or acclivity; so
that the greater inclination is attended with the greater velocity;
and contrariwise, upon the ascending plane, the same moveable
thrown with the same force, moveth a greater distance, by how
much the elevation is less. Now tell me, what would befall the
same moveable upon a superficies that had neither acclivity nor
declivity?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SIMPL.</speaker>
                        <p>Here you must give me a little time to consider of an
answer. There being no declivity, there can be no natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to motion: and there being no acclivity, there can be no
resistance to being moved; so that there would arise an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between propension and resistance of motion; therefore,
methinks it ought naturally to stand still. But I had forgot my
self: it was but even now that <hi>Sagredus</hi> gave me to understand

                        <p>So I think, provided one did lay it down gently: but
if it had an <hi>impetus</hi> given it towards any part, what would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low?</p>

                        <p>There would follow, that it should move towards that
part.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>But with what kind of motion? with the continually
accelerated, as in declining planes; or with the successively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded,
as in those ascending.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SIMP.</speaker>
                        <p>I cannot tell how to discover any cause of acceleration,
or retardation, there being no declivity or acclivity.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>Well: but if there be no cause of retardation, much
less ought there to be any cause of rest. How long therefore
would you have the moveable to move?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SIMP.</speaker>
                        <p>As long as that superficies, neither inclined nor decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>Therefore if such a space were interminate, the motion
upon the same would likewise have no termination, that is, would
be perpetual.</p>

                        <speaker>SIMP.</speaker>
                        <p>I think so, if so be the moveable be of a matter

                        <p>That hath been already supposed, when it was said,
that all external and accidental impediments were removed, and
the brittlenesse of the moveable in this our case, is one of those
impediments accidental. Tell me now, what do you think is the
cause that that same Ball moveth spontaneously upon the inclining
plane, and not without violence upon the erected?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SIMP.</speaker>
                        <p>Because the inclination of grave bodies is to move to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the centre of the Earth, and onely by violence upwards to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the circumference; and the inclining superficies is that
which acquireth vicinity to the centre, and the ascending one,
remotenesse.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>Therefore a superficies, which should be neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
nor ascending, ought in all its parts to be equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from the centre. But is there any such superficies in the
World?</p>
                     </sp>

                        <speaker>SIMP.</speaker>
                        <p>There is no want thereof: Such is our Terrestrial
Globe, if it were more even, and not as it is rough and montai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous;
but you have that of the Water, at such time as it is calm

                        <p>Then a ship which moveth in a calm at Sea, is one of
those moveables, which run along one of those superficies that
are neither declining nor ascending, and therefore disposed, in
case all obstacles external and accidental were removed, to move
with the impulse once imparted incessantly and uniformly.</p>

                        <p>And that stone which is on the round top, doth not it
move, as being together with the ship carried about by the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference
of a Circle about the Centre; and therefore conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
by a motion in it indelible, if all extern obstacles be

                        <p>Then in good time recant, I pray you, that your last
conclusion, if you are satisfied with the truth of all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</p>

                        <speaker>SIMPL.</speaker>
                        <p>By my last conclusion, you mean, That that same
stone moving with a motion indelibly impressed upon it, is not to
leave, nay rather is to follow the ship, and in the end to light in
the self same place, where it falleth when the ship lyeth still; and
so I also grant it would do, in case there were no outward impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
that might disturb the stones motion, after its being let
go, the which impediments are two, the one is the moveables
inability to break through the air with its meer <hi>impetus</hi> onely, it
being deprived of that of the strength of Oars, of which it had
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:96976:77"/>
been partaker, as part of the ship, at the time that it was upon
the Mast; the other is the new motion of descent, which also
must needs be an hinderance of that other progressive motion.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>As to the impediment of the Air, I do not deny it
you; and if the thing falling were a light matter, as a feather,
or a lock of wool, the retardation would be very great, but in
an heavy stone is very exceeding small. And you your self but
even now did say, that the force of the most impetuous wind
sufficeth not to stir a great stone from its place; now do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what the calmer air is able to do, being encountred by a
stone no more swift than the whole ship. Neverthelesse, as I said
before, I do allow you this small effect, that may depend upon
such an impediment; like as I know, that you will grant to me,
that if the air should move with the same velocity that the ship
and stone hath, then the impediment would be nothing at all.
As to the other of the additional motion downwards; in the first
place it is manifest, that these two, I mean the circular, about
the centre, and the streight, towards the centre, are not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
or destructive to one another, or incompatible. Because that
as to the moveable, it hath no repugnance at all to such motions,
for you your self have already confest the repugnance to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the motion which removeth from the centre, and the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to be towards the motion which approacheth to the centre.
Whence it doth of necessity follow, that the moveable hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
repugnance, nor propension to the motion which neither ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth,
nor goeth from the centre, nor consequently is there
any cause for the diminishing in it the faculty impressed. And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as the moving cause is not one alone, which it hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the new operation of retardation; but that they are
two, distinct from each other, of which, the gravity attends on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the drawing of the moveable towards the centre, and the
vertue impress't to the conducting it about the centre, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
no occasion of impediment.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SIMPL.</speaker>
                        <p>Your argumentation, to give you your due, is very
probable; but in reality it is invelloped with certain intricacies,
that are not easie to be extricated. You have all along built upon
a supposition,<note place="margin">The project ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> is not moved by vertue impressed, but by the <hi>medium.</hi>
                           </note> which the <hi>Peripatetick</hi> Schools will not easily grant
you, as being directly contrary to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and it is to take for
known and manifest, That the project separated from the proji<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
continueth the motion by <hi>vertue impressed</hi> on it by the
said projicient, which <hi>vertue impressed</hi> is a thing as much dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
in <hi>Peripatetick</hi> Philosophy, as the passage of any accident
from one subject into another. Which doctrine doth hold, as I
believe it is well known unto you, that the project is carried by
the <hi>medium,</hi> which in our case happeneth to be the Air. And
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:96976:77"/>
therefore if that stone let fall from the round top, ought to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the motion of the ship, that effect should be ascribed to the
Air, and not to the vertue impressed. But you presuppose that
the Air doth not follow the motion of the ship, but is tranquil.
Moreover, he that letteth it fall, is not to throw it, or to give
it <hi>impetus</hi> with his arm, but ought barely to open his hand and let
it go; and by this means, the stone, neither through the vertue
impressed by the projicient, nor through the help of the Air,
shall be able to follow the ships motion, and therefore shall be
left behind.</p>

                        <p>I think then that you would say, that if the stone be
not thrown by the arm of that person, it is no longer a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>

nothing to do in the continuation of projects, after they are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated

force and violence throws his arm, with which jactation the
stone doth not move so much as the circumambient Air; so that
when the stone at its being forsaken by the hand, findeth it self
in the Air, which at the same time moveth with impetousity, it
is thereby born away; for, if the air did not operate, the stone
would fall at the foot of the projicient or thrower.</p>

                        <p>But, if that which moveth the projected substance, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it is delivered from the hand, be no other than the air moved
by the arm, and the moved air do more easily bear away light
than grave matters, how cometh it that the project of wool flieth
not farther, and swifter than that of stone? Certainly it argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that the stone hath some other impulse besides the motion of
the air. Furthermore, if two strings of equal length did hang
at yonder beam, and at the end of one there was fastened a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
of lead, and a ball of cotton wool at the other, and both
were carried to an equal distance from the perpendicular, and
then let go; it is not to be doubted, but that both the one and
the other would move towards the perpendicular, and that being
carried by their own <hi>impetus,</hi> they would go a certain space be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
it, and afterwards return thither again. But which of these
two pendent Globes do you think, would continue longest in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

                        <p>It is requisite then, that the projicient do confer mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                        <p>To this it is answered that the Air, in regard it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

receive every impulse, and also to retain the same.</p>

unto us, that the moveable, the lesse it had of gravity, the lesse

which in the Air hath no gravity at all, doth of it self alone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the motion acquired? I believe, and know that you by this

to rest, than doth the circumambient Air. Let's go into the
Chamber, and with a towel let us agitate the Air as much as we
can, and then holding the cloth still, let a little candle be

let a leaf of beaten Gold be left at liberty to flie any way, and you
shall by the calm vagation of them be assured that the Air is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately

a thing is it, that that same small filament of air, impelled by
the bow-string, should in despite of fate go along with the arrow?
But I would willingly know another particular of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> to
which I intreat <hi>Simplicius</hi> would vouchsafe me an answer. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that with the same Bow there were shot two arrows, one
just after the usual manner, and the other side-wayes, placing it
long-wayes upon the Bow-string, and then letting it flie, I would
know which of them would go farthest. Favour me, I pray you
with an answer, though the question may seem to you rather
ridiculous than otherwise; and excuse me, for that I, who am, as
you see, rather blockish, than not, can reach no higher with my
speculative faculty.</p>

                        <p>I have never seen an arrow shot in that manner, yet

                        <p>And for that I am of the same opinion, hence it is, that
I have a doubt risen in me, whether <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth not contradict
experience. For as to experience, if I lay two arrows upon this
Table, in a time vvhen a strong Wind blovveth, one tovvards
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:96976:79"/>
the course of the wind, and the other sidelong, the wind will
quickly carry away this later, and leave the other where it was;
and the same to my seeming, ought to happen, if the Doctrine of
<hi>Aristotle</hi> were true, of those two shot out of a Bow: forasmuch
as the arrow shot sideways is driven by a great quantity of Air,
moved by the bowstring, to wit by as much as the said string is
long, whereas the other arrow receiveth no greater a quantity of
air, than the small circle of the strings thickness. And I cannot
imagine what may be the reason of such a difference, but would
fain know the same.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SIMP.</speaker>
                        <p>The cause seemeth to me sufficiently manifest; and it
is, because the arrow shot endways, hath but a little quantity of
air to penetrate, and the other is to make its way through a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
as great as its whole length.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>Then it seems the arrows shot, are to penetrate the air?
but if the air goeth along with them, yea, is that which carrieth
them, what penetration can they make therein? Do you not see
that, in this case, the arrow would of necessity move with greater
velocity than the air? and this greater velocity, what doth confer
it on the arrow? Will you say the air giveth them a velocity
greater than its own? Know then, <hi>Simplicius,</hi> that the business
proceeds quite contrary to that which <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith,<note place="margin">The <hi>medium</hi> doth impede and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the motion of projects.</note> and that the
<hi>medium</hi> conferreth the motion on the project, is as false, as it is
true, that it is the onely thing which procureth its obstruction; and
having known this, you shall understand without finding any thing
whereof to make question, that if the air be really moved, it doth
much better carry the dart along with it longways, than endways,
for that the air which impelleth it in that posture, is much, and in
this very little. But shooting with the Bow, forasmuch as the air
stands still, the transverse arrow, being to force its passage through
much air, comes to be much impeded, and the other that was nock't
easily overcometh the obstruction of the small quantity of air,
which opposeth it self thereto.</p>

                        <p>How many Propositions have I observed in <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
(meaning still in Natural Philosophy) that are not onely false,
but false in such sort, that its diametrical contrary is true, as it
happens in this case. But pursuing the point in hand, I think that
<hi>Simplicius</hi> is perswaded, that, from seeing the stone always to fall
in the same place, he cannot conjecture either the motion or sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of the Ship: and if what hath been hitherto spoken,
should not suffice, there is the Experiment of the <hi>medium</hi> which
may thorowly assure us thereof; in which experiment, the most
that could be seen would be, that the cadent moveable might be
left behind, if it were light, and that the air did not follow the
motion of the ship: but in case the air should move with equal
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:96976:79"/>
velocity, no imaginable diversity could be found either in this,
or any other experiment whatsoever, as I am anon to tell you.
Now if in this case there appeareth no difference at all, what can
be pretended to be seen in the stone falling from the top of the
Tower, where the motion in gyration is not adventitious, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental,
but natural and eternal; and where the air exactly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
the motion of the Tower, and the Tower that of the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial
Globe? have you any thing else to say, <hi>Simplicius,</hi> upon
this particular?</p>

                        <p>If it be true, that the <hi>impetus</hi> wherewith the ship moves,
doth remain indelibly impress'd in the stone, after it is let fall from
the Mast; and if it be farther true, that this motion brings no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment
or retardment to the motion directly downwards, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
to the stone:<note place="margin">An admirable accident in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of projects.</note> it's necessary, that there do an effect ensue of
a very wonderful nature. Let a Ship be supposed to stand still,
and let the time of the falling of a stone from the Masts Round-top
to the ground, be two beats of the pulse; let the Ship afterwards
be under sail, and let the same stone depart from the same place,
and it, according to what hath been premised, shall still take up
the time of two pulses in its fall, in which time the ship will have
run, suppose, twenty yards; so that the true motion of the stone
will be a transverse line, considerably longer than the first straight
and perpendicular line, which is the length of the<note n="*" place="margin">By the length of the mast he means the distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck and Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top.</note> Mast, and yet
nevertheless the<note n="*" place="margin">La palla.</note> stone will have past it in the same time. Let
it be farther supposed, that the Ships motion is much more accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
so that the stone in falling shall be to pass a transverse line
much longer than the other; and in sum, increasing the Ships ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity
as much as you will, the falling stone shall describe its trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
lines still longer and longer, and yet shall pass them all in
those self same two pulses. And in this fashion, if a Canon were
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:96976:80"/>
level'd on the top of a Tower, and shots were made therewith
point blank, that is, paralel to the Horizon, let the Piece have a
greater or less charge, so as that the ball may fall sometimes a
thousand yards distant, sometimes four thousand, sometimes six,
sometimes ten, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all these shots shall curry or finish their
ranges in times equal to each other, and every one equal to the
time which the ball would take to pass from the mouth of the
Piece to the ground, being left, without other impulse, to fall
simply downwards in a perpendicular line. Now it seems a very
admirable thing, that in the same short time of its falling perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicularly
down to the ground, from the height of, suppose, an
hundred yards, the same ball, being thrust violently out of the
Piece by the Fire, should be able to pass one while four hundred,
another while a thousand, another while four, another while ten
thousand yards, so as that the said ball in all shots made point
blank, always continueth an equal time in the air.</p>

                        <p>The consideration for its novelty is very pretty, and if
the effect be true, very admirable: and of the truth thereof, I
make no question: and were it not for the accidental impediment
of the air, I verily believe, that, if at the time of the balls going
out of the Piece, another were let fall from the same height di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
downwards, they would both come to the ground at the
same instant, though that should have curried ten thousand
miles in its range, and this but an hundred onely: presupposing
the surface of the Earth to be equal, which to be assured of, the
experiment may be made upon some lake. As for the impediment
which might come from the air, it would consist in retarding the
extreme swift motion of the shot. Now, if you think fit, we will
proceed to the solution of the other Objections, seeing that <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicius</hi>
(as far as I can see) is convinc'd of the nullity of this first,
taken from things falling from on high downwards.</p>

fault is my own, as not being of so easie and quick an apprehension
as <hi>Sagredus.</hi> And it seems to me, that if this motion, of which
the stone did partake whilst it was on the Round-top of the Ships
Mast, be, as you say, to conserve it self indelibly in the said stone,
even after it is separated from the Ship, it would follow, that like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in case any one, riding a horse that was upon his speed, should
let a bowl drop out of his hand, that bowl being fallen to the
ground would continue its motion and follow the horses steps,
without tarrying behind him: the which effect, I believe, is not
to be seen, unless when he that is upon the horse should throw it
with violence that way towards which he runneth; but otherwise,
I believe it will stay on the ground in the same place where it
fell.</p>

                        <p>I believe that you very much deceive your self, and am
certain, that experience will shew you the contrary, and that the ball
being once arrived at the ground, will run together with the horse,
not staying behind him, unless so far as the asperity and uneven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Earth shall hinder it. And the reason seems to me
very manifest: for if you, standing still, throw the said ball a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
the ground, do you think it would not continue its motion
even after you had delivered it out of your hand? and that for so
much a greater space, by how much the superficies were more
smooth, so that <hi>v. g.</hi> upon ice it would run a great way?</p>

                        <p>There is no doubt of it, if I give it <hi>impetus</hi> with my
arm; but in the other case it is supposed, that he who is upon the
horse, onely drops it out of his hand.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>So I desire that it should be: but when you throw it
with your arm, what other remaineth to the ball being once gone
out of your hand, than the motion received from your arm, which
motion being conserved in the boul, it doth continue to carry it
forward? Now, what doth it import, that that <hi>impetus</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
on the ball rather from the arm than from the horse? Whilst
you were on horseback, did not your hand, and consequently the
ball run as fast as the horse it self? Doubtless it did: therefore
in onely opening of the hand, the ball departs with the motion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
coceived, not from your arm, by your particular motion,
but from the motion dependant on the said horse, which cometh to
be communicated to you, to your arm, to your hand, and lastly to
the ball. Nay, I will tell you farther, that if the rider upon his
speed fling the ball with his arm to the part contrary to the course,
it shall, after it is fallen to the ground, sometimes (albeit thrown to
the contrary part) follow the course of the horse, and sometimes lie
still on the ground; and shall onely move contrary to the said
course, when the motion received from the arm, shall exceed that
of the carrier in velocity. And it is a vanity, that of some, who
say that a horseman is able to cast a javelin thorow the air, that
way which the horse runs, and with the horse to follow and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the same; and lastly, to catch it again. It is, I say, a vanity,
for that to make the project return into the hand, it is requisite to
cast it upwards, in the same manner as if you stood still. For, let
the carrier be never so swift, provided it be uniform, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
not over-light, it shall always fall back again into the hand of
the projicient, though never so high thrown.</p>

                        <p>By this Doctrine I come to know some Problems very
curious upon this subject of projections;<note place="margin">Sundry curious Problems, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the motions of projects.</note> the first of which must
seem very strange to <hi>Simplicius.</hi> And the Problem is this; I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it to be possible, that the ball being barely dropt or let fall,
by one that any way runneth very swiftly, being arrived at the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:96976:81"/>
Earth, doth not onely follow the course of that person, but doth
much out go him. Which Problem is connexed with this, that
the moveable being thrown by the projicient above the plane of
the Horizon, may acquire new velocity, greater by far than that
confer'd upon it by the projicient. The which effect I have with
admiration observed, in looking upon those who use the sport of
tops, which, so soon as they are set out of the hand, are seen to
move in the air with a certain velocity, the which they afterwards
much encrease at their coming to the ground; and if whipping
them, they rub at any uneven place that makes them skip on high,
they are seen to move very slowly through the air, and falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to the Earth, they still come to move with a greater velocity:
But that which is yet more strange, I have farther observed, that
they not onely turn always more swiftly on the ground, than in
the air, but of two spaces both upon the Earth, sometimes a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the second space is more swift than in the first. Now what
would <hi>Simplicius</hi> say to this?</p>

the same. He would say again, in the third place, that if

the same, he would account you a great Daemon.</p>

                        <p>In its reeling there are parts, that is the uppermost, which
do move contrary to the inferiour; therefore you must instance
which it shall obey: for as to the parts ascending and descending,
the one kind will not yield to the other; nor will they all go
downwards, being hindered by the Earth, nor upwards as being
heavy.</p>

                        <p>The top will run reeling along the floor towards that

                        <speaker>SAGR.</speaker>

                        <speaker>SIMP.</speaker>
                        <p>Because those upon the ground happen to be impeded
by the roughness of the touch, that is, by the floors unevenness;
but the superiour, which are in the tenuous and flexible air, are
hindred very little, if at all; and therefore the top will obey their
inclination.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SAGR.</speaker>
                        <p>So that that taction, if I may so say, of the neither
parts on the floor, is the cause that they stay, and onely the upper
parts spring the top forward.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>And therefore, if the top should fall upon the ice, or
other very smooth superficies, it would not so well run forward, but
might peradventure continue to revolve in it self, (or sleep) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
acquiring any progressive motion.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SAGR.</speaker>
                        <p>It is an easie thing for it so to do; but yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
it would not so speedily come to sleep, as when it falleth on
a superficies somewhat rugged. But tell me, <hi>Simplicius,</hi> when
the top-turning round about it self, in that manner, is let fall, why
doth it not move forwards in the air, as it doth afterwards when it
is upon the ground?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SIMP.</speaker>
                        <p>Because having air above it, and beneath, neither those
parts, nor these have any where to touch, and not having more oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to go forward than backward, it falls perpendicularly.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SAGR.</speaker>
                        <p>So then the onely reeling about its self, without other
<hi>impetus,</hi> can drive the top forward, being arrived at the ground,
very nimbly. Now proceed we to what remains. That lash,
which the driver tyeth to his Top-stick, and with which, winding
it about the top, he sets it (<hi>i. e.</hi> makes it go) what effect hath it on
the said top?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SIMP.</speaker>
                        <p>It constrains it to turn round upon its toe, that so it may
free it self from the Top-lash.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SAGR.</speaker>
                        <p>So then, when the top arriveth at the ground, it cometh
all the way turning about its self, by means of the lash. Hath it
not reason then to move in it self more swiftly upon the ground,
than it did whilst it was in the air?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SIMP.</speaker>
                        <p>Yes doubtless; for in the air it had no other impulse
than that of the arm of the projicient; and if it had also the reel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
this (as hath been said) in the air drives it not forward at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but arriving at the floor, to the motion of the arm is added the
progression of the reeling, whereby the velocity is redoubled. And
I know already very well, that the top skipping from the ground,
its velocity will deminish, because the help of its circulation is
wanting; and returning to the Earth will get it again, and by that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:96976:82"/>
means move again faster, than in the air. It onely rests for me to
understand, whether in this second motion on the Earth it move
more swiftly, than in the first; for then it would move <hi>in infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
alwayes accelerating.</p>

                        <p>I did not absolutely affirm, that this second motion is
more swift than the first; but that it may happen so to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</p>

it turn round (<hi>i. e.</hi> setting it) what will it do at its coming to

                           <hi>Chiosa,</hi> and that falling side-wayes upon
the same, it do acquire the motion of turning round upon its toe,
wherewith it afterwards continueth to move progressively on the

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SAGR.</speaker>
                        <p>You see then that in some case it may acquire a new
revolution. When then the top jerked up from the ground, falleth
down again, why may it not casually hit upon the declivity of
some stone fixed in the floor, and that hath an inclination that
way towards which it moveth, and acquiring by that slip a new
whirle over and above that conferred by the lash, why may it
not redouble its motion, and make it swifter than it was at its
first lighting upon the ground?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SIMP.</speaker>
                        <p>Now I see that the same may easily happen. And I
am thinking that if the top should turn the contrary way, in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving
at the ground, it would work a contrary effect, that is,
the motion of the accidental whirl would retard that of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jicient.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SAGR.</speaker>
                        <p>And it would sometimes wholly retard and stop it, in
case the revolution of the top were very swift. And from hence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth
the resolution of that slight, which the more skilful Tennis
Players use to their advantage; that is, to gull their adversary by
cutting (for so is their Phrase) the Ball; which is, to return it
with a side Rachet, in such a manner, that it doth thereby ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a motion by it self contrary to the projected motion, and so
by that means, at its coming to the ground, the rebound, which
if the ball did not turn in that manner, would be towards the
adversary, giving him the usual time to tosse it back again, doth
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:96976:83"/>
fail, and the ball runs tripping along the ground, or rebounds lesse
than usual, and breaketh the time of the return. Hence it is
that you see, those who play at<note n="*" place="margin">A Game in <hi>Italy,</hi> wherein they strive who shall trundle or throw a wooden bowle neerest to an assigned mark.</note> Stool-ball, when they play in
a stony way, or a place full of holes and rubs that make the ball
trip an hundred several wayes, never suffering it to come neer the
mark, to avoid them all, they do not trundle the ball upon the
ground, but throw it, as if they were to pitch a quait. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in throwing the ball, it issueth out of the hand with some
roling conferred by the fingers, when ever the hand is under the
ball, as it is most commonly held; whereupon the ball in its lighting
on the ground neer to the mark, between the motion of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jicient
and that of the roling, would run a great way from the
same: To make the ball stay, they hold it artificially, with their
hand uppermost, and it undermost, which in its delivery hath
a contrary twirl or roling conferred upon it by the fingers, by
means whereof in its coming to the ground neer the mark it stays
there, or runs very very little forwards. But to return to our
principal problem which gave occasion for starting these others; I
say it is possible that a person carried very swiftly, may let a ball
drop out of his hand, that being come to the Earth, shall not
onely follow his motion, but also out-go it, moving with a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
velocity. And to see such an effect, I desire that the course
may be that of a Chariot, to which on the out-side let a decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
board be fastened; so as that the neither part may be towards
the horses, and the upper towards the hind Wheel. Now, if in
the Chariots full career, a man within it, let a ball fall gliding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
the declivity of that board, it shall in roling downward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a particular <hi>vertigo</hi> or turning, the which added to the
motion impressed by the Chariot, will carrie the ball along the
ground much faster than the Chariot. And if one accommodate
another declining board over against it, the motion of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot
may be qualified so, that the ball, gliding downwards along
the board, in its coming to the ground shall rest immoveable,
and also shall sometimes run the contrary way to the Chariot. But
we are strayed too far from the purpose, therefore if <hi>Simplicius</hi>

                        <p>I have sometimes considered of it, and make no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
that if one could be certain of the nature of that motion
wherewith the grave body descendeth to approach the centre of
the Terrestrial Globe, mixing it self afterwards with the common
circular motion of the diurnal conversion; it might be exactly
found what kind of line that is, that the centre of gravity of the
moveable describeth in those two motions.</p>

                        <p>Touching the simple motion towards the centre de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
on the gravity, I think that one may confidently, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
error, believe that it is by a right line, as it would be, were
the Earth immoveable.</p>

                        <p>Nay rather <hi>Sagredus</hi> we onely see the simple motion of
descent; since that other circular one common to the Earth, the
Tower and our selves remains imperceptible, and as if it never
were, and there remaineth perceptible to us that of the stone, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
not participated by us, and for this, sense demonstrateth that

                        <p>I am content to excuse you from this narration for the
present, provided that this may be one of the Propositions reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be examined amongst the rest in another particular meeting,
for that the knowledg thereof is by me very much desired; and
in the mean time let us return to the line described by the grave
body in its fall from the top of the Tower to its base.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>If the right motion towards the centre of the Earth was
uniforme, the circular towards the East being also uniforme, you
would see composed of them both a motion by a spiral line, of
that kind with those defined by <hi>Archimedes</hi> in his Book <hi>De Spira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus;</hi>
which are, when a point moveth uniformly upon a right
line, whilest that line in the mean time turneth uniformly about
one of its extreme points fixed, as the centre of his gyration.
But because the right motion of grave bodies falling, is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
accelerated, it is necessary, that the line resulting of the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:96976:84"/>
composition of the two motions do go alwayes receding with
greater and greater proportion from the circumference of that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
which the centre of the stones gravity would have designed,
if it had alwayes staid upon the Tower; it followeth of necessity
that this recession at the first be but little, yea very small, yea,
more, as small as can be imagined, seeing that the descending
grave body departing from rest, that is, from the privation of
motion, towards the bottom and entring into the right motion
downwards, it must needs passe through all the degrees of tardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that are betwixt rest, and any assigned velocity; the which
degrees are infinite; as already hath been at large discoursed and
proved.</p>
                        <p>It being supposed therefore, that the progresse of the accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
being after this manner, and it being moreover true, that
the descending grave body goeth to terminate in the centre of the
Earth,<note place="margin">The line descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by a moveable in its natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent, the motion of the Earth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout its own centre being presupposed, would probably be the circumference of a circle.</note> it is necessary that the line of its mixt motion be such, that
it go continually receding with greater and greater proportion
from the top of the Tower, or to speak more properly, from
the circumference of the circle described by the top of the Tower,
by means of the Earths conversion; but that such recessions be
lesser and lesser <hi>in infinitum;</hi> by how much the moveable finds it
self to be lesse and lesse removed from the first term where it
rested. Moreover it is necessary, that this line of the compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
motion do go to terminate in the centre of the Earth. Now
having presupposed these two things, I come to describe about
the centre A <hi>[in Fig. 1. of this second Dialogue;]</hi> with the semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diameter
AB, the circle BI, representing to me the Terrestrial
Globe, and prolonging the semidiameter AB to C, I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
the height of the Tower BC; the which being carried
about by the Earth along the circumference BI, describeth with
its top the arch CD: Dividing, in the next place, the line CA
in the middle at E; upon the centre E, at the distance EC, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
the semicircle CIA: In which, I now affirm, that it is very
probable that a stone falling from the top of the Tower C, doth
move, with a motion mixt of the circular, which is in common,
and of its peculiar right motion. If therefore in the circumference
CD, certain equal parts CF, FG, GH, HL, be marked, and
from the points F, G, H, L, right lines be drawn towards the
centre A, the parts of them intercepted between the two cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumferences
CD and BI, shall represent unto us the same
Tower CB, transported by the Terrestrial Globe towards DI;
in which lines the points where they come to be intersected by the
arch of the semicircle CI, are the places by which from time to
time the falling stone doth passe; which points go continually
with greater and greater proportion receding from the top of the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:96976:85"/>
Tower. And this is the cause vvhy the right motion made along
the side of the Tower apeareth to us more and more accelerate.
It appeareth also, how by reason of the infinite acutenesse of
the contact of those two circles DC, CI, the recession of the
cadent moveable from the circumference CFD; namely, from
the top of the Tower, is towards the beginning extream small,
which is as much as if one said its motion downwards is very slow,
and more and more slow <hi>in infinitum,</hi> according to its vicinity to
the term C, that is to the state of rest. And lastly it is seen how
in the end this same motion goeth to terminate in the centre of the
Earth A.</p>

                        <p>But stay a little <hi>Sagredus,</hi> for I am to acquaint you
also with three Observations of mine, that its possible will not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please
you.<note place="margin">A moveable fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from the top of the Tower, moveth in the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of a circle.</note> The first of which is, that if we do well consider, the
moveable moveth not really with any more than onely one motion
simply circular, as when being placed upon the Tower, it moved
with one single and circular motion. The second is yet more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant;
for,<note place="margin">It moveth neither more nor lesse, than if it had staid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes there.</note> it moveth neither more nor lesse then if it had staid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
upon the Tower, being that to the arches CF, FG, GH,
&amp;c. that it would have passed continuing alwayes upon the Tower,
the arches of the circumference CI are exactly equal, answering
under the same CF, FG, GH, &amp;c. Whence followeth the third
wonder,<note place="margin">It moveth with an uniform, not an accelerate mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> That the true and real motion of the stone is never acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated,
but alwayes even and uniforme, since that all the equal ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
noted in the circumference CD, and their respondent ones
marked in the circumference CI, are past in equal times; so that
we are left at liberty to seek new causes of acceleration, or of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
motions, seeing that the moveable, as well standing upon the
Tower, as descending thence, alwayes moveth in the same fashion,
that is, circularly, with the same velocity, and with the same uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.
Now tell me what you think of this my fantastical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SAGR.</speaker>
                        <p>I must tell you, that I cannot with words sufficiently
expresse how admirable it seemeth to me; and for vvhat at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
offereth it self to my understanding, I cannot think that the
business happeneth otherwise; and vvould to God that all the
demonstrations of Philosophers were but half so probable as this.
However for my perfect satisfaction I would gladly hear how you
prove those arches to be equal.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>The demonstration is most easie. Suppose to your self
a line drawn from I to E. And the Semidiameter of the circle CD,
that is, the line CA, being double the Semidiameter CE of the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:96976:85"/>
circle CI, the circumference shall be double to the circumference,
and every arch of the greater circle double to every like arch of
the lesser; and consequently, the half of the arch of the greater
circle, equal to the whole arch of the lesse. And because the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
CEI made in the centre E of the lesser circle, and which insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
upon the arch CI, is double the angle CAD, made in the
centre A of the greater circle, to which the arch CD subtendeth;
therefore the arch CD is half of the arch of the greater circle like
to the arch CI, and therefore the two arches CD and CI are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual;
and in the same manner we may demonstrate of all their
parts. But that the business, as to the motion of descending grave
bodies, proceedeth exactly thus, I will not at this time affirm; but
this I will say, that if the line described by the cadent moveable
be not exactly the same with this, it doth extream neerly resemble
the same.</p>

                           <hi>Salviatus,</hi> am just now considering another par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
very admirable; and this it is; That admitting these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations,
the right motion doth go wholly<note n="*" place="margin">Vadia del tutto a monte, <hi>rendered in the Latine</hi> omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no pessum eat.</note> mounting, and that
Nature never makes use thereof, since that, even that that use,
which was from the beginning granted to it, which was of redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the parts of integral bodies to their place, when they were
separated from their whole, and therefore constituted in a depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
disposition, is taken from it, and assigned to the circular
motion.</p>

                        <p>This would necessarily follow, if it were concluded
that the Terrestrial Globe moveth circularly; a thing, which I
pretend not to be done, but have onely hitherto attempted, as I
shall <hi>still,</hi> to examine the strength of those reasons, which have
been alledged by Philosophers to prove the immobility of the

it over in silence; albeit he was, indeed, very brief in examining
the other allegations of his adversaries, I believe through his

like as Lions are not much moved at the barking of little Dogs.
We will therefore reserve the instance of birds to the last place,
and for the present, see if we can give <hi>Simplicius</hi> satisfaction in
the others, by shewing him in our wonted manner, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
hath their answers at hand, though upon first thoughts he doth
not discover them. And to begin with the shots made at randome,
with the self same piece, powder, and ball, the one towards the East,
the other towards the West (if the diurnal conversion belonged to
the Earth) ought to be much longer than that towards the East.</p>

West, before that the ball falleth to the ground, the piece is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
very far towards the East, by which means the space be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the ball and the piece, that is Range, will appear longer
than the other, by how much the piece, that is the Earth, had

                        <p>In my thoughts this experiment is very proper: and I
do not doubt but that the flight, that is, the space between the
shaft and the place where the chariot was at the shafts fall, will be
less by much when one shooteth towards the chariots course, than
when one shooteth the contrary way. For an example, let the
flight of it self be three hundred yards, and the course of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot
in the time whilst the shaft stayeth in the air, an hundred
yards, therefore shooting towards the course, of the three hundred
yards of the flight, the chariot will have gone one hundred; so
then at the shafts coming to the ground, the space between it and
the chariot, shall be but two hundred yards onely; but on the
contrary, in the other shoot, the chariot running contrary to the
shaft, when the shaft shall have passed its three hundred yards, and
the chariot its other hundred the contrary way, the distance inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
shall be found to be four hundred yards.</p>

                        <p>I know no other way, unless by making the chariot to

                        <p>In that case you are to draw the Bow higher in shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>Then you see that there is one way more. But how

                        <p>In our case, where we have supposed that the bow car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
three hundred yards, it would be requisite to draw it so, as
that it might carry four hundred, and in the other to slacken it so,
as that it might carry no more than two hundred. For so each
of the flights would be but three hundred in relation to the chariot,
the which, with its course of an hundred yards which it substracts
from the shoot of four hundred, and addeth to that of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
would reduce them both to three hundred.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SIMP.</speaker>
                        <p>The stiffer bow carrieth it with greater velocity, and the
weaker with less; and the same shaft flieth so much farther at one
time than another, with how much greater velocity it goeth out of
the tiller at one time, than another.</p>

                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>So that to make the shaft shot either way, to flie at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
distance from the running chariot, it is requisite, that if in the
first shoot of the precedent example, it goeth out of the tiller with
<hi>v. g.</hi> four degrees of velocity, that then in the other shoot it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:96976:87"/>
but with two onely: but if the same bow be used, it always
receiveth thence three degrees.</p>

                        <speaker>SIMP.</speaker>
                        <p>It doth so; and for this reason, shooting with the

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SIMP.</speaker>
                        <p>The velocity of the chariot must be supposed to be one
degree in comparison to that of the bow, which is three,</p>

                        <p>Very right, for so computation gives it. But tell me,
when the chariot moveth, doth not all things in the same move
with the same velocity?</p>

                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>Then so doth the shaft also, and the bow, and the string,
upon which the shaft is nock't.</p>

                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>Why then, in discharging the shaft towards the course
of the chariot, the bow impresseth its three degrees of velocity on
a shaft that had one degree of velocity before, by means of the
chariot which transported it so fast towards that part; so that in
its going off it hath four degrees of velocity. On the contrary,
in the other shoot, the same bow conferreth its same three degrees
of velocity on a shaft that moveth the contrary way, with one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree;
so that in its departing from the bow-string, it hath no more
left but onely two degrees of velocity. But you your self have
already said, that the way to make the shoots equal, is to cause
that the shaft be let flie the first time with four degrees of velocity,
and the second time with two. Therefore without changing the
bow, the very course of the chariot is that which adjusteth the
flights,<note place="margin">The solution of the argument ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from great-Guns shot towards the East &amp; West.</note> and the experiment doth so represent them to any one who
is not either wilfully or naturally incapable of reason. Now
apply this discourse to Gunnery, and you shall find, that whether the
Earth move or stand still, the shots made with the same force, will
always curry equal ranges, to what part soever aimed. The error
of <hi>Aristotle, Ptolomey, Tycho,</hi> your self, and all the rest, is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon that fixed and strong persuasion, that the Earth standeth
still, which you have not judgment nor power to depose, no not
when you have a desire to argue of that which would ensue, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposing
the Earth to move. And thus, in the other argument,
not considering that whil'st the stone is upon the Tower, it doth,
as to moving or not moving, the same that the Terrestrial Globe
doth, because you have concluded with your self, that the Earth
stands still, you always discourse touching the fall of the stone, as
if it were to depart from rest: whereas it behooveth to say, that
if the Earth standeth still, the stone departeth from rest, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendeth
perpendicularly; but if the Earth do move, the stone
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:96976:87"/>
likewise moveth with like velocity, nor doth it depart from rest,
but from a motion equal to that of the Earth, wherewith it inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixeth
the supervenient motion of descent, and of those two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
a third which is transversal or side-ways.</p>

                        <p>But for Gods sake, if it move transversly, how is it that

                        <p>If a Painter, then, at our launching from the Port, had
began to design upon a paper with that pen, and continued his
work till he came to <hi>Scanderon,</hi> he would have been able to have
taken by its motion a perfect draught of all those figures perfectly
interwoven and shadowed on several sides with countreys, build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
living creatures, and other things; albeit all the true, real,
and essential motion traced out by the neb of that pen, would
have been no other than a very long, but simple line: and as to
the proper operation of the Painter, he would have delineated the
same to an hair, if the ship had stood still. That therefore of the
huge long motion of the pen there doth remain no other marks,
than those tracks drawn upon the paper, the reason thereof is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the grand motion from <hi>Venice</hi> to <hi>Scanderon,</hi> was common to
the paper, the pen, and all that which was in the ship: but the petty
motions forwards and backwards, to the right, to the left, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
by the fingers of the Painter unto the pen, and not to
the paper, as being peculiar thereunto, might leave marks of it self
upon the paper, which did not move with that motion. Thus it
is likewise true, that the Earth moving, the motion of the stone in
descending downwards, was really a long tract of many hundreds
and thousands of yards, and if it could have been able to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineated
in a calm air, or other superficies, the track of its course,
it would have left behind an huge long transverse line. But that
part of all this motion which is common to the stone, the Tower,
and our selves, is imperceptible to us, and as if it had never been,
and that part onely remaineth observable, of which neither the
Tower nor we are partakers, which is in fine, that wherewith the
stone falling measureth the Tower.</p>

with that delineation, and with thinking how those strokes
drawn so many ways, hither, thither, upwards, downwards, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
backwards, and interwoven with thousands of turnings, are
not essentially or really other, than small pieces of one sole line
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:96976:88"/>
drawn all one way, and the same without any other alteration save
the declining the direct rectitude, sometimes a very insensible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
towards one side or another, and the pens moving its neb one
while softer, another while slower, but with very small inequality.
And I think that it would in the same manner write a letter, and
that those frollike penmen, who to shew their command of hand,
without taking their pen from the paper in one sole stroke, with
infinite turnings draw a pleasant knot, if they were in a boat that
did tide it along swiftly they would convert the whole motion
of the pen, which in reality is but one sole line, drawn all towards
one and the same part, and very little curved, or declining from
perfect rectitude, into a knot or flourish. And I am much pleased

had made a greater voyage with its round-top, that is with its

there are a great many more such fancies no less pleasant &amp; vvitty.
It follovveth that vve speak of the peice of Ordinance mounted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular

unto the same peice, though that in the long time vvhich it is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from the peice, the earth hath transported it many miles
tovvards the East; novv it seemeth, that the ball ought to fall a like
distance from the peice tovvards the West; the vvhich doth not
happen: therefore the peice vvithout having been moved did stay
expecting the same. The ansvver is the same vvith that of the
stone falling from the Tovver;<note place="margin">The answer to the objection, shewing the equivoke.</note> and all the fallacy, and equivocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
consisteth in supposing still for true, that vvhich is in question;
for the Opponent hath it still fixed in his conceit that the
ball departs from its rest, being discharged by the fire
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:96976:89"/>
from the piece; and the departing from the state of rest, cannot
be, unlesse the immobility of the Terrestrial Globe be presuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
which is the conclusion of that was in dispute; Therefore,
I reply, that those who make the Earth moveable, answer, that
the piece, and the ball that is in it, partake of the same motion
with the Earth; nay that they have this together with her from
nature; and that therefore the ball departs in no other manner
from its quiescence, but conjoyned with its motion about the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
the which by its projection upwards, is neither taken away,
nor hindered; and in this manner following, the universal motion
of the Earth towards the East, it alwayes keepeth perpendicular
over the said piece, as well in its rise as in its return. And the
same you see to ensue, in making the experiment in a ship with
a bullet shot upwards perpendicularly with a Crosse-bow, which

                        <p>It would not so do; but issuing out of the piece, it
would pursue its motion by a right line which prolongeth the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect

not be perpendicular. It vvould indeed be perpendicular, if the
Earth stood still, for so the ball vvould have no other motion but
that proceeding from the fire.<note place="margin">The revolution of the Earth sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, the ball in the piece erected perpendicularly, doth not move by a perpendicular, but an inclined line.</note> But in case the Earth turns round,
the ball that is in the piece, hath likewise a diurnal motion, so
that there being added to the same the impulse of the fire, it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
from the breech of the piece to the muzzle with two motions,
from the composition whereof it cometh to passe that the motion
made by the centre of the balls gravity is an inclining line. And
for your clearer understanding the same, let the piece AC <hi>[in
Fig. 2.]</hi> be erected, and in it the ball B; it is manifest, that the
piece standing immoveable, and fire being given to it, the ball
will make its way out by the mouth A, and with its centre, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
thorow the the piece, shall have described the perpendicular
line BA, and it shall pursue that rectitude when it is out of the
piece, moving toward the Zenith. But in case the Earth should
move round, and consequently carry the piece along with it, in
the time that the ball driven out of the piece shall move along
the cylinder, the piece being carried by the Earth, shall passe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the situation DE, and the ball B, in going off, would be at
the cornish D, and the motion of the bals centre, would have
been according to the line BD, no longer perpendicular, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
towards the East; and the ball (as hath been concluded)
being to continue its motion through the air, according to the
direction of the motion made in the piece, the said motion shall
continue on according to the inclination of the line BD, and so
shall no longer be perpendicular, but inclined towards the East,
to which part the piece doth also move; whereupon the ball may
follow the motion of the Earth, and of the piece. Now <hi>Simplicius,</hi>

                        <p>I apprehend it in part; but I have a certain kind of
scruple, which I wish I knew how to express. It seems to me, that
according to what hath been said, if the Piece be erected perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular,
and the Earth do move, the ball would not be to fall, as
<hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Tycho</hi> will have it, far from the Piece towards the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:96976:90"/>
West, nor as you would have it, upon the Piece, but rather far
distant towards the East. For according to your explanation, it
would have two motions, the which would with one consent carry
it thitherward, to wit, the common motion of the Earth, which
carrieth the Piece and the ball from CA towards ED; and the
fire which carrieth it by the inclined line BD, both motions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the East, and therefore they are superiour to the motion of
the Earth.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SAGR.</speaker>
                        <p>Not so, Sir. The motion which carrieth the ball to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the East, cometh all from the Earth, and the fire hath no
part at all therein: the motion which mounteth the ball upwards,
is wholly of fire, wherewith the Earth hath nothing to do. And
that it is so, if you give not fire, the ball will never go out of the
Piece, nor yet rise upwards a hairs breadth; as also if you make
the Earth immoveable, and give fire, the ball without any incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
shall go perpendicularly upwards. The ball therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
two motions, one upwards, and the other in gyration, of both
which the transverse line BD is compounded, the impulse upward
is wholly of fire, the circular cometh wholly from the Earth, and
is equal to the Earths motion: and being equal to it, the ball
maintaineth it self all the way directly over the mouth of the
Piece, and at last falleth back into the same: and because it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
observeth the erection of the Piece, it appeareth also conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
over the head of him that is near the Piece, and therefore
it appeareth to mount exactly perpendicular towards our Zenith,
or vertical point.</p>

                        <p>I have yet one doubt more remaining, and it is, that in
regard the motion of the ball is very swift in the Piece, it seems
not possible, that in that moment of time the transposition of the
Piece from CA to AD should confer such an inclination upon
the transverse line CD, that by means thereof, the ball when it
cometh afterwards into the air should be able to follow the course
of the Earth.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SAGR.</speaker>
                        <p>You err upon many accounts; and first, the inclination
of the transverse line CD, I believe it is much greater than you
take it to be, for I verily think that the velocity of the Earths mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not onely under the Equinoctial, but in our paralel also, is
greater than that of the ball whilst it moveth in the Piece; so that
the interval CE would be absolutely much bigger than the whole
length of the Piece, and the inclination of the transverse line con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
bigger than half a right angle: but be the velocity of
the Earth more, or be it less, in comparison of the velocity of the
fire, this imports nothing; for if the velocity of the Earth be small,
and consequently the inclination of the transverse line be little
also; there is then also need but of little inclination to make the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:96976:90"/>
ball suspend it self in its range directly over the Piece. And in a
word, if you do but attentively consider, you will comprehend,
that the motion of the Earth in transferring the Piece along with
it from CA to ED, conferreth upon the transverse line CD, so
much of little or great inclination, as is required to adjust the
range to its perpendicularity. But you err, secondly, in that you
referr the faculty of carrying the ball along with the Earth to the
impulse of the fire, and you run into the same error, into which
<hi>Salviatus,</hi> but even now seemed to have fallen; for the faculty
of following the motion of the Earth, is the primary and perpetual
motion, indelibly and inseparably imparted to the said ball, as to a
thing terrestrial, and that of its own nature doth and ever shall
possess the same.</p>

                           <hi>Simplicius,</hi> for the business is just as he
saith. And now from this discourse let us come to understand the
reason of a Venatorian Problem, of those Fowlers who with their
guns shoot a bird flying; and because I did imagine, that in regard
the bird flieth a great pace, therefore they should aim their shot far
from the bird, anticipating its flight for a certain space, and more
or less according to its velocity and the distance of the bird, that
so the bullet hasting directly to the mark aimed at, it might come
to arrive at the self same time in the same point with its motion,
and the bird with its flight, and by that means one to encounter
the other: and asking one of them, if their practise was not so
to do; He told me, no; but that the slight was very easie and
certain, and that they took aim just in the same manner as if they
had shot at a bird that did sit still; that is, they made the flying
bird their mark, and by moving their fowling-piece they followed
her, keeping their aim still full upon her, till such time as they let
fly, and in this manner shot her as they did others sitting still. It is
necessary therefore that that motion, though slow, which the fowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-piece
maketh in turning and following after the flight of the
bird do communicate it self to the bullet also, and that it be joyned
with that of the fire; so that the ball hath from the fire the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
directly upwards, and from the concave Cylinder of the barrel
the declination according to the flight of the Bird, just as was said
before of the shot of a Canon; where the ball receiveth from the
fire a virtue of mounting upwards towards the Zenith, and from
the motion of the Earth its winding towards the East, and of both
maketh a compound motion that followeth the course of the
Earth, and that to the beholder seemeth onely to go directly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and return again downwards by the same line. The hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therefore of the gun continually directed towards the mark,
maketh the shoot hit right, and that you may keep your gun di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to the mark, in case the mark stands still, you must also hold
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:96976:91"/>
your gun still; and if the mark shall move, the gun must be kept upon

to the other argument taken from the shot of a Canon, at the

that if the Earth should move, the shots would all range West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of the mark, because that in the time whilst the ball, being
forc'd out of the Piece, goeth through the air to the mark, the said
mark being carried toward the East, would leave the ball to the
Westward. I answer therefore, demanding whether if the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
be aimed true at the mark, and permitted so to continue, it
will constantly hit the said mark, whether the Earth move or stand
still? It must be replied, that the aim altereth not at all, for if
the mark doth stand still, the Piece also doth stand still, and if it,
being transported by the Earths motion, doth move, the Piece doth
also move at the same rate, and, the aim maintained, the shot
proveth always true, as by what hath been said above, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest.</p>

                        <p>Stay a little, I entreat you, <hi>Salviatus,</hi> till I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
a certain conceit touching these shooters of birds flying,
whose proceeding I believe to be the same which you relate, and
believe the effect of hitting the bird doth likewise follow: but yet
I cannot think that act altogether conformable to this of shooting
in great Guns, which ought to hit as well when the piece and mark
moveth, as when they both stand still; and these, in my opinion,
are the particulars in which they disagree. In shooting with a
great Gun both it and the mark move with equal velocity, being
both transported by the motion of the Terrestrial Globe: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
sometimes the piece being planted more towards the Pole,
than the mark, and consequently its motion being somewhat flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than the motion of the mark, as being made in a lesser circle,
such a difference is insensible, at that little distance of the piece
from the mark: but in the shot of the Fowler the motion of the
Fowling-piece wherewith it goeth following the bird, is very slow
in comparison of the flight of the said bird; whence me thinks it
should follow, that that small motion which the turning of the
Birding-piece conferreth on the bullet that is within it, cannot,
when it is once gone forth of it, multiply it self in the air, untill it
come to equal the velocity of the birds flight, so as that the said bullet
should always keep direct upon it: nay, me thinketh the bird
would anticipate it and leave it behind. Let me add, that in this
act, the air through which the bullet is to pass, partaketh not of the
motion of the bird: whereas in the case of the Canon, both it,
the mark, and the intermediate air, do equally partake of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
diurnal motion. So that the true cause of the Marks-man
his hitting the mark, as it should seem, moreover and besides the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:96976:91"/>
following the birds flight with the piece, is his somewhat anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it, taking his aim before it; as also his shooting (as I believe)
not with one bullet, but with many small balls (called shot) the
which scattering in the air possess a great space; and also the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
velocity wherewith these shot, being discharged from the
Gun, go towards the bird.</p>

light upon these disparities,<note place="margin">The answer to the Argument taken from the shots at point blanck to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the East &amp; West.</note> but not without long studie. Now
turning to the matter in hand, there do remain to be considered
by us the shots at point blank, towards the East and towards the
West; the first of which, if the Earth did move, would always
happen to be too high above the mark, and the second too low;
forasmuch as the parts of the Earth Eastward, by reason of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal
motion, do continually descend beneath the tangent paralel
to the Horizon, whereupon the Eastern stars to us appear to ascend;
and on the contrary, the parts Westward do more and more as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend,
whereupon the Western stars do in our seeming descend:
and therefore the ranges which are leveled according to the said
tangent at the Oriental mark, (which whilst the ball passeth
along by the tangent descendeth) should prove too high, and the
Occidental too low by means of the elevation of the mark, whilst
the ball passeth along the tangent. The answer is like to the rest:
for as the Eastern mark goeth continually descending, by reason
of the Earths motion, under a tangent that continueth immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
so likewise the piece for the same reason goeth continually
inclining, and with its mounture pursuing the said mark: by
which means the shot proveth true.</p>
                        <p>But here I think it a convenient opportunity to give notice of
certain concessions,<note place="margin">The followers of <hi>Copernicus</hi> too freely admit cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain propositions for true, which are very doubtfull.</note> which are granted perhaps over liberally by

that this of experimenting whether the shot made by a Canon to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the East proveth too high, and the Western shot too low,
is one: and because I believe that they have never made tryal
thereof, I desire that they would tell me what difference they

moveable, or supposing it moveable; and let <hi>Simplicius</hi> for this

                        <p>Now I desire that for our satisfaction we do make thus
in grosse a slight calculation,<note place="margin">A Computation how much the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of great shot ought to vary from the marke, the Earths motion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
granted.</note> if you consent thereto, which will
stand us in stead likewise (if the computation succeed as I expect)
for a warning how we do in other occurrences suffer our selves, as
the saying is, to be taken with the enemies shouts, and surrender
up our belief to what ever first presents it self to our fancy. And
now to give all advantages to the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> and <hi>Tychonicks,</hi>
let us suppose our selves to be under the Equinoctial, there to shoot
a piece of Ordinance point blank Eastwards at a mark five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
paces off. First, let us see thus (as I said) in a level, what
time the shot after it is gone out of the Piece taketh to arrive at
the mark; which we know to be very little, and is certainly no
more than that wherein a travailer walketh two steps, which also
is less than the second of a minute of an hour; for supposing
that the travailer walketh three miles in an hour, which are nine
thousand paces, being that an hour containes three thousand, six
hundred second minutes, the travailer walketh two steps and an
half in a second, a second therefore is more than the time of the
balls motion. And for that the diurnal revolution is twenty four
hours, the Western horizon riseth fifteen degrees in an hour, that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:96976:92"/>
is, fifteen first minutes of a degree, in one first minute of an hour;
that is, fifteen seconds of a degree, in one second of an hour; and
because one second is the time of the shot, therefore in this time
the Western horizon riseth fifteen seconds of a degree, and so
much likewise the mark; and therefore fifteen seconds of that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
whose semidiameter is five hundred paces (for so much the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the mark from the Piece was supposed.) Now let us
look in the table of Arches and Chords (see here is <hi>Copernicus</hi> his
book) what part is the chord of fifteen seconds of the semidiame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that is, five hundred paces. Here you see the chord (or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense)
of a first minute to be less than thirty of those parts, of
which the semidiameter is an hundred thousand. Therefore the
chord of a second minute shall be less then half of one of those
parts, that is less than one of those parts, of which the semidiame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is two hundred thousand; and therefore the chord of fifteen
conds shall be less than fifteen of those same two hundred thousand
parts; but that which is less than<note n="a" place="margin">That is, in plainer termes the fraction 15/200000, is more than the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction 4/50000, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators by their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

five hundred; therefore the ascent of the mark in the time of the
balls motion is lesse than four centesmes, that is, than one twenty
fifth part of a pace; it shall be therefore<note n="b" place="margin">It shall be neer 2 2/5 inches, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting the pace to be Geometrical, containing 5 foot.</note> about two inches:
And so much consequently shall be the variation of each Western
shot, the Earth being supposed to have a diurnal motion. Now if I
shall tell you, that this variation (I mean of falling two inches short
of what they would do in case the Earth did not move) upon tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
doth happen in all shots, how will you convince me <hi>Simplicius,</hi>
shewing me by an experiment that it is not so? Do you not see
that it is impossible to confute me, unless you first find out a way
to shoot at a mark with so much exactnesse, as never to misse an
hairs bredth? For whilst the ranges of great shot consist of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

each of those variations there is contained that of two inches cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

There yet remains in me some haesitancy (as I have hinted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
touching the flight of birds; the which having as it were an
animate faculty of moving at their pleasure with a thousand mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and to stay long in the Air separated from the Earth, and
therein with most irregular windings to go fluttering to and again,
I cannot conceive how amongst so great a confusion of motions,
they should be able to retain the first commune motion; and in
what manner, having once made any stay behind, they can get
it up again, and overtake the same with flying, and keep pace
with the Towers and trees which hurry with so precipitant a course
towards the East; I say so precipitant, for in the great circle of
the Globe it is little lesse than a thousand miles an hour, whereof
the flight of the swallow I believe makes not fifty.</p>

                        <p>If the birds were to keep pace with the course of the
trees by help of their wings, they would of necessity flie very fast;
and if they were deprived of the universal conversion, they would
lag as far behind; and their flight would seem as furious towards
the West, and to him that could discern the same, it would
much exceed the flight of an arrow; but I think we could not be
able to perceive it, no more than we see a Canon bullet, whil'st
driven by the fury of the fire, it flieth through the Air: But the
truth is that the proper motion of birds, I mean of their flight,
hath nothing to do with the universal motion, to which it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an help, nor an hinderance; and that which maintaineth
the said motion unaltered in the birds, is the Air it self, thorough
which they flie, which naturally follovving the <hi>Vertigo</hi> of the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:96976:93"/>
Earth, like as it carrieth the clouds along with it, so it transporteth
birds and every thing else which is pendent in the same; in so much
that as to the businesse of keeping pace vvith the Earth, the birds

                        <p>That the Air can carry the clouds along with it, as
being matters easie for their lightnesse to be moved and deprived

partake also of the conditions and properties of the Earth; I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
without any difficulty; but that birds, which as having
life, may move with a motion quite contrary to the diurnal, once
having surceased the said motion, the Air should restore them to
it, seems to me a little strange, and the rather for that they are solid
and weighty bodies; and withal, we see; as hath been said, stones
and other grave bodies to lie unmoved against the <hi>impetus</hi> of the
air; and when they suffer themselves to be overcome thereby,
they never acquire so much velocity as the wind which carrieth
them.</p>

                        <p>It might indeed be so affirmed, if you would speak
quite contrary to truth; for the truth is, that the water, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:96976:94"/>
of its great resistance to the division made by the hull of the
ship, doth with great noise resist the same; nor doth it permit it
of a great while to acquire that velocity which the wind would
confer upon it, were the obstacle of the water removed. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<hi>Simplicius</hi> you have never considered with what fury the
water besets a bark, whil'st it forceth its way through a standing
water by help of Oars or Sails: for if you had ever minded that
effect, you would not now have produced such an absurdity.
And I am thinking that you have hitherto been one of those who
to find out how such things succeed, and to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg

our birds; touching which you have said, that the Air being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

diurnal motion which amongst the windings of their flight they
might have lost; to which I reply, that the agitated Air seemeth
unable to confer on a solid and grave body, so great a velocity as
its own: And because that of the Air is as great as that of the
Earth, I cannot think that the Air is able to make good the losse
of the birds retardation in flight.</p>

                        <p>Your making a greater scruple of this than of the other
instances dependeth, if I mistake not, upon the birds being ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated,
and thereby enabled to use their strength at pleasure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the primary motion in-bred in terrene bodies: like as for
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:96976:94"/>
example, we see them whil'st they are alive to fly upwards, a thing
altogether impossible for them to do as they are grave bodies;
whereas being dead they can onely fall downwards; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you hold that the reasons that are of force in all the kinds of
projects above named, cannot take place in birds: Now this is
very true; and because it is so, <hi>Sagredus,</hi> that doth not appear
to be done in those projects,<note place="margin">The answer to the argument ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the flight of birds contrary to the motion of the Earth.</note> which we see the birds to do. For if
from the top of a Tower you let fall a dead bird and a live one,
the dead bird shall do the same that a stone doth, that is, it shall
first follow the general motion diurnal, and then the motion of
descent, as grave; but if the bird let fall, be a live, what shall
hinder it, (there ever remaining in it the diurnal motion) from
soaring by help of its wings to what place of the Horizon it shall
please? and this new motion, as being peculiar to the bird, and
not participated by us, must of necessity be visible to us; and if
it be moved by help of its wings towards the West, what shall
hinder it from returning with a like help of its wings unto the
Tower. And, because, in the last place, the bird swending its
flight towards the West was no other than a withdrawing from
the diurnal motion, (which hath, suppose ten degrees of velocity)
one degree onely, there did thereupon remain to the bird whil'st
it was in its flight nine degrees of velocity, and so soon as it did
alight upon the the Earth, the ten common degrees returned to it,
to which, by flying towards the East it might adde one, and with
those eleven overtake the Tower. And in short, if we well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
and more narrowly examine the effects of the flight of
birds, they differ from the projects shot or thrown to any part of
the World in nothing, save onely that the projects are moved by an
external projicient,<note place="margin">An experiment with which alone is shewn the nullity of all the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons produced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the motion of the Earth.</note> and the birds by an internal principle. And
here for a final proof of the nullity of all the experiments before
illedged, I conceive it now a time and place convenient to
demonstrate a way how to make an exact trial of them all.
Shut your self up with some friend in the grand Cabbin between
the decks of some large Ship, and there procure gnats, flies, and
such other small winged creatures: get also a great tub (or
other vessel) full of water, and within it put certain fishes; let
also a certain bottle be hung up, which drop by drop letteth forth
its water into another bottle placed underneath, having a narrow
neck: and, the Ship lying still, observe diligently how those small
winged animals fly with like velocity towards all parts of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin;
how the fishes swim indifferently towards all sides; and how
the distilling drops all fall into the bottle placed underneath. And
casting any thing towards your friend, you need not throw it with
more force one way then another, provided the distances be equal:
and leaping, as the saying is, with your feet closed, you will reach
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:96976:95"/>
as far one way as another. Having observed all these particulars,
though no man doubteth that so long as the vessel stands still, they
ought to succeed in this manner; make the Ship to move with
what velocity you please; for (so long as the motion is uniforme,
and not fluctuating this way and that way) you shall not discern
any the least alteration in all the forenamed effects; nor can you
gather by any of them whether the Ship doth move or stand still.
In leaping you shall reach as far upon the floor, as before; nor for
that the Ship moveth shall you make a greater leap towards the
poop than towards the prow; howbeit in the time that you staid
in the Air, the floor under your feet shall have run the contrary way
to that of your jump; and throwing any thing to your companion
you shall not need to cast it with more strength that it may reach
him, if he shall be towards the prow, and you towards the poop,
then if you stood in a contrary situation; the drops shall all distill
as before into the inferiour bottle, and not so much as one shall
fall towards the poop, albeit whil'st the drop is in the Air, the Ship
shall have run many feet; the Fishes in their water shall not swim
with more trouble towards the fore-part, than towards the hinder
part of the tub; but shall with equal velocity make to the bait
placed on any side of the tub; and lastly, the flies and gnats
shall continue their flight indifferently towards all parts; nor
shall they ever happen to be driven together towards the side of
the Cabbin next the prow, as if they were wearied with fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the swift course of the Ship, from which through their
suspension in the Air, they had been long separated; and if
burning a few graines of incense you make a little smoke,
you shall see it ascend on high, and there in manner of a cloud
suspend it self, and move indifferently, not inclining more to one
side than another: and of this correspondence of effects the cause
is for that the Ships motion is common to all the things contained
in it, and to the Air also; I mean if those things be shut up in the
Cabbin: but in case those things were above deck in the open Air,
and not obliged to follow the course of the Ship, differences more
or lesse notable would be observed in some of the fore-named ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
and there is no doubt but that the smoke would stay behind
as much as the Air it self; the flies also, and the gnats being hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by the Air would not be able to follow the motion of the
Ship, if they were separated at any distance from it. But keeping
neer thereto, because the Ship it self as being an unfractuous Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick,
carrieth along with it part of its neerest Air, they would
follow the said Ship without any pains or difficulty. And for the
like reason we see sometimes in riding post, that the troublesome
flies and<note n="*" place="margin">Tafaris, <hi>horse-flyes.</hi>
                           </note> hornets do follow the horses flying sometimes to one,
sometimes to another part of the body, but in the falling drops
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:96976:95"/>
the difference would be very small; and in the salts, and projecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

                        <p>Though it came not into my thoughts to make triall of
these observations, when I was at Sea, yet am I confident that they
will succeed in the same manner, as you have related; in confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of which I remember that being in my Cabbin I have asked
an hundred times whether the Ship moved or stood still; and
sometimes I have imagined that it moved one way, when it steered
quite another way. I am therefore as hitherto satisfied and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of the nullity of all those experiments that have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
in proof of the negative part. There now remains the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
founded upon that which experience shews us, namely, that
a swift <hi>Vertigo</hi> or whirling about hath a faculty to extrude and
disperse the matters adherent to the machine that turns round;
whereupon many were of opinion, and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> amongst the rest,
that if the Earth should turn round with so great velocity, the
stones and creatures upon it should be tost into the Skie, and
that there could not be a morter strong enough to fasten buildings
so to their foundations, but that they would likewise suffer a like
extrusion.</p>

                        <p>Before I come to answer this objection, I cannot but
take notice of that which I have an hundred times observed, and
not without laughter, to come into the minds of most men so soon
as ever they hear mention made of this motion of the Earth, which
is believed by them so fixt and immoveable, that they not only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
doubted of that rest, but have ever strongly believed that all
other men aswell as they, have held it to be created immoveable,
and so to have continued through all succeeding ages:<note place="margin">The stupidity of some that think the Earth to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to move, when <hi>Pythagoras</hi> began to affirme that it did so.</note> and being
setled in this perswasion, they stand amazed to hear that any one
should grant it motion, as if, after that he had held it to be immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable,
he had fondly thought it to commence its motion then
(and not till then) when <hi>Pythagoras</hi> (or whoever else was the first
hinter of its mobility) said that it did move. Now that such a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
conceit (I mean of thinking that those who admit the motion
of the Earth, have first thought it to stand still from its creation,
untill the time of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and have onely made it moveable
after that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> esteemed it so) findeth a place in the mindes
of the vulgar, and men of shallow capacities, I do not much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
but that such persons as <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> should also
run into this childish mistake, is to my thinking a more admirable
and unpardonable folly.</p>

                           <hi>Ptolomey</hi> either argueth against those who have esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Earth always moveable; or against such as have held that
it stood for some time still, and hath since been set on moving.
If against the first, he ought to say, that the Earth did not always
move, for that then there would never have been men, animals, or
edifices on the Earth, its <hi>vertigo</hi> not permitting them to stay
thereon. But in that he arguing, saith that the Earth doth not
move, because that beasts, men, and houses before plac'd on the
Earth would precipitate, he supposeth the Earth to have been once
in such a state, as that it did admit men and beasts to stay, and
build thereon; the which draweth on the consequence, that it
did for some time stand still, to wit, was apt for the abode of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
and erection of buildings. Do you now conceive what I
would say?</p>

                        <p>I do, and I do not: but this little importeth to the
merit of the cause; nor can a small mistake of <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
through inadvertencie be sufficient to move the Earth,
when it is immoveable. But omitting cavils, let us come to the
substance of the argument, which to me seems unanswerable.</p>

                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>And I, <hi>Simplicius,</hi> will drive it home, and re-inforce it,
by shewing yet more sensibly, that it is true that grave bodies
turn'd with velocity about a settled centre, do acquire an <hi>impetus</hi>
of moving, and receding to a distance from that centre, even
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:96976:96"/>
then when they are in a state of having a propension of moving
naturally to the same. Tie a bottle that hath water in it, to
the end of a cord, and holding the other end fast in your hand,
and making the cord and your arm the semi-diameter, and the
knitting of the shoulder the centre, swing the bottle very fast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
so as that it may describe the circumference of a circle,
which, whether it be parallel to the Horizon, or perpendicular to
it, or any way inclined, it shall in all cases follow, that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
will not fall out of the bottle: nay, he that shall swing it,
shall find the cord always draw, and strive to go farther from the
shoulder. And if you bore a hole in the bottom of the bottle,
you shall see the water spout forth no less upwards into the skie,
than laterally, and downwards to the Earth; and if instead of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
you shall put little pebble stones into the bottle, and swing it
in the same manner, you shall find that they will strive in the like
manner against the cord. And lastly, we see boys throw stones
a great way, by swinging round a piece of a stick, at the end of
which the stone is let into a slit (<hi>which stick is called by them a
sling;</hi>) all which are arguments of the truth of the conclusion,
to wit, that the <hi>vertigo</hi> or swing conferreth upon the moveable,
a motion towards the circumference, in case the motion be swift:
and therefore if the Earth revolve about its own centre, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the superficies, and especially towards the great circle,
as being incomparably more swift than those before named, ought
to extrude all things up into the air.</p>

                        <p>The motion of the stone, so long as it is in the slit, is
circular, that is, moveth by the arch of a circle, whose stedfast
centre is the knitting of the shoulder, and its semi-diameter the arm

                        <p>But by what right line? Because infinite, and towards

                        <p>It moveth by that line which goeth directly from the

                        <p>The motion of the stone whilst it was in the slit, you
have affirmed already to be circular; now circularity opposeth

                        <p>I mean not that the projected motion is direct in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the whole circle, but in reference to that ultimate point,
where the circular motion determineth. I know what I would
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:96976:97"/>

but that you have not the proper terms, wherewith to express the
same. Now these I can easily teach you; teach you, that is, as
to the words, but not as to the truths, which are things. And that
you may plainly see that you know the thing I ask you, and onely
want language to express it, tell me, when you shoot a bullet out

                        <p>Its acquired <hi>impetus</hi> carrieth it in a right line, which

                        <p>If then the line of the projects motion be to continue
without making an angle upon the circular line described by it,
whilst it was with the projicient; and if from this circular motion it
ought to pass to the right motion, what ought this right line to be?</p>

                        <speaker>SIMP.</speaker>
                        <p>It must needs be that which toucheth the circle in the
point of separation, for that all others, in my opinion, being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
would intersect the circumference, and by that means make
some angle therewith.</p>

                        <p>In the same manner that you have understood all this,
you shall, nay you do understand the rest: and with recollecting
your self, you may remember the same without the help of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
but that we may lose no time, I will help your memory
therein. You do already know of your self, that the circular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the projicient impresseth on the project an <hi>impetus</hi> of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
(when they come to separate) by the right Tangent, the
circle of the motion in the point of separation, and continuing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
by the same the motion ever goeth receding farther and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the projicient: and you have said, that the project
would continue to move along by that right line, if there were not
by its proper weight an inclination of descent added unto it; from
which the incurvation of the line of motion is derived. It seems
moreover that you knew of your self, that this incurvation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
bended towards the centre of the Earth, for thither do all
grave bodies tend. Now I proceed a little farther, and ask you, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the moveable after its separation, in continuing the right mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
goeth always equally receding from the centre, or if you will,
from the circumference of that circle, of which the precedent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was a part; which is as much as to say, Whether a moveable,
that forsaking the point of a Tangent, and moving along by the
said Tangent, doth equally recede from the point of contact, and
from the circumference of the circle?</p>

                        <p>No, Sir: for the Tangent near to the point of contact,
recedeth very little from the circumference, wherewith it keepeth
a very narrow angle, but in its going farther and farther
off, the distance always encreaseth with a greater proportion; so
that in a circle that should have <hi>v. g.</hi> ten yards of diameter, a point
of the Tangent that was distant from the contact but two palms,
would be three or four times as far distant from the circumference
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:96976:98"/>
of the circle, as a point that was distant from the contaction one
palm, and the point that was distant half a palm, I likewise believe
would fearse recede the fourth part of the distance of the second:
so that within an inch or two of the contact, the separation of the
Tangent from the circumference is scarse discernable.</p>

in regard that upon the begining of the separation, the recession be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so small, by reason of the infinite acuteness of the angle of

                        <p>I question not, but that if one suppose that which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is, nor can be, to wit, that the inclination of those grave bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies

for I will not deny but that the stones are extruded. Yet I speak
this by way of supposition, to the end that you might grant me
the rest. Now fancy to your self, that the Earth is that great
wheel, which moved with so great velocity is to extrude the stones.
You could tell me very well even now, that the motion of proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
ought to be by that right line which toucheth the Earth in
the point of separation: and this Tangent, how doth it notably
recede from the superficies of the Terrestrial Globe?</p>

                        <p>And did you not say, that the project being drawn by
its own weight, declineth from the Tangent towards the centre of

                        <p>I said so, and also confesse the rest: and do now plainly
understand that the stone will not separate from the Earth, for
that its recession in the beginning would be such, and so small,
that it is a thousand times exceeded by the inclination which the
stone hath to move towards the centre of the Earth, which cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
in this case is also the centre of the wheel. And indeed it must
be confessed that the stones, the living creatures, and the other
grave bodies cannot be extruded; but here again the lighter things
beget in me a new doubt, they having but a very weak propension
of descent towards the centre; so that there being wanting in
them that faculty of withdrawing from the superficies, I see not,
but that they may be extruded; and you know the rule, that <hi>ad

                        <p>We will also give you satisfaction in this. Tell me
therefore in the first place, what you understand by light matters,
that is, whether you thereby mean things really so light, as that
they go upvvards, or else not absolutely light, but of so small gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
that though they descend downwards, it is but very slowly;
for if you mean the absolutely light, I will be readier than your
self to admit their extrusion.</p>

                        <p>This pen, as it hath a natural propension to descend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the superficies of the Earth, though it be very small, yet I
must tell you that it sufficeth to keep it from mounting upwards:
and this again is not unknown to you your self; therefore tell me
if the pen were extruded by the <hi>Vertigo</hi> of the Earth, by what
line would it move?</p>

                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>And when it should be to return, and re-unite it self to

                        <speaker>SIMP.</speaker>
                        <p>By that which goeth from it to the centre of the

                        <p>So then here falls under our consideration two moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
one the motion of projection, which beginneth from the
point of contact, and proceedeth along the tangent; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the motion of inclination downwards, which beginneth from
the project it self, and goeth by the secant towards the centre; and
if you desire that the projection follow, it is necessary that the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petus</hi>
by the tangent overcome the inclination by the secant: is it
not so?</p>

                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>But what is it that you think necessary in the motion
of the projicient, to make that it may prevail over that inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:96976:99"/>
from which ensueth the separation and elongation of the
pen from the Earth?</p>

                        <speaker>SIMP.</speaker>

                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>How, do you not know that? The moveable is here
the same, that is, the same pen; now how can the same moveable
superate and exceed it self in motion?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SIMP.</speaker>
                        <p>I do not see how it can overcome or yield to it self in
motion, unlesse by moving one while faster, and another while
slower.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>You see then, that you do know it. If therefore the
projection of the pen ought to follow, and its motion by the tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
be to overcome its motion by the secant, what is it requisite
that their velocities should be?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SIMP.</speaker>
                        <p>It is requisite that the motion by the tangent be greater
than that other by the secant. But wretch that I am! Is it not
only many thousand times greater than the descending motion of
the pen, but than that of the stone? And yet like a simple fellow
I had suffered my self to be perswaded, that stones could not be
extruded by the revolution of the Earth. I do therefore revoke
my former sentence, and say, that if the Earth should move,
stones, Elephants, Towers, and whole Cities would of necessity be
tost up into the Air; and because that that doth not evene, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that the Earth doth not move.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>Softly <hi>Simplicius,</hi> you go on so fast, that I begin to be
more afraid for you, than for the pen. Rest a little, and observe what
I am going to speap. If for the reteining of the stone or pen an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to the Earths surface it were necessary that its motion of
descent were greater, or as much as the motion made by the tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent;
you would have had reason to say, that it ought of necessity
to move as fast, or faster by the secant downwards, than by the
tangent Eastwards: But did not you tell me even now, that a
thousand yards of distance by the tangent from the contact, do
remove hardly an inch from the circumference? It is not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
therefore that the motion by the tangent, which is the same
with that of the diurnall <hi>Vertigo,</hi> (or hasty revolution) be simply
more swift than the motion by the secant, which is the same with
that of the pen in descending; but it is requisite that the same be
so much more swift as that the time which sufficeth for the pen
to move <hi>v. g.</hi> a thousand yards by the tangent, be insufficient for
it to move one sole inch by the secant. The which I tell you shall
never be, though you should make that motion never so swift,
and this never so slow.</p>

                        <p>I will say for example, that if that motion by the tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent

know, that from the centre of a circle a right line may be drawn
to meet the tangent, which intersecteth it in such a manner, that
the part of the tangent between the contact and the secant, may

the secant which lieth between the tangent and the circumference,

that it need not be feared, though the <hi>vertigo</hi> be swift, and the
motion downwards slow, that the pen or other lighter matter can
begin to rise upwards, for that the inclination downwards always
exceedeth the velocity of the projection.</p>

                        <p>I apprehend this demonstration; yet neverthelesse, I
am not left wholly without haesitation; for I find certain confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
scruples role to and again in my mind, which like thick and
dark clouds, permit me not to discern the cleernesse and necessity
of the conclusion with that perspicuity, which is usual in Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Demonstrations. And that which I stick at is this. It is
true that the spaces between the tangent and the circumference do
gradually diminish <hi>in infinitum</hi> towards the contact; but it is also
true on the contrary, that the propension of the moveable to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:96976:100"/>
descending groweth less &amp; less in it, the nearer it is to the first term
of its descent; that is, to the state of rest; as is manifest from that
which you declare unto us, demonstrating that the descending grave
body departing from rest, ought to passe thorow all the degrees of
tardity comprehended between the said rest, &amp; any assigned degree
of velocity, the which grow less and <hi>in infinitum.</hi> To which may
be added, that the said velocity and propension to motion, doth for
another reason diminish to infinity; and it is because the gravity of
the said moveable may infinitely diminish. So that the causes which
diminish the propension of ascending, and consequently favour
the projection, are two; that is, the levity of the moveable, and its
<hi>vicinity</hi> to the state of rest; both which are augmentable <hi>in infinit.</hi>
and these two on the contrary being to contract but with one sole
cause of making the projection, I cannot conceive how it alone, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it also do admit of infinite augmentation, should be able to
remain invincible against the union &amp; confederacy of the others, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
are two, and are in like manner capable of infinite augmentation.</p>

                        <p>This is a doubt worthy of <hi>Sagredus;</hi> and to explain it so as
that we may more cleerly apprehend it, for that you say that you
your self have but a confused <hi>Idea</hi> of it, we will distinguish of the
same by reducing it into figure; which may also perhaps afford us
some ease in resolving the same. Let us therefore <hi>[in Fig. 4.]</hi> draw
a perpendicular line towards the centre, and let it be AC, and to it
at right angles let there be drawn the Horizontal line AB, upon
which the motion of the projection ought to be made; now the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
would continue to move along the same with an even motion, if
so be its gravity did not incline it downwards. Let us suppose from
the point A a right line to be drawn, that may make any angle at
pleasure with the line AB; which let be AE, and upon AB let us
mark some equal spaces AF, FH, HK, and from them let us let fall
the perpendiculars FG, HI, KL, as far as AE. And because, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
hath been said, the descending grave body departing from rest,
goeth from time to time acquiring a greater degrees of velocity,
according as the said time doth successively encrease; we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the spaces AF, FH, HK, to represent unto us equal times; and
the perpendiculars FG, HI, KL, degrees of velocity acquired in the
said times; so that the degree of velocity acquired in the whole time
AK, is as the line KL, in respect to the degree HI, acquired in the
time AH, and the degree FG in the time AF; the which degrees KL,
HI, FG, are (as is manifest) the same in proportion, as the times KA,
HA, FA, and if other perpendiculars were drawn from the points
marked at pleasure in the line FA, one might successively find de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
lesse and lesse <hi>in infinitum,</hi> proceeding towards the point A,
representing the first instant of time, and the first state of rest. And
this retreat towards A, representeth the first propension to the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:96976:101"/>
motion of descent, diminished <hi>in infinitum</hi> by the approach of
the moveable to the first state of rest, which approximation is
augmentable <hi>in infinitum.</hi> Now let us find the other diminution
of velocity, which likewise may proceed to infinity, by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution
of the gravity of the moveable, and this shall be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
by drawing other lines from the point A, which contein
angles lesse than the angle BAE, which would be this line AD,
the which intersecting the parallels KL, HI, FG, in the points
M, N, and O, represent unto us the degrees FO, HN, KM,
acquired in the times AF, AH, AK, lesse than the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
FG, HI, KL, acquired in the same times; but these
latter by a moveable more ponderous, and those other by a
moveable more light. And it is manifest, that by the retreat of
the line EA towards AB, contracting the angle EAB (the
which may be done <hi>in infinitum,</hi> like as the gravity may <hi>in infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum</hi>
be diminished) the velocity of the cadent moveable may
in like manner be diminished <hi>in infinitum,</hi> and so consequently
the cause that impeded the projection; and therefore my thinks
that the union of these two reasons against the projection, dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
to infinity, cannot be any impediment to the said proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
And couching the whole argument in its shortest terms, we
will say, that by contracting the angle EAB, the degrees of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity
LK, IH, GF, are diminished; and moreover by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
of the parallels KL, HI, FG, towards the angle A, the
same degrees are again diminished; and both these diminutions
extend to infinity: Therefore the velocity of the motion of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent
may very well diminish so much, (it admitting of a twofold
diminution <hi>in infinitum</hi>) as that it may not suffice to restore the
moveable to the circumference of the wheel, and thereupon may
occasion the projection to be hindered and wholly obviated.</p>
                        <p>Again on the contrary, to impede the projection, it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
that the spaces by which the project is to descend for the
reuniting it self to the Wheel, be made so short and close toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that though the descent of the moveable be retarded, yea
more, diminished <hi>in infinitum,</hi> yet it sufficeth to reconduct it thither:
and therefore it would be requisite, that you find out a diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the said spaces, not only produced to infinity, but to such an
infinity, as that it may superate the double infinity that is made in
the diminution of the velocity of the descending moveable. But
how can a magnitude be diminished more than another, which
hath a twofold diminution <hi>in infinitum?</hi> Now let <hi>Simplicius</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
how hard it is to philosophate well in nature, without <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry.</hi>
The degrees of velocity diminished <hi>in infinitum,</hi> as well
by the diminution of the gravity of the moveable, as by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proxination
to the first term of the motion, that is, to the state
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:96976:101"/>
of rest, are alwayes determinate, and answer in proportion to the
parallels comprehended between two right lines that concur in
an angle, like to the angle BAE, or BAD, or any other
infinitely more acute, alwayes provided it be rectilineall.
But the diminution of the spaces thorow which the moveable is
to be conducted along the circumference of the wheel, is propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate
to another kind of diminution, comprehended between
lines that contain an angle infinitely more narrow and acute, than
any rectilineal angle, how acute soever, which is that in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
case. Let any point be taken in the perpendicular AC, and
making it the centre, describe at the distance CA, an arch AMP,
the which shall intersect the parallels that determine the degrees of
velocity, though they be very minute, and comprehended within
a most acute rectilineal angle; of which parallels the parts that
lie between the arch and the tangent AB, are the quantities of
the spaces, and of the returns upon the wheel, alwayes lesser (and
with greater proportion lesser, by how much neerer they approach
to the contact) than the said parallels of which they are parts.
The parallels comprehended between the right lines in retiring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the angle diminish alwayes at the same rate, as <hi>v. g.</hi> AH be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
divided in two equal parts in F, the parallel HI shall be dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to FG, and sub-dividing FA, in two equal parts, the paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
produced from the point of the division shall be the half of
FG; and continuing the sub-division <hi>in infinitum,</hi> the subsequent
parallels shall be alwayes half of the next preceding; but it doth
not so fall out in the lines intercepted between the tangent and
the circumference of the circle: For if the same sub-division be
made in FA; and supposing for example, that the parallel which
cometh from the point H, were double unto that which commeth
from F, this shall be more then double to the next following, and

unremoveable upon the circumference.</p>

                        <p>I very well comprehend the whole discourse, and upon
what it layeth all its stresse, yet neverthelesse methinks that he
that would take pains to pursue it, might yet start some further
questions, by saying, that of those two causes which render the
descent of the moveable slower and slower <hi>in infinitum,</hi> it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
that that which dependeth on the vicinity to the first term of
the descent, increaseth alwayes in the same proportion, like as the
parallels alwayes retain the same proportion to each other, &amp;c.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:96976:102"/>
but that the diminution of the same velocity, dependent on the
diminution of the gravity of the moveable (which vvas the second
cause) doth also observe the same proportion, doth not so plainly
appear, And vvho shall assure us that it doth not proceed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the proportion of the lines intercepted between the secant,
and the circumference; or vvhether vvith a greater proportion?</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>I have assumed for a truth, that the velocities of movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
descending naturally, vvill follovv the proportion of their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities,
with the favour of <hi>Simplicius,</hi> and of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who doth
in many places affirm the same, as a proposition manifest: You,
in favour of my adversary, bring the same into question, and say
that its possible that the velocity increaseth with greater propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yea and greater <hi>in infinitum</hi> than that of the gravity; so that
all that hath been said falleth to the ground: For maintaining
whereof, I say, that the proportion of the velocities is much lesse
than that of the gravities; and thereby I do not onely support
but confirme the premises. And for proof of this I appeal unto
experience, which will shew us, that a grave body, howbeit thirty
or fourty times bigger then another; as for example, a ball of
lead, and another of sugar, will not move much more than twice
as fast. Now if the projection would not be made, albeit the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity
of the cadent body should diminish according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of the gravity, much lesse would it be made so long as the
velocity is but little diminished, by abating much from the gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
But yet supposing that the velocity diminisheth with a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
much greater than that wherewith the gravity decreaseth, nay
though it were the self-same wherewith those parallels conteined
between the tangent and circumference do decrease, yet cannot I
see any necessity why I should grant the projection of matters of
never so great levity; yea I farther averre, that there could no such
projection follow, meaning alwayes of matters not properly and
absolutely light, that is, void of all gravity, and that of their own
natures move upwards, but that descend very slowly, and
have very small gravity. And that which moveth me so to think
is, that the diminution of gravity, made according to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the parallels between the tangent and the circumference,
hath for its ultimate and highest term the nullity of weight, as those
parallels have for their last term of their diminution the contact it
self, which is an indivisible point: Now gravity never diminisheth
so far as to its last term, for then the moveable would cease to be
grave; but yet the space of the reversion of the project to the
circumference is reduced to the ultimate minuity, which is when
the moveable resteth upon the circumference in the very point of
contact; so as that to return thither it hath no need of space:
and therefore let the propension to the motion of descent be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:96976:102"/>
so small, yet is it alwayes more than sufficient to reconduct the
moveable to the circumference, from which it is distant but its least
space, that is, nothing at all.</p>

so much the more against your cause? For if it be supposed
that the tangent was separated from the terrestrial superficies, yet
it hath been however demonstrated that by reason of the great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity
of the angle of contingence (if happily it may be call'd an
angle) the project would not separate from the same; how much
lesse cause of separation would it have, if that angle should be
wholly closed,<note place="margin">The truth sometimes gaines strength by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</note> and the superficies and the tangent become all one?
Perceive you not that the Projection would do the same thing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the surface of the Earth, which is asmuch as to say, it would
do just nothing at all? You see then the power of truth, which
while you strive to oppose it, your own assaults themselves uphold

which you desire to prove, is it not, that the curved line ACB, is
longer than the right line AB; the middle term which is taken

                        <p>That the curve-line ACB, is greater than the right
line AB, is the conclusion more known than the middle term,
which is, that the same curve-line is greater than the two right-lines
AC and CB. Now when the middle term is less known
than the conclusion, it is called a proving <hi>ignotum per ignotius.</hi>
But to return to our purpose, it is sufficient that you know the
right line to be the shortest of all the lines that can be drawn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two points. And as to the principal conclusion, you say,
that the material sphere doth not touch the sphere in one sole
point. What then is its contact?</p>

that a sphere of metal passing along a plane, its own weight should
not so depress it, as that the plain should yield somewhat, or that
the sphere it self should not in the contact admit of some impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

it will be no less difficult to find a sphere so perfect, as that
it hath all the lines from the centre to the superficies, exactly
equal.</p>

                        <p>I very readily grant you all this that you have said; but
it is very much beside our purpose: for whilst you go about to
shew me that a material sphere toucheth not a material plane in
one point alone, you make use of a sphere that is not a sphere, and
of a plane that is not a plane; for that, according to what you
say, either these things cannot be found in the world, or if they
may be found, they are spoiled in applying them to work the effect.
It had been therefore a less evil, for you to have granted the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
but conditionally, to wit, that if there could be made of
matter a sphere and a plane that were and could continue perfect,
they would touch in one sole point, and then to have denied that
any such could be made.</p>

matter, that body which ought to be perfectly spherical, and that
plane which ought to be perfectly level, do not prove to be the

                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>Then when ever in concrete you do apply a material Sphere
to a material plane,<note place="margin">Things are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the same in abstract as in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete.</note> you apply an imperfect Sphere to an imperfect
plane, &amp; these you say do not touch only in one point. But I must
tell you, that even in abstract an immaterial Sphere, that is, not a
perfect Sphere, may touch an immaterial plane, that is, not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
plane, not in one point, but with part of its superficies, so that
hitherto that which falleth out in concrete, doth in like manner
hold true in abstract. And it would be a new thing that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations
and rates made in abstract numbers, should not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
answer to the Coines of Gold and Silver, and to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes
in concrete. But do you know <hi>Simplicius,</hi> how this
commeth to passe? Like as to make that the computations agree
with the Sugars, the Silks, the Wools, it is necessary that the
accomptant reckon his tares of chests, bags, and such other things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
So when the <hi>Geometricall Philosopher</hi> would observe in concrete
the effects demonstrated in abstract, he must defalke the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the matter, and if he know how to do that, I do assure
you, the things shall jump no lesse exactly, than <hi>Arithmetical</hi>
computations. The errours therefore lyeth neither in abstract, nor
in concrete, nor in <hi>Geometry,</hi> nor in <hi>Physicks,</hi> but in the Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
that knoweth not how to adjust his accompts. Therefore if
you had a perfect Sphere and plane, though they were material,
you need not doubt but that they would touch onely in one point.
And if such a Sphere was and is impossible to be procured, it was
much besides the purpose to say, <hi>Quod Sphaera aenea non tangit in
puncto.</hi> Furthermore, if I grant you <hi>Simplicius,</hi> that in matter a
figure cannot be procured that is perfectly spherical, or perfectly
level: Do you think there may be had two materiall bodies,
whose superficies in some part, and in some sort are incurvated as
irregularly as can be desired?</p>

point; for this contact in but one point alone is not the sole and
peculiar priviledge of the perfect Sphere and perfect plane. Nay, he
that should prosecute this point with more subtil contemplations
would finde that it is much harder to procure two bodies that
touch with part of their s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

For if two superficies be required to combine well together, it is
necessary either, that they be both exactly plane, or that if one be
convex, the other be concave; but in such a manner concave,
that the concavity do exactly answer to the convexity of the other:

because for the most part there will be some small yielding filth
upon them, as because that no diligence is used in applying them
without striking one another; and every small matter sufficeth to
make the one superficies yield somewhat to the other; so that
they interchangeably, at least in some small particle, receive figure
from the impression of each other. But in case their superficies
were very terse and polite, and that they were both laid upon a
table, that so one might not presse upon the other, and gently put
towards one another, I question not, but that they might be
brought to the simple contact in one onely point.</p>

and solid body, that is, perfectly of a Spherical figure, and whil'st
I saw <hi>Salviatus</hi> in a certain manner, not gainsaying, to give his
consent thereto; therefore I would know, whether there would
be the same difficulty in forming a solid of some other figure, that
is, to expresse my self better, whether there is more difficulty in
reducing a piece of Marble into the figure of a perfect Sphere, than
into a perfect Pyramid, or into a perfect Horse, or into a perfect

first place, I will acquit my self of the assent which you think I
gave to <hi>Simplicius,</hi> which was only for a time; for I had it also in
my thoughts, before I intended to enter upon any other matter, to
speak that, which, it may be, is the same, or very like to that which
you are about to say;<note place="margin">The Sphericall Figure is easier to be made than any other.</note> And answering to your first question, I say,
that if any figure can be given to a Solid, the Spherical is the easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

the superficial. The description of which Circle, as being more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
than all the rest, hath alone been judged by <hi>Mathematicians</hi>
worthy to be put amongst the<note n="*" place="margin">Demands or Petitions.</note> 
                           <hi>postulata</hi> belonging to the descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of all other figures. And the formation of the Sphere is
so very easie, that if in a plain plate of hard metal you take an
empty or hollow circle, within which any Solid goeth casually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving
that was before but grosly rounded, it shall, without any
other artifice be reduced to a Spherical figure, as perfect as is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for it to be; provided, that that same Solid be not lesse than
the Sphere that would passe thorow that Circle. And that which is
yet more worthy of our consideration is, that within the self-same
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:96976:105"/>
incavity one may form Spheres of several magnitudes.<note place="margin">Sphericall Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of sundry magnitudes may be made with one onely instrument.</note> But what
is required to the making of an Horse, or (as you say) of a Grass-hopper,

                        <p>Gentlemen, with your favour, I may say that we have
sallied out into a dispute not much more worth than the wool of a
goat; and whereas our argumentations should continually be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant
about serious and weighty points, we consume our time in
frivolous and impertinent wranglings.<note place="margin">The constitution of the Vniverse is one of the most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Problems.</note> Let us call to minde, I pray
you, that the search of the worlds constitution, is one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
and noblest Problems that are in nature; and so much the
greater, inasmuch as it is directed to the resolving of that other;
to wit, of the cause of the Seas ebbing and flowing, enquired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
by all the famous men, that have hitherto been in the world,
and possibly found out by none of them. Therefore if we have
nothing more remaining for the full confutation of the argument
taken from the Earths <hi>vertigo,</hi> which was the last, alledged to
prove its immobility upon its own centre, let us passe to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
of those things that are alledged for, and against the
<hi>Annual Motion.</hi>

                        <p>I would not have you, <hi>Salviatus,</hi> measure our wits by
the scale of yours: you, who use to be continually busied about
the sublimest contemplations, esteem those notions frivolous and
below you, which we think matters worthy of our profoundest
thoughts: yet sometimes for our satisfaction do not disdain to
stoop so low as to give way a little to our curiosity. As to the
refutation of the last argument, taken from the extrusions of the
diurnal <hi>vertigo,</hi> far less than what hath been said, would have
given me satisfaction: and yet the things superfluously spoken,
seemed to me so ingenious, that they have been so far from wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
my fancy, as that they have, by reason of their novelty, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
me all along with so great delight, that I know not how
to desire greater: Therefore, if you have any other speculation
to add, produce it, for I, as to my own particular, shall gladly
hearken to it.</p>

sight, I will for a full and true measure of the past dispute, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
another fallacy of the Sectators of <hi>Ptolomey</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
which I take from the argument alledged.</p>

                        <p>We have hitherto over-passed, and granted to <hi>Ptolomey,</hi>
as an effect indubitable, that the extrusion of the stone proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the velocity of the wheel turn'd round upon its centre,
the cause of the said extrusion encreaseth in proportion, as the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity
of the <hi>vertigo</hi> (or whirling) is augmented: from whence
it was inferred, that the velocity of the Earth's <hi>vertigo</hi> being
very much greater than that of any machin whatsoever, that we
can make to turn round artificially; the extrusion of stones, of
animals, &amp;c. would consequently be far more violent. Now, I
observe that there is a great fallacy in this discourse, in that we do
compare these velocities indifferently and absolutely to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
It's true, that if I compare the velocities of the same wheel,
or of two wheels equal to each other, that which shall be more
swiftly turn'd round, shall extrude the stone with greater vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
and the velocity encreasing, the cause of the projection
shall likewise encrease: but when the velocity is augmented, not
by encreasing the velocity in the same wheel, which would be by
causing it to make a greater number of revolutions in equal times;
but by encreasing the diameter, and making the wheel greater, so
as that the conversion taking up the same time in the lesser wheel,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:96976:106"/>
as in the greater,<note place="margin">The cause of the projection increas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not according to the proportion of the velocity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased by making the wheel bigger.</note> the velocity is greater onely in the bigger wheel,
for that its circumference is bigger; there is no man that thinketh
that the cause of the extrusion in the great wheel will encrease ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the proportion of the velocity of its circumference, to
the velocity of the circumference of the other lesser wheel; for that
this is most false, as by a most expeditious experiment I shall thus
grosly declare: We may sling a stone with a stick of a yard long,
farther than we can do with a stick six yards long, though
the motion of the end of the long stick, that is of the stone placed
in the slit thereof, were more than double as swift as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the end of the other shorter stick, as it would be if
the velocities were such that the lesser stick should turn thrice
round in the time whilst the greater is making one onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.</p>

                        <p>This which you tell me, <hi>Salviatus,</hi> must, I see, needs
succeed in this very manner; but I do not so readily apprehend
the cause why equal velocities should not operate equally in
extruding projects, but that of the lesser wheel much more than
the other of the greater wheel; therefore I intreat you to tell me
how this cometh to pass?</p>

                        <p>Herein, <hi>Sagredus,</hi> you seem to differ much from your
self, for that you were wont to penetrate all things in an instant,
and now you have overlook'd a fallacy couched in the experiment
of the stick, which I my self have been able to discover: and this
is the different manner of operating, in making the projection one
while with the short sling and another while with the long one,
for if you will have the stone fly out of the slit, you need not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
its motion uniformly, but at such time as it is at the swiftest,
you are to stay your arm, and stop the velocity of the stick; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the stone which was in its swiftest motion, flyeth out, and
moveth with impetuosity: but now that stop cannot be made in
the great stick, which by reason of its length and flexibility, doth
not entirely obey the check of the arm, but continueth to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
the stone for some space, and holdeth it in with so much less
force, and not as if you had with a stiff sling sent it going with a
jerk: for if both the sticks or slings should be check'd by one and
the same obstacle, I do believe they would fly aswell out of the
one, as out of the other, howbeit their motions were equally
swift.</p>

to <hi>Simplicius,</hi> in regard he hath addressed himself to me;
and I say, that in his discourse there is somewhat good
and somewhat bad: good, because it is almost all true;
bad, because it doth not agree with our case: Truth is, that when
that which carrieth the stones with velocity, shall meet with a
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:96976:107"/>
check that is immoveable, they shall fly out with great impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity:
the same effect following in that case, which we see dayly
to fall out in a boat that running a swift course, runs a-ground, or
meets with some sudden stop, for all those in the boat, being sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized,

check, as should be able to resist and arrest its <hi>vertigo,</hi> then indeed
I do believe that not onely beasts, buildings and cities, but moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
lakes and seas would overturn, and the globe it self would
go near to shake in pieces; but nothing of all this concerns our
present purpose, for we speak of what may follow to the motion
of the Earth, it being turn'd round uniformly, and quietly about
its own centre, howbeit with a great velocity. That likewise
which you say of the slings, is true in part; but was not alledged
by <hi>Salviatus,</hi> as a thing that punctually agreed with the matter
whereof we treat, but onely, as an example, for so in gross it may
prompt us in the more accurate consideration of that point, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the velocity increasing at any rate, the cause of the proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
doth increase at the same rate: so that <hi>v. g.</hi> if a wheel of
ten yards diameter, moving in such a manner that a point of its
circumference will pass an hundred yards in a minute of an hour,
and so hath an <hi>impetus</hi> able to extrude a stone, that same <hi>impetus</hi>
shall be increased an hundred thousand times in a wheel of a million
of yards diameter; the which <hi>Salviatus</hi> denieth, and I incline to his
opinion; but not knowing the reason thereof, I have requested it
of him, and stand impatiently expecting it.</p>

yet neverthelesse I believe that in the sequel of the dispute,
you will find that they do not prove so. Therefore let <hi>Sagredus</hi>

                        <p>I see not for the present that the moveable hath any
internal resistance to motion, unlesse it be its natural inclination
and propension to the contrary motion, as in grave bodies, that
have a propension to the motion downwards, the resistance is to
the motion upwards; and I said an internal resistance, because
of this, I think, it is you intend to speak, and not of the external
resistances, which are many and accidental.</p>

there be not in the moveable, besides the natural inclination to the

                        <p>I believe that it is exactly the same. And for this reason
I see that two equal weights being put into a ballance, they do
stand still in <hi>equilibrium,</hi> the gravity of the one resisting its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
raised by the gravity wherewith the other pressing down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
would raise it.</p>

                        <p>Very well; so that if you would have one raise up the
other, you must encrease the weight of that which depresseth,
or lessen the weight of the other. But if the resistance to ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
motion cunsist onely in gravity, how cometh it to passe, that
in ballances of unequal arms, to wit in the<note n="*" place="margin">A portable bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance wherewith market-people weigh their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, giving it gravity by remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the weight farther from the cock: call'd by the Latines, <hi>Campana trutina.</hi>

doth not suffice to raise up on of four pounds; that shall counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poise
with it, nay this of four, descending shall raise up that

the weight which vve vvould vveigh? If the resistance to motion
resideth onely in the gravity, hovv can the arm with its vveight of
four pounds onely, resist the vveight of a sack of wool, or bale of
silk, vvhich shall be eight hundred, or a thousand vveight; yea
more, hovv can it overcome the sack vvith its moment, and raise
it up? It must therefore be confest <hi>Sagredus,</hi> that here it maketh
use of some other resistance, and other force, besides that of
simple gravity.</p>

                        <p>I think that your putting me to it a second time, hath
made me remember something that may be to the purpose. In
both these beams the business is done by the weight, and by the
motion; in the ballance, the motions are equal, and therefore the
one weight must exceed it in gravity before it can move it; in the
stiliard, the lesser weight will not move the greater, unless when
this latter moveth little, as being hung at a lesser distance, and the
other much, as hanging at a greater distance from the lacquet or
cock. It is necessary therefore to conclude, that the lesser weight
overcometh the resistance of the greater, by moving much, whilst
the other is moved but little.</p>

                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>Yes doubtless, as I am able by many experiments to
demonstrate: but for the present, let this onely of the stiliard
suffice: in which you see that the light end of the beam is then
able to sustain and equilibrate the great Wool-sack, when its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from the centre, upon which the stiliard resteth and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
shall so much exceed the lesser distance, by how much the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
gravity of the Wool-sack exceedeth that of the pendent
weight. And we see nothing that can cause this insufficiencie in
the great sack of Wool, to raise with its weight the pendent
weight so much less grave, save the disparity of the motions which
the one and the other should make, whilst that the Wool-sack by
descending but one inch onely, will raise the pendent weight an
hundred inches: (supposing that the sack did weigh an hundred
times as much, and that the distance of the small weight from the
centre of the beam were an hundred times greater, than the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
between the said centre and the point of the sacks suspensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.)
And again, the pendent weight its moving the space of an
hundred inches, in the time that the sack moveth but one inch
onely, is the same as to say, that the velocity of the motion of the
little pendent weight, is an hundred times greater than the velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of the motion of the sack. Now fix it in your belief, as a
true and manifest axiom, that the resistance which proceedeth from
the velocity of motion, compensateth that which dependeth on
the gravity of another moveable: So that consequently, a move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
of one pound, that moveth with an hundred degrees of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity,
doth as much resist all obstruction, as another moveable
of an hundred weight, whose velocity is but one degree onely.
And two equal moveables will equally resist their being moved,
if that they shall be moved with equal velocity: but if one be
to be moved more swiftly than the other, it shall make greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
according to the greater velocity that shall be conferred
on it. These things being premised, let us proceed to the expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of our Problem; and for the better understanding of
things, let us make a short Scheme thereof. Let two unequal
wheels be described about this centre A, <hi>[in Fig. 7.]</hi> and let the
circumference of the lesser be BG, and of the greater CEH, and
let the semidiameter ABC, be perpendicular to the Horizon; and
by the points B and C, let us draw the right lined Tangents BF
and CD; and in the arches BG and CE, take two equal parts
BG and CE: and let the two wheels be supposed to be turn'd
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:96976:108"/>
round upon their centres with equal velocities, so as that two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veables,
which suppose for example to be two stones placed in the
points B and C, come to be carried along the circumferences BG
and CE, with equal velocities; so that in the same time that the
stone B shall have run the arch BG, the stone C will have past the
arch CE. I say now, that the whirl or <hi>vertigo</hi> of the lesser wheel
is much more potent to make the projection of the stone B, than
the <hi>vertigo</hi> of the bigger wheel to make that of the stone C.
Therefore the projection, as we have already declared, being to be
made along the tangent, when the stones B and C are to separate
from their wheel, and to begin the motion of projection from the
points B and C, then shall they be extruded by the <hi>impetus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from the <hi>vertigo</hi> by (or along) the tangents BF and CD.
The two stones therefore have equal impetuosities of running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
the tangents BF and CD, and would run along the same, if
they were not turn'd aside by some other force: is it not so <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredus?</hi>

                        <p>It is either their own gravity, or else some glutinous
matter that holdeth them fast and close to the wheels.</p>

                        <p>But for the diverting of a moveable from the motion
to which nature inciteth it, is there not required greater or lesser
force, according as the deviation is intended to be greater or les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser?
that is, according as the said moveable in its deviation hath a
greater or lesser space to move in the same time?</p>

                        <speaker>SAGR.</speaker>
                        <p>Yes certainly: for it was concluded even now, that to
make a moveable to move; the movent vertue must be increased
in proportion to the velocity wherewith it is to move.</p>

                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>Now consider, that for the deviating the stone upon
the lesse wheel from the motion of projection, which it would
make by the tangent BF, and for the holding of it fast to the
wheel, it is required, that its own gravity draw it back the whole
length of the secant FG, or of the perpendicular raised from the
point G, to the line BF, whereas in the greater wheel the retracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
needs to be no more than the secant DE, or the perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
let fall from the tangent DC to the point E, lesse by much
than FG, and alwayes lesser and lesser according as the wheel is
made bigger. And forasmuch as these retractions (as I may call
them) are required to be made in equal times, that is, whil'st the
wheels passe the two equal arches BG and CE, that of the stone
B, that is, the retraction FG ought to be more swift than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
DE; and therefore much greater force will be required for
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:96976:109"/>
holding fast the stone B to its little wheel, than for the holding
the stone C to its great one, which is as much as to say, that such
a small thing will impede the extrusion in the great wheel, as will
not at all hinder it in the little one. It is manifest therefore that
the more the wheel augmenteth, the more the cause of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
diminisheth.</p>

                     <sp>

                        <p>From this which I now understand, by help of your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
dissertation, I am induced to think, that I am able to satisfie
my judgment in a very few words. For equal <hi>impetus</hi> being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
on both the stones that move along the tangents, by the
equal velocity of the two wheels, we see the great circumference,
by means of its small deviation from the tangent, to go seconding,
as it were, and in a fair way refraining in the stone the appetite, if
I may so say, of separating from the circumference; so that any
small retention, either of its own inclination, or of some glutina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
sufficeth to hold it fast to the wheel. Which, again, is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to work the like effect in the little wheel, which but little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting
the direction of the tangent, seeketh with too much ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gernesse
to hold fast the stone; and the restriction and glutination
not being stronger than that which holdeth the other stone fast to
the greater wheel, it<note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Strappar la ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vezza,</hi> is to break the bridle.</note> breaks loose, and runneth along the tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.
Therefore I do not only finde that all those have erred,
who have believed the cause of the projection to increase accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the augmentation of the <hi>vertigo's</hi> velocity; but I am
further thinking, that the projection diminishing in the inlarging of
the wheel, so long as the same velocity is reteined in those wheels;
it may possibly be true, that he that would make the great wheel
extrude things like the little one, would be forced to increase
them as much in velocity; as they increase in diameter, which he
might do, by making them to finish their conversions in equal
times; and thus we may conclude, that the Earths revolution or
<hi>vertigo</hi> would be no more able to extrude stones, than any little
wheel that goeth so slowly, as that it maketh but one turn in twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
four hours.</p>

that a grave body falling from thence above would consume more
than six dayes in attaining to the centre of the Earth, to which all
grave bodies naturally move. Now if by the absolute Divine

up thither, and placed in our Zenith or vertical point, and from
thence let go at liberty, it is in his, and also in my opinion, a most
incredible thing that it, in descending downwards, should all the
way maintain it self in our vertical line, continuing to turn round
with the Earth, about its centre, for so many dayes, describing
under the Equinoctial a Spiral line in the plain of the great circle
it self; and under other Parallels, Spiral lines about Cones, and
under the Poles falling by a simple right line. He, in the next

passing to the centre of the Earth, and that I think I remember
that the time would not be so long; it would be fit that you shew

advantage for his adversaries, supposing that the velocity of
the body falling along the vertical line, towards the centre of the
Earth, were equal to the velocity of its circular motion, which it
made in the grand circle of the concave of the Lunar Orb.
Which by equation would come to passe in an hour, twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
six hundred German miles, a thing which indeed savours of
impossibility: Yet neverthelesse, to shew his abundant caution,
and to give all advantages to his adversaries, he supposeth it for
true, and concludeth, that the time of the fall ought however to
be more than six dayes.</p>

for that having it in the power of his will to give what velocity he
pleased to such a descending body, and might aswell have made it
six moneths, nay, six years in falling to the Earth, he is content
with six dayes. But, good <hi>Salviatus,</hi> sharpen my appetite a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,

                        <p>I shall undoubtedly be much pleased therewith, though
indeed, as to what concerneth Natural Philosophy, I do not think
that it is necessary to descend unto minute particularities, a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
knowledg of the definition of motion, and of the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of natural and violent, even and accelerate, and the like,
sufficing: For if this were not sufficient, I do not think that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>

                        <p>It may be so. But let us not lose more time about
this, which I promise to spend half a day apart in, for your satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction;
nay, now I remember, I did promise you once before to
satisfie you herein. Returning therefore to our begun calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the time, wherein the grave cadent body would pass from
the concave of the Moon to the centre of the earth, that we may
not proceed arbitrarily and at randon, but with a Logical method,
we will first attempt to ascertain our selves by experiments often
repeated, in how long time a ball <hi>v. g.</hi> of Iron descendeth to the
Earth from an altitude of an hundred yards.</p>

                        <p>Let us therefore take a ball of such a determinate
weight, and let it be the same wherewith we intend to make the
computation of the time of descent from the Moon.</p>

                        <p>This is not material, for that a ball of one, of ten, of an
hundred, of a thousand pounds, will all measure the same hundred
yards in the same time.</p>

also, that two balls of the same matter, being let fall in the

from an altitude of an hundred yards, the great one arriveth at the
ground, before the other is descended but one yard onely: Now
bring your fancy, if you can, to imagine, that you see the great

five second-minutes of an hour. And because, as we have said,
the spaces that are measured by the cadent moveable, increase in
double proportion; that is, according to the squares of the times,
being that the time of one first-minute is duodecuple to the time
of five seconds, if we multiply the hundred yards by the square of
12, that is by 144, we shall have 14400, which shall be the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of yards that the same moveable shall pass in one first-minute
of an hour: and following the same rule because one hour is 60
minutes, multiplying 14400, the number of yards past in one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute,
by the square of 60, that is, by 3600, there shall come forth
51840000, the number of yards to be passed in an hour, which
make 17280 miles. And desiring to know the space that the said
ball would pass in 4 hours, let us multiply 17280 by 16, (which
is the square of 4) and the product will be 276480 miles: which
number is much greater than the distance from the Lunar concave
to the centre of the Earth, which is but 196000 miles, making the
distance of the concave 56 semidiameters of the Earth, as that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern

not be passed under more than six days, you see that (computing

in much less than four hours; and making the computation
exact, it shall be passed by the moveable in 3 hours, 22 <hi>min. prim.</hi>

                        <p>So indeed it is: therefore having (as I have said) by
diligent tryal observed, that such a moveable passeth in its descent,
the height of 100 yards in 5 seconds of an hour, we will say, if
100 yards are passed in 5 seconds; in how many seconds shall
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:96976:112"/>
588000000 yards (for so many are in 56 diameters of the Earth)
be passed? The rule for this work is, that the third number must
be multiplied by the square of the second, of which doth come
14700000000, which ought to be divided by the first, that is, by
100, and the root square of the quotient, that is, 12124 is the
number sought, namely 12124 <hi>min. secun.</hi> of an hour, which are
3 hours, 22 <hi>min. prim.</hi> and 4 seconds.</p>

                        <p>Yet I will give it, though you do not ask it, because it
is very easie. Let us mark these three numbers with the Letters
A first, B second, C
third. A and C are the
numbers of the spaces,
B is the number of the
time; the fourth number
is sought, of the time
also. And because we
know, that look what
proportion the space A,
hath to the spuace C, the
same proportion shall the
square of the time B
have to the sqare of the
time, which is sought.

                        <p>There might be much more said touching these local
motions; but according to agreement, we will reserve it to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
conference; and for the present I will speak something
touching the Author named by <hi>Simplicius,</hi> who thinketh he hath
given a great advantage to the adverse party in granting that, that
Canon bullet in falling from the concave of the Moon may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
with a velocity equal to the velocity wherewith it would
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:96976:113"/>
turn round, staying there above, and moving along with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal
conversion. Now I tell him, that that same ball falling from
the concave unto the centre, will acquire a degree of velocity
much more than double the velocity of the diurnal motion of the
Lunar concave;<note place="margin">The falling move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able if it move with a degree of veloci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty acquired in a like time with an uniform motion, it shall pass a space double to that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with the acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated motion.</note> and this I will make out by solid and not imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
suppositions. You must know therefore that the grave
body falling and acquiring all the way new velocity according
to the proportion already mentioned, hath in any whatsoever
place of the line of its motion such a degree of velocity, that if it
should continue to move therewith, uniformly without farther
encreasing it; in another time like to that of its descent, it would
passe a space double to that passed in the line of the precedent
motion of descent. And thus for example, if that ball in coming
from the concave of the Moon to its centre hath spent three hours,
22 min. <hi>prim.</hi> and 4 seconds, I say, that being arrived at the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
it shall find it self constituted in such a degree of velocity, that
if with that, without farther encreasing it, it should continue to
move uniformly, it would in other 3 hours, 22 min. <hi>prim.</hi> and
4 seconds, passe double that space, namely as much as the whole
diameter of the Lunar Orb; and because from the Moons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave
to the centre are 196000 miles, which the ball passeth in 3
hours 22 <hi>prim.</hi> min. and 4 seconds, therefore (according to what
hath been said) the ball continuing to move with the velocity
which it is found to have in its arrival at the centre, it would
passe in other 3 hours 22 min. prim. and 4 seconds, a space dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to that, namely 392000 miles; but the same continuing in
the concave of the Moon, which is in circuit 1232000 miles, and
moving therewith in a diurnal motion, it would make in the same
time, that is in 3 hours 22 min. prim. and 4 seconds, 172880
miles, which are fewer by many than the half of the 392000
miles. You see then that the motion in the concave is not as the
modern Author saith, that is, of a velocity impossible for the fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ball to partake of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

plummet be of any considerable weight) that it riseth so little less
than it descended, so that I have sometimes thought, that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending

a question whether the vibrations might not perpetuate themselves;
and I believe that they might,<note place="margin">The motion of grave <hi>penduli</hi> might be perpetua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, impediments being removed.</note> if that it were possible to remove

                        <p>You will be pleased when you hear it, but I shall not
tell it you till anon: in the mean time, let us proceed. I have
proposed the observation of this <hi>Pendulum,</hi> to the intent, that you
should understand, that the <hi>impetus</hi> acquired in the descending
arch, where the motion is natural, is of it self able to drive the
said ball with a violent motion, as far on the other side in the like
ascending arch; if so, I say, of it self, all external impediments
being removed: I believe also that every one takes it for granted,
that as in the descending arch the velocity all the way increaseth,
till it come to the lowest point, or its perpendicularity; so from
this point, by the other ascending arch, it all the way diminisheth,
untill it come to its extreme and highest point: and diminishing
with the same proportions, wherewith it did before increase, so that
the dgrees of the velocities in the points equidistant from the point
of perpendicularity, are equal to each other. Hence it seemeth
to me (arguing with all due modesty) that I might easily be induced
to believe,<note place="margin">If the Terrestrial Globe were perfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, a grave bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy descending by that bore, would pass and ascend as far beyond the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, as it did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend.</note> that if the Terrestrial Globe were bored thorow the
centre, a Canon bullet descending through that Well, would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
by that time it came to the centre, such an impulse of velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
that, it having passed beyond the centre, would spring it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the other way, as great a space, as that was wherewith it had
descended, all the way beyond the centre diminishing the velocity
with decreasements like to the increasements acquired in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent:
and the time spent in this second motion of ascent, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
would be equal to the time of descent. Now if the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by diminishing that its greatest degree of velocity which it
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:96976:114"/>
had in the centre, successively until it come to total extinction,
do carry the moveable in such a time such a certain space, as it had
gone in such a like quantity of time, by the acquist of velocity
from the total privation of it until it came to that its greatest degree;
it seemeth very reasonable, that if it should move always with the
said greatest degree of velocity it would pass, in such another
quantity of time, both those spaces: For if we do but in our
mind successively divide those velocities into rising and falling <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
degrees, as <hi>v. g.</hi> these numbers in the margine; so that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
first sort unto 10 be supposed the increasing velocities, and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
others unto one 1, be the increasing; and let those of the time <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
of the descent, and the others of the time of the ascent being <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
added all together, make as many, as if one of the two sums of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
them had been all of the greatest degrees, and therefore the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
whole space passed by all the degrees of the increasing veloci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> and decreasing, (which put together is the whole diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> ought to be equal to the space passed by the greatest velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> that are in number half the aggregate of the increasing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
and decreasing velocities. I know that I have but obscurely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>

                        <p>I think I understand you very well; and also that I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
can in a few words shew, that I do understand you. You had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
a mind to say, that the motion begining from rest, and all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
way increasing the velocity with equal augmentations, such as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
are those of continuate numbers beginning at 1, rather at 0,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
which representeth the state of rest, disposed as in the margine:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
and continued at pleasure, so as that the least degree may be 0,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
and the greatest <hi>v. g.</hi> 5, all these degrees of velocity wherewith
the moveable is moved, make the sum of 15; but if the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="0"/>
moveable should move with as many degrees in number as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
these are, and each of them equal to the biggest, which is 5, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
aggregate of all these last velocities would be double to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
others, namely 30. And therefore the moveable moving with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
a like time, but with uniform velocity, which is that of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
highest degree 5, ought to pass a space double to that which it
passeth in the accelerate time, which beginneth at the state of rest.</p>

                        <p>According to your quick and piercing way of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
things, you have explained the whole business with more
plainness than I my self; and put me also in mind of adding some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more: for in the accelerate motion, the augmentation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
continual, you cannot divide the degrees of velocity, which
continually increase, into any determinate number, because chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
every moment, they are evermore infinite. Therefore we
shall be the better able to exemplifie our intentions by describing
a Triangle, which let be this ABC, <hi>[in Fig. 8.]</hi> taking in the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:96976:114"/>
side AC, as many equal parts as we please, AD, DE, EF, FG,
and drawing by the points D, E, F, G, right lines parallel to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>
BC. Now let us imagine the parts marked in the line AC, to be
equal times, and let the parallels drawn by the points D, E, F, G,
represent unto us the degrees of velocity accelerated, and increas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
equally in equal times; and let the Point A be the state of rest,
from which the moveable departing, hath <hi>v. g.</hi> in the time AD,
acquired the degree of velocity DH, in the second time we will
suppose, that it hath increased the velocity from DH, as far as to
EI, and so supposing it to have grown greater in the succeeding
times,<note place="margin">The acceleration of grave bodies na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally descendent, increaseth from moment to moment.</note> according to the increase of the lines FK, GL, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but
because the acceleration is made continually from moment to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and not disjunctly from one certain part of time to another;
the point A being put for the lowest moment of velocity, that is,
for the state of rest, and AD for the first instant of time follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
it is manifest, that before the acquist of the degree of velocity
DH, made in the time AD, the moveable must have past by
infinite other lesser and lesser degrees gained in the infinite instants
that are in the time DA, answering the infinite points that are in
the line DA; therefore to represent unto us the infinite degrees
of velocity that precede the degree DH, it is necessary to imagine
infinite lines successively lesser and lesser, which are supposed to
be drawn by the infinite points of the line DA, and parallels to
DH, the which infinite lines represent unto us the superficies of
the Triangle AHD, and thus we may imagine any space passed
by the moveable, with a motion which begining at rest, goeth uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly
accelerating, to have spent and made use of infinite degrees
of velocity, increasing according to the infinite lines that begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the point A, are supposed to be drawn parallel to the
line HD, and to the rest IE, KF, LG, the motion continuing as
far as one will.</p>
                        <p>Now let us compleat the whole Parallelogram AMBC, and let
us prolong as far as to the side thereof BM, not onely the Parallels
marked in the Triangle, but those infinite others imagined to be
drawn from all the points of the side AC; and like as BC, was
the greatest of those infinite parallels of the Triangle, represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto us the greatest degree of velocity acquired by the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in the accelerate motion, and the whole superficies of the said
Triangle, was the mass and sum of the whole velocity, wherewith
in the time AC it passed such a certain space, so the parallelogram
is now a mass and aggregate of a like number of degrees of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity,
but each equal to the greatest BC, the which mass of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locities
will be double to the mass of the increasing velocities in
the Triangle, like as the said Parallelogram is double to the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle:
and therefore if the moveable, that falling did make use
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:96976:115"/>
of the accelerated degrees of velocity, answering to the triangle
ABC, hath passed in such a time such a space, it is very reasonable
and probable, that making use of the uniform velocities answering
to the parallelogram, it shall passe with an even motion in the
same time a space double to that passed by the accelerate mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

may shew you: and though they were very unequal, yet
would they not discountenance, but favour our cause. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us draw the perpendicular AB <hi>[in Fig. 9.]</hi> and hang from
the point A, upon the threed AC, a plummet C, and another up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the same threed also, which let be E, and the threed AC, being
removed from its perpendicularity, and then letting go the plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets
C and E, they shall move by the arches CBD, EGF, and
the plummet E, as hanging at a lesser distance, and withall, as
(by what you said) lesse removed, will return back again faster,
and make its vibrations more frequent than the plummet C, and
therefore shall hinder the said plummet C, from running so much
farther towards the term D, as it would do, if it were free: and
thus the plummet E bringing unto it in every vibration continuall
impediment,<note place="margin">The cause which impedeth the <hi>pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulum</hi> and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth it to rest.</note> it shall finally reduce it to quiescence. Now the

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:96976:115"/>
to make it, vibrations successively more and more frequent;
and consequently is able to bring a continual impediment to the
plummet C; and for a proof that this is so, if we do but observe
the thread AC, we shall see it distended not directly, but in an
arch; and if instead of the thread we take a chain, we shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern

that the chain being composed of many loose particles, and each of
them of some weight, the arches AEC, and AFD, will appear
notably incurvated. By reason therefore, that the parts of the
chain, according as they are neerer to the point A, desire to make
their vibrations more frequent, they permit not the lower parts of
the said chain to swing so far as naturally they would: and by
continual detracting from the vibrations of the plummet C, they
finally make it cease to move, although the impediment of the air
might be removed.</p>

apprehended the <hi>Copernican Hypothesis,</hi> for if he had but taken
notice how he alwayes makes the Axis of the terrestrial Globe
perpetually parallel to it self, he would not have said, that one
half of the Earth would never see the Sun, but that the year
would be one entire natural day, that is, that thorow all parts of
the Earth there would be six moneths day, and six moneths night,
as it now befalleth to the inhabitants under the Pole, but let

this, which I doubted I had committed some mistake in reciting,
therefore let us read it. <hi>His positis, necesse est, terra circulariter

These things being supposed, it is necessary, the Earth being cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
moved, that all things from the air to the same, &amp;c. So
that if we suppose these balls to be equal in magnitude and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
and being placed in the concave of the Lunar Sphere, we
permit them a free descent, and if we make the motion down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
equal in velocity to the motion about, (which nevertheless
is otherwise, if the ball A, &amp;c.) they shall be falling at least (that
we may grant much to our adversaries) six dayes; in which time
they shall be turned six times about the Earth, &amp;c.</p>

they ought to proceed, who would give themselves up to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
others in those things, which perhaps they do not believe
themselves. For me thinks it a thing impossible, but that this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
was advised, that he did design to himself a circle, whose dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter
(which amongst Mathematicians, is lesse than one third part
of the circumference) is above 72 times bigger than it self: an
errour that affirmeth that to be considerably more than 200
which is lesse than one.</p>

                        <p>It may be, that these Mathematical proportions, which
are true in abstract, being once applied in concrete to Physical and
Elementary circles, do not so exactly agree: And yet, I think,
that the Cooper, to find the semidiameter of the bottom, which he
is to fit to the Cask, doth make use of the rule of Mathematicians
in abstract, although such bottomes be things meerly material,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:96976:116"/>
and concrete<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore let <hi>Simplicius</hi> plead in excuse of this
Author; and whether he thinks that the Physicks can differ so
very much from the Mathematicks.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SIMP.</speaker>
                        <p>The substractions are in my opinion insufficient to salve
this difference, which is so extreamly too great to be reconciled:
and in this case I have no more to say but that, <hi>Quandoque bonus
dormilet Homerus.</hi> But supposing the calculation of<note n="*" place="margin">Not <hi>Sagre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> as the Latine hath it.</note> 
                           <hi>Salviatus</hi>
to be more exact, and that the time of the descent of the ball
were no more than three hours; yet me thinks, that coming from
the concave of the Moon, which is so great a distance off, it would
be an admirable thing, that it should have an instinct of maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it self all the way over the self-same point of the Earth, over
which it did hang in its departure thence, and not rather be left a
very great way behind.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>The effect may be admirable, and not admirable, but
natural and ordinary, according as the things precedent may fall
out. For if the ball (according to the Authors suppositions)
whilst it staid in the concave of the Moon, had the circular motion
of twenty four hours together with the Earth, and with the rest of
the things contained within the said Concave; that very vertue
which made it turn round before its descent, will continue it in
the same motion in its descending. And so far it is from not keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
pace with the motion of the Earth, and from staying behind,
that it is more likely to out-go it; being that in its approaches to
the Earth, the motion of gyration is to be made with circles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
lesser and lesser; so that the ball retaining in it self that
self-same velocity which it had in the concave, it ought to antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate,
as I have said, the <hi>vertigo</hi> or conversion of the Earth. But
if the ball in the concave did want that circulation, it is not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in descending to maintain it self perpendicularly over that
point of the Earth, which was just under it when the descent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.
Nor will. <hi>Copernicus,</hi> or any of his followers affirm the
same.</p>

                        <speaker>SIMP.</speaker>
                        <p>But the Author maketh an objection, as you see, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
on what principle this circular motion of grave and light
bodies, doth depend: that is, whether upon an internal or an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
principle.</p>

                        <p>Keeping to the Probleme of which we speak, I say,
that that very principle which made the ball turn round, whil'st it
was in the Lunar concave, is the same that maintaineth also the
circulation in the descent: yet I leave the Author at liberty to
make it internal or external at his pleasure.</p>

                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>And I will say then, that the ball in the concave did
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:96976:117"/>
not move, and so he shall not be bound to shew how that in des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
it continueth all the way vertically over one point, for
that it will not do any such thing.</p>

                        <p>Very well; But if grave bodies, and light can have no
principle, either internal or external of moving circularly, than
neither can the terrestrial Globe move with a circular motion: and
thus you have the intent of the Author.</p>

                        <p>I did not say, that the Earth had no principle, either
interne, or externe to the motion of gyration, but I say, that I do
not know which of the two it hath; and yet my not knowing it
hath not a power to deprive it of the same; but if this Author
can tell by what principle other mundane bodies are moved round,
of whose motion there is no doubt; I say, that that which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the Earth to move, is a vertue, like to that, by which <hi>Mars</hi>
and <hi>Jupiter</hi> are moved, and wherewith he believes that the starry
Sphere it self also doth move; and if he will but assure me, who is
the mover of one of these moveables, I will undertake to be able
to tell him who maketh the Earth to move. Nay more; I will
undertake to do the same, if he can but tell me, who moveth the

                        <p>But this motion beyond the centre, would it not be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and according to your assertion preternatural, and violent?
And yet on what other principle do you make it to depend, but
only upon the self same, which did carry the ball to the centre,
and which you called intrinsecal, and natural? Finde, if you can,
another external projicient, that overtaketh it again to drive it
upwards. And this that hath been said of the motion thorow
the centre,<note place="margin">The natural mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion changeth it selfe into that which is called pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent.</note> is also seen by us here above; for the interne <hi>impetus</hi>
of a grave body falling along a declining superficies, if the said
superficies be reflected the other way, it shall carry it, without a
jot interrupting the motion, also upwards. A ball of lead that
hangeth by a thread, being removed from its perpendicularity, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendeth
spontaneously, as being drawn by its internal inclination,
and without any interposure of rest, passeth beyond the lowest
point of perpendicularity: and without any additional mover,
moveth upwards. I know that you will not deny, but that the
principle of grave bodies that moveth them downwards, is no less
natural, and intrinsecal, than that principle of light bodies, vvhich
moveth them upwards: so that I propose to your consideration a
ball of lead, vvhich descending through the Air from a great al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
and so moving by an intern principle, and comming to a
depth of vvater, continueth its descent, and without any other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
mover, submergeth a great vvay; and yet the motion of
descent in the vvater is preternatural unto it; but yet nevertheless
dependeth on a principle that is internal, and not external to the
ball. You see it demonstrated then, that a moveable may be
moved by one and the same internal principle, with contrary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

though for the present I do not remember them; but however it
be, the Author continueth to demand, on what principle this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
motion of grave and light bodies dependeth; that is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on a principle internal, or external; and proceeding for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards,
sheweth, that it can be neither on the one, nor on the other,
saying; <hi>Si ab externo; Deusne illum excitat per continuum mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum?

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:96976:118"/>
none of those who ascribe that principle to the ambient air. As
to the Miracle, or an Angel, I should rather incline to this side; for
that which taketh beginning from a Divine Miracle, or from an
Angelical operation; as for instance, the transportation of a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
ball or bullet into the concave of the Moon, doth in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
depend on the vertue of the same principle for perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the rest. But, as to the Air, it serveth my turn, that it doth
not hinder the circular motion of the moveables, which we did
suppose to move thorow it. And to prove that, it sufficeth (nor is
more required) that it moveth with the same motion, and finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
its circulations with the same velocity, that the Terrestrial
Globe doth.</p>

no such thing; and this Author ascribes these things to him with
two excessive courtesie. It's true, he saith, and for my part I
think he saith well, that the part of the air neer to the Earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rather a terrestrial evaporation, may have the same nature,
and naturally follow its motion; or, as being contiguous to it,
may follow it in the same manner, as the Peripateticks say, that
the superiour part of it, and the Element of fire, follow the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Lunar Concave, so that it lyeth upon them to declare,
whether that motion be natural, or violent.</p>

the inferiour part of the Air to move, and supposeth the upper
part thereof to want the said motion, he cannot give a reason, how
that quiet air can be able to carry those grave bodies along with
it, and make them keep pace with the motion of the Earth.</p>

                        <p>Supposing for this time, that water and fire are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;

the most that could follow from thence would be, that those mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
cannot be common to them, that are contrary to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
so that <hi>v. g.</hi> the motion upwards, which naturally agreeth
to fire, cannot agree to water; but that, like as it is by nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to fire: so to it that motion suiteth, which is contrary to the
motion of fire, which shall be the motion <hi>deorsum;</hi> but the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
motion, which is not contrary either to the motion <hi>sursum,</hi>
or to the motion <hi>deorsum,</hi> but may mix with both, as <hi>Aristotle</hi>

soul: but those which belong to the body, in as much as it is ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary,
and consequently participateth of the qualities of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements,
why may not they be common as well to the dead corps,

which is in these words: <hi>Si secundum (nempè, si dicas tale princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium

Sed repugnant iterum tot diversae rerum naturae, quales

&amp;c. quae tamen omnia specie &amp; genere differentia, moverentur à
naturà suâ circulariter, ipsa naturis diversissima, &amp;c. [In English
thus]</hi> If the second, (that is, if you shall say that this principle is
a substance) it is either matter, or form, or a compound of both.
But such diverse natures of things are again repugnant, such as are
birds, snails, stones, darts, snows, smoaks, hails, fishes, &amp;c. all
which notwithstanding their differences in species and kind, are
moved of their own nature circularly, they being of their natures
most different, &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>If these things before named are of diverse natures, and
things of diverse natures cannot have a motion in common, it must
follow, if you would give satisfaction to all, that you are to think
of, more than two motions onely of upwards and downwards: and
if there must be one for the arrows, another for the snails, another
for the stones, and another for fishes; then are you to bethink your
self of worms, topazes and mushrums, which are not less different
in nature from one another, than snow and hail.</p>

upwards, can agree with all those things afore named, a circular
motion may no less agree with them: and as you are a <hi>Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi>
do not you put a greater difference between an elementary
comet and a celestial star, than between a fish and a bird? and

Author, that the Earth standing still by the will of God, the other
things, separated from it, would continue to turn round of their
own natural motion, and let us hear what impossibilities or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
would follow: for I, as to my own particular, do not
see how there can be greater disorders, than these produced by the
Author himself, that is, that Larks, though they should flie, could
not be able to hover over their nests, nor Crows over snails, or
rocks: from whence would follow, that Crows must suffer for
want of snails, and young Larks must die of hunger, and cold, not
being able to be fed or sheltered by the wings of the old ones.
This is all the ruine that I can conceive would follow, supposing
the Authors speech to be true. Do you see, <hi>Simplicius,</hi> if grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

disordered; though indeed it is better to say, that neither the
parts ordered or disordered ever move with a right motion, but
with one mixed, which might as well be averred meerly circular:
but to us but one part onely of this motion is visible and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,
that is, the part of the right, the other part of the circular
being imperceptible to us, because we partake thereof. And this
answers to the rays which move upwards, and round about, but we
cannot distinguish their circular motion, for that, with that we our
selves move also. But I believe that this Author never thought
of this mixture; for you may see that he resolutely saith, that the
rays go directly upwards, and not at all in gyration.</p>

circularly along with the vertigenous diurnal revolution is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely

[Which I translate to this sense:] If the whole Earth, together

fall from the clouds, but would be onely naturally carried round;
neither any fire or fiery thing would ascend, seeing to these that men
it is no improbable opinion that there is no fire above.</p>

(that I may get som pretty passages out of him) that if the
Earth and Water should be reduced to nothing, there would be no
more hails or rains, nor would igneal matters ascend any longer

what will the Philosopher say then?</p>

I never had the fortune to see the Terrestrial Globe and the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

what the hail and water did in that little Chaos. But he

                        <p>I would give any thing to change a word or two with
this person, to ask him, whether when this Globe vanished, it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away with it the common centre of gravity, as I believe it did;
in which case, I think that the hail and water would remain insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sate
and stupid amongst the clouds, without knowing what to do
with themselves. It might be also, that attracted by that great
void <hi>Vacuum,</hi> left by the Earths absenting, all the ambients would
be rarified, and particularly, the air, which is extreme easily drawn,
and would run thither with very great haste to fill it up. And
perhaps the more solid and material bodies, as birds, (for there
would in all probability be many of them scattered up and down
in the air) would retire more towards the centre of the great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
sphere; (for it seemeth very reasonable, that substances that
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:96976:122"/>

and there being dead of hunger, and resolved into Earth, would
form a new little Globe, with that little water, which at that time
was among the clouds. It might be also, that those matters as
not beholding the light, would not perceive the Earths departure,
but like blind things, would descend according to their usual custom
to the centre, whither they would now go, if that globe did not
hinder them. And lastly, that I may give this Philosopher a less
irresolute answer, I do tell him, that I know as much of what
would follow upon the annihilation of the Terrestrial Globe, as
he would have done that was to have followed in and about the
same, before it was created. And because I am certain he will
say, that he would never have been able to have known any of
all those things which experience alone hath made him knowing
in, he ought not to deny me pardon, and to excuse me if I know
not that which he knows, touching what would ensue upon the
annihilation of the said Globe: for that I want that experience
which he hath. Let us hear if he have any thing else to say.</p>

vvould press, and violently rest it self onely upon that air, in case
its hardness could not be overcome and broken by its gravity; but
loose stones, I believe, would descend to the centre, and not swim
above in the air: nor may it be said, that they move not to their
whole, though they move whither all the parts of the whole
would transfer themselves, if all impediments were removed.</p>

                        <p>He is the very same: but the confutation of the new
Stars is not in his <hi>Anti-Tycho,</hi> onely so far as he proveth, that they
were not prejudicial to the inalterability and ingenerability of the
Heavens, as I told you before; but after he had published his
<hi>Anti-Tycho,</hi> having found out, by help of the Parallaxes, a way to
demonstrate, that they also are things elementary, and contained
within the concave of the Moon, he hath writ this other Book,
<hi>de tribus novis Stellis, &amp;c.</hi> and therein also inserted the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
against <hi>Copernicus:</hi> I have already shewn you what he
hath written touching these new Stars in his <hi>Anti-Tycho,</hi> where he
denied not, but that they were in the Heavens; but he proved, that
their production altered not the inalterability of the Heavens, and
that he did, with a Discourse purely philosophical, in the same man<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner
as you have already heard. And I then forgot to tell you, how
that he afterwards did finde out a way to remove them out of the
Heavens; for he proceeding in this confutation, by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations
and parallaxes, matters little or nothing at all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by me, I did not mention them to you, but have bent all my
studies upon these arguments against the motion of the Earth,
which are purely natural.</p>

after we have heard what he hath to say against <hi>Copernicus,</hi> that
we hear, or see at least the manner wherewith he, by way of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallaxes,
proveth those new stars to be elementary, which so many
famous Astronomers constitute to be all very high, and amongst
the stars of the Firmament; and as this Author accomplisheth such

                        <p>And this happens because the motion, which the Ship
conferreth on the Sail-yard, it conferreth also upon you, and upon
your eye; so that you need not stir it a jot to behold the top of
the Sail-yard: and consequently, it vvill seem to you immovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
Now this Discourse being applied to the revolution of the
Earth, and to the stone placed in the top of the Tower, in which
you cannot discern any motion, because that you have that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
vvhich is necessary for the following of it, in common with it
from the Earth; so that you need not move your eye. When a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
there is conferred upon it the motion of descent, which is its
particular motion, and not yours, and that it is intermixed with the
circular, that part of the circular which is common to the stone,
and to the eye, continueth to be imperceptible, and the right one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is perceived, for that to the perception of it, you must follow it
with your eye, looking lower and lower. I wish for the undecei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

of reasonable depth full of water, and prepare a ball of wax, or
other matter that would descend very slowly to the bottome, so
that in a minute of an hour, it would scarce sink a yard; and that
rowing the boat as fast as could be, so that in a minute of an hour
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:96976:124"/>
it should run above an hundred yards, he would let the ball sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merge
into the water, &amp; freely descend, &amp; diligently observe its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
If he would but do thus, he should see, first, that it would go in a
direct line towards that point of the bottom of the vessel, whither it
would tend, if the boat should stand still; &amp; to his eye, and in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the vessel, that motion would appear most straight and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular,
and yet he could not say, but that it would be composed
of the right motion downwards, and of the circular about the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of water. And if these things befall in matters not natural,
and in things that we may experiment in their state of rest; &amp; then
again in the contrary state of motion, and yet as to appearance no
diversity at all is discovered, &amp; that they seem to deceive our sense
what can we distinguish touching the Earth, which hath been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
in the same constitution, as to motion and rest? And in
what time can we experiment whether any difference is discernable
amongst these accidents of local motion, in its diverse states of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                        <p>These Discourses have somewhat whetted my stomack,
which those fishes, and snails had in part nauseated; and the former
made me call to minde the correction of an errour, that hath so
much appearance of truth, that I know not whether one of a
thousand would refuse to admit it as unquestionable. And it was
this, that sailing into <hi>Syria,</hi> and carrying with me a very good
<hi>Telescope,</hi> that had been bestowed on me by our <hi>Common Friend,</hi>
who not many dayes before had invented, I proposed to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners,
that it would be of great benefit in Navigation to make use
of it upon the round top of a ship, to discover and kenne Vessels
afar off. The benefit was approved, but there was objected the
difficulty of using it,<note place="margin">An ingenuous consideration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the possibility of using the <hi>Teles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope</hi> with as much facility on the round top of the Mast of a ship, as on the Deck.</note> by reason of the Ships continual fluctuation;
and especially on the round top, where the agitation is so much
greater, and that it would be better for any one that would make
use thereof to stand at the Partners upon the upper Deck, where
the tossing is lesse than in any other place of the Ship. I (for I
will not conceal my errour) concurred in the same opinion, and
for that time said no more: nor can I tell you by what hints I was
moved to return to ruminate with my self upon this businesse, and
in the end came to discover my simplicity (although excusable) in
admitting that for true, which is most false; false I say, that the
great agitation of the basket or round top, in comparison of the
small one below, at the partners of the Mast, should render the
use of the <hi>Telescope</hi> more difficult in finding out the object.</p>

And because the proceeding by interrogatories doth in my opinion
much dilucidate things, besides the pleasure which it affords of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
our companion, forcing from him that which he thought he
knew not, I will make use of that artifice. And first, I suppose that the
Ship, Gally, or other Vessel, which we would discover, is a great way
off, that is, four, six, ten, or twenty<note n="*" place="margin">I deviate here from the strict Sea Diallect, which denominates all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances by Leagues.</note> miles, for that to kenne those
neer at hand there is no need of these Glasses: &amp; consequently, the
<hi>Telescope</hi> may at such a distance of four or six miles conveniently
discover the whole Vessel, &amp; a muchgreater bulk. Now I demand
what for species, &amp; how many for number are the motions that are
made upon the round top, depending on the fluctuation of the Ship.</p>

First,<note place="margin">Different moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons depending on the fluctuation of the Ship.</note> in a calme Sea, it would have no other motion than

that the spaces here and there being contained between parallel
rayes, the mutations made here and there, ought to be equal, and
because the space which the Instrument discovers yonder, is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of many of those Towers; therefore we shall not lose sight of it.</p>

                        <p>Returning now to the Ship, we may undoubtedly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that the <hi>Telescope</hi> moving to the right or left, upwards, or
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:96976:125"/>
downwards, and also forwards or backwards ten or fifteen fathom;
keeping it all the while parallel to its self, the visive ray cannot
stray from the point observed in the object, more than those fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
fathom; and because in a distance of eight or ten miles, the
Instrument takes in a much greater space than the Gally or other
Vessel kenn'd; therefore that small mutation shall not make me
lose sight of her. The impediment therefore, and the cause of
losing the object cannot befall us, unlesse upon the mutation made
angularly; since that <hi>Telescopes</hi> transportation higher or lower, to
the right, or to the left, by the agitation of the ship, cannot import
any great number of fathomes. Now suppose that you had two
<hi>Telescopes</hi> fixed, one at the Partners close by the Deck, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at the round top, nay at the main top, or main top-gallant
top, where you hang forth the <hi>Pennon</hi> or streamer, and that they
be both directed to the Vessel that is ten miles off, tell me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you believe that any agitation of the ship, &amp; inclination of the
Mast, can make greater changes, as to the angle, in the higher tube,
than in the lower? One wave arising, the prow will make the main
top give back fifteen or twenty fathom more than the foot of the
Mast, and it shall carry the upper tube along with it so greata space,
&amp; the lower it may be not a palm; but the angle shall change in one
Instrument aswell as in the other; and likewise a side-billow shall
bear the higher tube an hundred times as far to the Larboard or
Starboard, as it will the other below; but the angles change not at
all, or else alter both alike. But the mutation to the right hand or
left, forwards or backwards, upwards or downwards, bringeth no
sensible impediment in the kenning of objects remote, though the
alteration of the angle maketh great change therein; Therefore it
must of necessity be confessed, that the use of the <hi>Telescope</hi> on the
round top is no more difficult than upon the Deck at the Partners;
seeing that the angular mutations are alike in both places.</p>

this principle whereby we turn round with the Earth, either is
intrinsick to us, or external; that is, a rapture of that Earth; and
if it be this second, we not feeling any such rapture, it must be
confessed that the sense of feeling, doth not feel its own object

                        <p>So that the instance of this Philosopher lays its stress up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this, that whether the principle by which we move round with
the Earth be either extern, or intern, yet however we must per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it, and not perceiving it, it is neither the one nor the other,
and therefore we move not, nor consequently the Earth. Now I
say,<note place="margin">Our motion may be either <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                                 <desc>〈…〉</desc>

                              </gap>, and yet we never perceive or feel it.</note> that it may be both ways, and yet we not perceive the same.
And that it may be external, the experiment of the boat supera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
satisfieth me; I say, superabundantly, because it being
in our power at all times to make it move, and also to make it
stand still, and with great exactness to make observation, whether
by some diversity that may be comprehended by the sense of feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
we can come to know whether it moveth or no, seeing that
as yet no such science is obtained: Will it then be any matter of
wonder, if the same accident is unknown to us on the Earth, the
which may have carried us about perpetually, and we, without our
being ever able to experiment its rest?<note place="margin">The motion of a Boat insensible to those that are with in it, as to the sense of feeling.</note> You, <hi>Simplicius,</hi> as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
have gone by boat many times to <hi>Padoua,</hi> and if you will
confess the truth, you never felt in your self the participation of
that motion, unless when the boat running a-ground, or encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
some obstacle, did stop, and that you with the other Passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
being taken on a sudden, were with danger over-set. It
would be necessary that the Terrestrial Globe should meet with
some rub that might arrest it, for I assure you, that then you
would discern the impulse residing in you, when it should toss you
up towards the Stars. It's true, that by the other senses, but yet
assisted by Reason,<note place="margin">The boats moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is perceptible to the sight joyn'd with reason.</note> you may perceive the motion of the boat, that
is, with the sight, in that you see the trees and buildings placed on

contrary way.<note place="margin">The terrestrial motion collected from the stars.</note> But if you would by such an experiment receive
intire satisfaction in this business of the Terrestrial motion, look
on the stars, which upon this reason seem to move the contrary

supposing it to be internal, is a less reasonable conceit; for
if we do not feel such a one, that cometh to us from without,
and that frequently goeth away, with what reason can we expect
to feel it, if it immutably and continually resides in us? Now let
us see what you have farther to allege on this argument.</p>

which may easily deceive us. And I would not have this Author
trouble himself in attempting to make us comprehend by sense,

no other kind; nor let him exclaim that a thing so clear, manifest,
and obvious should be brought in question; for in so doing, he
maketh others believe, that he thinketh those that deny that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of the fallacy of the meer senses;<note place="margin">Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Earths motion taken, <hi>ex rerum natura.</hi>
                           </note> therefore suspending such
sensations for the present, let us hear the Arguments that follow
which are taken, as he saith, <hi>ex rerum natura.</hi> The first of which
is, that the Earth cannot of its own nature move with three moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
very different; or otherwise we must deny many manifest
Axioms.<note place="margin">Three Axioms that are supposed manifest.</note> The first whereof is, that <hi>Omnis effectus dependeat ab
aliquâ causà; [i. e.]</hi> that every effect dependeth on some cause.
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:96976:127"/>
The second, that <hi>Nulla res seipsam producat; [i. e.]</hi> that nothing
produceth it self: from whence it follows, that it is not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that the move and moved should be totally the same thing:
And this is manifest, not onely in things that are moved by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick
mover; but it is gathered also from the principles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
that the same holdeth true in the natural motion depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
on an intrinsick principle; otherwise, being that the mover,
as a mover, is the cause, and the thing moved, as moved, is the
effect, the same thing would totally be both the cause and effect.
Therefore a body doth not move its whole self, that is, so as
that all moveth, and all is moved; but its necessary in the thing
moved to distinguish in some manner the efficient principle of the
motion, and that which with that motion is moved. The third
Axiom is, that <hi>in rebus quae sensui subjiciuntur, unum, quatenus
unum, unam solam rem producat; i. e.</hi> That in things subject to
the senses, one, as it is one, produceth but onely one thing: That
is, the soul in animals produceth its true divers operations, as the
sight, the hearing, the smell, generation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but all these with
several instruments. And in short, in things sensible, the diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of operations, is observed to derive it self from the diversity
that is in the cause.<note place="margin">A simple body at the Earth, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not move with three several moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> Now if we put all these Axioms together, it
will be a thing very manifest, that one simple body, as is the
Earth, cannot of its own nature move at the same time with
three motions, very divers: For by the foregoing suppositions,
all moveth not its self all; it is necessary therefore to distinguish
in it three principles of its three motions; otherwise one and the
same principle would produce many motions; but if it contein in
it three principles of natural motions, besides the part moved, it
shall not be a simple body, but compounded of three principle
movers,<note place="margin">The Earth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not move with any of the motions assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned it by <hi>Coperni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus.</hi>
                           </note> and of the part moved. If therefore the Earth be a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
body, it shall not move with three motions; nay more, it will
not move with any of those which <hi>Copernicus</hi> ascribeth to it, it
being to move but with one alone, for that it is manifest, by the
reasons of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that it moveth to its centre, as its parts do
shew, which descend at right angles to the Earths Spherical
Surface.</p>

furnished me with an answer, when he saith that from one sole prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in animals, there are produced divers operations; so that for

makes the objection, yea, it is totally overthrown by that which
immediately after he addeth for a greater confirmation of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as you shall hear. He re-inforceth his argument, I say, with
another Axiome,<note place="margin">A fourth Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iome against the motion of the Earth</note> which is this; That <hi>natura in rebus necessariis
nec deficiat, nec abundat: i. e.</hi> That nature in things necessary is

they are to move with many motions, Nature hath made many
flexures, and hath thereunto commodiously knitted the parts for
motion, as to the knees, to the hips, for the inabling of living
creatures to go, and run at their pleasure. Moreover in man he
hath framed many flexions, and joynts, in the elbow, and hand, to
enable them to perform many motions.<note place="margin">Another argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against the threefold motion of the Earth.</note> From these things the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument

the Body, that is one, and continuate, without any manner of

can without them, then in vain hath nature framed the flexures in

them, then the Earth, one body, and continuate, and deprived of

                        <p>I verily believe that this would be the answer of the
Philosopher. Against which I make opposition another way; and
ask you, whether you think that by way of joynts and flexures one
may adapt the terrestrial Globe to the participation of three diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
circular motions? Do you not answer me? Seeing you are
speechlesse, I will undertake to answer for the Philosopher, who
would absolutely reply that they might; for that otherwise it
would have been superfluous, and besides the purpose to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to consideration, that nature maketh the flexions, to the
end, the moveable may move with different motions; and that
therefore the terrestrial Globe having no flexures, it cannot have
those three motions which are ascribed to it. For if he had
thought, that neither by help of flexures, it could be rendered apt
for such motions, he would have freely affirmed, that the Globe
could not move with three motions. Now granting this, I intreat
you,<note place="margin">It is desired to know, by means of what flexures and joynts the <hi>Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial Globe</hi> might move with three diverse motions.</note> and by you, if it were possible, that Philosopher, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the Argument, to be so courteous as to teach me in what
manner those flexures should be accommodated, so that those
three motions might commodiously be excercised; and I grant you
four or six moneths time to think of an answer. As to me, it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that one principle onely may cause a plurality of motions in
the Terrestrial Globe,<note place="margin">One only princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may cause a plurality of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Earth.</note> just in the same manner that, as I told you
before, one onely principle with the help of various instruments
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:96976:129"/>
produceth sundry and divers motions in living creatures. And as
to the flexures there is no need of them, the motions being of the
whole, and not of some particular parts; and because they are
to be circular, the meer spherical figure is the most perfect articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
or flection that can be desired.</p>

                        <p>The most that ought to be granted upon this, would be,
that it may hold true in one single motion, but in three different
motions, in my opinion, and that of the Author, it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
as he going on, prosecuting the objection, writes in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
words. <hi>Let us suppose, with</hi> Copernicus, <hi>that the Earth
moveth of its own faculty, and upon an intrinsick principle from
West to East in the plane of the Ecliptick; and again, that it also
by an intrinsick principle revolveth about its centre, from East to
West; and for a third motion, that it of its own inclination defle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
from North to South, and so back again.</hi> It being a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
body, and not knit together with joints and flections, our
fancy and our judgment will never be able to comprehend, that
one and the same natural and indistinct principle, that is, that
one and the same propension, should actuate it at the same instant
with different, and as it were of contrary motions. I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that any one would say such a thing, unlesse he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
to maintain this position right or wrong.</p>

to the Stars, it would be necessary to confesse, that the Horizon,

the Earth would reoolve in it self a contrary way to that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the Stars seem to move, that is from West to East, which
is according to the order of the Signes of the Zodiack. As, in the

to make the Sun seem unto us to move about the said Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack,

the Earth move according to the same order, to the end that the

                        <p>The forme of the argument appeareth good; but yet
I believe that the application or matter is defective: and if the
Authour will but persist in his assumption, the consequence shall
make directly against him. The Argument runs thus; Amongst
mundane bodies,<note place="margin">From the Earths obscurity, and the splendour of the Sun, and fixed Stars, is argued, that it is movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable.</note> six there are that do perpetually move, and they
are the six Planets; of the rest, that is, of the Earth, Sun, and
fixed Stars, it is disputable which of them moveth, and which
stands still, it being necessary, that if the Earth stand still, the Sun
and fixed Stars do move; and it being also possible, that the Sun
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:96976:131"/>
and fixed Stars may stand immoveable, in case the Earth should
move: the matter of fact in dispute is, to which of them we may
with most convenience ascribe motion, and to which rest. Natural
reason dictates, that motion ought to be assigned to the bodies,
which in kind and essence most agree with those bodies which do
undoubtedly move, and rest to those which most dissent from them;
and in regard that an eternal rest and perpetual motion are most
different, it is manifest, that the nature of the body always move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ought to be most different from the body alwayes stable.
Therefore, in regard that we are dubious of motion and rest,
let us enquire, whether by the help of some other eminent affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we may discover, which most agreeth with the bodies certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
moveable, either the Earth, or the Sun and fixed Stars. But see
how Nature, in favour of our necessity and desire, presents us
with two eminent qualities, and no less different than motion and
rest, and they are light and darkness, to wit, the being by nature
most bright, and the being obscure, and wholly deprived of light:
the bodies therefore adorned with an internal and eternal splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
are most different in essence from those deprived of light:
The Earth is deprived of light, the Sun is most splendid in it self,
and so are the fixed Stars. The six Planets do absolutely
want light, as the Earth; therefore their essence agreeth with
the Earth, and differeth from the Sun and fixed Stars. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is the Earth moveable, immoveable the Sunne and Starry
Sphere.</p>

tenebrose, and by that negative will he abide. Or he will argue
the great conformity of nature between the six Planets, and the
Sun, and Fixed Stars; and the disparity between them and the
Earth from other conditions than from tenebrosity and light; yea,

                        <p>There is the sixth and last argument;<note place="margin">A sixth argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernicus,</hi> taken from animals, who have need of rest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be natural.</note> wherein he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
it a very improbale thing. <hi>[That a corruptible and dissipable
body should move with a perpetual and regular motion; and this
be confirmeth with the example of living creatures, which moving
with a motion natural to them, yet grow weary, and have need of
repose to restore their strength.]</hi> But what hath this motion to do
with that of the Earth, that in comparision to theirs is immense?
Besides, to make it move with three motions that run and draw
several wayes: Who would ever assert such Paradoxes, unlesse
he had sworn to be their defender? Nor doth that avail in this
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:96976:132"/>
case, which <hi>Copernicus</hi> alledgeth, that by reason this motion is
natural to the Earth and not violent, it worketh contrary effects
to violent motions; and that those things dissolve and cannot
long subsist, to which impulse is conferred, but those so made
by nature do continue in their perfect disposure; this answer suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth
not, I say, for it is overthrown by that of ours. For the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
is a natural body, and not made by art, and its motion is
natural, deriving it self from the soul, that is, from an intrinsick
principle; and that motion is violent, whose beginning is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
and on which the thing moved conferreth nothing; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
if the animal continueth its motion any long time, it grows
weary, and also dyeth, if it obstinately strive to persist therein.
You see then that in nature we meet on all sides with notions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the <hi>Copernican Hypothesis,</hi> and none in favour of it. And
for that I have nothing more wherein to take the part of this Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent,
hear what he produceth against <hi>Keplerus</hi> (with whom
he disputeth) upon that argument, which the said <hi>Kepler</hi> bringeth
against those who think it an inconvenient, nay impossible thing,
to augment the Starry Sphere immensely, as the <hi>Copernican</hi> Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis

                           </note> wondering how much
<hi>Kepler</hi> deceived himself, in saying, that in the Ptolomaick Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis
the motion encreaseth beyond the model of the subject, for in
his judgment it doth not encrease, save onely in conformity to the
model, and that according to its encreasement, the velocity of
the motion is augmented.<note place="margin">The velocity of the circular moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on increaseth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of the circle.</note> Which he proveth by supposing a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine
to be framed, that maketh one revolution in twenty four
hours, which motion shall be called most slow; afterwards sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
its semidiameter to be prolonged, as far as to the distance
of the Sun, its extreme will equal the velocity of the Sun; and
it being continued out unto the Starry Sphere, it will equal the
velocity of the fixed Stars, though in the circumference of the
machine it be very slow. Now applying this consideration of the
machine to the Starry Sphere, let us imagine any point in its se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midiameter,
as neer to the centre as is the semidiameter of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine;
the same motion that in the Starry Sphere is exceeding

swift, shall in that point be exceeding slow; But the great mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude
of the body is that which maketh it of exceeding slow, to
become exceeding swift, although it continueth still the same, and
thus the velocity encreaseth, not beyond the model of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,

he did not understand, that the highest term of a line drawn from

it is lesse inconvenient to encrease an immoveable body to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
magnitude, than to ascribe an extraordinary velocity
to a body, though very bigge, having regard to the model,
that is to the gauge, and to the example of other natural bodies;
in which we see, that the distance from the centre encreasing, the
velocity diminisheth; that is, that the periods of their circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
take up longer times.<note place="margin">The greatnesse and smalnesse of the body make a differeuce in moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and not in rest.</note> But in rest which is not capable of aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
or diminution, the grandure or smalnesse of the body
maketh no difference. So that if the answer of the Author would
be directed against the argument of <hi>Kepler,</hi> it is necessary, that
that Author doth hold, that to the movent principle its one and the
same to move in the same time a body very small, or very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense,
in regard that the augmentation of velocity inseparably
attends the augmentation of the masse.<note place="margin">The order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is to make the lesser Orbs to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate in shorter times, and the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in longer times.</note> But this again is contrary
to the Architectonical rule of nature, which doth in the lesser
Spheres, as we see in the Planets, and most sensibly in the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean
Stars, observe to make the lesser Orbs to circulate in shorter
times: Whence the time of <hi>Saturns</hi> revolution is longer than all
the times of the other lesser Spheres, it being thirty years; now
the passing from this to a Sphere very much bigger, and to make
it move in 24. hours, may very well be said to exceed the rules of
the model. So that if we would but attentively consider it, the
Authors answer opposeth not the intent and sense of the argument,
but the expressing and manner of delivering of it; where again
the Author is injurious, and cannot deny but that he artificially
dissembled his understanding of the words, that he might charge
<hi>Kepler</hi> with grosse ignorance; but the imposture was so very dull
and obvions, that he could not with all his craft alter the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which <hi>Kepler</hi> hath begot of his Doctrine in the minds of all
the Learned. As in the next place, to the instance against the

besides the business, as you perhaps make it; for a motion
that serveth instead of rest, and removeth weariness from a body
tired with travail, may much more easily serve to prevent the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of that weariness,<note place="margin">Animals would not grow weary of their motion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding as that which is assigned to the terrestrial Globe.</note> like as preventive remedies are more easie
than curative. And I hold for certain, that if the motion of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
should proceed in the same manner as this that is ascribed to
the Earth, they would never grow weary; Seeing that the weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the living creature, deriveth it self, in my opinion, from
the imployment of but one part alone in the moving of its self,<note place="margin">The cause of the wearinesse of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.</note>
and all the rest of the body; as <hi>v. g.</hi> in walking, the thighs and
the legs onely are imployed for carrying themselves and all the
rest: on the contrary, you see the motion of the heart to be as it
were indefatigable, because it moveth it self alone. Besides, I
know not how true it may be,<note place="margin">The motion of an animal is rather to be called violent than natural.</note> that the motion of the animal is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
and not rather violent: nay, I believe that one may truly
say, that the soul naturally moveth the members of an animal with
a motion preternatural, for if the motion upwards is preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
to grave bodies, the lifting up of the legs, and the thighs,
which are grave bodies, in walking, cannot be done without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and therefore not without labour to the mover. The
climbing upwards by a ladder carrieth the grave body contrary to
its natural inclination upwards, from whence followeth weariness,
by reason of the bodies natural aversness to that motion: but in

things that favour the opinion of <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

neverthelesse I will adde somewhat, which then ran in my minde.
He proposeth it as a thing very unlikely, that a body dissipable
and corruptible, as the Earth, should perpetually move with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
motion, especially for that we see living creatures in the end
to grow weary, and to stand in need of rest: and the improbability
is increased, in that the said motion is required to be of velocity
incomparable and immense, in respect to that of animals. Now, I
cannot see why the velocity of the Earth should, at present, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
it; so long as that of the starry Sphere so very much bigger
doth not occasion in it any disturbance more considerable, than that
which the velocity of a machine, that in 24 hours maketh but one
sole revolution, produceth in the same. If the being of the velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of the Earths conversion, according to the model of that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine,
inferreth things of no greater moment than that, let the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
cease to fear the Earths growing weary; for that not one of
the most feeble and slow-pac't animals, no not a Chamaeleon would

that this day have falne under our debate, have appeared to me
fraught with very acute and ingenious notions, alledged on <hi>Coper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi>
his side, in confirmation of the motion of the Earth, but yet
I find not my self perswaded to believe it; for in short, the things
that have been said conclude no more but this, that the reasons
for the stability of the Earth are not necessary; but all the while
no demonstration hath been produced on the other side, that doth
necessarily convince and prove its mobility.</p>

                        <p>I never undertook, <hi>Simplicius,</hi> to remove you from that
your opinion; much less dare I presume to determine definitively
in this controversie: it onely was, and still shall be in the ensuing
disputations my intent, to make it appear to you, that those who
have thought that most swift motion of 24 hours doth belong to
the Earth alone, and not to the Universe, the Earth onely exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
were not induced to believe, that so it might and ought to do
out of any blind perswasion; but that they did very well see, try,
and examine the reasons on the contrary side, and also not slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
answer them. With the same intention, if it stand with your
liking, and that of <hi>Sagredus,</hi> we may passe to the consideration of
that other motion; first, by <hi>Aristarchus Samius,</hi> and afterwards
by <hi>Nicholaus Copernicus</hi> ascribed to the said Terrestrial Globe,
which is, as, I believe, you have heretofore heard, made under the
Zodiack within the space of a year about the Sun, immoveably

credit and applause with them: but on the contrary, those which
are brought against their opinion, though ingenuous and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,

to make them speak in favour of their pre-assumed and pertinaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

with these men; and the rather, for that their conversation is not
only unpleasant, but also dangerous. Yet let us continue our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference

where I was stranded, and forced to stay there more than a full

the tide from ebbing to become young flood, without standing

                        <p>But how could you in so short a time examine all this
Book, which is so great a Volume, and must needs contain very

                        <p>I have confined my self to these his first confutations, in
which with twelve demonstrations founded upon the observations
of twelve <hi>Astronomers,</hi> (who all held, that the Star, <hi>Anno</hi> 1572.
which appeared in <hi>Cassiopeia,</hi> was in the Firmament) he proveth it
on the contrary, to be beneath the Moon, conferring, two by two,
the meridian altitudes, proceeding in the method that you shall
understand by and by. And because, I think, that in the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of this his first progression, I have discovered in this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
a great unlikelihood of his ability to conclude any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Astronomers,</hi> in favour of the <hi>Peripatetick Philosophers,</hi>
and that their opinion is more and more concludently confirmed,
I could not apply my self with the like patience in examining his
other methods, but have given a very slight glance upon them,
and am certain, that the defect that is in these first impugnations,
is likewise in the rest. And as you shall see, by experience, very
few words will suffice to confute this whole Book, though compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with so great a number of laborious calculations,<note place="margin">The method ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by <hi>Clar.</hi> in confuting the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomers, and by <hi>Salviatus</hi> in confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him.</note> as here you
see. Therefore observe my proceedings. This Authour under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh,
as I say, to wound his adversaries with their own weapons,
<hi>i. e.</hi> a great number of observations made by themselves, to wit, by
twelve or thirteen Authours in number, and upon part of them he
makes his supputations, and concludeth those stars to have been
below the Moon. Now because the proceeding by interrogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
very much pleaseth me, in regard the Authour himself is not
here, let <hi>Simplicius</hi> answer me to the questions that I shall ask
him, as he thinks he himself would, if he were present. And pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposing
that we speak of the foresaid Star, of <hi>Anno</hi> 1572. ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:96976:139"/>
in <hi>Cassiopeia,</hi> tell me, <hi>Simplicius,</hi> whether you believe that
it might be in the same time placed in divers places, that is, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Elements, aud also amongst the planetary Orbs, and
also above these amongst the fixed Stars, and yet again infinitely
more high.</p>

                        <p>There is no doubt, but that it ought to be confessed

                        <p>Therefore if the observations made by the Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
were exact, and the calculations made by this Author were
not erroneous, it were easie from all those and all these to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect
the same distances alwayes to an hair, is not this true?</p>

                        <p>But when of many and many computations that have
been made, there should not be so much as two onely that prove
true, what would you think of them?</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SIMP.</speaker>
                        <p>I would think that they were all false, either through
the fault of the computist, or through the defect of the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators,
and at the most that could be said, I would say, that but
onely one of them and no more was true; but as yet I know not
which to choose.</p>

                        <p>Would you then from false fundamentals deduce and
establish a doubtful conclusion for true? Certainly no. Now the
calculations of this Author are such, that no one of them agrees
with another, you may see then what credit is to be given to
them.</p>

                        <p>But by the way I have a mind to help <hi>Simplicius,</hi> and
the Author by telling <hi>Salviatus,</hi> that his arguments would hold
good if the Author had undertook to go about to find out exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the distance of the Star from the Earth, which I do not think
to be his intention; but onely to demonstrate that from those
observations he collected that the Star was sublunary. So
that if from those observations, and from all the computations
made thereon, the height of the Star be alwayes collected to be
lesse than that of the Moon, it serves the Authors turn to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
all those Astronomers of most impardonable ignorance,
that through the defect either of Geometry or Arithmetick, have
not known how to draw true conclusions from their own observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
themselves.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>It will be convenient therefore that I turn my self to
you, <hi>Sagredus,</hi> who so cunningly aphold the Doctrine of this
Author. And to see whether I can make <hi>Simplicius,</hi> though not
very expert in calculations, and demonstrations to apprehend the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:96976:139"/>
inconclusivenesse at least of the demonstrations of this Author,
first proposed to consideration, and how both he, and all the
Astronomers with whom he contendeth, do agree that the new
Star had not any motion of its own, and onely went round with
the diurnal motion of the <hi>primum mobile;</hi> but dissent about the
placing of it, the one party putting it in the Celestial Region,
that is above the Moon, and haply above the fixed Stars, and
the other judging it to be neer to the Earth, that is, under the
concave of the Lunar Orb. And because the situation of the new
star, of which we speak, was towards the North, and at no very
great distance from the Pole, so that to us <hi>Septentrionals,</hi> it did
never set, it was an easie matter with Astronomical instruments
to have taken its several meridian altitudes, as well its smallest
under the Pole, as its greatest above the same; from the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of which altitudes, made in several places of the Earth,
situate at different distances from the North, that is, different
from one another in relation to polar altitudes, the stars distance
might be inferred:<note place="margin">The greatest and least elevations of the new star differ not from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more than the polar altitudes, the said star being in the Firmnment.</note> For if it was in the Firmament amongst the
other fixed stars, its meridian altitudes taken in divers elevations
of the pole, ought necessarily to differ from each other with the
same variations that are found amongst those elevations them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
that is, for example, if the elevation of the star above
the horizon was 30 degrees, taken in the place where the polar
altitude was <hi>v. gr.</hi> 45 degrees, the elevation of the same star
ought to have been encreased 4 or 5 degrees in those more Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thernly
places where the pole was higher by the said 4 or 5 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.
But if the stars distance from the Earth was but very little,
in comparison of that of the Firmament; its meridian altitudes
ought approaching to the North to encrease considerably more
than the polar altitudes; and by that greater encrease, that is,
by the excesse of the encrease of the stars elevation, above the
encrease of the polar elevation (which is called the difference of
Parallaxes) is readily calculated with a cleer and sure method,
the stars distance from the centre of the Earth. Now this Author
taketh the observations made by thirteen Astronomers in sundry
elevations of the pole, and conferring a part of them at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
he computeth by twelve collations the new stars height to
have been alwayes beneath the Moon; but this he adventures to
do in hopes to find so grosse ignorance in all those, into whose
hands his book might come, that to speak the truth, it hath turn'd
my stomack; and I wait to see how those other Astronomers, and
particularly <hi>Kepler,</hi> against whom this Author principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigheth,
can contein themselves in silence, for he doth not use
to hold his tongue on such occasions; unlesse he did possibly
think the enterprize too much below him. Now to give you to
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:96976:140"/>
understand the same, I have upon this paper transcribed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
that he inferreth from his twelve indagations; the first of
which is upon the two observations:

                        <p>These are twelve indagations made by the Author at his electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
amongst many which, as he saith, might be made by combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the observations of these thirteen observators. The which
twelve we may believe to be the most favourable to prove his
intention.</p>

                        <p>I would know whether amongst the so many other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagations
pretermitted by the Author, there were not some that
made against him, that is, from which calculating one might find
the new star to have been above the Moon, as at the very first
sight I think we may reasonably question; in regard I see these
already produced to be so different from one another, that some
of them give me the distance of the said star from the Earth, 4, 6,
10, 100, a thousand, and an hundred thousand times bigger one
than another; so that I may well suspect that amongst those that
he did not calculate, there was some one in fauour of the adverse
party. And I guesse this to be the more probable, for that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
conceive that those Astronomers the observators could want
the knowledg and practice of rhese computations, which I think
do not depend upon the abstrucest things in the World. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it will seem to me a thing more than miraculous, if whilst in
these twelve investigations onely, there are some that make the
star to be distant from the Earth but a few miles, and others that
make it to be but a very fmall matter below the Moon, there are
none to be found that in favour of the contrary part do make it
so much as twenty yards above the Lunar Orb. And that which
shall be yet again more extravagant, that all those Astronomers
should have been so blind as not to have discovered that their so
apparent mistake.</p>

a little too much, whilst that with a superfluous circumlocution

go towards the North, would seem to rise higher and higher a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Horizon, as much as the Pole, although it should have
been scituate amongst the fixed stars; but, that in case it were
considerably lower, that is nearer to the Earth, it would appear
to ascend more than the said pole, and still more by how much
its vicinity was greater?</p>

marke the pole P; and in these two lower circles I will note two
stars beheld from one place on the Earth, which let be A; and
let the two stars be these B and C, beheld in the same line ABC,

walking along the Earth, till I come to the term E, the two
stars will appear to me separated from the fixed star D, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
neerer to the pole P, and the lower star B more, which
will appear to me in G, and the star C lesse, which will ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pear
to me in F, but the fixed star D will have kept the same
distance from the Pole.</p>

the space AE, paced on the Earth, being very small in

                        <p>Now you know <hi>Simplicius</hi> that Astronomers and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians
have found infallible rules by way of Geometry and
Arithmetick, to be able by help of the quantity of these angles
B and C, and of their differences, with the additional knowledg
of the distance of the two places A and E, to find to a foot the
remotenesse of sublime bodies; provided alwayes that the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
distance, and angles be exactly taken.</p>

                        <speaker>SIMP.</speaker>
                        <p>So that if the Rules dependent on <hi>Geometry</hi> and <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy</hi>
be true, all the fallacies and errours that might be met with
in attempting to investigate those altitudes of new Stars or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets,
or other things must of necessity depend on the distance AE,
and on the angles B and C, not well measured. And thus all those
differences which are found in these twelve workings depend, not
on the defects of the rules of the Calculations, but on the errours
committed in finding out those angles, and those distances, by means
of the Instrumental Observations.</p>

                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>True; and of this there is no doubt to be made. Now
it is necessary that you observe intensely, how in removing the Star
from B to C, whereupon the angle alwayes grows more acute, the
ray EBG goeth farther and farther off from the ray ABD in
the part beneath the angle, as you may see in the line ECF,
whose inferiour part EC is more remote from the part AC, than
is the part EB, but it can never happen, that by any whatsoever
immense recession, the lines AD and EF should totally sever from
each other, they being finally to go and conjoyn in the Star: and
onely this may be said, that they would separate, and reduce them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to parallels, if so be the recession should be infinite, which
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:96976:142"/>
case is not to be supposed. But because (observe well) the distance
of the Firmament, in relation to the smallnesse of the Earth, as
hath been said, is to be accounted, as if it were infinite; therefore
the angle conteined betwixt the two rayes, that being drawn from
the points A and E, go to determine in a fixed Star, is esteemed
nothing, and those rayes held to be two parallel lines; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is concluded, that then only may the New Star be affirmed
to have been in the Firmament, when from the collating of the
Observations made in divers places, the said angle is, by calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
gathered to be insensible, and the lines, as it were, parallels.
But if the angle be of a considerable quantity, the New Star must
of necessity be lower than those fixed; and also than the Moon, in
case the angle ABE should be greater than that which would be
made in the Moons centre.</p>

                        <p>But if this be so, it's possible that the said angle may

                        <p>This may very well be, yea, and is in the present case,
as you shall see in due place; that is, when I shall have made plain
the way, in such manner that you also, though not very perfect in
<hi>Astronomical</hi> calculations, may clearly see, and, as it were, with
your hands feel how that this Author had it more in his eye to
write in complacency of the <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> by palliating and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
sundry things, than to establish the truth, by producing
them with naked sincerity: therefore let us proceed forwards. By
the things hitherto spoken, I suppose that you comprehend very
well how that the distance of the new Star can never be
made so immense, that the angle so often named shall wholly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear,
and that the two rayes of the Observators at the places
A and E, shall become altogether parallels: and you may conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
comprehend to the full, that if the calculations should
collect from the observations, that that angle was totally null, or
that the lines were truly parallels, we should be certain that the
observations were at least in some small particular erroneous:
But, if the calculations should give us the said lines to be separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
not only to equidistance, that is, so as to be parallel, but to
have past beyond that terme, and to be dilated more above than
below, then must it be resolutely concluded, that the observations
were made with lesse accuratenesse, and in a word, to be errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
as leading us to a manifest impossibility. In the next place,
you must believe me, and suppose it for true, that two right lines
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:96976:142"/>
which depart from two points marked upon another right line, are
then wider above than below, when the angles included between
them upon that right line are greater than two right angles; and
if these angles should be equal to two right angles, the lines would
be parallels; but if they were less than two right angles, the lines
would be concurrent, and being continued out would undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intersect the triangle.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SIMP.</speaker>
                        <p>Without taking it upon trust from you, I know the
same; and am not so very naked of <hi>Geometry,</hi> as not to know a
Proposition, which I have had occasion of reading very often in
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> that is, that the three angles of all triangles are equall to
two right angles: so that if I take in my Figure the triangle ABE,
it being supposed that the line EA is right; I very well conceive,
that its three angles A, E, B, are equal to two right angles; and
that consequently the two angles E and A are lesse than two right
angles, so much as is the angle B. Whereupon widening the lines
AB and EB (still keeping them from moving out of the points A
and E) untill that the angle conteined by them towards the parts
B, disappear, the two angles beneath shall be equal to two right
angles, and those lines shall be reduced to parallels: and if one
should proceed to enlarge them yet more, the angles at the points
E and A would become greater than two right angles.</p>

                        <p>You are an <hi>Archimedes,</hi> and have freed me from the
expence of more words in declaring to you, that whensoever the
calculations make the two angles A and E to be greater than two
right angles, the observations without more adoe will prove erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous.
This is that which I had a desire that you should perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understand, and which I doubted that I was not able so to make
out, as that a meer <hi>Peripatetick</hi> Philosopher might attain to the
certain knowledg thereof. Now let us go on to what remains.
And re-assuming that which even now you granted me, namely,
that the new star could not possibly be in many places, but in one
alone, when ever the supputations made upon the observations of
these Astronomers do not assign it the same place, its necessary
that it be an errour in the observations, that is, either in taking the
altitudes of the pole, or in taking the elevations of the star, or in
the one or other working. Now for that in the many workings
made with the combinations two by two, there are very few of
the observations that do agree to place the star in the same situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
therefore these few onely may happily be the non-errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
but the others are all absolutely false.</p>

                        <speaker>SAGR.</speaker>
                        <p>It will be necessary then to give more credit to these
few alone, than to all the rest together, and because you say,
that these which accord are very few, and I amongst these 12,
do find two that so accord, which both make the distance of the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:96976:143"/>
star from the centre of the Earth 4 semidiameters, which are these,
the fifth and sixth, therefore it is more probable that the new star
was elementary, than celestial.</p>

                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>You mistake the point; for if you note well it was not
written, that the distance was exactly 4 semidiameters, but about
4 semidiameters; and yet you shall see that those two distances
differed from each other many hundreds of miles. Here they are;
you see that this fifth, which is 13389 <hi>Italian</hi> miles, exceeds the
sixth, which is 13100 miles, by almost 300 miles.</p>

                        <p>Which then are those few that agree in placing the star
in the same situation?</p>

                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>They are, to the disgrace of this Author five workings,
which all place it in the firmament, as you shall see in this note,
where I have set down many other combinations. But I will grant
the Author more than peradventure he would demand of me, which
is in sum, that in each combination of the observations there is
some error; which I believe to be absolutely necessary; for the
observations being four in number that serve for one working,
that is, two different altitudes of the Pole, and two different eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the star, made by different obfervers, in different pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<note place="margin">Astronomical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments are very subject to errour.</note> with different instruments, who ever hath any small know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of this art, will say, that amongst all the four, it is impossible
but there will be some error; and especially since we see that in
taking but one onely altitude of the Pole, with the same instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in the same place, by the same observer, that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
the observation a thousand times, there will still be a titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of one, or sometimes of many minutes, as in this same
book you may see in several places. These things presupposed,
I ask you <hi>Simplicius</hi> whether you believe that this Authour held
these thirteen observators for wise, understanding and expert men
in using those instruments, or else for inexpert, and bunglers?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SIMP.</speaker>
                        <p>It must needs be that he esteemed them very acute and
intelligent; for if he had thought them unskilful in the businesse,
he might have omitted his sixth book as inconclusive, as being
founded upon suppositions very erroneous; and might take us for
excessively simple, if he should think he could with their inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertnesse
perswade us to believe a false position of his for truth.</p>

                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>Therefore these observators being such, and that yet
notwithstanding they did erre, and so consequently needed cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
that so one might from their observations infer the
best hints that may be; it is convenient that we apply unto them
the least and neerest emendations and corrections that may be;
so that they do but suffice to reduce the observations from impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
to possibility; so as <hi>v. gr.</hi> if one may but correct a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
errour, and an apparent impossibility of one of their obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:96976:143"/>
by the addition or substraction of two or three minutes, and
with that amendment to reduce it to possibility, a man ought
not to essay to adjust it by the addition or substraction of fifteen,
twenty, or fifty.</p>

                        <p>I think the Author would not deny this: for granting
that they are expert and judicious men, it ought to be thought that
they did rather erre little than much.</p>

                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>Observe again; The places where the new Star is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
are some of them manifestly impossible, and others possible.
Absolutely impossible it is, that it should be an infinite space supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to the fixed Stars, for there is no such place in the world;
and if there were, the Star there scituate would have been imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible
to us: it is also impossible that it should go creeping along
the superficies of the Earth; and much lesse that it should be
within the said Terrestrial Globe. Places possible are these that
be in controversie, it not interferring vvith our understanding, that
a visible object in the likenesse of a Star might be aswell above the
Moon, as below it. Now whilst one goeth about to compute by
the way of Observations and Calculations made with the utmost
certainty that humane diligence can attain unto what its place was,
it is found that the greatest part of those Calculations make it
more than infinitely superiour to the Firmament, others make it
very neer to the surface of the Earth, and some also under the
same; and of the rest, which place it in situations not impossible,
none of them agree with each other; insomuch that it must be
confessed, hat all those observations are necessarily false; so that
if we would nevertheless collect some fruit from so many laborious
calculations, we must have recourse to the corrections, amending
all the observations.</p>

                        <p>But the Authour will say, that of the observations that
assign to the Star impossible places, there ought no account to be
made, as being extreamly erroneous and false; and those onely
ought to be accepted, that constitute it in places not impossible:
and amongst these a man ought to seek, by help of the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
and most numerous concurrences, not if the particular and
exact situation, that is, its true distance from the centre of the
Earth, at least, whether it was amongst the Elements, or else a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst

                        <p>The discourse which you now make, is the self same
that the Author made, in favour of his cause, but with too unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
a disadvantage to his adversaries; and this is that princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
point that hath made me excessively to wonder at the too great
confidence that he expressed to have, no less of his own authority,
than of the blindness and inadvertency of the Astronomers; in
favour of whom I will speak, and you shall answer for the Author.
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:96976:144"/>
And first, I ask you, whether the Astronomers, in observing with
their Instruments, and seeking <hi>v. gr.</hi> how great the elevation of a
Star is above the Horizon, may deviate from the truth, aswell in
making it too great, as too little; that is, may erroneously com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
that it is sometime higher than the truth, and sometimes low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
or else whether the errour must needs be alwayes of one
kinde, to wit, that erring they alwayes make it too much, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
too little, or alwayes too little, and never too much?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SIMP.</speaker>
                        <p>I doubt not, but that it is as easie to commit an errour
the one way, as the other.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>I believe the Author would answer the same. Now of
these two kinds of errours, which are contraries, and into which the
observators of the new star may equally have fallen, applied to
calculations, one sort will make the star higher, and the other lower
than really it is. And because we have already agreed, that all
the observations are false; upon what ground would this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
have us to accept those for most congruous with the truth,
that shew the star to have been near at hand, than the others that
shew it excessively remote?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SIMP.</speaker>
                        <p>By what I have, as yet, collected of the Authors mind,
I see not that he doth refuse those observations, and indagations
that might make the star more remote than the Moon, and also
than the Sun, but only those that make it remote (as you your self
have said) more than an infinite distance; the which distance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you also do refuse it as impossible, he also passeth over, as
being convicted of infinite falshood; as also those observations
are of impossibility. Methinks, therefore, that if you would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
the Author, you ought to produce supputations, more exact,
or more in number, or of more diligent observers, which constitute
the star in such and such a distance above the Moon, or above the
Sun, and to be brief, in a place possible for it to be in, like as he
produceth these twelve, which all place the star beneath the Moon
in places that have a being in the world, and where it is possible for
it to be.</p>

                        <p>But <hi>Simplicius</hi> yours and the Authors Equivocation
lyeth in this, yours in one respect, and the Authors in another; I
discover by your speech that you have formed a conceit to your
self, that the exorbitancies that are commited in the establishing
the distance of the Star do encrease successively, according to the
proportion of the errors that are made by the Instrument, in tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the observations, and that by conversion, from the greatness
of the exorbitancies, may be argued the greatnesse of the error;
and that thereforefore hearing it to be infered from such an obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
that the distance of the star is infinite, it is necessary, that
the errour in observing was infinite, and therefore not to be amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

and as such to be refused; but the businesse doth not succeed
in that manner, my <hi>Simplicius,</hi> and I excuse you for not having
comprehended the matter as it is, in regard of your small experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in such affairs; but yet cannot I under that cloak palliate the
error of the Author, who dissembling the knowledge of this which
he did perswade himself that we in good earnest did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
hath hoped to make use of our ignorance, to gain the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
credit to his Doctrine, among the multitude of illiterate men.
Therefore for an advertisement to those who are more credulous
then intelligent, and to recover you from error, know that its pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
(and that for the most part it will come to passe) that an
observation, that giveth you the star <hi>v. gr.</hi> at the distance of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi>
by the adition or substraction of but one sole minute from
the elevation taken with the instrument, shall make it to become
infinitely distant; and therefore of possible, impossible, and by
conversion, those calculations which being grounded upon those
observations, make the star infinitely remote, may possibly often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with the addition or subduction of one sole minute, reduce it
to a possible scituation: and this which I say of a minute, may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
happen in the correction of half a minute, a sixth part, and less.
Now fix it well in your mind, that in the highest distances, that is
<hi>v. g.</hi> the height of <hi>Saturn,</hi> or that of the fixed Stars, very small
errors made by the Observator, with the instrument, render the
scituation determinate and possible, infinite &amp; impossible. This doth
not so evene in the sublunary distances, and near the earth, where
it may happen that the observation by which the Star is collected to
be remote <hi>v. g.</hi> 4. Semidiameters terrestrial, may encrease or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,
not onely one minute but ten, and an hundred, and many
more, without being rendred by the calculation either infinitely
remote, or so much as superior to the Moon. You may hence
comprehend that the greatnesse of the error (to so speak) instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental,
are not to be valued by the event of the calculation, but
by the quantity it self of degrees and minutes numbred upon the
instrument, and these observations are to be called more just or
less erroneous, which with the addition or substraction of fewer
minutes, restore the star to a possible situation; and amongst the
possible places, the true one may be believed to have been that, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
which a greater number of distances concurre upon calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the more exact observations.</p>

                        <p>I do not very well apprehend this which you say: nor
can I of my self conceive how it can be, that in greater distances,
greater exorbitancies can arise from the errour of one minute only,
than in the smaller from ten or an hundred; and therefore would
gladly understand the same.</p>

                        <p>I have refreshed my self both those wayes; but truth is,
make these supputations with great brevity; and, if I may speak
the truth, I have much admired, that this Author goeth so farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
and introduceth so many computations no wise necessary to
the question in dispute. And for a full knowledge of this, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to the end it may soon be seen, how that from the observations
of the Astronomers, whereof this Author makes use, it is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
gathered, that the new star might have been above the
Moon, and also above all the Planets, yea amongst the fixed stars,
and yet higher still than they, I have transcribed upon this paper
all the observations set down by the said Authour, which were
made by thirteen Astronomers, wherein are noted the Polar alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and the altitudes of the star in the meridian, aswell the
lesser under the Pole, as the greater and higher, and they are
these.</p>

Now to see my whole proceeding, we may begin from these
calculations, which are four, omitted by the Author, perhaps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they make against him, in regard they place the star above
the moon by many semidiameters of the Earth. The first of
which is this, computed upon the observations of the Landgrave of
<hi>Hassia,</hi> and <hi>Tycho;</hi> which are, even by the Authors concession,
two of the most exact observers: and in this first, I will declare
the order that I hold in the working; which shall serve for all the
rest, in that they are all made by the same rule, not varying in any
thing, save in the quantity of the given summes, that is, in the
number of the degrees of the Poles altitude, and of the new Stars
elevation above the Horizon, the distance of which from the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
of the Earth, in proportion to the semidiameter of the terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial
Globe is sought, touching which it nothing imports in this
case, to know how many miles that semidiameter conteineth;
whereupon the resolving that, and the distance of places where
the observations were made, as this Author doth, is but time and
labour lost; nor do I know why he hath made the same, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
why at the last he goeth about to reduce the miles found, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
semidiameters of the Terrestrial Globe.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SIMP.</speaker>
                        <p>Perhaps he doth this to finde with such small measures,
and with their fractions the distance of the Star terminated to three
or four inches; for we that do not understand your rules of Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick,
are stupified in hearing your conclusions; as for instance,
whilst we read; Therefore the new Star or Comet was distant
from the Earths centre three hundred seventy and three thousand
eight hundred and seven miles; and moreover, two hundred and
eleven, four thousand ninety sevenths 373807 21<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>/4097, and upon these
precise punctualities, wherein you take notice of such small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
we do conceive it to be impossible, that you, who in our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations
keep an account of an inch, can at the close deceive us so
much as an hundred miles.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>This your reason and excuse would passe for currant,
if in a distance of thousands of miles, a yard over or under were
of any great moment, and if the suppositions that we take for
true, were so certain, as that they could assure us of producing an
indubitable truth in the conclusion; but here you see in the twelve
workings of the Author, the distances of the Star, which from
them one may conclude to have been different from each other,
(and therefore wide of the truth) for many hundreds and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of miles: now whilst that I am more than certain, that that
which I seek must needs differ from the truth by hundreds of miles,
to what purppse is it to be so curious in our calculations, for fear
of missing the quantity of an inch? But let us proceed, at last,
to the working, which I resolve in this manner. <hi>Tycho,</hi> as may be
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:96976:146"/>
seen in that same note observed the star in the polar altitude of 55
degrees and 58 <hi>mi. pri.</hi> And the polar altitude of the <hi>Landgrave</hi>
was 51 degrees and 18 <hi>mi. pri.</hi> The altitude of the star in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian
taken by <hi>Tycho</hi> was 27 degrees 45 <hi>mi. pri.</hi> The <hi>Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi>
found its altitude 23 degrees 3 <hi>mi. pri.</hi> The which altitudes
are these noted here, as you see.</p>

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:96976:147"/>
because the angle BAD, conteined between the vertical lines, is
equal to the difference of the Polar altitudes, it shall be <hi>4gr. 40m.</hi>
which I note here apart; and I finde the chord of it by the Table
of Arches and Chords, and set it down neer unto it, which is 8142
parts, of which the semidiameter AB is 100000. Next, I finde
the angle BDC with ease, for the half of the angle BAD, which
is <hi>2gr. 20 m.</hi> added to a right angle, giveth the angle BDF <hi>92gr.
20 m.</hi> to which adding the angle CDF, which is the distance from
the vertical point of the greatest altitude of the Star, which here is
62 <hi>gr. 15 m.</hi> it giveth us the quantity of the angle BDC,
154 <hi>grad. 45 min.</hi> the which I set down together with its Sine,
taken out of the Table, which is 42657, and under this I note
the angle of the Parallax BCD 0 <hi>gr. 2 m.</hi> with its Sine 58.
And because in the Triangle BCD, the side DB is to the side
BC; as the sine of the opposite angle BCD, to the sine of the
opposite angle BDC: therefore, if the line BD were 58. BC
would be 42657. And because the Chord DB is 8142. of those
parts whereof the semidiameter BA is 100000. and we seek to
know how many of those parts is BC; therefore we will say, by
the Golden Rule, if when BD is 58. BG is 42657. in case the
said DB were 8142. how much would BC be? I multiply the
second term by the third, and the product is 347313294. which
ought to be divided by the first, namely, by 58. and the quotient
shall be the number of the parts of the line BC, whereof the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midiameter
AB is 100000. And to know how many semidiame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
BA, the said line BC doth contein, it will be necessary anew
to divide the said quotient so found by 100000. and we shall have
the number of semidiameters conteined in BC. Now the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
347313294. divided by 58. giveth 5988160¼. as here you

which one being added for the line AB, we shall have little lesse

the right distance from the centre A, to the Star C, shall be more

few minutes, removeth the star a very great way farther off.
As for example, in the first of these workings, where the calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
made the star 60. semidiameters remote from the centre,
with the Parallax of 2. minutes; he that would maintain that it
was in the Firmament, is to correct in the observations but onely
two minutes, nay lesse, for then the Parallax ceaseth, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
so small, that it removeth the star to an immense di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
which by all is received to be the Firmament. In the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

two minutes onely mount the star even above the Firmament.
In the last preceding, a quarter of a minute, that is 15. seconds,
gives us the same. But it doth not so occur in the sublunary alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes;
for if you fancy to your self what distance you most
like, and go about to correct the workings made by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
and adjust them so as that they all answer in the same
determinate distance, you will find how much greater correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
they do require.</p>

                        <p>To take a distance that may favour the Authour, we
will suppose it to be that which is the greatest of all those found
by him in his 12 workings; for whilst it is in controversie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and Astronomers, and that they affirm the star to
have been superiour to the Moon, and he that it was inferiour,
very small space that he proveth it to have been lower, giveth
him the victory.</p>

                        <p>Let us therefore take the seventh working wrought
upon the observations of <hi>Tycho</hi> and <hi>Thaddaeus Hagecius,</hi> by
which the Authour found the star to have been distant from the
centre 32. semidiameters, which situation is most favourable to
his purpose; and to give him all advantages, let us moreover
place it in the distance most disfavouring the <hi>Astronomers,</hi> which
is to situate it above the Firmament. That therefore being sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
let us seek in the next place what corrections it would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to apply to his other 11 workings. And let us begin at the
first calculated upon the observations of <hi>Hainzelius</hi> and <hi>Mauroice;</hi>
in which the Authour findeth the distance from the centre about
3. semidiameters with the Parallax of 4 <hi>gr. 42 m. 30. sec.</hi> Let
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:96976:149"/>
us see whether by withdrawing it 20. minutes onely, it will rise
to the height of 32. semidiameters: See the short and true opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

chord BD, and divide the product, the five last figures being cut
off by the sine of the Parallax, and the quotient will be 28. se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midiameters,
and an half, so that though you make a correction
of 4 <hi>gr. 22 min. 30 sec.</hi> taken from 4 <hi>gr. 42 min. 30 sec.</hi> it shall
not elevate the star to the altitude of 32. semidiameters, which

and an half.</p>
                        <p>In the second operation made upon the observations of <hi>Hain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zelius,</hi>

from the centre of the Earth. It is necessary therefore for
the raising of it, to diminish the Parallax according to the Rule
which he likewise observeth in the ninth working. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
suppose the Parallax to be 6 <hi>m. prim.</hi> whose sine is 175, and
the division being made, there is found likewise lesse than 31

Here we see also, (as I have noted even now) that should the
Authour consent to assign the distance of 32. Semidiameters for
the true height of the Star, the correction of those his 10. workings,
(I say 10. because the second being very high, is reduced to the
height of 32. Semidiameters, with 2. minutes correction) to make
them all to restore the said Star to that distance, would require such
a reduction of Parallaxes, that amongst the whole number of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions
they should make more than 756 <hi>m. pr.</hi> whereas in the
5. calculated by me, which do place the Star above the Moon, to
correct them in such sort, as to constitute it in the Firmament,
the correction onely of 10. minutes, and one fourth sufficeth.</p>
                        <p>Now adde to these, other 5. workings, that place the Star pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
in the Firmament, without need of any correction at all,
and we shall have ten workings or indagations that agree to place
it in the Firmament, with the correction onely of 5. of them (as
hath been seen) but 10. <hi>m.</hi> and 15 <hi>sec.</hi> Whereas for the correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of those 10. of the Authour, to reduce them to the altitude of
32. semidiameters, there will need the emendations of 756 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
in 836. that is, there must from the summe 836 be substra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
756. if you would have the Star elevated to the altitude of
32. semidiameters, and yet that correction doth not fully serve.</p>
                        <p>The workings that immediately without any correction free the
Star from Parallaxes, and therefore place it in the Firmament,
and that also in the remotest parts of it, and in a word, as high
as the Pole it self, are these 5. noted here.</p>

                        <p>Of the remaining combinations that might be made of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
of all these Astronomers, those that make the Stars sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
to an infinite distance, are many in number, namely, about
30. more than those who give the Star, by calculation, to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Moon; and because (as it was agreed upon between us) it
is to be believed that the Observators have erred rather little than
much, it is a manifest thing that the corrections to be applied to
the Observaations, which make the star of an infinite altitude, to
reduce it lower, do sooner, and with lesser amendment place it in
the Firmament, than beneath the Moon; so that all these applaud
the opinion of those who put it amongst the fixed Stars. You may
adde, that the corrections required for those emendations, are
much lesser than those, by which the Star from an unlikely proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
may be removed to the height more favourable for this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
as by the foregoing examples hath been seen; amongst
which impossible proximities, there are three that seem to remove
the Star from the Earths centre, a lesse distance than one Semidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter,
making it, as it were, to turn round under ground, and
these are those combinations, wherein the Polar altitude of one
of the Observators being greater than the Polar altitude of the
other, the elevation of the Star taken by the first, is lesser than the
elation of the Star taken by the latter.</p>
                        <p>The first of these is this of the <hi>Landgrave</hi> with <hi>Gemma,</hi>
where the Polar altitude of the <hi>Landgrave 51 gr. 18 min.</hi> is
greater than the Polar altitude of <hi>Gemma,</hi> which is 50 <hi>gr. 50 m.</hi>
But the altitude of the Star of the <hi>Landgrave 79 gr. 30 min.</hi>
is lesser than that of the Star, of <hi>Gemma 79 gr. 45 min.</hi>

                        <p>From what I have hitherto demonstrated, you may guesse how
much this first way of finding out the distance of the Star, and
proving it sublunary introduced by the Authour, maketh against
himself, and how much more probably and clearly the distance
thereof is collected to have been amongst the more remote fixed
Stars.</p>

                        <p>As to this particular, I think that the inefficacy of the
Authors demonstrations is very plainly discovered; But I see that all
this was comprised in but a few leaves of his Book, and it may be,
that some other of his Arguments are more conclusive then these
first.</p>

                        <p>Rather they must needs be lesse valid, if we will take
those that lead the way for a proof of the rest: For (as it is clear)
the uncertainty and inconclusivenesse of those, is manifestly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
to derive it self from the errours committed in the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
observations, upon which the Polar Altitude, and height
of the Star was thought to have been justly taken, all in effect
having easily erred; And yet to find the Altitude of the Pole, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomers
have had Ages of time to apply themselves to it, at their
leasure: and the Meridian Altitudes of the Star are easier to be
observed, as being most terminate, and yielding the Observator
some time to continue the same, in regard they change not sensibly,
in a short time, as those do that are remote from the Meridian. And
if this be so, as it is most certain, what credit shall we give to Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
founded upon Observations more numerous, more difficult
to be wrought, more momentary in variation, and we may add,
with Instruments more incommodious and erroneous? Upon a
slight perusal of the ensuing demonstrations, I see that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations
are made upon Altitudes of the Star taken in different
Vertical Circles, which are called by the Arabick name, <hi>Azimuths;</hi> in
which observations moveable instruments are made use of, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Vertical Circles, but in the Horizon also, at the same time;
insomuch that it is requisite in the same moment that the altitude
is taken, to have observed, in the Horizon, the distance of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:96976:154"/>
point in which the Star is, from the Meridian; Moreover,
after a considerable interval of time, the operation must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,
and exact account kept of the time that passed, trusting
either to Dials, or to other observations of the Stars. Such an <hi>Olio</hi>
of Observations doth he set befo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap> you, comparing them with
such another made by another observer in another place with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
different instrument, and at another time; and from this
the Authour seeks to collect what would have been, the Elevations
of the Star, and Horizontal Latitudes happened in the time and
hour of the other first observations, and upon such a coaequation he
in the end grounds his account. Now I refer it to you, what credit
is to be given to that which is deduced from such like workings.
Moreover, I doubt not in the least, but that if any one would tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
himself with such tedious computations, he would find, as in
those aforegoing, that there were more that would favour the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
party, than the Authour: But I think it not worth the while
to take so much pains in a thing, which is not, amongst those prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

                        <p>Upon two sorts of observations most plain, most easie,
and most certain; one only of which is more than sufficient to assure
us, that it was scituate in the Firmament, or at least by a great
distance superiour to the Moon. One of which is taken from the
equality, or little differing inequality of its distances from the
Pole, aswell whilst it was in the lowest part of the Meridian, as
when it was in the uppermost: The other is its having perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
kept the same distances from certain of the fixed Stars, adjacent
to it, and particularly from the eleventh of <hi>Cassiopea,</hi> no more
remote from it than one degree and an half; from which two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
is undoubtedly inferred, either the absolute want of Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax,
or such a smalnesse thereof, that it doth assure us with very
expeditious Calculations of its great distance from the Earth.</p>

Heaven;] but this Authour runs, not to the Cords, but to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
Web of Heaven; as you shall plainly see in our examination
of these two particulars even now hinted. And first, that which
sheweth us the Polar distances of the Observators one by one, I
have noted down in these brief Calculations; For a full under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:96976:155"/>
of which, I ought first to advertise you, that when ever
the new Star, or other Phaenomenon is near to the earth, turning
with a Diurnal motion about the Pole, it will seem to be farther
off from the said Pole, whilst it is in the lower part of the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
then whilst it is above, as in this Figure <hi>[being fig. third of
this Dial.]</hi> may be seen. In which the point T. denotes the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
of the Earth; O. the place of the Observator; the Arch VPC
the Firmament; P. the Pole. The <hi>Phaenomenon, [or appearance]</hi>
moving along the Circle FS. is seen one while under the Pole by
the Ray OFC. and another while above, according to the Ray
OSD. so that the places seen in the Firmament are D. and C. but
the true places in respect of the Centre T, are B, and A, equidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from the Pole. Where it is manifest that the apparent place
of the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> S, that is the point D, is nearer to the Pole than
the other apparent place C, seen along the Line or Ray OFC,
which is the first thing to be noted. In the second place you must
note that the exces of the apparent inferiour distance from the Pole,
over and above the apparent superiour distance from the said Pole,
is greater than the Inferiour Parallax of the <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> that is, I
say, that the excesse of the Arch CP, (the apparent inferior di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance)
over and above the Arch PD, (the apparent superior di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance)
is greater then the Arch CA, (that is the inferiour Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax.)
Which is easily proved; for the Arch CP. more exceedeth
PD, then PB; PB, being bigger than PD, but PB. is equal to
PA, and the excesse of CP, above PA, is the arch, CA, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the excesse of the arch CP above the arch PD, is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than the arch CA, which is the parallax of the Phaenomenon
placed in F, which was to be demonstrated. And to give all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
to the Author, let us suppose that the parallax of the star
in F, is the whole excesse of the arch CP (that is of the inferiour
distance from the pole) above the arch PD (the inferiour di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.)
I proceed in the next place to examine that which the
observations of all Astronomers cited by the Authour giveth us,
amongst which, there is not one that maketh not against himself
and his purpose. And let us begin with these of <hi>Buschius,</hi> who
findeth the stars distance from the pole, when it was superiour, to be
28 <hi>gr. 10 m.</hi> and the inferiour to be 28 <hi>gr. 30 m.</hi> so that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
is 0 <hi>gr. 20 m.</hi> which let us take (in favour of the Author) as
if it all were the parallax of the star in F, that is the angle TFO.
Then the distance from the <hi>Vertex</hi> [or Zenith] that is the arch
CV, is 67 <hi>gr. 20 m.</hi> These two things being found, prolong the
line CO, and from it let fall the perpendicular TI, and let us
consider the triangle TOI, of which the angle I is right angle,
and the angle IOT known, as being vertical to the angle VOC,
the distance of the star from the <hi>Vertex,</hi> Moreover in the triangle
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:96976:155"/>
TIF, which is also rectangular, there is known the angle F, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by the parallax. Then note in some place apart the two an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
IOT and IFT, and of them take the sines, which are
here set down to them, as you seen. And because in the triangle
IOT, the sine TI is 92276. of those parts, whereof the whole
sine TO is 100000; and moreover in the triangle IFT, the sine TI
is 582. of those parts, whereof the whole sine TF is 100000, to
find how many TF is of those parts, whereof TO is 100000;
we will say by the Rule of three: If TI be 582. TF is an
100000. but if T I were 92276. how much would T F be.
Let us multiply 92276. by 100000. and the product will be
9227600000. and this must be divided by 582. and the quotient
will be 15854982. and so many shall there be in TF of those
parts, of which there are in TO an 100000. So that if it were
required to know how many lines TO, are in TF, we would
divide 15854982 by 100000. and there will come forth 158. and
very near an half; and so many diameters shall be the distance
of the star F, from the centre T, and to abreviate the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we seeing, that the product of the multiplication of 92276.
by 100000, ought to be divided first by 582, and then the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
of that division by 100000. we may without multiplying
92276. by 100000. and with one onely division of the sine
92276. by the sine 582. soon obtain the same solution, as may
be seen there below; where 92276. divided by 582. giveth us the
said 158 1/2, or thereabouts. Let us bear in mind therefore, that
the onely division of the sine TI, as the sine of the angle TOI
by the sine TI, as the sine of the angle IFT, giveth us the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
sought TF, in so many diameters TO.</p>

contradictions?</p>

                        <p>He betakes himself to one of those weak threads which
I speak of; saying that the <hi>Parallaxes</hi> come to be lessened by means
of the refractions, which opperating contrarily sublimate the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon,</hi>
whereas the <hi>Parallaxes</hi> abase it. Now of what little
stead this lamentable refuge is, judge by this, that in case that effect of
the refractions were of such an efficacy, as that which not long time
since some Astronomers have introduced, the most that they could
work touching the elevating a <hi>Phaeuomenon</hi> above the Horizon
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:96976:157"/>
more than truth, when it is before hand 23. or 24. Degrees high,
would be the lessening its <hi>Parallax</hi> about 3. minutes, the which
abatement is too small to pull down the Star below the Moon, and
in some cases is lesse than the advantage given him by us in admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that the excesse of the inferiour distance from the Pole above
the Superiour, is all <hi>Parallax,</hi> the which advantage is far more clear
and palpable than the effect of Refracton, of the greatnesse of
which I stand in doubt, and not without reason. But besides, I
demand of the Author, whether he thinks that those Astronomers,
of whose observations he maketh use, had knowledge of these ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of Refractions, and considered the same, or no; if they did
know and consider them, it is reasonable to think that the, kept ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of them in assigning the true Elevation of the Star, making
in those degrees of Attitude discovered with the Instruments, such
abatements as were convenient on the account of the alterations
made by the Refractions; insomuch that the distances by them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
were in the end those corrected and exact, and not the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
and false ones. But if he think that those Authors made
no reflection upon the said Refractions, it must be confessed, that
they had in like manner erred in determining all those things which
cannot be perfectly adjusted without allowance for the Refracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
amongst which things one is the precise investigation of the
Polar Altitudes, which are commonly taken from the two Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Altitudes of some of the fixed Stars that are constantly visible,
which Altitudes will come to be altered by Refraction in the same
manner, just as those of the new Star; so that the Polar Altitude
that is deduced from them, will prove to be defective, and to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of the self same want which this Author assigns to the Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
ascribed to the new Star, to wit, both that and these will
be with equal falshood placed higher than really they are. But any
such errour, as far as concerns our present businesse, doth no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judce
at all: For we not needing to know any more, but onely
the difference between the two distances of the new Star from the
Pole at such time as it was inferiour and superiour, it is evident that
such distances would be the same, taking the alteration of Refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
commonly for the Star and for the Pole, or for them when
commonly amended. The Authors Argument would indeed have
had some strength, though very small, if he had assured us that
the Altitude of the Pole had been once precisely assigned, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
from the errour depending on refraction, from which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
the Astronomers had not kept themselves in assigning the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of the new Star; but he hath not ascertained us of that,
nor perhaps could he have done, nor haply, (and this is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable)
was that caution wanting in the Observators.</p>

                        <p>This argument is in my judgment sufficiently answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:96976:157"/>
therefore tell me how he dis-ingageth himself in the next place
from that particular of the Stars having constantly kept the same
distance from the fixed Stars circumjacent to it.</p>

                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>He betakes himself, in like manner, to two threads, yet
more unable to uphold him than the former: one of which is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
fastened to refraction, but so much less firmly, in that he
saith, that refraction operating upon the new Star, and sublimating
it higher than its true situation, maketh the seeming distances un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to be distinguished from the true, when compared to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumposed
fixed Stars that environ it. Nor can I sufficiently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
how he can dissemble his knowing how that the same refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
will work alike upon the new Star, as upon the antient one
its neighbour, elevating both equally, so as that such a like acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
altereth not the space betwixt them. His other subterfuge is
yet more unhappy, and carryeth with it much of ridiculous, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
founded upon the errour that may arise in the instrumental o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
it self; whilst that the Observator not being able to
constitute the centre of the eyes pupil in the centre of the Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
(an Instrument imployed in observing the distance between
two Stars) but holding it elevated above that centre, as much as
the said pupil is distant from I know not what bone of the cheek,
against which the end of the Instrument resteth, there is formed
in the eye an angle more acute than that which is made by the sides
of the Instrument; which angle of rayes differeth also from it
self, at such time as a man looketh upon Stars, not much elevated
above the Horizon, and the same being afterwards placed at a
great height; that angle, saith he, is made different, while the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
goeth ascending, the head standing still: but if in moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Instrument, the neck should bend backwards, and the
head go rising, together with the Instrument, the angle would then
continue the same. So that the Authours answer supposeth that
the Observators in using the Instrument have not raised the head,
as they ought to have done; a thing which hath nothing of likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
in it. But granting that so it had been, I leave you to judge
what difference can be between two acute angles of two equicru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
triangles, the sides of one of which triangles are each four
<hi>[Italian] Braces [i. e.</hi> about three English yards] and those of the
other, four braces within the quantity of the diameter of a Pea;
for the differences cannot be absolutely greater between the length
of the two visive rayes, whilst the line is drawn perpendicularly
from the centre of the pupil, upon the plain of the Rule of the
Sextant (which line is no bigger than the breath of the thumb)
and the length of the same rayes, whilst elevating the Sextant,
without raising the head together with it, that same line no longer
falleth perpendicularly upon the said plane, but inclineth, making
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:96976:158"/>
the angle towards the circumference something acute. But wholly
to free this Authour from these unhappy lies, let him know, (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
it appears that he is not very skilful in the use of Astronomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Instruments) that in the sides of the Sextant or Quadrant
there are placed two<note n="*" place="margin">Traguardi.</note> Sights, one in the centre, and the other at
the other at the opposite end, which are raised an inch or more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the plane of the Rule; and through the tops of those sights
the ray of the eye is made to passe, which eye likewise is held an
hands breadth or two, or it may be more, from the Instrument; so
that neither the pupil, nor any bone of the cheek, nor of the whole
body toucheth or stayeth it self upon the Instrument, nor much
lesse is the Instrument upheld or mounted in the armes, especially
if it be one of those great ones, as is usual, which weighing tens,
hundreds, and also thousands of pounds, are placed upon very
strong feet or frames: so that the whole objection vanisheth.
These are the subterfuges of this Authour, which, though they were
all of steel, would not secure him the hundredth part of a minute;
and with these he conceits to make us believe, that he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensated
that difference, which importeth more than an hundred
minutes; I mean, that of the not observing a notable difference
in the distances between one of the fixed stars, and the new star in
in any of their circulations; which, had it been neer to the Moon,
it ought to have been very conspicuous to the meer sight, without
any Instrument, especially comparing it with the eleventh of <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siopeia,</hi>
its neighbour, within 1 <hi>gr. 30 m.</hi> which ought to have va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
from it more than two diameters of the moon, as the more
intelligent Astronomers of those times do well note.</p>

But now let <hi>Simplicius</hi> begin to propose those doubts which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
him from believing that the Earth, in like manner, as the
other planets, may move round about a fixed centre.</p>

                        <p>The first and greatest difficulty is the repugnance and
incompatibility that is between being in the centre, and being far
from it; for if the Terrestrial Globe were to move in a year by
the circumference of a circle, that is, under the Zodiack, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
that it should, at the same time, be in the centre of the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack;
but that the Earth is in the said centre <hi>Aristotle, Ptolomy,</hi>
and others have many wayes proved.</p>

                        <speaker>SALV.</speaker>
                        <p>You very well argue, and there is no question but that
one that would make the Earth to move in the circumference of a
circle, must first of necessity prove, that it is not in the centre of
that same circle; it now followeth, that we enquire, whether the
Earth be, or be not in that centre, about which, I say, that it tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
and you say that it is fixed; and before we speak of this, it
is likewise necessary that we declare our selves, whether you and I
have both the same conceit of this centre, or no. Therefore tell
me, what and where is this your intended centre?</p>

                        <p>Supposing those <hi>Phaenomena</hi> expressed by you, and
which I have likewise read in the little treatise of Conclusions, to
<figure/>
be true, namely, that that star never recedes from the Sun beyond
such a determinate space of 40 degrees or thereabouts, so as that
it never cometh either to apposition with the Sun, or so much as
to quadrature, or yet to the sextile aspect; and more than that,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Venus</hi> very great towards the respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive conjunction and very small to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</note>
supposing that it sheweth at one time almost 40 times greater than
at another; namely, very great, when being retrograde, it goeth to
the vespertine conjnnction of the Sun, and very small when with a
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:96976:161"/>
motion straight forwards, it goeth to the matutine conjunction;
and moreover it being true, that when it appeareth bigge it shews
with a corniculate figure, and when it appeareth little, it seems
perfectly round, these appearances, I say, being true, I do not see
how one can choose but affirm the said star to revolve in a circle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Sun,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Venus</hi> necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily proved to move about the Sun.</note> for that the said circle cannot in any wise be said
to encompasse or to contain the Earth within it, nor to be inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to the Sun, that is between it and the Earth, nor yet supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to the Sun. That circle cannot incompasse the Earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Venus</hi> would then sometimes come to opposition with the
Sun; it cannot be inferiour, for then <hi>Venus</hi> in both its conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
with the Sun would seem horned; nor can it be superiour,
for then it would alwayes appear round, and never cornicular;
and therefore for receit of it I will draw the circle CH, about
the Sun, without encompassing the Earth.</p>

                           <hi>Mars,</hi> Because it comes to an opposition with the Sun,
its Circle must of necessity encompass the Earth; But I see that it
must necessarily encompass the Sun also, for coming to conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the Sun, if it did not move over it, but were below it, it
would appear horned, as <hi>Venus</hi> and the Moon; but it shews al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
round, and therefore it is necessary, that it no less includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

that you did say, that when it is in opposition with the
Sun, it seems 60 times bigger than when it is in the conjunction,
me thinks that a Circle about the Centre of the Sun, and that tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

                        <p>Following the same Method (which seems to me very
conclusive) in regard we see that the Moon cometh to conjunction
and opposition with the Sun,<note place="margin">The Moons Orb invironeth the Earth, but not the Sun.</note> it is necessary to say, that its circle
encompasseth the Earth, but yet doth it not follow, that it must
environ the Sun, for then at that time towards its conjunction, it
would not seem horned, but alwayes round and full of Light.
Moreover it could never make, as it often doth, the Eclipse of the
Sun, by interposing betwixt it and us; It is necessary therefore
to assign it a circle about the Earth, which should be this NP, so
that being constituted in P, it will appear from the Earth A, to be
in conjunction with the Sun, and placed in N, it appeareth opposite
to the Sun, and in that position it may fall under the Earths sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,

                        <p>Now, <hi>Simplicius,</hi> what shall we do with the fixed

point; or else placed in a superficies spherically distended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

                        <p>I would rather take a middle way;<note place="margin">The probable situation of the fixed stars.</note> and would assign
them an Orb described about a determinate centre and comprized
within two spherical superficies, to wit, one very high, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave,
and the other lower,<note place="margin">Which ought to be accounted the sphere of the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse.</note> and convex, betwixt which I would

                        <p>But now we have all this while, <hi>Simplicius,</hi> disposed the
mundane bodies exactly, according to the order of <hi>Copernicus,</hi>
and we have done it with your hand; and moreover to each of
them you have assigned peculiar motions of their own, except to
the Sun, the Earth, and starry Sphere; and to <hi>Mercury</hi> with
<hi>Venus,</hi> you have ascribed the circular motion about the Sun,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:96976:162"/>
without encompassing the Earth; about the same Sun you make
the three superiour Planets <hi>Mars, Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> to move,
comprehending the Earth within their circles. The Moon in the
next place can move in no other manner than about the Earth,
without taking in the Sun, and in all these motions you agree also
with the same <hi>Copernicus.</hi> There remains now three things to be
decided between the Sun, the Earth, and fixed stars, namely,
Rest,<note place="margin">Rest, the annual motion and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal ought to be distributed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Sun, Earth, and Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament.</note> which seemeth to belong to the Earth; the annual motion
under the Zodiack, which appeareth to pertain to the Sun; and the
diurnal motion, which seems to belong to the Starry Sphere, and
to be by that imparted to all the rest of the Universe, the Earth
excepted, And it being true that all the Orbs of the Planets, I
mean of <hi>Mercury,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">In a moveable sphere, it seemeth more reasonable that its centre be stable, than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of its parts.</note> 
                           <hi>Venus, Mars, Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> do move
about the Sun as their centre; rest seemeth with so much more
reason to belong to the said Sun, than to the Earth, in as much
as in a moveable Sphere, it is more reasonable that the centre
stand still, than any other place remote from the said centre; to
the Earth therefore, which is constituted in the midst of move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
parts of the Universe, I mean between <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> one
of which maketh its revolution in nine moneths, and the other in
two years, may the motion of a year very commodiously be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed,
leaving rest to the Sun.<note place="margin">Granting to the Earth the annual, it must of necessity also have the diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal motion assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it.</note> And if that be so, it followeth
of necessary consequence, that likewise the diurnal motion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to the Earth; for, if the Sun standing still, the Earth
should not revolve about its self, but have onely the annual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
about the Sun, our year would be no other than one day and
one night, that is six moneths of day, and six moneths of night,
as hath already been said. You may consider withal how commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously
the precipitate motion of 24 hours is taken away from
the Universe, and the fixed stars that are so many Suns, are made
in conformity to our Sun to enjoy a perpetual rest. You see more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
what facility one meets with in this rough draught to render
the reason of so great appearances in the Celestial bodies.</p>

others haply could make thence contrary deductions; doubting,

many and many a time, with the relation of such kind of frivolous
reasons, as serve to make the vulgar contumacious, and difficult to
be perswaded to hearken, (I will not say to consent) to this novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:96976:162"/>
I believe that you wonder at the paucity of those who are fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of that opinion would be much diminished.<note place="margin">Discourses more than childish, serve to keep fools in the opinion of the Earths stability.</note> But small re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
in my judgement, ought to be had of such thick sculs, as think
it a most convincing proof to confirm, and steadfastly settle them
in the belief of the earths immobility, to see that if this day they
cannot Dine at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> nor Sup in <hi>Jappan,</hi> that then the
Earth as being a most grave body cannot clamber above the Sun,
and then slide headlong down again; Of such as these I say,
whose number is infinite, we need not make any reckoning, nor
need we to record their foolieries, or to strive to gain to our side
as our partakers in subul and sublime opinions, men in whose de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
the kind onely is concerned, and the difference is wanting.
Moreover, what ground do you think you could be able to gain,
with all the demonstrations of the World upon brains so stupid,
as are not able of themselves to know their down right follies? But
my admiration, <hi>Sagredus,</hi> is very different from yours, you won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that so few are followers of the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Opinion; and I
am amazed how there could be any yet left till now that do em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
and follow it:<note place="margin">A declaration of the improbabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>Copernicus</hi> his opinion.</note> Nor can I sufficiently admire the eminencie of

the sprightlinesse of their judgements offered such violence to their
own sences, as that they have been able to prefer that which their
reason dictated to them, to that which sensible experiments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
most manifestly on the contrary. That the reasons against
the Diurnal virtiginous revolution of the Earth by you already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined,
do carry great probability with them, we have already
seen; as also that the <hi>Ptolomaicks,</hi> and <hi>Aristotelicks,</hi> with all their

of their efficacie; but those experiments which apertly contradict

that (I say it again) I cannot find any bounds for my admiration,
how that reason was able in <hi>Aristarchus</hi> and <hi>Copernicus,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
such a rape upon their Sences, as in despight thereof, to make
her self mistress of their credulity.</p>

twice as much differences, as from the earth to the Sun; it would be
necessary, that when it is nearest unto us, its <hi>discus</hi> would shew
more than 60. times bigger than it seems, when it is farthest from
us; nevertheless that diversity of apparent magnitude is not to be
seen, nay in its opposition with the Sun, when its nearest to the
Earth, it doth not shew so much as quadruple and quintuple in
bigness, to what it is, when towards the conjunction it cometh to
be occulted under the Suns rayes. Another and greater difficulty
doth <hi>Venus</hi> exhibit; For if revolving about the Sun, as <hi>Copernicus</hi>

onely shineth as the Moon, by the illumination of the Sun, which
seemeth most reasonable; it would shew forked or horned at such
time as it is under the Sun, as the Moon doth when she is in like

her.<note place="margin">

her self, or else that her substance is of such a nature, that it can
imbue the Solar light, and transmit the same through all its whole
depth, so as to be able to appear to us alwayes shining; and in this
manner <hi>Copernicus</hi> excuseth the not changing figure in <hi>Venus:</hi> but
of her small variation of Magnitude,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Copernicus</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing of the small variation of bigness in <hi>Venus</hi> and in <hi>Mars.</hi>
                           </note> he maketh no mention at all;
and much less of <hi>Mars</hi> than was needful; I believe as being una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
so well as he desired to salve a <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> so contrary to his
Hypothesis, and yet being convinced by so many other occurrences
and reasons he maintained, and held the same Hypothesis to be true.
Besides these things, to make the Planets, together with the Earth,
to move above the Sun as the Centre of their conversions, and the
Moon onely to break that order,<note place="margin">The moon much disturbeth the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the other Planets.</note> and to have a motion by it self
about the earth; and to make both her, the Earth, and the whole
Elementary <hi>Sphere,</hi> to move all together about the Sun in a year,
this seemeth to pervert the order of this Systeme, which rendreth
it unlikely and false. These are those difficulties that make me
wonder how <hi>Aristarchus</hi> and <hi>Copernicus,</hi> who must needs have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
them, not having been able for all that to salve them, have
yet notwithstanding by other admirable occurrences been induced
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:96976:163"/>
to conside so much in that which reason dictated to them, as that
they have considently affirmed that the structure of the Universe
could have no other figure than that which they designed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
There are also several other very serious and curious doubts,
not so easie to be resolved by the middle sort of wits, but yet pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated
and declared by <hi>Coperninus,</hi> which we shall defer till by
and by, after we have answered to other objections that seem to
make against this opinion. Now coming to the declarations and
answers to those three before named grand Objections, I say, that
the two first not onely contradict not the <hi>Copernican</hi> Systeme,<note place="margin">Answers to the three first objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernican,</hi> Systeme.</note> but
greatly and absolutely favour it; For both <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> seems
unequal to themselves, according to the proportions assigned; and

the sense of seeing, the which by nature was not granted to man
so perfect, as that it was able to attain to the discovery of such dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences;
nay even the very instrument of sight is an impediment
to it self: But since that it hath pleased God in our age to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe

our sight, by multiplying it four, six, ten, twenty, thirty, and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

daily do make a thousand experiments of the same: But I pray
you, let us leave this kind of pertinacious men, whom we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
so much as tax without doing them too great honour. And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to our purpose,<note place="margin">Shining objects seem environed with adventitious rayes.</note> I say, that resplendent objects, whether
it is that their light doth refract on the humidity that is upon the

its reflex rayes upon the said pupils, or whether it is for some

                        <p>I believe you would have said three times; for adding
four inches to this side, and four inches to that side of the diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                           <hi>Simplicius.</hi>
True it is, that the diameter is tripled, but the superficies, which is
that of which we speak, increaseth nine times: for you must know,
<hi>Simplicius,</hi> that the superficies of circles are to one another, as
the squares of their diameters; and a circle that hath four inches
diameter is to another that hath twelve, as the square of four to
the square of twelve; that is, as 16. is to 144. and therefore it shall
be increased nine times, and not three; this, by way of advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to <hi>Simplicius.</hi> And proceeding forwards, if we should add
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:96976:164"/>
the said irradiation of four inches to a circle that hath but two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of diameter onely, the diameter of the irradiation or Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
would be ten inches, and the superficial content of the circle
would be the <hi>area</hi> of the naked body, as 100. to 4. for those
are the squares of 10. and of 2. the agrandizement would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be 25. times so much; and lastly, the four inches of hair or
fringe, added to a small circle of an inch in diameter, the same
would be increased 81. times; and so continually the augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are made with a proportion greater and greater, according
as the real objects that increase, are lesser and lesser.</p>

                        <p>I have already declared the same in part, when I said,
that onely lucid objects so increased, and not the obscure; now I
adde what remaines, that of the resplendent objects those that are
of a more bright light, make the reflection greater and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>splendent
upon our pupil; whereupon they seem to augment
much more than the lesse lucid: and that I may no more inlarge
my self upon this particular, come we to that which the true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris
of <hi>Astronomy,</hi> Experience, teacheth us. Let us this evening,
when the air is very obscure, observe the star of <hi>Jupiter;</hi> we
shall see it very glittering,<note place="margin">An easie expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment that shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the increase in the stars, by means of the adventitious rays.</note> and very great; let us afterwards look
through a tube, or else through a small trunk, which clutching the
hand close, and accosting it to the eye, we lean between the palm
of the hands and the fingers, or else by an hole made with a small
needle in a paper; and we shall see the said star divested of its
beams, but so small, that we shall judge it lesse, even than a sixti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
part of its great glittering light seen with the eye at liberty:
we may afterwards behold the <hi>Dog-stars</hi> beautiful and bigger than
any of the other fixed stars,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Jupiter</hi> augments lesse than the <hi>Dog-star.</hi>
                           </note> which seemeth to the bare eye no
great matter lesse than <hi>Jupiter;</hi> but taking from it, as before, the
irradiation, its <hi>Discus</hi> will shew so little, that it will not be
thought the twentieth part of that of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> nay, he that hath not
very good eyes, will very hardly discern it; from whence it may
be rationally inferred, that the said star, as having a much more
lively light than <hi>Jupiter,</hi> maketh its irradiation greater than <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
doth his. In the next place, as to the irradiation of the Sun
and Moon,<note place="margin">The <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> increase lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</note> it is as nothing, by means of their magnitude, which
possesseth of it self alone so great a space in our eye, that it lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
no place for the adventitious rayes; so that their faces seem
close clipt, and terminate. We may assure our selves of the same
truth by another experiment which I have often made triall of;
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:96976:165"/>
we may assure ourselves,<note place="margin">It is seen by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest experience, that the more splendid bodies do much more irradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate than the lesse lucid.</note> I say, that bodies shining with most live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
light do irradiate, or beam forth rayes more by far than those
that are of a more languishing light. I have many times seen <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>
and <hi>Venus</hi> together twenty or thirty degrees distant from the
Sun, and the air being very dark, <hi>Venus</hi> appeared eight or ten
times bigger than <hi>Jupiter,</hi> being both beheld by the eye at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
but being beheld afterwards with the Telescope, the <hi>Discus</hi>
of <hi>Jupiter</hi> discovered it self to be four or more times greater than
that of <hi>Venus,</hi> but the vivacity of the splendour of <hi>Venus</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably
bigger than the languishing light of <hi>Jupiter;</hi> which
was only because of <hi>Jupiters</hi> being far from the Sun, and from us;
and <hi>Venus</hi> neer to us, and to the Sun. These things premised, it
will not be difficult to comprehend, how Mars, when it is in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to the Sun, and therefore neerer to the Earth by seven times,
and more, than it is towards the conjunction, cometh to appear
scarce four or five times bigger in that state than in this, when as it
should appear more than fifty times so much; of which the only
irradiation is the cause; for if we divest it of the adventitious
rayes, we shall find it exactly augmented with the due proportion:
but to take away the capillitious border,<note place="margin">The <hi>Telescope</hi> is the best means to take away the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiations of the Stars.</note> the Telescope is the best

and <hi>Iupiter</hi> to G, in opposition to the Sun, it shall be visible in
the Zodiack at V, and much returned backwards by all the arch

while crouding close together, another while dissevering, and
some dividing themselves into many and very much changing fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
which, for the most part, are very unusual. And albeit
those so inconstant mutations did somewhat alter the primary pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riodick
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:96976:168"/>
course of the said spots, yet did they not alter the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our friend, so as to make him believe, that they were any
essential and fixed cause of those deviations, but he continued to
hold, that all the apparent alterations derived themselves from
those accidental mutations: in like manner, just as it would hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to one that should from far distant Regions observe the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Clouds; which would be discovered to move with a
most swift, great, and constant motion, carried round by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal
<hi>Vertigo</hi> of the Earth (if haply that motion belong to the
same) in twenty four hours, by circles parallel to the Equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
but yet altered, in part, by the accidental motions caused by
the winds, which drive them, at all adventures, towards different
quarters of the World. While this was in agitation, it came to
pass that <hi>Velserus</hi> sent him two Letters, written by a certain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
under the feigned name of<note n="*" place="margin">This Authors true name is <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stopher Scheinerus</hi> a Jesuit, and his Book here meant is intituled, <hi>Apel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les post tabulam.</hi>

                           <hi>Apelles,</hi> upon the subject of
these Spots, requesting him, with importunity, to declare his
thoughts freely upon those Letters, and withall to let him know
what his opinion was touching the essence of those spots; which his
request he satisfied in 3 Letters, shewing first of all howvain the
conjectures of <hi>Apelles</hi> were; &amp; discovering, secondly, his own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
withal foretelling to him, that <hi>Apelles</hi> would undoubtedly
be better advised in time, and turn to his opinion, as it afterwards
came to pass. And because that our Academian (as it was also
the judgment of many others that were intelligent in Natures se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets)
thought he had in those three Letters investigated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated,
if not all that could be desired, or required by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
curiosity, at least all that could be attained by humane
reason in such a matter, he, for some time (being bufied in other
studies) intermitted his continual observations, and onely in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency
to some friend, joyned with him, in making now and
then an abrupt observation: till that he, and after some years,

of the whole progresse of the said spot, carefully marking
upon a sheet of paper the places that it was in every day at the
time of the Suns coming into the Meridian; and we having found
that its course was not in a right line, but somewhat incurvated,
we came to resolve, at last, to make other observations from time
to time; to which undertaking we were strongly induced by a
conceit, that accidentally came into the minde of my Guest,
which he imparted to me in these or the like words.</p>
                        <p>In my opinion, <hi>Philip,</hi> there is a way opened to a business of
very great consequence. For if the Axis about which the Sun
turneth be not erect perpendicularly to the plane of the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:96976:169"/>
                           <note place="margin">A conceipt that came suddenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the minde of the Academian <hi>Lyncaeus</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed upon the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Solar spots.</note> but is inclined upon the same, as its crooked course, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
now observed, makes me believe, we shall be able to make
such conjectures of the states of the Sun and Earth, as neither so
solid or so rational have been hitherto deduced from any other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
whatsoever. I being awakened at so great a promise, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portun'd
him to make a free discovery of his conceit unto me.
And he continued his discourse to this purpose.<note place="margin">Extravagant mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the motions of the spots, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen by the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demick, in case the Earth had the annual motion.</note> If the Earths
motion were along the Ecliptique about the Sun; and the Sun
were constituted in the centre of the said Ecliptick, and therein
revolved in its self, not about the Axis of the said Ecliptique
(which would be the Axis of the Earths annual motion) but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one inclined, it must needs follow, that strange changes will
represent themselves to us in the apparent motions of the Solar
spots, although the said Axis of the Sun should be supposed to
persist perpetually and immutably in the same inclination, and in
one and the same direction towards the self-same point of the
Universe. Therefore the Terrestrial Globe in the annual motion
moving round it, it will first follow, that to us, carried about by
the same, the courses of the spots shall sometimes seem to be
made in right lines, but this only twice a year, and at all other
times shall appear to be made by arches insensibly incurvated.
Secondly, the curvity of those arches for one half of the year,
will shew inclined the contrary way to what they will appear in
the other half; that is, for six moneths the convexity of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
shall be towards the upper part of the Solar <hi>Discus,</hi> and for
the other six moneths towards the inferiour. Thirdly, the spots be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to appear, and (if I may so speak) to rise to our eye from
the left side of the Solar <hi>Discus,</hi> and going to hide themselves
and to set in the right side, the Oriental termes, that is, of their
first appearings for six moneths, shall be lower than the opposite
termes of their occultations; and for other six moneths it shall
happen contrarily, to wit, that the said spots rising from more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levated
points, and from them descending, they shall, in their
courses, go and hide themselves in lower points; and onely for
two dayes in all the year shall those termes of risings and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
be equilibrated: after which freely beginning by small de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
the inclination of the courses of the spots, and day by day
growing bigger, in three moneths, it shall arrive at its greatest
obliquity, and from thence beginning to diminish, in such another
time it shall reduce it self to the other <hi>Aequilibrium.</hi> It shall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
for a fourth wonder, that the course of the greatest obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
shall be the same with the course made by the right line,
and in the day of the Libration the arch of the course shall seem
more than ever incurvated. Again, in the other times, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as the pendency shall successively diminish, and make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:96976:169"/>
towards the <hi>Aequilibrium,</hi> the incurvation of the arches
of the courses on the contrary shall, by degrees, increase.</p>

to form any distinct conceit of so much as one of these conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

                        <p>The same that befalls you, befell me also, whilst my
Guest transported me with bare words; who afterwards assisted
my capacity,<note place="margin">The first Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the motion of the Solar spots; and consequently all the rest explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> by describing the businesse upon a material Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which was no other than a simple Sphere, making use of
some of its circles, but to a different purpose from that, to which
they are commonly applied. Now I will supply the defect of
the Sphere, by drawing the same upon a piece of paper, as need
shall require. And to represent the first accident by me propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
which was, that the courses or journeys of the spots, twice
a year, and no more, might be seen to be made in right lines, let
us suppose this point O <hi>[in Fig. 4.]</hi> to be the centre of the grand
Orb, or, if you will, of the Ecliptick, and likewise also of the
Globe of the Sun it self; of which, by reason of the great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
that is between it and the Earth, we that live upon the
Earth, may suppose that we see the one half: we will therefore
describe this circle ABCD about the said centre O, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth
unto us the extream term that divideth and separates the
Hemisphere of the Sun that is apparent to us, from the other that
is occult. And because that our eye, no lesse than the centre of
the Earth, is understood to be in the plane of the Ecliptick, in
which is likewise the centre of the Sun, therefore, if we should
fancy to our selves the body of the Sun to be cut thorow by the
said plane, the section will appear to our eye a right line, which
let be BOD, and upon that a perpendicular being let fall AOC,
it shall be the Axis of the said Ecliptick, and of the annual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Terrestrial Globe. Let us next suppose the Solar body
(without changing centre) to revolve in it self, not about the
Axis AOC (which is the erect Axis upon the plane of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliptick)
but about one somewhat inclined, which let be this
EOI, the which fixed and unchangeable Axis maintaineth it self
perpetually in the same inclination and direction towards the
same points of the Firmament, and of the Universe. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
in the revolutions of the Solar Globe, each point of its su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies
(the Poles excepted) describeth the circumference of a
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:96976:170"/>
circle, either bigger or lesser, according as it is more or lesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from the said Poles, let us take the point F, equally distant
from them, and draw the diameter FOG, which shall be perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular
to the Axis EI, and shall be the diameter of the grand
circle described about the Poles EI. Supposing not that the
Earth, and we with her be in such a place of the Ecliptick, that
the Hemisphere of the Sun to us apparent is determin'd or bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the circle ABCD, which passing (as it alwayes doth) by
the Poles AC, passeth also by EI. It is manifest, that the grand
circle, whose diameter is FG, shall be erect to the circle ABCD,
to which the ray that from our eye falleth upon the centre O, is
perpendicular; so that the said ray falleth upon the plane of
the circle, whose diameter is FG, and therefore its circumference
will appear to us a right line, and the self same with FG, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
if there should be in the point F, a spot, it comming after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to be carried about by the Solar conversion, would, upon
the surface of the Sun, trace out the circumference of that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
which seems to us a right line. Its course or passage will
therefore seem straight. And straight also will the motion of the
other spots appear, which in the said revolution shall describe les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
circles, as being all parallel to the greater, and to our eye
placed at an immense distance from them. Now, if you do but
consider, how that after the Earth shall in six moneths have run
thorow half the grand Orb, and shall be situate opposite to that
Hemisphere of the Sun, which is now occult unto us, so as that
the boundary of the part that then shall be seen, may be the self
same ABCD, which also shall passe by the Poles EI; you
shall understand that the same will evene in the courses of the
spots, as before, to wit, that all will appear to be made by right
lines. But because that that accident takes not place, save one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when the teminator or boundary passeth by the Poles EI,
and the said terminator from moment to moment, by meanes of
the Earths annual motion, continually altereth, therefore its pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
by the fixed Poles EI, shall be momentary, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
momentary shall be the time, in which the motions of those
spots shall appear straight. From what hath been hitherto spoken
one may comprehend also how that the apparition and beginning
of the motion of the spots from the part F, proceeding towards
G, their passages or courses are from the left hand, ascending to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the right; but the Earth being placed in the part diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically
opposite the appearance of the spots about G, shall still
be to the left hand of the beholder, but the passage shall be des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
towards the right hand F. Let us now describe the Earth
to be situate one fourth part farther distant from its present state,
and let us draw, as in the other figure, the terminator ABCD,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:96976:170"/>
                           <hi>[as in Fig. 5.]</hi> and the Axis, as before AC, by which the plane
of our Meridian would passe, in which plane should also be the
Axis of the Suns revolution, with its Poles, one towards us, that
is, in the apparent Hemisphere, which Pole we will represent by
the point E, and the other shall fall in the occult Hemisphere,
and I mark it I. Inclining therefore the Axis EI, with the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
part E, towards us, the great circle described by the Suns
conversion, shall be this BFDG, whose half by us seen, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
BFD, shall no longer seem unto us a right line, by reason the
Poles EI are not in the circumference ABCD, but shall appear
incurvated, and with its convexity towards the inferiour part C.
And it is manifest, that the same will appear in all the lesser cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
parallel to the same BFD. It is to be understood also, that
when the Earth shall be diametrically opposite to this state, so
that it seeth the other Hemisphere of the Sun, which now is hid,
it shall of the said great circle behold the part DGB incurved,
with its convexity towards the superiour part A; and the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the spots in these constitutions shall be first, by the arch
BFD, and afterwards by the other DGB, and the first appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and ultimate occultations made about the points B and D,
shall be equilibrated, and not those that are more or lesse eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
than these. But if we constitute the Earth in such a place
of the Ecliptick, that neither the boundary ABCD, nor the
Meridian AC, passeth by the Poles of the Axis EI, as I will shew
you anon, drawing this other Figure <hi>[viz. Fig. 6.]</hi> wherein the
apparent or visible Pole E falleth between the arch of the termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator
AB, and the section of the Meridian AC; the diameter
of the great circle shall be FOG, and the apparent semicircle
FNG, and the occult semicircle GSF, the one incurvated with
its convexity N towards the inferiour part, and the other also
bending with its convexity S towards the upper part of the Sun.
The ingressions and exitions of the spots, that is, the termes F
and G shall not be librated, as the two others B and D; but F
shall be lower, and G higher: but yet with lesser difference
than in the first Figure. The arch also FNG shall be incurva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but not so much as the precedent BFD; so that in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
the passages or motions of the spots shall be ascendent
from the left side F, towards the right G, and shall be made by
curved lines. And imagining the Earth to be constituted in the
position diametrically opposite; so that the Hemisphere of the
Sun, which was before the occult, may be the apparent, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
by the same boundary ABCD, it will be manifestly
discerned, that the course of the spots shall be by the arch GSF,
beginning from the upper point G, which shall then be likewise
from the left hand of the beholder, and going to determine, des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:96976:171"/>
towards the right, in the point F. What I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
said, being understood, I believe that there remains no
difficulty in conceiving how from the passing of the terminator of
the Solar Hemispheres by the Poles of the Suns conversion, or
neer or far from the same, do arise all the differences in the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
courses of the spots; so that by how much the more those Poles
shall be remote from the said terminator, by so much the more shall
those courses be incurvated, and lesse oblique; whereupon at
the same distance, that is, when those Poles are in the section of
the Meridian, the incurvation is reduced to the greatest, but the
obliquity to the least, that is to <hi>Aequilibrium,</hi> as the second of
these three last figures <hi>[viz. Fig. 5.]</hi> demonstrateth. On the
contrary, when the Poles are in the terminator, as the first of
these three figures <hi>[viz. Fig. 4.]</hi> sheweth the inclination is at
the greatest, but the incurvation at the least, and reduced to
rectitude. The terminator departing from the Poles, the curvity
begins to grow sensible, the obliquity all the way encreasing,
and the inclination growing lesser.</p>
                        <p>These are those admirable and extravagant mutations, that my
Guest told me would from time to time appear in the progresses
of the Solar spots, if so be it should be true that the annual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
belonged to the Earth, and that the Sun being constituted
in the centre of the Ecliptick, were revolved in it self upon an
Axis, not erect, but inclined to the Plane of the said Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</p>

follow that arguing <hi>per conversum,</hi> from finding such like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual

Earth to move by the circumference, and the Sun to be placed

like irregularities may not as well be visible in the Sun, it being
moveable by the Ecliptick, to the inhabitants of the Earth, it
being also immoveable in the centre of the same? Unlesse you
demonstrate to me, that there can be no reason given for that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,

circumference let the center of the Sun be placed; it is necessary
that of all the differences that are seen in those motions, the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
do reside in the motions that are in the body of the Sun:
Which in the first place must necessarily revolve in it self (<hi>i. e.</hi>
about its own axis) carrying the spots along therewith;<note place="margin">If the Earth be immoveable in the centre of the Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack, there must be ascribed to the Sun four several moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as is declared at length.</note> which
spots have been supposed, yea and proved to adhere to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
superficies. It must secondly be confest, that the Axis of the
Solar conversion is not parallel to the Axis of the Ecliptick, that
is as much as to say, that it is not perpendicularly erected upon
the Plane of the Ecliptick, because if it were so, the courses and
exitions of those spots would seem to be made by right lines pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
to the Ecliptick. The said Axis therefore is inclining, in
regard the said courses are for the most part made by curve lines.
It will be necessary in the third place to grant that the inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this Axis is not fixed, and continually extended towards
one and the same point of the Universe, but rather that it doth
alwayes from moment to moment go changing its direction; for
if the pendency should always look towards the self same point,
the courses of the spots would never change appearance; but
appearing at one time either right or curved, bending upwards
or downwards, ascending or descending, they would appear
the same at all times. It is therefore necessary to say, that the
said Axis is convertible; and is sometimes found to be in the
Plane of the circle that is extreme, terminate, or of the visible
Hemisphere, I mean at such time as the courses of the spots
seem to be made in right lines, and more than ever pendent,
which happeneth twice a year; and at other times found to be in
the Plane of the Meridian of the Observator, in such sort that
one of its Poles falleth in the visible Hemisphere of the Sun, and
the other in the occult; and both of them remote from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
points, or we may say, from the poles of another Axis of
the Sun, which is parallel to the Axis of the Ecliptick; (which
second Axis must necessarily be assigned to the Solar Globe) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote,
I say, as far as the inclination of the Axis of the revolution
of the spots doth import; and moreover that the Pole falling in
the apparent Hemisphere, is one while in the superiour, another
while in the inferiour part thereof; for that it must be so, the
courses themselves do manifestly evince at such time as they are
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:96976:172"/>
equilibrated, and in their greatest curvity, one while with
their convexity towards the upper part, and another while
towards the lower part of the Solar <hi>Discus.</hi> And because
those positions are in continuall alteration, making the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
and incurvations now greater, now lesser, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
reduce themselves, the first sort to perfect libration, and
the second to perfect perpendicularity, it is necessary to assert that
the self same Axis of the monethly revolution of the spots hath
a particular revolution of its own, whereby its Poles describe
two circles about the Poles of another Axis, which for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
ought (as I have said) to be assigned to the Sun, the semidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter
of which circles answereth to the quantity of the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the said Axis. And it is necessary, that the time of its
Period be a year; for that such is the time in which all the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
and differences in the courses of the spots do return.
And that the revolution of this Axis, is made about the Poles of
the other Axis parallel to that of the Ecliptick, &amp; not about other
points, the greatest inclinations and greatest incurvations, which
are always of the same bigness, do clearly prove. So that finally, to
maintain the Earth fixed in the centre, it will be necessary to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to the Sun, two motions about its own centre, upon two seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Axes, one of which finisheth its conversion in a year, and the
other in lesse than a moneth; which assumption seemeth, to my
understanding, very hard, and almost impossible; and this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth
on the necessity of ascribing to the said Solar body two
other motions about the Earth upon different Axes, describing
with one the Ecliptick in a year, and with the other forming spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
or circles parallel to the Equinoctial one every day:
whereupon that third motion which ought to be assigned to the
Solar Clobe about its own centre (I mean not that almost
monethly, which carrieth the spots about, but I speak of that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which ought to passe thorow the Axis and Poles of this
monethly one) ought not, for any reason that I see, to finish its
Period rather in a year, as depending on the annual motion by
the Ecliptick, than in twenty four hours, as depending on the
diurnal motion upon the Poles of the Equinoctial. I know, that
what I now speak is very obscure, but I shall make it plain unto
you, when we come to speak of the third motion annual, assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Copernicus,</hi> to the Earth. Now if these four motions, so
incongruous with each other, (all which it would be necessary to
assign to the self same body of the Sun) may be reduced to one
sole and simple motion, assigned the Sun upon an Axis that never
changeth position, and that without innovating any thing in the
motions for so many other causes assigned to the Terrestrial
Globe, may so easily salve so many extravagant appearances in
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:96976:173"/>
the motions of the Solar spots, it seemeth really that such an
Hypothesis ought not to be rejected.</p>

as humane reason is permitted to penetrate, confining my self

say a little more resolutely than <hi>Simplicius</hi> doth, that amongst
all the ingenuous subtilties I ever heard, I have never met with
any thing of greater admiration to my intellect, nor that hath
more absolutely captivated my judgment, (alwayes excepting
pure Geometrical and Arithmetical Demonstrations) than these
two conjectures taken, the one from the stations and retrograda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the five Planets, and the other from these irregularities of
the motions of the Solar spots: and because they seem to me so
easily and clearly to assign the true reason of so extravagant ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances,
shewing as if they were but one sole simple motion,
mixed with so many others, simple likewise, but different from
each other, without introducing any difficulty, rather with obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
those that accompany the other Hypothesis; I am think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

reasons, which, for the one and other Systeme, may be produced

be false, it is a thing impossible that (alwayes confining our selves

the true Hypothesis should not manifest themselves as concludent

                        <p>The supputation is easie and short. The Diameter of
the Sun,<note place="margin">The computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the fixed Stars, in respect to the grand Orb.</note> is eleven semidiameters of the Earth, and the Diameter
of the grand Orb, contains 2416. of those same semidiameters,
by the ascent of both parties; so that the Diameter of the said
Orb, contains the Suns Diameter 220. times very near. And
because the Spheres are to one another, as the Cubes of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameters,
let us make the Cube of 220. which is 106480000. and
we shall have the grand Orb, an hundred and six millions, four
hundred and eighty thousand times bigger than the Sun, to which
grand Orb, a star of the sixth magnitude, ought to be equal, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

that arbitrarily, and as we say, with the eye, some one of the
more antient of them pronounced the thing to be so and so, and
that all that followed him afterwards, without more ado, kept
close to what the first had said; for if any one of them had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied

doubtlesse have discovered the fraud.</p>

shewing the <hi>Discus</hi> of the Star naked, and magnified an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
or a thousand times, rendereth the operation much more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
but the same thing may be done, although not altogether so
exactly, without the Instrument, and I have many times done
the same, and my method therein was this. I have caused a rope
to be hanged towards some Star,<note place="margin">A way to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the apparent diameter of a star.</note> and I have made use of the
Constellation, called the <hi>Harp,</hi> which riseth between the North
and<note n="*" place="margin">Rendred in Latine <hi>Corum,</hi> that is to say, North-west.</note> North-east, and then by going towards, and from
the said rope, interposed between me and the Star, I have found
the place from whence the thicknesse of the rope hath just hid
the Star from me: this done, I have taken the distance from the
eye to the rope, which was one of the sides including the angle
that was composed in the eye, and<note n="*" place="margin">

angle in the Starry Sphere, that insisteth upon the diameter of
the Star, and by the proportion of the ropes thicknesse to the
distance from the eye to the rope, by the table of Arches and
Chords, I have immediately found the quantity of the angle; u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
all the while the wonted caution that is observed in taking
angles so acute, not to forme the concourse of the visive rayes
in the centre of the eye, where they are onely refracted, but
beyond the eye, where really the pupils greatnesse maketh them
to concur.</p>

have a kind of haesitancy touching the same, but that which most
puzzleth me is, that in this operation, if it be made in the dark

                        <p>Not so, Sir, for the rope in covering the naked body
of the Star, taketh away the rayes, which belong not to it, but
to our eye, of which it is deprived so soon as the true <hi>Discus</hi>
thereof is hid; and in making the observation, you shall see, how
unexpectedly a little cord will cover that reasonable big body of
light, which seemed impossible to be hid, unlesse it were with a
much broader Screene: to measure, in the next place, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly
to find out, how many of those thicknesses of the rope inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in the distance between the said rope and the eye, I take not
onely one diameter of the rope, but laying many pieces of the
same together upon a Table, so that they touch, I take with a
pair of Compasses the whole space occupied by fifteen, or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

before with another smaller cord taken from the rope to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course

                        <p>I see and comprehend this very well, but before we
passe any further, I would propound the doubt that ariseth in
me in the finding the concourse [or intersection] of the visual
rayes beyond the eye, when observation is made of objects com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
between very acute angles; and my scruple proceeds
from thinking, that the said concourse may be sometimes more
remote, and sometimes lesse; and this not so much, by meanes
of the greater or lesser magnitude of the object that is beheld, as
because that in observing objects of the same bignesse, it seems
to me that the concourse of the rayes, for certain other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:96976:176"/>
ought to be made more and lesse remote from the eye.</p>

                        <p>I see already, whither the apprehension of <hi>Sagredus,</hi>
a most diligent observer of Natures secrets, tendeth; and I
would lay any wager,<note place="margin">The circle of the pupil of the eye en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largeth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracteth.</note> that amongst the thousands that have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
Cats to contract and inlarge the pupils of their eyes very
much, there are not two, nor haply one that hath observed the
like effect to be wrought by the pupils of men in seeing, whilst
the <hi>medium</hi> is much or little illumin'd, and that in the open light
the circlet of the pupil diminisheth considerably: so that in loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
upon the face or <hi>Discus</hi> of the Sun, it is reduced to a small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
lesser than a grain of<note n="*" place="margin">

                           <hi>Panick,</hi> and in beholding objects
that do not shine, and are in a lesse luminous <hi>medium,</hi> it is inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to the bignesse of a Lintel or more; and in summe this
expansion and contraction differeth in more than decuple pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion:
From whence it is manifest, that when the pupil is
much dilated, it is necessary that the angle of the rayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
be more remote from the eye; which happeneth in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
objects little luminated. This is a Doctrine which <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredus</hi>
hath, just now, given me the hint of, whereby, if we
were to make a very exact observation, and of great conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
we are advertized to make the observation of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
in the act of the same, or just such another operation; but
in this our case, wherein we are to shew the errour of <hi>Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,</hi>
this accuratenesse is not necessary: for though we should,
in favour of the contrary party, suppose the said concourse to be
made upon the pupil it self, it would import little, their mistake
being so great. I am not certain, <hi>Sagredus,</hi> that this would have
been your objection.</p>

                        <p>The method is very easie, and this it is, I take two

the black half as broad as the white; then I stick up the white a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a wall, and far from that I place the other upon a stick, or
other support, at a distance of fifteen or twenty yards, and rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
from this, second another such a space in the same right line,
it is very manifest, that at the said distance the right lines will
concur, that departing from the termes of the breadth of the
white piece, shall passe close by the edges of the other label pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the mid-way; whence it followeth, that in case the eye
were placed in the point of the said concourse or intersection,
the black slip of paper in the midst would precisely hide the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:96976:177"/>
blank, if the sight were made in one onely point; but if we
should find, that the edges of the white cartel appear discovered,
it shall be a necessary argument that the visual rayes do not issue
from one sole point. And to make the white label to be hid by
the black, it will be requisite to draw neerer with the eye:
Therefore, having approached so neer, that the intermediate la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
covereth the other, and noted how much the required ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proximation
was, the quantity of that approach shall be the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
measure, how much the true concourse of the visive rayes, is
remote from the eye in the said operation, and we shall moreover
have the diameter of the pupil, or of that circlet from whence
the visive rayes proceed: for it shall be to the breadth of the
black paper, as is the distance from the concourse of the lines,
that are produced by the edges of the papers to the place where
the eye standeth, when it first seeth the remote paper to be hid
by the intermediate one, as that distance is, I say, to the distance
that is between those two papers. And therefore when we
would, with exactnesse, measure the apparent diameter of a Star,
having made the observation in manner, as aforesaid, it would be
necessary to compare the diameter of the rope to the diameter of
the pupil; and having found <hi>v. g.</hi> the diameter of the rope to be
quadruple to that of the pupil, and the distance of the eye from
the rope to be, for example, thirty yards, we would say, that the
true concourse of the lines produced from the ends or extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the diameter of the star, by the extremities of the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter
of the rope, doth fall out to be fourty yards remote from
the said rope, for so we shall have observed, as we ought, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
between the distance of the rope from the concourse of
the said lines, and the distance from the said concourse to the
place of the eye, which ought to be the same that is between
the diameter of the rope, and diameter of the pupil.</p>

not think it weakened so, as that it hath not strength enough left

chief and ultimate conclusion, in case, the stars of the sixth mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude
were supposed to be as big as the Sun, (which yet I can
hardly think) yet it would still be true, that the grand Orb [or
Ecliptick] would occasion a mutation and variation in the starry
Sphere, like to that which the semidiameter of the Earth produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth

saying, if the Orb of <hi>Saturn,</hi> by reason it is nine times bigger

Orb, which should be full five times bigger than that, which even
now we computed it to be, in case that a fixed Star of the sixth

and can no longer form a conceipt of the same, so it
happens also in comprehending immense magnitudes and distan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
so that there intervenes to the comprehension an effect like
to that which befalleth the sense; For whilest that in a serene
night I look towards the Stars, I judge, according to sense, that
their distance is but a few miles, and that the fixed Stars are not a
jot more remote than <hi>Jupiter</hi> or <hi>Saturn,</hi> nay than the Moon.

between the Astronomers and Peripatetick Philosophers, upon

placing them amongst the fixed Stars, and the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
believing them to be below the Moon. So unable is our
sense to distinguish great distances from the greatest, though these
be in reality many thousand times greater than those. In a word,
I ask of thee, O foolish man! Doth thy imagination comprehend

Heaven may in greatnesse surpasse our imagination, as also that
God might have created it thousands of times vaster than now it

to what purpose is it to interpose afterwards between the sublime

whilst we will have it, that the onely care of us, is the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aequate
work, and bound, beyond which the Divine Wisdome
and Power doth, or disposeth of nothing. But I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
that we should so much shorten its hand, but desire that we
may content our selves with an assurance that God and Nature
are so imployed in the governing of humane affairs,<note place="margin">God &amp; Nature do imploy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in caring for men, as if they minded nothing else.</note> that they
could not more apply themselves thereto, although they had no

so, that it could not be more intense, if the sum of all its business
had been the only maturation of that grape. Now if this grape
receiveth all that it is possible for it to receive from the Sun, not
suffering the least injury by the Suns production of a thousand
other effects at the same time; it would be either envy or folly
to blame that grape, if it should think or wish that the Sun would
onely appropriate its rayes to its advantage. I am confident that
nothing is omitted by the Divine Providence, of what concernes
the government of humane affairs; but that there may not be
other things in the Universe, that depend upon the same infinite
Wisdome, I cannot, of my self, by what my reason holds forth
to me, bring my self to believe. However, if it were not so,
yet should I not forbear to believe the reasons laid before me by

should tell me, that an immense space interposed between the
Orbs of the Planets and the Starry Sphere, deprived of stars and
idle, would be vain and uselesse, as likewise that so great an
immensity for receipt of the fixed stars, as exceeds our utmost
comprehension would be superfluous, I would reply, that it is

Returning therefore to our natural and humane disquisitions, I
say,<note place="margin">Great, small, immense, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are relative terms.</note> that great, little, immense, small, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not absolute,

in relation to what the Starry Sphere of <hi>Copernicus</hi> may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
over vast. In my judgment it cannot be compared, or said
to be such, unlesse it be in relation to some other thing of the

fixed stars for its receptacle so great a part of the Worlds space,
it would be necessary to make the Orb wherein such innumerable

                        <p>I conceive by the questions which this person asketh,
that one may collect,<note place="margin">Answers to the interrogatories of the said Authour.</note> that in case the Heavens, the Stars, and
the quantity of their distances and magnitudes which he hath
hitherto held, be let alone, (although he never certainly fancied
to himself any conceivable magnitude thereof) he perfectly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
and comprehends the benefits that flow from thence to the
Earth, which is no longer an inconsiderable thing; nor are they
any longer so remote as to appeare so very small, but big enough to
be able to operate on the Earth; and that the distance between
them and <hi>Saturn</hi> is very well proportioned, and that he, for all
these things, hath very probable reasons; of which I would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have heard some one:<note place="margin">The Authour of the Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons confound and contradicts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in his interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</note> but being that in these few words he
confounds and contradicts himself, it maketh me think that he
is very poor and ill furnished with those probable reasons, and
that those which he calls reasons, are rather fallacies, or dreams
of an over-weening fancy. For I ask of him, whether these Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
bodies truly operate on the Earth,<note place="margin">Interrogatories put to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions, by which the weaknesse of his is made appear.</note> and whether for the
working of those effects they were produced of such and such
magnitudes, and disposed at such and such distances, or else
whether they have nothing at all to do with Terrene mattets. If
they have nothing to do with the Earth; it is a great folly for us
that are Earth-born, to offer to make our selves arbitrators of
their magnitudes, and regulators of their local dispositions, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that we are altogether ignorant of their whole businesse and
concerns; but if he shall say that they do operate, and that they
are directed to this end, he doth affirm the same thing which a
little before he denied, and praiseth that which even now he
condemned, in that he said, that the Celestial bodies situate so
far remote as that they appear very small, cannot have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
at all upon the Earth. But, good Sir, in the Starry Sphere
pre-established at its present distance, and which you did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
to be in your judgment, well proportioned to have an
influence upon these Terrene bodies, many stars appear very
small, and an hundred times as many more are wholly invisible
unto us (which is an appearing yet lesse than very small)
therefore it is necessary that (contradicting your self) you do
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:96976:180"/>
now deny their operation upon the Earth; or else that (still
contradicting your self) you grant that their appearing very small
doth not in the least lessen their influence; or else that (and this
shall be a more sincere and modest concession) you acknowledg
and freely confesse, that our passing judgment upon their mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudes
and distances is a vanity, not to say presumption or
rashnesse.</p>

perceive the manifest contradiction, in saying, that the Stars (if

not operate on the Earth, and not perceiving that he had granted
an influence upon the Earth to those of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and his secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,

                        <p>But I proceed to another consideration: What is the
reason, doth he say, why the stars appear so little? Is it haply,
because they seem so to us?<note place="margin">That remote ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects appeare so small, is the defect of the eye, as is demonstrated.</note> Doth not he know, that this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
from the Instrument that we imploy in beholding them, to
wit, from our eye? And that this is true, by changing Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
we shall see them bigger and bigger, as much as we will.
And who knows but that to the Earth, which beholdeth them
without eyes, they may not shew very great, and such as in reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
they are? But it's time that, omitting these trifles, we come
to things of more moment; and therefore I having already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
these two things: First, how far off the Firmament
ought to be placed to make, that the grand Orb causeth no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
difference than that which the Terrestrial Orb occasioneth in
the remotenesse of the Sun; And next, how likewise to make
that a star of the Firmament appear to us of the same bignesse,
as now we see it, it is not necessary to suppose it bigger than the
Sun; I would know whether <hi>Tycho,</hi> or any of his adherents hath
ever attempted to find out, by any means, whether any appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
be to be discovered in the starry Sphere, upon which one

any of them do know what alteration the Earths annual motion
ought to produce in the fixed stars, in case the starry Sphere were
not so far distant, as that in them the said diversity, by reason of
its minuity dis-appeareth; for their surceasing that inquisition,
and referring themselves to the meer assertion of <hi>Copernicus,</hi>

that he either for want of Instruments, or for some other defect
hath not known; and yet he proceeding upon other solid and
rational conjectures, affirmeth that, which the things by him not
discovered do seem to contradict: for, as hath been said already,
without the Telescope, neither could <hi>Mars</hi> be discerned to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease

as the Earth in such a time, by such a space as is the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter
of the grand Orb, retireth one while towards the North, and
another while towards the South; and yet it seemed to him reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
yea necessary, that we, following the Earth, when we were
towards the North should have the Pole more elevated than when
we are towards the South. In this very error did one fall that was
otherwise a very skilful Mathematician, &amp; a follower of <hi>Copernic.</hi>
as <hi>Tycho</hi> relateth in his<note n="*" place="margin">Christophorus Rothmannus.</note>

had observed the Polar altitude to vary, and to differ in Summer
from what it is in Winter: and because <hi>Tycho</hi> denieth the merit
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:96976:181"/>

is, denieth that there is any mutation to be seen in the altitude of
the Pole, but doth not blame the inquisition, for not being adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the finding of what is sought, he thereby sheweth, that he
also esteeemed the Polar altitude varied, or not varied every six
moneths, to be a good testimony to disprove or inferre the annual
motion of the Earth.</p>

                        <p>In truth, <hi>Salviatus,</hi> my opinion also tells me, that the
same must necessarily ensue: for I do not think that you will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
me, but that if we walk only 60. miles towards the North,
the Pole will rise unto us a degree higher, and that if we move
60. miles farther Northwards, the Pole will be elevated to us a
degree more, &amp;c. Now if the approaching or receding 60. miles
onely, make so notable a change in the Polar altitudes, what
alteration would follow, if the Earth and we with it, should
be transported, I will not say 60. miles, but 60. thousand miles
that way.</p>

                        <p>It would follow (if it should proceed in the same
proportion) that the Pole shall be elevated a thousand degrees.
See, <hi>Simplicius,</hi> what a long rooted opinion can do. Yea, by
reason you have fixed it in your mind for so many years, that it
is Heaven, that revolveth in twenty four hours, and not the
Earth, and that consequently the Poles of that Revolution are in
Heaven, and not in the Terrestrial Globe, cannot now, in an
hours time shake off this habituated conceipt, and take up the
contrary, fancying to your self, that the Earth is that which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,
only for so long time as may suffice to conceive of what
would follow, thereupon should that lye be a truth. If the Earth
<hi>Simplicius,</hi> be that which moveth in its self in twenty four hours,
in it are the Poles, in it is the Axis, in it is the Equinoctial, that
is, the grand Circle, described by the point, equidistant from the
Poles, in it are the infinite Parallels bigger and lesser described by
the points of the superficies more and lesse distant from the Poles,
in it are all these things, and not in the starry Sphere, which, as
being immoveable, wants them all, and can only by the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be conceived to be therein, prolonging the Axis of the Earth
so far, till that determining, it shall mark out two points placed
right over our Poles, and the plane of the Equinoctial being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
it shall describe in Heaven a circle like it self. Now if the
true Axis, the true Poles, the true Equinoctial, do not change
in the Earth so long as you continue in the same place of the
Earth, and though the Earth be transported, as you do please,
yet you shall not change your habitude either to the Poles, or to
the circles, or to any other Earthly thing; and this because, that

Tis true those points in Heaven do change, when the Earths tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sportment
is made after such a manner, that its Axis cometh to
passe by other and other points of the immoveable Celestial
Sphere, but our habitude thereunto changeth not, so as that the
second should be more elevated to us than the first. If any one
will have one of the points of the Firmament, which do answer
to the Poles of the Earth to ascend, and the other to descend,
he must walk along the Earth towards the one, receding from the
other, for the transportment of the Earth, and with it us our
selves, (as I told you before) operates nothing at all.</p>

not the star, but the point of the Firmament that lyeth in a right

that the right line is the same with the circumference of an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite

to the consideration of <hi>Simplicius,</hi> how the accession and
recession that the Earth makes from the said fixed star which is
neer the Pole can be made as it were by a right line, for such is
the Diameter of the Grand Orb, so that the attempting to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate
the elevation and depression of the Polar star by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
along the said Diameter, as if it were by the motion about
the little circle of the Earth, is a great argument of but little

at least very difficult to be resolved.</p>

                        <p>The stresse and strength of the knot rendereth the
solution thereof more commendable and admirable; but I do
not promise you the same at this time, and pray you to dispense
with me therein till too morrow, and for the present we will go
considering and explaining those mutations and differences that
by means of the annual motion ought to be discerned in the fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
stars, like as even now we said, for the explication whereof
certain preparatory points offer themselves, which may facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the answer to the grand objection. Now reassuming the
two motions ascribed to the Earth (two I say, for the third is
no motion, as in its place I will declare) that is the annual and
diurnal,<note place="margin">The annual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made by the centre of the Earth under the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and the diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal motion made by the Earth about its own centre.</note> the first is to be understood to be made by the centre of
the Earth in or about the circumference of the grand Orb, that
is of a very great circle described in the plain of the fixed and
immutable Ecliptick; the other, namely the diurnal, is made
by the Globe of the Earth in it self about its own centre, and
own Axis, not erect, but inclined to the Plane of the Ecliptick,
with the inclination of 23. degrees and an half, or thereabouts,
the which inclination is maintained all the year about, and that
which ought especially to be observed, is alwayes situate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the same point of Heaven:<note place="margin">The axis of the Earth continueth alwayes parallel to it self, and descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth a Cylindrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal superficies, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to the grand Orb.</note> in so much that the Axis of the
diurnal motion doth alwayes remain parallel to it self; so that
if we imagine that same Axis to be continued out until it reach
the fixed stars, whilst the centre of the Earth is encircling the
whole Ecliptick in a year, the said Axis describeth the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:96976:184"/>
of an oblique Cylinder, which hath for one of its bases
the said annual circle, and for the other a like circle imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
described by its extremity, or, (if you will) Pole, amongst
the fixed stars. And this same cylinder is oblique to the Plane of
the Ecliptick, according to the inclination of the Axis that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth
it, which we have said to be 23 degrees and an half,
the which continuing perpetually the same (save onely, that in
many thousands of years it maketh some very small mutation,
which nothing importeth in our present businesse) causeth that
the Terrestrial Globe doth never more incline or elevate,<note place="margin">The Orb of the Earth never incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, but is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutably the same.</note> but
still conserveth the same state without mutation. From whence
ensueth, that as to what pertaineth to the mutations to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in the fixed stars dependant on the sole annual motion,
the same shall happen to any point whatsoever of the Earths
surface, as befalleth unto the centre of the Earth it self; and
therefore in the present explanations we will make use of the
centre, as if it were any whatsoever point of the superficies.
And for a more facile understanding of the whole,<note place="margin">The fixed stars placed in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliptick never ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate nor descend, on account of the annual motion, but yet approach and recede.</note> let us design
the same in lineal figures: And first of all let us describe in the
Plane of the Ecliptick the circle ANBO <hi>[in Fig. 7.]</hi> and let
us understand the points A and B, to be the extreams towards
the North and South; that is, the beginning of <hi>[or entrance into]
Cancer</hi> or <hi>Capricorn,</hi> and let us prolong the Diameter AB, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinately
by D and C towards the Starry Sphere. I say
now in the first place, that none of the fixed stars placed in the
Ecliptick, shall ever vary elevation, by reason of any whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
mutation made by the Earth along the said Plane of the
Ecliptick, but shall alwayes appear in the same superficies, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Earth shall approach and recede as great a space as is
that of the diameter of the Grand Orb, as may plainly be
seen in the said figure. For whether the Earth be in the point
A or in B, the star C alwayes appeareth in the same line ABC;
although the distance BC, be lesse than AC, by the whole
diameter AB. The most therefore that can be discovered in the
star C, and in any other placed in the Ecliptick, is the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
or diminished apparent magnitude, by reason of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proximation
or recession of the Earth.</p>

                        <p>Stay a while I pray you, for I meet with a certain
scruple, which much troubleth me, and it is this: That the star
C may be seen by the same line ABC, as wel when the Earth
is in A, as when it is in B, I understand very well, as also fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore
I apprehend that the same would happen in all the
points of the line AB,<note place="margin">Objections against the Earths annual motion taken from the fixed stars placed in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliptick.</note> so long as the Earth should passe from A
to B by the said line; but it passing thither, as is to be supposed,
by the arch ANB, it is manifest that when it shall be in the
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:96976:185"/>
point N, and in any other except those two A and B, the said
star shall no longer be observed in the line AB; but in others.
So that, if the appearing under several lines ought to cause
apparent mutations, some difference must needs appear in
this case. Nay more, I will speak it with that Philosophical
freedom, which ought to be allowed amongst Philosophick
friends, methinks that you, contradicting your self, deny that
now, which but even now to our admiration, you proved to be
really true, and considerable; I mean that which happeneth in
the Planets, and particularly in the three superiour ones, that
being constantly in the Ecliptick, or very near unto it, do not
onely shew themselves one while near unto us, and another
while remote, but so deformed in their regular motions, that
they seem sometimes immoveable, and sometimes many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
retrograde; and all upon no other occasion than the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
motion of the Earth.</p>

this one experiment more to ascertain me of what I may expect
from his ingenuity, and all this for my own interest, for in case
my Propositions stand but proof against the hammer and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace

deceive you, and to put any falshood upon you, as it might
have happened if the objection by me disguised, and by you o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-lookt,
had been the same in effect as it seemed to be in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
that is, really valid and conclusive; but it is not so;
nay I rather suspect that to try me, you make as if you did not
see its nullity. But I will herein be too hard for you, and force
from your tongue, that which you would so artificially conceal;
and therefore tell me, what that thing should be, whereby you
come to know the station and retrogradation of the Planets,
which is derived from the annual motion, aud which is so great,
that at least some foot-steps of such an effect ought to appear in
the stars of the Ecliptick?</p>

which it is necessary that I make reply; the first relates to the
imputation which you lay upon me of a Dissembler; the other
concerneth that which may appear in the stars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As to the
first, I will say with your permission, that it is not true, that I
have dissembled my knowing the nullity of that objection; and
to assure you of the same, I now tell you that I very well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the nullity thereof.</p>

                        <p>The very confession of knowing it may assure you
that I did not dissemble, when I said that I did not understand it;
for if I had had a mind, and would dissemble, who could hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
me from continuing in the same simulation, and denying still
that I understand the fallacy? I say therefore that I understood
not the same, at that time, but that I do now at this present ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
it, for that you have prompted my intellect, first by
telling me resolutely that it is <hi>null,</hi> and then by beginning to
question me so at large what thing that might be, whereby I
might come to know the station and retrogradation of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets;
<note place="margin">The station, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation of the Planets is known, in relation to the fixed stars.</note> and because this is known by comparing them with the fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
stars, in relation to which, they are seen to vary their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
one while towards the West, and another towards the

is not any thing above the Starry Sphere, immensely more remote
from us, and visible unto us, wherewith we may compare our
fixed stars, therefore we cannot discover in the fixed stars any
foot-steps of what appeareth to us in the Planets. This I believe

be found amongst the fixed stars, by which it may be gathered

bear witnesse of that motion, in favour of the Earth; for I do not

from a common centre, but hold, that their distances from
us are so various, that some of them may be twice and thrice as
remote as others; so that if with the Telescope one should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
a very small star neer to one of the bigger, and which
therefore was very exceeding high, it might happen, that some
sensible mutation might fall out between them, correspondent
to that of the superiour Planets. And so much shall serve to have
spoken at this time touching the stars placed in the Ecliptick.<note place="margin">The fixed stars without the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick elevate and descend more or lesse, according to their distance from the said Ecliptick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Let us now come to the fixed stars, placed out of the Ecliptick,
and let us suppose a great circle erect upon <hi>[i. e. at right angles
to]</hi> the Plane of the<note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>i. e.</hi> of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliptick.</note> same; and let it, for example, be a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
that in the Starry Sphere answers to the Solstitial Colure,
and let us mark it CEH <hi>[in Fig. 8.]</hi> which shall happen to be
withal a Meridian, and in it we will take a star without the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
which let be E. Now this star will indeed vary its elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:96976:186"/>
upon the Earths motion; for from the Earth in A it shall be
seen according to the ray AE, with the elevation of the angle
EAC; but from the Earth placed in B, it shall be seen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ray BE, with the elevation of the angle EBC,
bigger than the other EAC, that being extern, and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
and opposite in the triangle EAB, the distance therefore
of the star E from the Ecliptick, shall appear changed; and
likewise its altitude in the Meridian shall become greater in the
position B, than in the place A, according as the angle EBC
exceeds the angle EAC, which excesse is the quantity of the
angle AEB: For in the triangle EAB, the side AB being
continued to C, the exteriour angle EBC (as being equal to
the two interiour and opposite E and A) exceedeth the said an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
A, by the quantity of the angle E. And if we should take
another star in the same Meridian, more remote from the Ecli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptick,
as for instance the star H, the diversity in it shall be
greater by being observed from the two stations A and B, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as the angle AHB is greater than the other E; which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
shall encrease continually according as the observed star shall
be farther and farther from the Ecliptick, till that at last the
greatest mutation will appear in that star that should be placed in
the very Pole of the Ecliptick. As for a full understanding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we thus demonstrate. Suppose the diameter of the Grand
Orb to be AB, whose centre <hi>[in the same Figure]</hi> is G, and
let it be supposed to be continued out as far as the Starry Sphere
in the points D and C, and from the centre G let there be erected
the Axis of the Ecliptick GF, prolonged till it arrive at the said
Sphere, in which a Meridian DFC is supposed to be described,
that shall be perpendicular to the Plane of the Ecliptick; and
in the arch FC any points H and E, are imagined to be taken,
as places of fixed stars: Let the lines FA, FB, AH, HG,
HB, AE, GE, BE, be conjoyned. And let the angle of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
or, if you will, the Parallax of the star placed in the
Pole F, be AFB, and let that of the star placed in H, be the
angle AHB, and let that of the star in E, be the angle
AEB. I say, that the angle of difference of the Polar star F, is
the greatest, and that of the rest, those that are nearer to the
greatest are bigger than the more remote; that is to say, that the
angle F is bigger than the angle H, and this bigger than the angle
E. Now about the triangle FAB, let us suppose a circle to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.
And because the angle F is acute, (by reason that its base
AB is lesse than the diameter DC, of the semicircle DFC) it shall
be placed in the greater portion of the circumscribed circle cut
by the base AB. And because the said AB is divided in the
midst, and at right angles by FG, the centre of the circumscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:96976:186"/>
circle shall be in the line FG, which let be the point I; and
because that of such lines as are drawn from the point G, which
is not the centre, unto the circumference of the circumscribed
circle, the biggest is that which passeth by the centre, GF shall
be bigger than any other that is drawn from the point G, to the
circumference of the said circle; and therefore that circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
will cut the line GH (which is equal to the line GF) and
cutting GH, it will also cut AH. Let it cut it in L, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
the line LB. These two angles, therefore, AFB and ALB
shall be equal, as being in the same portion of the circle cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscribed.
But ALB external, is bigger than the internal H;
therefore the angle F is bigger than the angle H. And by the
same method we might demonstrate the angle H to be bigger
than the angle E, because that of the circle described about the
triangle AHB, the centre is in the perpendicular GF, to which
the line GH is nearer than the line GE, and therefore the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference
of it cutteth GE, and also AE, whereupon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
is manifest. We will conclude from hence, that the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of appearance, (which with the proper term of art, we
might call the Parallax of the fixed stars) is greater, or lesse, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as the Stars observed are more or lesse adjacent to the
Pole of the Ecliptick, so that, in conclusion of those Stars that
are in the Ecliptick it self, the said diversity is reduced to nothing.
In the next place,<note place="margin">The Earth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth or rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from the fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed stars of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliptick, the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Grand Orb.</note> as to the Earths accession by that motion to,

or recession to, or from the stars about the Pole of the Ecliptick,
is almost nothing; and in going to and from others, this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

We may,<note place="margin">The stars near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to us make greater differences than the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote.</note> in the third place, know, that the said difference

this DFI <hi>[in Fig. 7.]</hi> a Star placed in F, and seen by the same
ray AFE, the Earth being in A, would, in case it should be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served

would make the angle of difference, namely, BFA, bigger

                        <p>With great delight, and also benefit have I heard
your discourse;<note place="margin">The Epilogue of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the fixed stars caused by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual motion of the Earth.</note> and that I may be certain, whether I have right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understood the same, I shall give you the summe of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
in a few words. As I take it, you have explained to us
the different appearances, that by means of the Earths annual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:96976:187"/>
may be by us observed in the fixed stars to be of two
kinds: The one is, that of their apparent magnitudes varied, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as we, transported by the Earth, approach or recede
from the same: The other (which likewise dependeth on the
same accession and recession) their appearing unto us in the
same Meridian, one while more elevated, and another while lesse.
Moreover, you tell us (and I understand it very well) that the
one and other of these mutations are not made alike in all the
stars, but in some greater, and in others lesser, and in others not
at all. The accession and recession whereby the same star ought
to appear, one while bigger, and another while lesser, is insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and almost nothing in the stars neer unto the pole of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliptick,
but is greatest in the stars placed in the Ecliptick it self,
and indifferent in the intermediate: the contrary happens in the
other difference, that is, the elevation or depression of the stars
placed in the Ecliptick is nothing at all, greatest in those neerest
to the Pole of the said Ecliptick, and indifferent in the interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate.
Besides, both these differences are more sensible in the
Stars neerest to us, in the more remote lesse sensible, and in
those that are very far distant wholly disappear. This is, as to
what concerns my self; it remaineth now, as I conceive, that
something be said for the satisfaction of <hi>Simplicius,</hi> who, as I
believe, will not easily be made to over-passe those differences,
as insensible that are derived from a motion of the Earth so vast,
and from a mutation that transports the Earth into places twice
as far distant from us as the Sun.</p>

for there may perhaps yet some qualification be found for
your difficulties. And first, that the apparent magnitude of the
stars is not seen to make any sensible alteration, ought not to be
judged by you a thing improbable, in regard you see the guesses
of men in this particular to be so grossely erroneous, especially in
looking upon splendid objects; and you your self beholding
<hi>v. g.</hi> a lighted Torch at the distance of 200 paces,<note place="margin">In objects far remote, and lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, a small ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach or recession is imperceptible.</note> if it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
nearer to you 3. or 4. yards, do you think that it will
shew any whit encreased in magnitude? I for my part should
not perceive it certainly, although it should approach 20. or
30. yards nearer; nay it hath sometimes happened that in seeing
such a light at that distance I know not how to resolve whether
it came towards me, or retreated from me, when as it did in
reality approach nearer to me. But what need I speak of this?
If the self same accession and recession (I speak of a distance
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:96976:187"/>
twice as great as that from the Sun to us) in the star of <hi>Saturn</hi> is
almost totally imperceptible, and in <hi>Jupiter</hi> not very observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
what shall we think of the fixed stars, which I believe you

                        <p>I could wish you would say that in case such a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
were discovered,<note place="margin">If in the fixed stars one should discover any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual mutation, the motion of the Earth would be undeniable.</note> nothing more would remain behind, that

                        <p>All this I grant you; but neither one nor other of
these is sufficient to ascertain us in a businesse of this importance.
I desire that we may make use of Instruments greater by far,<note place="margin">What Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are apt for most exact obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note> and

at the like setting, it shew'd such another part of it, but notably
more small, a necessary argument, that it had begun to recede

observations to be made in the fixed stars, making use of some
of those wherein the mutation ought to appear more conspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
such as are (as hath already been declared) the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from the Ecliptick, amongst which the Harp a very great

in Countries far North, proceeding according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
that I shall shew by and by, but in the use of another star;
and I have already fancied to my self a place very well adapted
for such an observation. The place is an open Plane, upon
which towards the North there riseth a very eminent Mountain,
in the apex or top whereof is built a little Chappel, situate East
and West, so as that the ridg of its Roof may intersect at right
angles, the meridian of some building standing in the Plane. I
will place a beam parallel to the said ridg, or top of the Roof,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:96976:188"/>
and distant from it a yard or thereabouts. This being placed, I
will seek in the Plain the place from whence one of the stars of
<hi>Charls's</hi> Waine, in passing by the Meridian, cometh to hide it
self behind the beam so placed, or in case the beam should not
be so big as to hide the star, I will finde a station where one
may see the said beam to cut the said star into two equal parts;
an effect that with an * exquisite Telescope may be perfectly
discerned. And if in the place where the said accident is discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
there were some building, it will be the more commodious;
but if not, I will cause a Pole to be stuck very fast in the
ground, with some standing mark to direct where to place the
eye anew, when ever I have a mind to repeat the observation.
The first of which observations I will make about the Summer
Solstice, to continue afterwards from Moneth to Moneth, or
when I shall so please, to the other Solstice; with which obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
one may discover the elevation and depression of the star,
though it be very small. And if in that operation it shall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
that any mutation shall discover it self, what and how great
benefit will it bring to Astronomy? Seeing that thereby, besides
our being assured of the annual motion, we may come to know
the grandure and distance of the same star.</p>

well in the <hi>Copernican</hi> position, as in the <hi>Ptolomaick:</hi> nay, with

one may manifestly conceive that Hypothesis to be as easie to be
effected by nature, as difficult to be apprehended by the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing:
yet neverthelesse, I hope by making use of another
kind of explanation,<note place="margin">Necessary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions for the better conceiving of the consequences of the Earths mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> than that used by <hi>Copernicus,</hi> to render like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the apprehending of it somewhat lesse obscure. Which
that I may do, I will propose certain suppositions of themselves
known and manifest, and they shall be these that follow.</p>
                        <p>First, I suppose that the Earth is a spherical body, turning
round upon its own Axis and Poles, and that each point assigned
in its superficies, describeth the circumference of a circle, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or lesser, according as the point assigned shall be neerer or
farther from the Poles: And that of these circles the greatest is
that which is described by a point equidistant from the said Poles;
and all these circles are parallel to each other; and <hi>Parallels</hi> we
will call them.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The Earth being of a Spherical Figure, and of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacous
substance, it is continually illuminated by the Sun, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the half of its surface, the other half remaining obscure,
and the boundary that distinguisheth the illuminated part from
the dark being a grand circle, we will call that circle the <hi>termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator
of the light.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, If the Circle that is terminator of the light should
passe by the Poles of the Earth, it would cut (being a grand
and principal circle) all the parallels into equal parts; but not
passing by the Poles, it would cut them all in parts unequal, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
only the circle in the middle, which, as being a grand circle
will be cut into equal parts.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, The Earth turning round upon its own Poles, the
quantities of dayes and nights are termined by the arches of the
Parallels, intersected by the circle, that is, the terminator of the
light, and the arch that is scituate in the illuminated Hemisphere
prescribeth the length of the day, and the remainer is the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of the night.</p>
                        <p>These things being presupposed,<note place="margin">A plain Scheme representing the <hi>Copernican</hi> Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis, and its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences.</note> for the more clear under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of that which remaines to be said, we will lay it down
in a Figure. And first, we will draw the circumference of a
circle, that shall represent unto us that of the grand Orb descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:96976:189"/>
in the plain of the Ecliptick, and this we will divide into
four equal parts with the two diameters <hi>Capricorn Cancer,</hi> and
<hi>Libra Aries,</hi> which, at the same time, shall represent unto us the
four Cardinal points, that is, the two Solstices, and the two E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctials;
and in the centre of that circle we will place the
Sun O, fixed and immoveable.</p>
                        <figure/>
                        <p>Let us next draw about the four points, Capricorn, Cancer,
Libra and Aries, as centres, four equal circles, which represent
unto us the Earth placed in them at four several times of the
year. The which, with its centre, in the space of a year, passeth
through the whole circumference, Capricorn, Aries, Cancer, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra,
moving from East to West, that is, according to the order
of the Signes. It is already manifest, that whilst the Earth is in
Capricorn,<note place="margin">The Suns an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual motion, how it comes to passe, according to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernicus.</hi>
                           </note> the Sun will appear in Cancer, and the Earth moving
along the arch Capricorn Aries, the Sun will seem to move along
the arch Cancer Libra, and in short, will run thorow the Zodiack
according to the order of the Signes, in the space of a year; and
by this first assumption, without all question, full satisfaction is
given for the Suns apparent annual motion under the Ecliptick.
Now, coming to the other, that is, the diurnal motion of the
Earth in it self, it is necessary to establish its Poles and its Axis,
the which must be understood not to be erect perpendicularly
upon the plain of the Ecliptick, that is, not to be parallel to the
Axis of the grand Orb, but declining from a right angle 23 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
and an half, or thereabouts, with its North Pole towards
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:96976:190"/>
the Axis of the grand Orb, the Earths centre being in the Solsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
point of Capricorn. Supposing therefore the Terrestrial
Globe to have its centre in the point Capricorn, we will describe
its Poles and Axis AB, inclined upon the diameter Capricorn
Cancer 23 degrees and an half; so that the angle A Capricorn
Cancer cometh to be the complement of a Quadrant or Radius,
that is, 66 degrees and an half; and this inclination must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
to be immutable, and we will suppose the superiour
Pole A to be Boreal, or North, and the other Austral, or South.
Now imagining the Earth to revolve in it self about the Axis AB
in twenty four hours, from West to East, there shall by all the
points assigned in its superficies, be circles described parallel to
each other. We will draw, in this first position of the Earth,
the greatest CD, and those two distant from it <hi>gr.</hi> 23. and an
half, EF above, and GM beneath, and the other two extream
ones IK and LM remote, by those intervals from the Poles A
and B; and as we have marked these five, so we may imagine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
others, parallel to these, described by the innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
points of the Terrestrial surface. Next let us suppose the
Earth, with the annual motion of its centre, to transferre it self
into the other places already marked; but to passe thither in such
a manner, that its own Axis AB shall not only not change incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
upon the plain of the Ecliptick, but shall also never vary
direction; so that alwayes keeping parallel to it self, it may
continually tend towards the same part of the Universe, or, if
you will, of the Firmament, whereas, if we do but suppose it
prolonged, it will, with its extream termes, designe a Circle pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
and equal to the grand Orb, Libra Capricorn Aries Cancer,
as the superiour base of a Cylinder described by it self in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
motion above the inferiour base, Libra Capricorn Aries
Cancer. And therefore this immutability of inclination conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing,
we will design these other three figures about the centres
Aries, Cancer, and Libra, alike in every thing to that first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
about the centre Capricorn. Now we will consider the
first figure of the Earth, in which, in regard the Axis AB is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
from perpendicularity upon the diameter Capricorn Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
23 degrees and an half towards the Sun O, and the arch AI
being also 23 degrees and an half, the illumination of the Sun
will illustrate the Hemisphere of the Terrestrial Globe exposed
towards the Sun (of which, in this place, half is to be seen) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
from the obscure part by the Terminator of the light
IM, by which the parallel CD, as being a grand circle, shall
come to be divided into equal parts, but all the rest into parts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal;
being that the terminator of the light IM passeth not
by their Poles AB, and the parallel IK, together with all the rest
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:96976:190"/>
described within the same, and neerer to the pole A, shall wholly
be included in the illuminated part; as on the contrary, the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
ones towards the Pole B, contained within the paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
LM, shall remain in the dark. Moreover, the arch AI be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
equal to the arch FD, and the arch AF, common to them
both, the two arches IKF and AFD shall be equal, and each
a quadrant or 90 degrees. And because the whole arch IFM
is a semicircle, the arch FM shall be a quadrant, and equal to
the other FKI; and therefore the Sun O shall be in this state
of the Earth vertical to one that stands in the point F. But by
the revolution diurnal about the standing Axis AB, all the points
of the parallel EF passe by the same point F: and therefore in
that same day the Sun, at noon, shall be vertical to all the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of the Parallel EF, and will seem to them to describe in its
apparent motion the circle which we call the Tropick of Cancer.
But to the inhabitants of all the Parallels that are above the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
EF, towards the North pole A, the Sun declineth from
their <hi>Vertex</hi> or Zenith towards the South; and on the contrary,
to all the inhabitants of the Parallels that are beneath EF, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Equinoctial CD, and the South Pole B, the Meridian
Sun is elevated beyond their <hi>Vertex</hi> towards the North Pole A.
Next, it is visible that of all the Parallels, only the greatest CD
is cut in equal parts by the Terminator of the light IM. But
the rest, that are beneath and above the said grand circle, are all
intersected in parts unequal: and of the superiour ones, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midiurnal
arches, namely those of the part of the Terrestrial sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
illustrated by the Sun, are bigger than the seminocturnal
ones that remain in the dark: and the contrary befalls in the
remainder, that are under the great one CD, towards the pole B,
of which the semidiurnal arches are lesser than the seminocturnal,
It is likewise apparently manifest, that the differences of the said
arches go augmenting, according as the Parallels are neerer to
the Poles, till such time as the parallel IK comes to be wholly in
the part illuminated, and the inhabitants thereof have a day of
twenty four hours long, without any night; and on the contrary,
the Parallel LM, remaining all in obscurity, hath a night of
twenty four hours, without any day. Come we next to the
third Figure of the Earth, placed with its centre in the point
Cancer, where the Sun seemeth to be in the first point of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricorn.
We have already seen very manifestly, that by reason
the Axis AB doth not change inclination, but continueth paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
to it self, the aspect and situation of the Earth is the same to
an hair with that in the first Figure; save onely that that Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphere
which in the first was illuminated by the Sun, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
obtenebrated, and that cometh to be luminous, which in
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:96976:191"/>
the first was tenebrous: whereupon that which happened before
concerning the differences of dayes and nights, touching the
dayes being greater or lesser than the nights, now falls out quite
contrary. And first, we see, that whereas in the first Figure the
circle IK was wholly in the light, it is now wholly in the dark;
and the opposite arch LM is now wholly in the light, which
was before wholly in the dark. Of the parallels between the
grand circle CD, and the Pole A, the semidiurnal arches are now
lesser than the seminocturnal, which before were the contrary.
Of the others likewise towards the Pole B, the semidiurnal arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
are now bigger than the seminocturnal, the contrary to what
happened in the other position of the Earth. We now see the
Sun made vertical to the inhabitants of the Tropick GN, and to
be depressed towards the South, with those of the Parallel EF,
by all the arch ECG, that is, 47 degrees; and in summe, to have
passed from one to the other Tropick, traversing the Equinoctial,
elevating and declining in the Meridians the said space of 47 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.
And all this mutation is derived not from the inclination
or elevation of the Earth, but on the contrary, from its not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
or elevating at all; and in a word, by continuing always
in the same position, in respect of the Universe, onely with turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about the Sun situate iu the midst of the said plane, in which
it moveth it self about circularly with its annual motion. And
here is to be noted an admirable accident,<note place="margin">An admirable accident depending on the not inclining of the Earths axis</note> which is, that like as
the Axis of the Earth conserving the same direction towards the
Universe, or we may say, towards the highest Sphere of the fixed
stars, causeth the Sun to appear to elevate and incline so great a
space, namely, for 47 degrees, and the fixed Stars to incline or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levate
nothing at all; so, on the contrary, if the same Axis of
the Earth should maintain it self continually in the same inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
towards the Sun, or, if you will, towards the Axis of the
Zodiack, no mutation would appear to be made in the Sun about
its elevating or declining, whereupon the inhabitants of one and
the same place would alwayes have one and the same difference
of dayes and nights, and one and the same constitution of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
that is, some alwayes Winter, others alwayes Summer,
others Spring, &amp;c. but, on the contrary, the alterations in the
fixed Stars would appear very great, as touching their elevation,
and inclination to us, which would amount to the same 47 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.
For the understanding of which let us return to consider
the position of the Earth, in its first Figure, where we see the
Axis AB, with the superiour Pole A, to incline towards the Sun;
but in its third Figure, the same Axis having kept the same dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
towards the highest Sphere, by keeping parallel to it self,
inclines no longer towards the Sun with its superiour Pole A, but
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:96976:191"/>
on the contrary reclines from its former position <hi>gr.</hi> 47. and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth
towards the opposite part, so that to restore the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
of the said Pole A towards the Sun, it would be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
by turning round the Terrestrial Globe, according to the
circumference ACBD, to transport it towards E those same
<hi>gr.</hi> 47. and for so many degrees, any whatsoever fixed star ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in the Meridian, would appear to be elevated, or inclined.
Let us come now to the explanation of that which remains, and
let us consider the Earth placed in the fourth Figure, that is,
with its centre in the first point of Libra; upon which the Sun
will appear in the beginning of Aries. And because the Axis of
<figure/>
the Earth, which in the first Figure is supposed to be inclined up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the diameter Capricorn Cancer, and therefore to be in that
same plane, which cutting the plane of the grand Orb, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the line Capricorn Cancer, was erected perpendicularly
upon the same, transposed into the fourth Figure, and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
as hath alwayes been said, parallel to it self, it shall come
to be in a plane in like manner erected to the superficies of
the Grand Orbe, and parallel to the plane, which at right
angles cuts the same superficies, according to the diameter Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricorn
Cancer. And therefore the line which goeth from
the centre of the Sunne to the centre of the Earth, that is,
O Libra, shall be perpendicular to the Axis BA: but the
same line which goeth from the centre of the Sunne to the
centre of the Earth, is also alwayes perpendicular to the
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:96976:192"/>
circle that is the Terminator of the light; therefore this same
circle shall passe by the Poles AB in the fourth figure, and
in its plain the Axis AB shall fall, but the greatest circle passing
by the Poles of the Parallels, divideth them all in equal parts;
therefore the arches IK, EF, CD, GN, LM, shall be all
semicircles, and the illumin'd Hemisphere shall be this which
looketh towards us, and the Sun, and the Terminator of the
light shall be one and the same circle ACBD, and the Earth
being in this place shall make it Equinoctial to all its Inhabitants.
And the same happeneth in the second figure, where the Earth
having its illuminated Hemisphere towards the Sun, sheweth us
the other that is obscure, with its nocturnal arches, which in
like manner are all semicircles, and consequently, here also it
maketh the Equinoctial. And lastly in regard that the line pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from the centre of the Sun to the centre of the Earth, is
perpendicular to the Axis AB, to which the greatest circle of
the parallels CD, is likewise erect, the said line O <hi>Libra</hi> shall
passe of necessity by the same Plain of the parallel CD, cutting
its circumference in the midst of the diurnal arch CD; and
therefore the Sun shall be vertical to any one that shall stand
where that intersection is made; but all the Inhabitants of that
Parallel shall passe the same, as being carried about by the
Earths diurnal conversion; therefore all thes upon that day
shall have the Meridian Sun in their vertex. And the Sun at the
same time to all the Inhabitants of the Earth shall seem to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
the Grand Parallel called the Equinoctial. Furthermore,
forasmuch as the Earth being in both the Solstitial points of the
Polar circles IK and LM, the one is wholly in the light, and
the other wholly in the dark; but when the Earth is in the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial
points, the halves of those same polar circles are in the
light, the remainder of them being in the dark; it should not
be hard to understand, how that the Earth <hi>v. gr.</hi> from <hi>Cancer</hi>
(where the parallel IK is wholly in the dark) to <hi>Leo,</hi> one part of
the parallel towards the point I, beginneth to enter into the light,
and that the Terminator of the light IM beginneth to retreat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Pole AB, intersecting the circle ACBD no longer in IM,
but in two other points falling between the terms IA and MB, of
the arches IA and MB; whereupon the Inhabitants of the circle
begin to enjoy the light, and the other Inhabitants of the circle
LM to partake of night. And thus you see that by two simple
motions made in times proportionate to their bignesses, and not
contrary to one another, but performed, as all others that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to moveable mundane bodies, from West to East assigned
to the Terrestrial Globe, adequate reasons are rendred of all
those <hi>Phaenomena</hi> or appearances, for the accommodating of
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:96976:192"/>
which to the stability of the Earth it is necessary (forsaking that
Symetry which is observed to be between the velocities and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudes
of moveables) to ascribe to a Sphere, vast above all
others, an unconceiveable celerity, whilst the other lesser
Spheres move extream slowly; and which is more, to make that
motion contrary to all their motions; and, yet again to adde to
the improbability, to make that superiour Sphere forcibly to
transport all the inferiour ones along with it contrary to their
proper inclination. And here I refer it to your judgment to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
which of the two is the most probable.</p>

                        <p>To tell you true, I do not very well know; perhaps,
because I have not so much as learnt the reasons that are by <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>
produced, of those effects, I mean of those stations, retrogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
accessions, recessions of the Planets; lengthenings and
shortnings of dayes, changes of seasons, &amp;c. But omitting the
consequences that depend on the first suppositions, I find in the
suppositions themselves no small difficulties; which suppositions,
if once they be overthrown, they draw along with them the ruine
of the whole fabrick. Now forasmuch as because the whole
module of <hi>Copernicus</hi> seemeth in my opinion to be built upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
foundations, in that it relyeth upon the mobility of the earth,
if this should happen to be disproved, there would be no need of
farther dispute. And to disprove this, the Axiom of <hi>Aristotle</hi>
is in my judgement most sufficient, That of one simple body,
one sole simple motion can be natural: but here in this case, to
the Earth,<note place="margin">Four several motions assigned to the Earth.</note> a simple body, there are assigned 3. if not 4. motions,
and all very different from each other. For besides the right
motion, as a grave body towards its centre, which cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
it, there is assigned to it a circular motion in a great circle
about the Sun in a year, and a vertiginous conversion about its
own centre in twenty four hours. And that in the next place
which is more exorbitant, &amp; which happly for that reason you pass
over in silence, there is ascribed to it another revolution about
its own centre, contrary to the former of twenty four hours,
and which finisheth its period in a year. In this my understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
apprehendeth a very great contradiction.</p>

                        <p>As to the motion of descent,<note place="margin">The motion of descent belongs not to the terrestrial Globe, but to its parts.</note> it hath already been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
not to belong to the Terrestrial Globe which did never
move with any such motion, nor never shall do; but is (if there be
such a thing) that propension of its parts to reunite themselves
to their whole. As, in the next place, to the Annual motion,
and the Diurnal,<note place="margin">The annual and diurnal motion are compatible in the Earth.</note> these being both made towards one way, are
very compatible, in the same manner just as if we should let a
Ball trundle downwards upon a declining superficies, it would in
its descent along the same spontaneously revolve in it self. As
to the third motion assigned it by <hi>Copernicus,</hi> namely about it
self in a year, onely to keep its Axis inclined and directed
towards the same part of the Firmament, I will tell you a thing
worthy of great consideration: namely <hi>ut tantum abest</hi> (although
it be made contrary to the other annual) it is so far from having
any repugnance or difficulty in it,<note place="margin">Every pensil and librated, body car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed round in the circumference of a circle, acquireth of it self a motion in it self contrary to that.</note> that naturally and without any
moving cause, it agreeth to any whatsoever suspended and libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
body, which if it shall be carried round in the circumference
of a circle, immediate of it self, it acquireth a conversion about
its own centre, contrary to that which carrieth it about, and of
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:96976:193"/>
such velocity, that they both finish one revolution in the same
time precisely. You may see this admirable, and to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
accommodate experience,<note place="margin">An Experiment which sensibly shews that two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary motions may naturally agree in the same move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</note> if putting in a Bason of water a
Ball that will swim; and holding the Bason in your hand, you
turn round upon your toe, for you shall immediatly see the Ball
begin to revolve in it self with a motion, contrary to that of the
Bason, and it shall finish its revolution, when that of the Bason it
shall finish. Now what other is the Earth than a pensil Globe
librated in tenuous and yielding aire, which being carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
in a year along the circumference of a great circle,<note place="margin">The third motion ascribed to the Earth is rather a resting immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</note> must
needs acquire, without any other mover, a revolution about its
own centre, annual, and yet contrary to the other motion in like
manner annual? You shall see this effect I say, but if afterwards
you more narrowly consider it, you shall find this to be no real
thing, but a meer appearance; and that which you think to be
a revolution in it self, you will find to be a not moving at all,
but a continuing altogether immoveable in respect of all that
which without you, and without the vessel is immoveable: for if in
that Ball you shall make some mark, and consider to what part of
the Room where you are, or of the Field, or of Heaven it is
situate, you shall see that mark in yours, and the vessels revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to look alwayes towards that same part; but comparing it to
the vessel and to your self that are moveable, it will appear to go
altering its direction, and with a motion contrary to yours, and
that of the vessel, to go seeking all the points of its circumgyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
so that with more reason you and the bason may be said
to turn round the immoveable Ball, than that it moveth round
in the bason. In the same manner the Earth suspended and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
in the circumference of the Grand Orbe, and scituate in
such sort that one of its notes, as for example, its North Pole, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
towards such a Star or other part of the Firmament, it always
keepeth directed towards the same, although carried round by
the annual motion about the circumference of the said Grand
Orbe. This alone is sufficient to make the Wonder cease, and
to remove all difficulties. But what will <hi>Simplicius</hi> say, if to
this non-indigence of the co-operating cause we should adde

                        <p>As to appearance, I see that they are different things,
there being very great heaps of unfruitful sands, and others of
fruitful soiles; There are infinite sharp and steril mountains, full
of hard stones and quarries of several kinds, as Porphyre, Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blaster,

are vast Minerals of so many kinds of metals; and in a word,

is not right: for this Earth which is broke up, is sowed, and is
fertile, is but one part, and that very small of the surface of the
Globe, which doth not go very deep, yea, its depth is very small,
in comparison of the distance to the centre: and experience
sheweth us, that one shall not dig very low, but one shall finde
matters very different from this exteriour scurf, more solid, and
not good for the production of vegetables. Besides the interne
parts, as being compressed by very huge weights that lie upon
them, are, in all probability, slived, and made as hard as any
hard rock. One may adde to this, that fecundity would be in
vain conferred upon those matters which never were designed to
bear fruit, but to rest eternally buried in the profound and dark
abysses of the Earth.</p>

demonstratively that the primary and real substance of this our

Globe is Load-stone; but onely to shew that no reason could be
given why one should be more unwilling to grant that it is of
Load-stone,<note place="margin">Our Globe would have been called stone, in stead of Earth, of that name had been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen it in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</note> than of some other matter. And if you will but
seriously consider, you shall find that it is not improbable, that
one sole, pure, and arbitrary name, hath moved men to think
that it consists of Earth; and that is their having made use com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
from the beginning of this word Earth, as well to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
that matter which is plowed and sowed, as to name this our
Globe. The denomination of which if it had been taken from
stone, as that it might as well have been taken from that as
from the Earth; the saying that its primary substance was stone,
would doubtlesse have found no scruple or opposition in any
man. And is so much the more probable, in that I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that if one could but pare off the scurf of this great Globe,
taking away but one full thousand or two thousand yards; and
afterwards seperate the Stones from the Earth, the accumulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the stones would be very much biger than that of the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Mould. But as for the reasons which concludently prove <hi>de facto,</hi>
that is our Globe is a Magnet, I have mentioned none of
them, nor is this a time to alledg them, and the rather, for that
to your benefit you may read them in <hi>Gilbert;</hi> onely to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage

of my own,<note place="margin">The method of <hi>Gilbert</hi> in his Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy.</note> the method that he observed in his Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.
I know you understand very well how much the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of the accidents is subservient to the investigation of the
substance and essence of things; therefore I desire that you
would take pains to informe your self well of many accidents and
properties that are found in the Magnet,<note place="margin">Many proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net.</note> and in no other stone,
or body; as for instance of attracting Iron, of conferring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it by its sole presence the same virtue, of communicating
likewise to it the property of looking towards the Poles, as it
also doth it self; and moreover endeavour to know by trial,
that it containeth in it a virtue of conferring upon the magnetick
needle not onely the direction under a Meridian towards the
Poles, with an Horizontal motion, (a property a long time ago
known) but a new found accident, of declining (being ballanced
under the Meridian before marked upon a little spherical Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net)
of declining I say to determinate marks more or lesse, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as that needle is held nearer or farther from the Pole,
till that upon the Pole it self it erecteth perpendicularly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in the middle parts it is parallel to the Axis. Furthermore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
a proof to be made, whether the virtue of attracting Iron,
residing much more vigorously about the Poles, than about the
middle parts, this force be not notably more vigorous in one
Pole than in the other, and that in all pieces of Magnet; the
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:96976:196"/>
stronger of which Poles is that which looketh towards the South.
Observe, in the next place, that in a little Magnet this South and
more vigorous Pole, becometh weaker, when ever it is to take
up an iron in presence of the North Pole of another much big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Magnet: and not to make any tedious discourse of it, asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

                        <p>If it be so, say resolutely, that under this cover and
scurf of Earth, stones, metals, water, &amp;c. there is hid a great
Magnet, forasmuch as about the same there may be seen by any
one that will heedfully observe the same, all those very accidents
that agree with a true and visible Globe of Magnet; but if no
more were to be seen than that of the Declinatory Needle, which
being carried about the Earth, more and more inclineth, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth
to the North Pole, and declineth lesse towards the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctial,
under which it finally is brought to an <hi>Aequilibrium,</hi>
it might serve to perswade even the most scrupulous judgment. I
forbear to mention that other admirable effect, which is sensibly
observed in every piece of Magnet, of which, to us inhabitants
of the Northern Hemisphere, the Meridional Pole of the said Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
is more vigorous than the other; and the difference is found
greater, by how much one recedeth from the Equinoctial; and
under the Equinoctial both the parts are of equal strength, but
notably weaker. But, in the Meridional Regions, far distant
from the Equinoctial, it changeth nature, and that part which to
us was more weak, acquireth more strength than the other: and
all this I confer with that which we see to be done by a small
piece of Magnet, in the presence of a great one, the vertue of
which superating the lesser, maketh it to become obedient to it,
and according as it is held, either on this or on that side the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial
of the great one, maketh the self same mutations,

Magnet,<note place="margin">The Magnet armed takes up much more Iron, than when armed.</note> I, for a long time, made many Observations, and all
worthy of extream wonder; but above all, that seemeth to me
very stupendious of increasing the faculty of taking up Iron so

arming that piece of mine, I multiplied its force in octuple propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and whereas unarmed it scarce took up nine ounces of

that a little piece of the like stone gave me greater cause of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that is in the keeping of our Academick, which being no
more than of six ounces weight, and sustaining, when unarmed,
hardly two ounces, doth, when armed, take up 160. ounces, so
as that it is of 80. times more force armed than unarmed, and
takes up a weight 26. times greater than its own; a much greater
wonder than <hi>Gilbert</hi> could ever meet with, who writeth, that he
could never get any Loadstone that could reach to take up four
times its own weight.</p>

                        <p>In my opinion, this Stone offers to the wit of man a
large Field to Phylosophate in; and I have many times thought
with my self, how it can be that it conferreth on that Iron, which
armeth it, a strength so superiour to its own; and finally, I finde
nothing that giveth me satisfaction herein; nor do I find any
thing extraordinary in that which <hi>Gilbert</hi> writes about this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular;

                        <p>I extreamly praise, admire, and envy this Authour,
for that a conceit so stupendious should come into his minde,
touching a thing handled by infinite sublime wits, and hit upon
by none of them: I think him moreover worthy of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
applause for the many new and true Observations that he
made, to the disgrace of so many fabulous Authours, that write
not only what they do not know, but what ever they hear spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by the foolish vulgar, never seeking to assure themselves of
the same by experience, perhaps, because they are unwilling to
diminish the bulk of their Books. That which I could have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
in <hi>Gilbert,</hi> is, that he had been a little greater Mathematici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
and particularly well grounded in <hi>Geometry,</hi> the practice
whereof would have rendered him less resolute in accepting those
reasons for true Demonstrations, which he produceth for true
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:96976:197"/>
causes of the true conclusions observed by himself. Which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
(freely speaking) do not knit and bind so fast, as those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
ought to do, in that of natural, necessary, and lasting
conclusions may be alledged. And I doubt not, but that in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of time this new Science will be perfected with new obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
and, which is more, with true and necessary Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<note place="margin">The first obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and inventers of things ought to be admired.</note> Nor ought the glory of the first Inventor to be thereby
diminished; nor do I lesse esteem, but rather more admire, the
Inventor of the Harp (although it may be supposed that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
at first was but rudely framed, and more rudely finger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
than an hundred other Artists, that in the insuing Ages redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
that profession to great perfection. And methinks, that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
had very good reason to enumerate the first Inventors of
the Noble Arts amongst the Gods; seeing that the common wits
have so little curiosity, and are so little regardful of rare and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
things, that though they see and hear them exercitated by
the exquisite professors of them, yet are they not thereby per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to a desire of learning them. Now judge, whether Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities
of this kind would ever have attempted to have found out
the making of the Harp, or the invention of Musick, upon the
hint of the whistling noise of the dry sinews of a Tortois, or
from the striking of four Hammers. The application to great
inventions moved by small hints, and the thinking that under a
primary and childish appearance admirable Arts may lie hid, is
not the part of a trivial, but of a super-humane spirit. Now an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
to your demands, I say, that I also have long thought
upon what might possibly be the cause of this so tenacious and
potent union, that we see to be made between the one Iron that
armeth the Magnet, and the other that conjoyns it self unto it.
And first,<note place="margin">The true cause of the multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vertue in the Magnet, by means of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</note> we are certain, that the vertue and strength of the stone
doth not augment by being armed, for it neither attracts at
greater distance, nor doth it hold an Iron the faster, if between it,
and the arming or cap, a very fine paper, or a leaf of beaten gold,
be interposed; nay, with that interposition, the naked stone
takes up more Iron than the armed. There is therefore no alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in the vertue, and yet there is an innovation in the effect.
And because its necessary,<note place="margin">Of a new effect its necessary that the cause be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise new.</note> that a new effect have a new cause, if
it be inquired what novelty is introduced in the act of taking up
with the cap or arming, there is no mutation to be discovered, but
in the different contact; for whereas before Iron toucht Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,
now Iron toucheth Iron. Therefore it is necessary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<note place="margin">It is proved, that Iron consists of parts more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, pure, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact than the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net.</note> that the diversity of contacts is the cause of the diversity
of effects. And for the difference of contacts it cannot, as I see,
be derived from any thing else, save from that the substance of
the Iron is of parts more subtil, more pure, and more compact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:96976:197"/>
than those of the Magnet, which are more grosse, impure, and
rare. From whence it followeth, that the superficies of two I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons
that are to touch, by being exquisitely plained, filed, and
burnished, do so exactly conjoyn, that all the infinite points of
the one meet with the infinite points of the other; so that the
filaments, if I may so say, that collegate the two Irons, are many
more than those that collegate the Magnet to the Iron, by reason
that the substance of the Magnet is more porous, and lesse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact,
which maketh that all the points and filaments of the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
do not close with that which it unites unto. In the next
place, that the substance of Iron (especially the well refined, as
namely, the purest steel) is of parts much more dense, subtil,
and pure than the matter of the Loadstone, is seen, in that one
may bring its edge to an extraordinary sharpnesse, such as is that
of the Rasor, which can never be in any great measure effected in
a piece of Magnet.<note place="margin">A sensible proof of the impurity of the Magnet.</note> Then, as for the impurity of the Magnet, and
its being mixed with other qualities of stone, it is first sensibly
discovered by the colour of some little spots, for the most part
white; and next by presenting a needle to it, hanging in a
thread, which upon those stonynesses cannot find repose, but
being attracted by the parts circumfused, seemeth to fly from
<note n="*" place="margin">The Author hereby meaneth that the stone doth not all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of magnetick matter, but that the whiter specks being weak, those other parts of the Loadstone of a more dark &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant colour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all that vertue wherewith bodies are attracted.</note> 
                           <hi>those,</hi> and to leap upon the Magnet contiguous to <hi>them:</hi> and
as some of those Heterogeneal parts are for their magnitude ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
visible, so we may believe, that there are others, in great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance,
which, for their smallnesse, are imperceptible, that are
disseminated throughout the whole masse. That which I say,
(namely, that the multitude of contacts that are made between
Iron and Iron, is the cause of the so solid conjunction) is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by an experiment, which is this, that if we present the
sharpned point of a needle to the cap of a Magnet, it will stick
no faster to it, than to the same stone unarmed: which can
proceed from no other cause, than from the equality of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacts
that are both of one sole point. But what then? Let a
<note n="*" place="margin">A common sewing needle.</note> Needle be taken and placed upon a Magnet, so that one of its
extremities hang somewhat over, and to that present a Nail; to
which the Needle will instantly cleave, insomuch that withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Nail, the Needle will stand in suspense, and with its two
ends touching the Magnet and the Iron; and withdrawing the
Nail yet a little further, the Needle will forsake the Magnet;
provided that the eye of the Needle be towards the Nail, and
the point towards the Magnet; but if the eye be towards the
Loadstone, in withdrawing the Nail the Needle will cleave to
the Magnet; and this, in my judgment, for no other reason,
save onely that the Needle, by reason it is bigger towards the
eye, toucheth in much more points than its sharp point doth.</p>

of the Magnet were really much lesse continuate than that
of Iron or of Steel, I made the Artists that work in the Gallery
of my Lord the Grand Duke, to smooth one side of that piece
of Magnet, which formerly was yours, and then to polish and
burnish it; upon which to my satisfaction I found what I desired.
For I discovered many specks of colour different from the rest,
but as splendid and bright, as any of the harder sort of stones;
the rest of the Magnet was polite, but to the tact onely, not
being in the least splendid; but rather as if it were smeered over
with foot; and this was the substance of the Load-stone, and
the shining part was the fragments of other stones intermixt
therewith, as was sensibly made known by presenting the face
thereof to filings of Iron, the which in great number leapt to
the Load-stone, but not so much as one grain did stick to the
said spots, which were many, some as big as the fourth part of
the nail of a mans finger, others somewhat lesser, the least of
all very many, and those that were scarce visible almost innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable.
So that I did assure my self, that my conjecture was
true, when I first thought that the substance of the Magnet
was not close and compact, but porous, or to say better, spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy;
but with this difference, that whereas the sponge in its
cavities and little cels conteineth Air or Water, the Magnet hath
its pores full of hard and heavy stone, as appears by the exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
lustre which those specks receive. Whereupon, as I have said
from the beginning, applying the surface of the Iron to the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies
of the Magnet the minute particles of the Iron, though
perhaps more continuate than these of any other body (as its
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:96976:198"/>
shining more than any other matter doth shew) do not all, nay
but very few of them incounter pure Magnet; and the contacts
being few, the union is but weak. But because the cap of the
Load-stone, besides the contact of a great part of its superficies,
invests its self also with the virtue of the parts adjoyning, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they touch not; that side of it being exactly smoothed
to which the other face, in like manner well polisht of the Iron to
be attracted, is applyed, the contract is made by innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
minute particles, if not haply by the infinite points of both
the superficies, whereupon the union becometh very strong.
This observation of smoothing the surfaces of the Irons that are
to touch, came not into the thoughts of <hi>Gilbert,</hi> for he makes
the Irons convex, so that their contact is very small; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
it cometh to passe that the tenacity, wherewith those Irons
conjoyn, is much lesser.</p>

reasons of a great number of accidents and effects which we see
not without admiration to be produced in nature. But this kind
of philosophating seems to me to have great sympathy with a

then came into my minde, &amp; which I would have intimated, was a
certain consideration touching the scruple and objection of <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicius,</hi>
which he propounded against the mobility of the Earth,
taken from the multiplicity of motions,<note place="margin">The several na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural motions of the Magnet.</note> impossible to be assigned
to a simple body, of which but one sole and simple motion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the doctrine of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> can be natural; and that
which I would have proposed to consideration, was the Magnet,
to which we manifestly see three motions naturally to agree:
one towards the centre of the Earth, as a <hi>Grave;</hi> the second is
the circular Horizontal Motion, whereby it restores and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
its Axis towards determinate parts of the Universe; and
the third is this, newly discovered by <hi>Gilbert,</hi> of inclining its
Axis, being in the plane of a Meridian towards the surface of the
Earth, and this more and lesse, according as it shall be distant
from the Equinoctial, under which it is parallel to the Axis of
the Earth. Besides these three, it is not perhaps improbable,
but that it may have a fourth, of revolving upon its own Axis, in
case it were librated and suspended in the air or other fluid and
yielding <hi>Medium,</hi> so that all external and accidental impediments
were removed, and this opinion <hi>Gilbert</hi> himself seemeth also to
applaud. So that, <hi>Simplicius,</hi> you see how tottering the Axiome

will maintain that the straight motion is a peculiar to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and the circular to the coelestial bodies. Therefore if
you will more safely argue, you must say, that of the integral
bodies of the Universe, those that are by nature moveable, do all
move circularly, and that therefore the Magnet, as a part of the
true primary,<note place="margin">The errour of those who call the Magnet a mixt body, and the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial Globe a simble body.</note> and integral substance of our Globe, pertaketh of
the same qualities with it. And take notice of this your fallacy,
in calling the Magnet a mixt body, and the Terrestrial Globe a
simple body, which is sensibly perceived to be a thousand times
more compound: for, besides that it containeth an hundred an
hundred matters, exceeding different from one another, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
great abundance of this which you call mixt, I mean
of the Load-stone. This seems to me just as if one should call

any more about these particulars, and the rather, because you
know that our purpose was not to determine resolutely, or to
accept for true, this or that opinion, but only to propose for our
divertisement such reasons, and answers as may be alledged on
the one side, or on the other; and <hi>Simplicius</hi> maketh this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
in defence of his Peripateticks, therefore let us leave the
judgment in suspense, and remit the determination into the
hands of such as are more known than we. And because I think
that we have, with sufficient prolixity, in these three dayes, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed
upon the Systeme of the Universe, it will now be seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
that we proceed to the grand accident, from whence our
Disputations took beginning, I mean, of the ebbing and flowing
of the Sea, the cause whereof may, in all probability, be referred
to the motion of the Earth. But that, if you so please, we will
reserve till to morrow. In the mean time, that I may not forget
it, I will speak to one particular, to which I could have wished,
that <hi>Gilbert</hi> had not lent an ear;<note place="margin">An improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effect admired by <hi>Gilbertus</hi> in the Loadstone.</note> I mean that of admitting, that
in case a little Sphere of Loadstone might be exactly librated, it
would revolve in it self; because there is no reason why it should
do so; For if the whole Terrestrial Globe hath a natural facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of revolving about its own centre in twenty four hours, and
that all its parts ought to have the same, I mean, that faculty of
turning round together with their <hi>whole,</hi> about its centre in twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
four hours; they already have the same in effect, whilst that,
being upon the Earth, they turn round along with it: And the
assigning them a revolution about their particular centres, would
be to ascribe unto them a second motion much different from the
first: for so they would have two, namely, the revolving in twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
four hours about the centre of their <hi>whole;</hi> and the turning
about their own: now this second is arbitrary, nor is there any
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:96976:200"/>
reason for the introducing of it: If by plucking away a piece
of Loadstone from the whole natural masse, it were deprived of
the faculty of following it, as it did, whilst it was united thereto,
so that it is thereby deprived of the revolution about the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
centre of the Terrestrial Globe, it might haply, with some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
greater probability be thought by some, that the said Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
was to appropriate to it self a new conversion about its parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
centre; but if it do no lesse, when separated, than when
conjoyned, continue always to pursue its first, eternal, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

it another new one?</p>

our Globe, writeth, that the seeing the small * particles of water
shape themselves into rotundity, as in the drops, and in the dew
daily apparent upon the leaves of several herbs, is a strong ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument;
and because, according to the trite Axiome, there is
the same reason for the whole, as for the parts, the parts affecting
that same figure, it is necessary that the same is proper to the
whole Element: and truth is, methinks it is a great oversight
that these men should not perceive so apparent a vanity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that if their argument had run right, it would have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that not only the small drops, but that any whatsoever greater

to attain to the true and primary causes; not that I pretend
to be able to produce all the proper and adequate reasons of

be but one true and primary cause of the effects that are of the

know to be true, and assigne the causes thereof that I think
to be true, and you also, Gentlemen, shall produce such
others as are known to you, besides mine, and then we will

six hours flow, and for six hours ebbe. The second period is
monethly, and it seemes to take its origen from the motion of
the Moon, not that it introduceth other motions, but only al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth
the greatnesse of those before mentioned, with a notable
difference, according as it shall wax or wane, or come to the

they run one while towards the East, and recur another
while towards the West; and in others they vary the heights

Tide at time of flood hath room to extend it self: but if the
course of the Tide were intercepted by Cliffes and Banks of
great height and steepnesse, there it will flow and ebbe without
any progressive motion. Again, it runs to and again, without
changing height in the middle parts of the Mediterrane, as nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

to them, and lower; but so do not those Waters that are
of greatest profundity; and the higher having once driven back
the lower, they in a short time grow quiet and<note n="*" place="margin">Or rather smooth.</note> level. This
your <hi>Peripatetick</hi> must needs be of an opinion, that all the Lakes
in the World that are in a calme, and that all the Seas where
the ebbing and flowing is insensible, are level in their bottoms;

                        <p>I believe that no man believeth Fables, so long as he
knows them to be so; and of the opinions concerning the causes
of ebbing and flowing, which are many, because I know that of
one single effect there is but one single cause that is true and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary,
I understand very well, and am certain that but one alone
at the most can be true, and for all the rest I am sure that they are
fabulous, and false; and its possible that the true one may not be

liberty that is permitted amongst us, that the introduction of the
Earths motion, and the making it the cause of the ebbing and
flowing of Tides, seemeth to me as yet a conjecture no lesse fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous
than the rest of those that I have heard; and if there
should not be proposed to me reasons more conformable to natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

artificially make the Water conteined in an immoveable Vessel

some places more; in some lesse, and in some not at all: and to
work all these different effects in one and the same Vessel that
containeth it: besides, that these are several Miracles, and that
is but one onely. And here it may be added, that the Miracle
of making the water to move is accompanied with another,
namely, the holding of the Earth stedfast against impetuosities
of the water, able to make it swage sometimes one way, and
sometimes another, if it were not miraculously kept to rights.</p>

                        <p>And I am of the same opinion; nor doth my saying,
that the motion of the Earth is the Natural cause of the ebbing
and flowing, hinder, but that the said motion of the Earth may
be miraculous. Now reassuming our Argument, I apply, and
once again affirm, that it hath been hitherto unknown how it
might be that the Waters contained in our Mediterranean
Straights should make those motions, as we see it doth, if so be
the said Straight, or containing Vessel were immoveable. And
that which makes the difficulty, and rendreth this matter inextri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable,
are the things which I am about to speak of, and which
are daily observed. Therefore lend me your attention.</p>
                        <p>We are here in <hi>Venice,</hi> where at this time the Waters are low,

and that in the term of five or six hours the water do rise ten
<note n="*" place="margin">Palms.</note> hand breadths and more; that rise is not made by the first
water, which was said to be rarefied, but it is done by the acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of new Water: Water of the same sort with the former,
of the same brackishness, of the same density, of the same
weight: Ships, <hi>Simplicius,</hi> float therein as in the former, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
drawing an hairs breadth more water; a Barrel of this second
doth not weigh one single grain more or less than such another
quantity of the other, and retaineth the same coldness without
the least alteration: And it is, in a word, Water newly and visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
entred by the Channels and Mouth of the<note n="†" place="margin">
                              <hi>Lio</hi> is a fair Port in the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Gulph, lying N. E. from the City.</note> 
                           <hi>Lio.</hi> Consider
now, how and from whence it came thither. Are there happly
hereabouts any Gulphs or Whirle-pools in the bottom of the
Sea, by which the Earth drinketh in and spueth out the Water,
breathing as it were a great and monstruous Whale? But if this
be so, how comes it that the Water doth not flow in the space of
six hours in <hi>Ancona,</hi> in * <hi>Ragusa,</hi> in <hi>Corfu,</hi> where the Tide is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
small, and happly unobservable? Who will invent a way to
pour new Water into an immoveable Vessel, and to make that
it rise onely in one determinate part of it, and in other places
not? Will you say, that this new Water is borrowed from the
Ocean, being brought in by the Straight of <hi>Gibraltar?</hi> This
will not remove the doubt aforesaid, but will beget a greater.
And first tell me what ought to be the current of that Water,
that entering at the Straights mouth, is carried in six hours to
the remotest Creeks of the Mediterrane, at a distance of two
or three thousand Miles, and that returneth the same space again
in a like time at its going back? What would Ships do that lye out
at Sea? What would become of those that should be in the
Straights-mough in a continual precipice of a vast accumulation of
Waters, that entering in at a Channel but eight Miles broad, is to
give admittance to so much Water as in six hours over-floweth a
tract of many hundred Miles broad, &amp; thousands in length? What
Tygre, what Falcon runneth or flyeth with so much swiftness?
With the swiftness, I say, of above 400 Miles an hour. The cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
run (nor can it be denied) the long-wayes of the Gulph, but
so slowly, as that a Boat with Oars will out-go them, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
not without defalking for their wanderings. Moreover, if this
Water come in at the Straight, the other doubt yet remaineth,
namely, how it cometh to flow here so high in a place so remote,
without first rising a like or greater height in the parts more adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent?
In a word, I cannot think that either obstinacy, or sharpness
of wit can ever find an answer to these Objections, nor conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to maintain the stability of the Earth against them, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
within the bounds of Nature.</p>

                        <p>These effects being to ensue in consequence of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that naturally agree with the Earth, it is necessary that they
not onely meet with no impediment or obstacle, but that they do
follow easily, &amp; not onely that they follow with facility, but with
necessity, so as that it is impossible that it should succeed otherwise,
for such is the property &amp; condition of things natural &amp; true. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
therefore shewen the impossibility of rendring a reason of the
motions discerned in the Waters,<note place="margin">True and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral effects follow without difficulty.</note> &amp; at the same time to maintain
the immobility of the vessel that containeth them we may proceed
to enquire, whether the mobility of the Container may produce
the required effect, in the manner that it is observed to evene.</p>
                        <p>Two kinds of motions may be conferred upon a Vessel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Water therein contained,<note place="margin">Two sorts of motions of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Vessel, may make the contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned water to rise and fall.</note> may acquire a faculty of flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuating
in it, one while towards one side, and another while
towards another; and there one while to ebbe, and another
while to flow. The first is, when first one, and then another of
those sides is declined, for then the Water running towards the
inclining side, will alternately be higher and lower, sometimes
on one side, and sometimes on another. But because that this
rising and abating is no other than a recession and accession to the
centre of the Earth, such a motion cannot be ascribed to the Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the said Earth, that are the Vessels which contain the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
the parts of which Vessel cannot by any whatsoever motion
assigned to the Earth,<note place="margin">The Cavities of the Earth cannot approach or go far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of the same.</note> be made to approach or recede from the
centre of the same: The other sort of motion is, when the
Vessel moveth (without inclining in the least) with a progressive
motion, not uniform, but that changeth velocity, by sometimes
accellerating, and other times retarding: from which disparity
it would follow,<note place="margin">The progpessive and uneven motion may make the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contained in a Vessel to run to and fro.</note> that the VVater contained in the Vessel its true,
but not fixed fast to it, as its other solid parts, but by reason of
its fluidity, as if it were separated and at liberty, and not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to follow all the mutations of its Container, in the retardation
of the Vessel, it keeping part of the <hi>impetus</hi> before conceived,
would run towards the the preceding part, whereupon it would
of necessity come to rise; and on the contrary, if new velocity
should be added to the Vessel, with retaining parts of its tardity,
staying somewhat behind, before it could habituate it self to the
new <hi>impetus,</hi> it would hang back towards the following part,
where it would come to rise something. The which effects we
may plainly declare and make out to the Sense by the example of
one of those same Barks yonder, which continually come from
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:96976:208"/>
                           <note n="*" place="margin">A Town ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing S. E. of <hi>Venice</hi>
                           </note> 
                           <hi>Lizza-Fusina,</hi> laden with fresh water, for the service of the City.
Let us therefore fancy one of those Barks, to come from thence
with moderate velocity along the Lake, carrying the water gently,
of which it is full: and then either by running a ground, or by
some other impediment that it shall meet with, let it be notably
retarded. The water therein contained shall not, by that means,
lose, as the Bark doth, its pre-conceived <hi>impetus,</hi> but retaining
the same, shall run forwards towards the prow, where it shall
rise notably, falling as much a stern. But if, on the contrary,
the said Bark, in the midst of its smooth course, shall have a new
velocity, with notable augmentation added to it, the water con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
before it can habituate it self thereto, continuing in its
tardity, shall stay behinde, namely a stern, where of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
it shall mount, and abate for the same at the prow. This
effect is undoubted and manifest, and may hourly be experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
in which I desire that for the present three particulars may
be noted. The first is, that to make the water to rise on one
side of the vessel, there is no need of new water, nor that it run
thither, forsaking the other side. The second is, that the water
in the middle doth not rise or fall notably, unlesse the course of
the Bark were not before that very swift, and the shock or other
arrest that held it exceeding strong and sudden, in which case its
possible, that not only all the water might run forwards, but
that the greater part thereof might issue forth of the Bark: and
the same also would ensue, whilst that being under sail in a
smooth course, a most violent <hi>impetus</hi> should, upon an instant,
overtake it: But when to its calme motion there is added a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
retardation or incitation, the middle parts (as I said) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>observedly
rise and fall: and the other parts, according as they
are neerer to the middle, rise the lesse; and the more remote,
more. The third is, that whereas the parts about the midst do
make little alteration in rising and falling, in respect of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the sides; on the contrary, they run forwards and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
very much, in comparison of the extreams. Now, my
Masters, that which the Bark doth, in respect of the water by it
contained, and that which the water contained doth, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the Bark its container, is the self-same, to an hair, with
that which the Mediterranean Vessel doth, in respect of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in it contained, and that which the waters contained do, in
respect of the Mediterranean Vessel their container.<note place="margin">The parts of the terrestrial Globe accelerate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard in their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> It follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

that the Mediterrane, and all the other Straits; and in a word,

thereby assigned to all the said Globe taken collectively.</p>

of the flux and reflux.</p>
                        <p>We have said,<note place="margin">Demonstrations how the parts of the terrestriall Globe accelerate and retard.</note> that the motions assigned to the Terrestrial
Globe are two, the first Annual, made by its centre about the
circumference of the Grand Orb, under the Ecliptick, according
to the order of the Signes, that is, from West to East; the other
made by the said Globe revolving about its own centre in twenty
four hours; and this likewise from West to East: though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
an Axis somewhat inclined, and not equidistant from that
of the Annual conversion. From the mixture of these two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
each of it self uniform, I say, that there doth result an
uneven and deformed motion in the parts of the Earth. Which,
that it may the more easily be understood, I will explain, by
drawing a Scheme thereof. And first, about the centre A <hi>[in
Fig. 1. of this Dialogue]</hi> I will describe the circumference of
the Grand Orb B C,<note place="margin">The parts of a Circle regularly moved about its own centre move in divers times with contrary motions.</note> in which any point being taken, as B,
about it as a centre we will describe this lesser circle D E F G,
representing the Terrestrial Globe; the which we will suppose
to run thorow the whole circumference of the Grand Orb, with
its centre B, from the West towards the East, that is, from the
part B towards C; and moreover we will suppose the Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial
Globe to turn about its own centre B likewise from West
to East, that is, according to the succession of the points
D E F G, in the space of twenty four hours. But here we
ought carefully to note, that a circle turning round upon its
own centre, each part of it must, at different times, move with
contrary motions: the which is manifest, considering that whilst
the parts of the circumference, about the point D move to the
left hand, that is, towards E, the opposite parts that are about F,
approach to the right hand, that is, towards G; so that when
the parts D shall be in F, their motion shall be contrary to what
it was before. when it was in D. Furthermore, the same time
that the parts E descend, if I may so speak, towards F, those in
G ascend towards D. It being therefore presupposed, that
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:96976:209"/>
there are such contrarieties of motions in the parts of the Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial
Surface,<note place="margin">The mixture of the two motions annnal and diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, causeth the inequality in the motion of the parts of the terrestrial Globe.</note> whilst it turneth round upon its own centre, it is
necessary, that in conjoyning this Diurnal Motion, with the other
Annual, there do result an absolute motion for the parts of the
said Terrestrial Superficies, one while very accelerate, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
while as slow again. The which is manifest, considering
first the parts about D, the absolute motion of which shall be
extream swift, as that which proceedeth from two motions made
both one way, namely, towards the left hand; the first of
which is part of the Annual Motion, common to all the parts of
the Globe, the other is that of the said point D., carried likewise
to the left, by the Diurnal Revolution; so that, in this case, the
Diurnal motion increaseth and accelerateth the Annual. The
contrary to which happeneth in the opposite part F, which, whilst
it is by the common annual motion carried, together with the
whole Globe, towards the left, it happeneth to be carried by the
Diurnal conversion also towards the right: so that the Diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
motion by that means detracteth from the Annual, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the absolute motion, resulting from the composition of both
the other, is much retarded. Again, about the points E and G,
the absolute motion becometh in a manner equal to the simple
Annual one, in regard that little or nothing increaseth or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth
it, as not tending either to the left hand, or to the right,
but downwards and upwards. We will conclude therefore, that
like as it is true, that the motion of the whole Globe, and of
each of its parts, would be equal and uniforme, in case they did
move with one single motion, whether it were the meer Annual,
or the single Diurnal Revolution, so it is requisite, that mixing
those two motions together, there do result thence for the parts
of the said Globe irregular motions, one while accelerated, and
another while retarded, by means of the additions or substracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Diurnal conversion from the annual circulation. So
that, if it be true (and most true it is, as experience proves) that
the acceleration and retardation of the motion of the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
makes water contained therein to run to and again the long
wayes of it, and to rise and fall in its extreames, who will make
scruple of granting, that the said effect may, nay ought to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in the Sea-waters, contained within their Vessels, subject to
such like alterations, and especially in those that distend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
long-wayes from West to East, which is the course that
the motion of those same Vessels steereth?<note place="margin">The most potent and primary cause of the ebbing and flowing.</note> Now this is the
most potent and primary cause of the ebbing and flowing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the which no such effect would ensue. But because the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
accidents are many and various, that in several places and
times are observed, which must of necessity have dependance
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:96976:209"/>
on other different concomitant causes, although they ought all
to have connexion with the primary; therefore it is convenient
that we propound and examine the several accidents that may
be the causes of such different effects.</p>
                        <p>The first of which is,<note place="margin">Sundry accidents that happen in the ebbings &amp; flowings The first acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</note> that when ever the water, by means of a
notable retardation or acceleration of the motion of the Vessel,
its container, shall have acquired a cause of running towards this
or that extream,<note place="margin">The Water rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in one end of the Vessel return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of its self to <hi>Aequilibrium.</hi>
                           </note> and shall be raised in the one, and abated in the
other, it shall not neverthelesse continue, for any time in that
state, when once the primary cause is ceased: but by vertue of
its own gravity and natural inclination to level and grow, even it
shall speedily return backwards of its own accord, and, as being
grave and fluid, shall not only move towards <hi>Aequilibrium;</hi> but
being impelled by its own <hi>impetus,</hi> shall go beyond it, rising in
the part, where before it was lowest; nor shall it stay here, but
returning backwards anew, with more reiterated reciprocations of
its undulations, it shall give us to know, that it will not from a
velocity of motion, once conceived, reduce it self, in an instant,
to the privation thereof, and to the state of rest, but will succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively,
by decreasing a little and a little, reduce it self unto the
same, just in the same manner as we see a weight hanging at a
cord, after it hath been once removed from its state of rest, that
is, from its perpendicularity, of its own accord, to return thither
and settle it self, but not till such time as it shall have often
past to one side, and to the other, with its reciprocall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations.</p>
                        <p>The second accident to be observed is,<note place="margin">In the shorter Vessels the undula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of waters are more frequent.</note> that the before-declared
reciprocations of motion come to be made and repeated
with greater or lesser frequency, that is, under shorter or longer
times, according to the different lengths of the Vessels contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the waters; so that in the shorter spaces the reciprocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are more frequent, and in the longer more rare: just as in
the former example of pendent bodies, the vibrations of those
that are hanged to longer cords are seen to be lesse frequent,
than those of them that hang at shorter strings.</p>
                        <p>And here,<note place="margin">The greater profundity maketh the undulations of waters more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</note> for a third observation, it is to be noted, that not
onely the greater or lesser length of the Vessel is a cause that
the water maketh its reciprocations under different times; but
the greater or lesser profundity worketh the same effect. And
it happeneth, that of waters contained in receptacles of equall
length, but of unequal depth, that which shall be the deepest,
maketh its undulations under shorter times, and the reciprocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the shallower waters are lesse frequent.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, there are two effects worthy to be noted, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
observed, which the water worketh in those its vibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:96976:210"/>
the one is its rising and falling alternately towards the
one and other extremity;<note place="margin">Water riseth &amp; falleth in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream parts of the Vessel, and runneth to and fro in the midst.</note> the other is its moving and running, to
so speak, Horizontally forwards and backwards. Which two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
motions differently reside in divers parts of the Water:
for its extream parts are those which most eminently rise and fall;
those in the middle never absolutely moving upwards, and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
of the rest successively those that are neerest to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams
rise and fall proportionally more than the remote: but on
the contrary, touching the other progressive motion forwards
and backwards, the middle parts move notably, going and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning,
and the waters that are in the extream parts gain no
ground at all; save onely in case that in their rising they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow
their banks, and break forth of their first channel and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle;
but where there is the obstacle of banks to keep them
in, they onely rise and fall; which yet hindereth not the waters
in the middle from fluctuating to and again; which likewise
the other parts do in proportion, undulating more or lesse,
according as they are neerer or more remote from the middle.</p>
                        <p>The fifth particular accident ought the more attentively to be
considered,<note place="margin">An accident of the Earths motions impossible to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to practice by art.</note> in that it is impossible to represent the effect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
by an experiment or example; and the accident is this. In
the vessels by us framed with art, and moved, as the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
Bark, one while more, and another while lesse swiftly,
the acceleration and retardation is imparted in the same manner
to all the vessel, and to every part of it; so that whilst <hi>v. g.</hi> the
Bark forbeareth to move, the parts precedent retard no more
than the subsequent, but all equally partake of the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tardment;
and the self-same holds true of the acceleration,
namely, that conferring on the Bark a new cause of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
velocity, the Prow and Poop both accelerate in one and
the same manner. But in huge great vessels, such as are the very
long bottomes of Seas, albeit they also are no other than cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
cavities made in the solidity of the Terrestrial Globe,
it alwayes admirably happeneth, that their extreams do not
unitedly equall, and at the same moments of time increase
and diminish their motion, but it happeneth that when one of its
extreames hath, by vertue of the commixtion of the two
Motions, Diurnal, and Annual, greatly retarded its velocity,
the other extream is animated with an extream swift motion.
Which for the better understanding of it we will explain, reas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
a Scheme like to the former; in which if we do but sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a tract of Sea to be long, <hi>v. g.</hi> a fourth part, as is the arch
B C <hi>[in Fig. 2.]</hi> because the parts B are, as hath been already
declared, very swift in motion, by reason of the union of the
two motions diurnal and annual, towards one and the same way,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:96976:210"/>
but the part C at the same time is retarded in its motion, as be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
deprived of the progression dependant on the diurnal motion:
If we suppose, I say, a tract of Sea as long as the arch B C, we
have already seen, that its extreams shall move in the same time
with great inequality. And extreamly different would the velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities
of a tract of Sea be that is in length a semicircle, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the position B C D, in regard that the extream B would
be in a most accelerate motion, and the other D, in a most slow
one; and the intermediate parts towards C, would be in a
moderate motion. And according as the said tracts of Sea shall
be shorter, they shall lesse participate of this extravagant acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
of being in some hours of the day with their parts diversly
affected by velocity and tardity of motion. So that, if, as in the first
case, we see by experience that the acceleration and retardation,
though equally imparted to all the parts of the conteining Vessel,
is the cause that the water contained fluctuates too and again, what
may we think would happen in a Vessel so admirably disposed,
that retardation and acceleration of motion is very unequally
contributed to its parts? Certainly we must needs grant that
greater and more wonderful causes of the commotions in the
Water ought to be looked for. And though it may seem im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to some, that in artificial Machines and Vessels we should
be able to experiment the effects of such an accident; yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse
it is not absolutely impossible to be done; and I have
by me the model of an Engine, in which the effect of these admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
commixtions of motions may be particularly observed. But
as to what concerns our present purpose, that which you may

                        <p>I for my own particular very well conceive that this
admirable accident ought necessarily to evene in the Straights of
Seas, and especially in those that distend themselves for a great
length from VVest to East; namely according to the course of
the motions of the Terrestrial Globe; and as it is in a certain
manner unthought of, and without a president among the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
possible to be made by us, so it is not hard for me to believe,
that effects may be derived from the same, which are not to be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitated
by our artificial experiments.</p>

                        <p>These things being declared, it is time that we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to examine the particular accidents, which, together with
their diversities, are observed by experience in the ebbing and
flowing of the waters.<note place="margin">Reasons renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the particn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar accidents ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in the eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bings and flowings.</note> And first we need not think it hard to
guesse whence it happeneth, that in Lakes, Pooles, and also in the
lesser Seas there is no notable flux and reflux; the which hath
two very solid reasons. The one is, that by reason of the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:96976:211"/>
of the Vessel,<note place="margin">Second causes why in small Seas and in Lakes there are no ebbings and flowings.</note> in its acquiring in several hours of the day
several degrees of velocity, they are with very little difference
acquired by all its parts; for as well the precedent as the subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
that is to say, both the Eastern and VVestern parts, do
accelerate and retard almost in the same manner; and withal
making that alteration by little and little, and not by giving the
motion of the conteining Vessel a sudden check, and retard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or a sudden and great impulse or acceleration; both it
and all its parts, come to be gently and equally impressed with
the same degrees of velocity; from which uniformity it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that also the conteined water with but small resistance and
opposition, receiveth the same impressions, and by consequence
doth give but very obscure signes of its rising or falling, or of its
running towards one part or another. The which effect is likewise
manifestly to be seen in the little artificial Vessels, wherein the
contained water doth receive the self same impressions of veloci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
when ever the acceleration and retardation is made by gentle
and uniform proportion. But in the Straights and Bays that for a
great length distend themselves from East to West, the accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and retardation is more notable and more uneven, for
that one of its extreams shall be much retarded in motion, and
the other shall at the same time move very swiftly: The reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal
libration or levelling of the water proceeding from the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petus</hi>
that it had conceived from the motion of its container.
The which libration, as hath been noted, hath its undulations
very frequent in small Vessels; from whence ensues, that though
there do reside in the Terrestrial motions the cause of confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
on the waters a motion onely from twelve hours to twelve
hours, for that the motion of the conteining Vessels do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
accelerate and extreamly retard but once every day,
and no more; yet neverthelesse this same second cause depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the gravity of the water which striveth to reduce it self to
equilibration, and that according to the shortnesse of the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
hath its reciprocations of one, two, three, or more hours, this
intermixing with the first, which also it self in small Vessels is
very little, it becommeth upon the whole altogether insensible.
For the primary cause, which hath the periods of twelve hours,
having not made and end of imprinting the precedent commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it is overtaken and opposed by the other second, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
on the waters own weight, which according to the brevity
and profundity of the Vessel, hath the time of its undulations of
one, two, three, four, or more hours; and this contending
with the other former one, disturbeth and removeth it, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
it to come to the height, no nor to the half of its moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and by this contestation the evidence of the ebbing and
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:96976:211"/>
flowing is wholly annihilated, or at least very much obscured.
I passe by the continual alteration of the air, which disquieting
the water, permits us not to come to a certainty, whether any,
though but small, encrease or abatement of half an inch, or
losse, do reside in the Straights, or receptacles of water not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
a degree or two in length.</p>
                        <p>I come in the second place to resolve the question,<note place="margin">The reason gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, why the eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bings and flowings, for the most part, are every six hours.</note> why, there
not residing any vertue in the primary principle of commoving
the waters, save onely every twelve hours, that is to say, once
by the greatest velocity, and once by the greatest tardity of
motion; the ebbings and flowings should yet neverthelesse ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be every six hours. To which is answered, that this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
cannot any wayes be taken from the primary cause
onely; but there is a necessity of introducing the secondary cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
as namely the greater or lesse length of the Vessels, and
the greater or lesse depth of the waters in them conteined.
Which causes although they have not any operation in the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the waters, those operations belonging to the sole prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
cause, without which no ebbing or flowing would happen,
yet neverthelesse they have a principal share in determining the
times or periods of the reciprocations, and herein their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is so powerful, that the primary cause must of force give
way unto them. The period of six hours therefore is no more
proper or natural than those of other intervals of times, though
indeed its the most observed, as agreeing with our Mediterrane,
which was the onely Sea that for many Ages was navigated:
though neither is that period observed in all its parts; for
that in some more angust places, such as are the <hi>Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spont,</hi>
and the <hi>Aegean</hi> Sea, the periods are much shorter,
and also very divers amongst themselves; for which diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities,
and their causes incomprehensible to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> some
say, that after he had a long time observed it upon some
cliffes of <hi>Negropont,</hi> being brought to desperation, he threw
himself into the adjoyning <hi>Euripus,</hi> and voluntarily drowned
himself.</p>
                        <p>In the third place we have the reason ready at hand,<note place="margin">The cause why some Seas, though very long, suffer no ebbing and flowing.</note> whence
it commeth to passe, that some Seas, although very long, as is
the Red Sea, are almost altogether exempt from Tides, which
happeneth because their length extendeth not from East to
West, but rather transversly from the Southeast to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west;
but the motions of the Earth going from West to East;
the impulses of the water, by that means, alwayes happen to fall
in the Meridians, and do not move from parallel to parallel;
insomuch that in the Seas that extend themselves athwart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Poles, and that the contrary way are narrow, there is
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:96976:212"/>
no cause of ebbing and flowing, save onely by the participation
of another Sea, wherewith it hath communication, that is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to great commotions.</p>
                        <p>In the fourth place we shall very easily find out the reason
why the fluxes and refluxes are greatest,<note place="margin">Ebbings and flowings why grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test in the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of Gulphs, and least in the middle parts.</note> as to the waters rising
and falling in the utmost extremities of Gulphs, and least in the
intermediate parts; as daily experience sheweth here in <hi>Venice,</hi>
lying in the farther end of the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea, where that diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
commonly amounts to five or six feet; but in the places
of the Mediterrane, far distant from the extreams, that mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is very small, as in the Isles of <hi>Corsica</hi> and <hi>Sardinnia,</hi> and
in the Strands of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Ligorne,</hi> where it exceeds not half a
foot; we shall understand also, why on the contrary, where
the risings and fallings are small, the courses and recourses are
great: I say it is an easie thing to understand the causes of these
accidents, seeing that we meet with many manifest occurrences
of the same nature in every kind of Vessel by us artificially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
in which the same effects are observed naturally to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
upon our moving it unevenly, that is, one while faster, and
another while flower.</p>
                        <p>Moreover,<note place="margin">Why in narrow places the course of the waters is more swift than in larger.</note> considering in the fifth place, that the same
quantity of Water being moved, though but gently, in a spatious
Channel, comming afterwards to go through a narrow passage,
will of necessity run, with great violence, we shall not finde it hard
to comprehend the cause of the great Currents that are made
in the narrow Channel that separateth <hi>Calabria</hi> from <hi>Sicilia:</hi>
for that all the Waters that, by the spaciousnesse of the Isle,
and by the <hi>Ionick</hi> Gulph, happens to be pent in the Eastern
part of the Sea, though it do in that, by reason of its largeness,
gently descend towards the West, yet neverthelesse, in that it
is pent up in the <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> it floweth with great violence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Scilla</hi> and <hi>Caribdis,</hi> and maketh a great agitation. Like to
which, and much greater, is said to be betwixt <hi>Africa</hi> and the
great Isle of St. <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> where the Waters of the two vast
Seas, <hi>Indian</hi> and <hi>Ethiopick,</hi> that lie round it, must needs be
straightned into a lesse Channel between the said Isle and the
<hi>Ethiopian</hi> Coast. And the Currents must needs be very great
in the Straights of <hi>Megallanes,</hi> which joyne together the
vast Oceans of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and <hi>Del Zur,</hi> called also the <hi>Pacifick</hi>
Sea.</p>

some more abstruse and incredible accidents, which are obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
upon this occasion, we make a considerable reflection upon
the two principal causes of ebbings and flowings, afterwards
compounding and mixing them together. The first and simplest
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:96976:212"/>
of which is (as hath often been said) the determinate accelera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and retardation of the parts of the Earth, from whence
the Waters have a determinate period put to their decursions
towards the East, and return towards the West, in the time of
twenty four hours. The other is that which dependeth on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
gravity of the Water, which being once commoved by the
primary cause, seeketh, in the next place, to reduce it self to <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilibrium,</hi>
with iterated reciprocations; which are not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by one sole and prefixed time; but have as many varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of times as are the different lengths and profundities of the
receptacles, and Straights of Seas; and by what dependeth on
this second principle, they would ebbe and flow, some in one
hour, others in two, in four, in six, in eight, in ten, &amp;c. Now if
we begin to put together the first cause, which hath its set Period
from twelve hours to twelve hours, with some one of the secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary,
that hath its Period <hi>verb. grat.</hi> from five hours to five
hours, it would come to passe, that at sometimes the primary
cause and secondary would accord to make impulses both one
the same way; and in this concurrency, and (as one may call
it) unanimous conspiration the flowings shall be great. At other
times it happening that the primary impulse doth, in a certain
manner, oppose that which the secondary Period would make,
and in this contest one of the Principles being taken away, that
which the other would give, will weaken the commotion of the
Waters, and the Sea will return to a very tranquil State, and
almost immoveable. And at other times, according as the two
aforesaid Principles shall neither altogether contest, nor altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
concur, there shall be other kinds of alterations made in
the increase and diminution of the ebbing and flowing. It may
likewise fall out that two Seas, considerably great and which
communicate by some narrow Channel, may chance to have, by
reason of the mixtion of the two Principles of motion, one
cause to flow at the time that the other hath cause to move a
contrary way; in which case in the Channel, whereby they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imbogue
themselves into each other, there do extraordinary
conturbations insue, with opposite and vortick motions, and
most dangerous boilings and breakings, as frequent relations
and experiences do assure us. From such like discordant moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
dependent not onely on the different positions and longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
but very much also upon the different profundities of the
Seas, which have the said intercourse there do happen at some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
different commotions in the Waters, irregular, and that
can be reduced to no rules of observation, the reasons of which
have much troubled, and alwayes do trouble Mariners, for that
they meet with them without seeing either impulse of winds, or
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:96976:213"/>
other eminent aereal alteration that might occasion the same; of
which disturbance of the Air we ought to make great account
in other accidents, and to take it for a third and accidental
cause, able to alter very much the observation of the effects de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
on the secondary and more essential causes. And it is
not to be doubted, but that impetuous windes, continuing to
blow, for example, from the East, they shall retein the Waters
and prohibit the reflux or ebbing; whereupon the second and
third reply of the flux or tide overtaking the former, at the
hours prefixed, they will swell very high; and being thus born
up for some dayes, by the strength of the Winds, they shall rise
more than usual, making extraordinary inundations.</p>
                        <p>We ought also, (and this shall serve for a seventh Probleme)
to take notice of another cause of motion dependant on the
great abundance of the Waters of great Rivers that discharge
themselves into Seas of no great capacity,<note place="margin">The cause why, in some narrow Channels, we see the Sea-waters run alwayes one way.</note> whereupon in the
Straits or <hi>Bosphori</hi> that communicate with those Seas, the Waters
are seen to run always one way: as it happeneth in the <hi>Thraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Bosphorus</hi> below <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where the water alwayes
runneth from the <hi>Black-Sea,</hi> towards the <hi>Propontis:</hi> For in the
said <hi>Black-Sea</hi> by reason of its shortnesse, the principal causes
of ebbing and flowing are but of small force. But, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
very great Rivers falling into the same, those huge de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxions
of water being to passe and disgorge themselves by the
the straight, the<note n="*" place="margin">Or current.</note> course is there very notable and alwayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the South. Where moreover we ought to take notice, that
the said Straight or Channel, albeit very narrow, is not subject
to perturbations, as the Straight of <hi>Scilla</hi> and <hi>Carybdis;</hi> for that
that hath the <hi>Black-Sea</hi> above towards the North, and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pontis,</hi>
the <hi>Aegean,</hi> and the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Seas joyned unto it,
though by a long tract towards the South; but now, as we have
observed, the Seas, though of never so great length, lying North
and South, are not much subject to ebbings and flowings; but
because the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Straight is situate between the parts of the
Mediterrane distended for a long tract or distance from West to
East, that is, according to the course of the fluxes and refluxes;
therefore in this the agitations are very great; and would be
much more violent between <hi>Hercules Pillars,</hi> in case the
Straight of <hi>Gibraltar</hi> did open lesse; and those of the Straight of
<hi>Magellanes</hi> are reported to be extraordinary violent.</p>
                        <p>This is what, for the present, cometh into my mind to say unto
you about the causes of this first period diurnal of the Tide, and
its various accidents, touching which, if you have any thing to
offer, you may let us hear it, that so we may afterwards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the other two periods, monethly and annual.</p>

                        <p>In my opinion, it cannot be denied, but that your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
carrieth with it much of probability, arguing, as we say,
<hi>ex suppositione,</hi> namely, granting that the Earth moveth with
the two motions assigned it by <hi>Copernicus:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The Hypothesis of the Earths mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility taken in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Tide, opposed.</note> but if that motion
be disproved, all that you have said is vain, and insignificant:
and for the disproval of that <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> it is very manifestly
hinted by your Discourse it self. You, with the supposition of
the two Terrestrial motions, give a reason of the ebbing and
flowing; and then again, arguing circularly, from the ebbing
and flowing, draw the reason and confirmation of those very
motions; and so proceeding to a more specious Discourse, you
say that the Water, as being a fluid body, and not tenaciously
annexed to the Earth, is not constrained punctually to obey eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of its motions, from which you afterwards infer its ebbing
and flowing, Now I, according to your own method, argue
the quite contrary, and say; the Air is much more tenuous, and
fluid than the Water, and lesse annexed to the Earths superfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
to which the Water, if it be for nothing else, yet by reason
of its gravity that presseth down upon the same more than the
light Air, adhereth; therefore the Air is much obliged to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the motions of the Earth: and therefore were it so, that the
Earth did move in that manner, we the inhabitants of it, and
carried round with like velocity by it, ought perpetually to feel
a Winde from the East that beateth upon us with intolerable
force. And that so it ought to fall out, quotidian experience as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sureth
us: for if with onely riding post, at the speed of eight or
ten miles an hour in the tranquil Air, the incountering of it with
our face seemeth to us a Winde that doth not lightly blow upon
us, what should we expect from our rapid course of 800. or a
thousand miles an hour, against the Air, that is, free from that
motion? And yet, notwithstanding we cannot perceive any
thing of that nature.</p>

                        <p>To this objection that hath much of likelihood in it,<note place="margin">The answer to the objections made against the motion of the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial Globe.</note> I
reply, that its true, the Air is of greater tenuity and levity; and,
by reason of its levity, lesse adherent to the Earth than Water so
much more grave and<note n="*" place="margin">Corpulenta</note> bulky; but yet the consequence is false
that you infer from these qualities; namely, that upon account
of that its levity, tenuity, and lesse adherence to the Earth, it
should be more exempt than the Water from following the
Terrestrial Motions; so as that to us, who absolutely pertake of
of them, the said exemption should be sensible and manifest;
nay, it happeneth quite contrary; for, if you well remember, the
cause of the ebbing and flowing of the Water assigned by us,
consisteth in the Waters not following the unevennesse of the
motion of its Vessel, but retaining the <hi>impetus</hi> conceived before,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:96976:214"/>
without diminishing or increasing it according to the precise rate
of its diminishing or increasing in its Vessel. Because therefore
that in the conservation and retention of the <hi>impetus</hi> before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<note place="margin">The Water more apt to conserve an <hi>impetus</hi> conceived, then the Air.</note> the disobedience to a new augmentation or diminution of
motion consisteth, that moveable that shall be most apt for such
a retention, shall be also most commodious to demonstrate the
effect that followeth in consequence of that retention. Now how
much the Water is disposed to maintain such a conceived agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
though the causes cease that impress the same, the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Seas extreamly disturbed by impetuous Winds shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us; the Billows of which, though the Air be grown calm, and
the Wind laid, for a long time after continue in motion: As the
Sacred Poet pleasantly sings,
<q>Qual l'alto Egeo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>And that long continuing rough after a storm,<note place="margin">Light bodies easier to be moved than heavy, but less apt to conserve the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> dependeth on
the gravity of the water: For, as I have elsewhere said, light bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
are much easier to be moved than the more grave, but yet
are so much the less apt to conserve the motion imparted, when
once the moving cause ceaseth. Whence it comes that the Aire,
as being of it self very light and thin, is easily mov'd by any very
small force, yet it is withall very unable to hold on its motion,
the Mover once ceasing. Therefore, as to the Aire which envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons
the Terrestrial Globe, I would fay, that by reason of its
adherence, it is no lesse carried about therewith then the Water;
and especially that part which is contained in its vessels; which
vessels are the valleys enclosed with Mountains.<note place="margin">Its more rational that the Air be commoved by the rugged surface of the Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than by the Celestial motion.</note> And we may
with much more reason affirm that this same part of the Air is
carried round, and born forwards by the rugged parts of the
Earth, than that the higher is whirl'd about by the motion of the
Heavens, as ye <hi>Peripateticks</hi> maintain.</p>
                        <p>What hath been hitherto spoken, seems to me a sufficient an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to the allegation of <hi>Simplitius;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The revolution of the Earth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by a new argument taken from the Air.</note> yet nevertheless with a new
instance and solution, founded upon an admirable experiment, I
will superabundantly satisfie him, and confirm to <hi>Sagredus</hi> the
mobility of the Earth. I have told you that the Air, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
that part of it which ascendeth not above the tops of the
highest Mountains, is carried round by the uneven parts of the
Earths surface: from whence it should seem, that it must of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
come to passe, that in case the superficies of the Earth
were not uneven, but smooth and plain, no cause would remain
for drawing the Air along with it, or at least for revolving it with
so much uniformity. Now the surface of this our Globe, is not
all craggy and rugged, but there are exceeding great tracts very
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:96976:214"/>
even, to wit, the surfaces of very vast Seas, which being also far
remote from the continuate ledges of Mountains which environ
it, seem to have no faculty of carrying the super-ambient Air
along therewith: and not carrying it about, we may perceive what
will of consequence ensue in those places.</p>

be alwayes on the losing hand; and therefore it would be better
to give over: Nevertheless, that we may not cheat our third man
we will play on. We said even now, and with some addition we
reitterate it, that the Ayr as if it were a thin and fluid body, and
not solidly conjoyned with the Earth, seem'd not to be necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
to obey its motion; unlesse so far as the cragginess of the
terrestrial superficies, transports and carries with it a part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
contigious thereunto; which doth not by any great space ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the greatest altitude of Mountains: the which portion of Air
ought to be so much less repugnant to the terrestrial conversion,
by how much it is repleat with vapours,<note place="margin">The vaporous parts of the earth, partake of its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> fumes, and exhalations,
matters all participating of terrene qualities, and consequently
apt of their own nature to the same motions. But where there are
wanting the causes of motion, that is, where the surface of the
Globe hath great levels, and where there is less mixture of the
terrene vapours, there the cause whereby the ambient Air is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to give entire obedience to the terrestrial conversion will
cease in part; so that in such places, whilst the Earth revolveth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the East, there will be continually a wind perceived which
will beat upon us, blowing from the East towards the West:
and such gales will be the more sensible, where the revolution of
the Globe is most swift; which will be in places more remote from
the Poles, and approaching to the greatest Circle of the diurnal
conversion. But now <hi>de facto</hi> experience much confirmeth this
Phylosophical argumentation; for in the spatious Seas, and in their
parts most remote from Land, and situate under the Torrid Zone,
that is bounded by the Tropicks, where there are none of those

thence towards the East is difficult and uncertain, and not to be
made by the same Rhumb, but must vere more to Land-ward, to
recover other Winds, which we may call accidentary and tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary,
produced from other Principles, as those that inhabit the

indifferently from all parts of the Earth, and make rough the Seas
remote from the Equinoctial, and environed by the rugged Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the Earth; which is as much as to say environ'd with
those perturbations of Air, that confound that primary Gale.
The which, in case these accidental impediments were removed,
would be continually felt, and especially upon the Sea. Now

which as I believe is unknown unto you, and which likewise may
serve to confirm the same conclusion: You <hi>Salviatus</hi> alledged,
That Accident which Sailers meet with between the Tropicks;
I mean that perpetual Gale of Winde that beats upon them from
the East, of which I have an account from those that have many
times made the Voyage: And moreover (which is very obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable)
I understand that the Mariners do not call it a <hi>Wind,</hi> but
by another<note n="*" place="margin">Which Wind with our English Mariners is called the <hi>Trade-wind.</hi>
                           </note> name, which I do not now remember, taken haply
from its so fixed and constant Tenor; which when they have met
with, they tie up their shrouds and other cordage belonging to
the Sails, and without any more need of touching them, though
they be in a sleep, they can continue their course. Now this constant
Trade-wind was known to be such by its continual blowing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
interruptions; for if it were interrupted by other Windes, it
would not have been acknowledged for a singular Effect, and
different from the rest: from which I will infer, That it may be
that also our Mediterranean Sea doth partake of the like accident;
but it is not observed, as being frequently altered by the conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of other windes. And this I say, not without good grounds,
yea upon very probable conjectures whch came unto my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
from that which tendred it self to my notice on occasion of
the voyage that I made into <hi>Syria,</hi> going Consul for this Nation

that in exactness of account the returns hither, that is the voiages

that one with another, the Eastern windes are stronger then the

                        <p>I desire not that my opinion should serve or stand for
a measure, whereby you should judge of others thoughts; for
as I have often said, I am inconsiderable in these kinde of studies,
and such things may come into the mindes of those that are enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into the deepest passages of Philosophy, as I could never think
of; as having (according to the Proverb) scarce kist her Maid:
yet nevertheless, to give you my sudden thoughts, I shall tell
you, That of those effects by you recounted, and particularly the
last, there may in my judgement very sufficient Reasons be given
without the Earths mobility, by the mobility of the Heavens one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
never introducing any novelty more, than the inversion of
that which you your self propose unto us. It hath been received
by the <hi>Peripatetick</hi> Schools,<note place="margin">It is demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted inverting the argument, that the perpetual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Air from East to West cometh from the motion of Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </note> that the Element of Fire, and also a
great part of the Aire is carried about according to the Diurnal
conversion from East to West, by the contact of the Concave of
the Lunar Orb, as by the Vessel their container. Now without
going out of your track, I will that we determine the Quantity of
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:96976:216"/>
the Aire which partaketh of that motion to distend so low as to
the Tops of the highest Hills,<note place="margin">It is demonstrated inverting the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that the perpetual motion of the Air from East to VVest, cometh from the motion of Heaven.</note> and that likewise they would reach
to the Earth, if those Mountains did not impede them, which
agreeth with what you say: For as you affirm, the Air, which is
invironed by ledges of Mountains, to be carried about by the
asperity of the moveable Earth; we on the contrary say, That
the whole Element of Air is carried about by the motion of
Heaven, that part only excepted which lyeth below those bodies,
which is hindred by the asperity of the immoveable Earth. And
whereas you said, That in case that asperity should be removed,
the Air would also cease to be whirld about; we may say,
That the said asperity being removed, the whole Aire would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
its motion. Whereupon, because the surfaces of spacious
Seas are smooth, and even; the Airs motion shall continue upon
those, alwaies blowing from the East: And this is more sensibly
perceived in Climates lying under the Line, and within the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks,
where the motion of Heaven is swifter; and like as that
Celestial motion is able to bear before it all the Air that is at
liberty, so we may very rationally affirm that it contributeth the
same motion to the Water moveable, as being fluid and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected
to the immobility of the Earth:<note place="margin">The motion of the VVater dependeth on the motion of Heaven.</note> And with so much the
more confidence may we affirm the same, in that by your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
that motion ought to be very small in resect of the efficient
Cause; which begirting in a natural day the whole Terrestrial
Globe, passeth many hundreds of miles an hour, and especially
towards the Equinoctial; whereas in the currents of the open Sea,
it moveth but very few miles an hour. And thus the voiages to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the West shall come to be commodious and expeditious,
not onely by reason of the perpetual Eastern Gale, but of the
course also of the Waters; from which course also perhaps the
Ebbing and Flowing may come, by reason of the different scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the Terrestrial Shores:<note place="margin">The flux and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux may depend on the diurnal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Heaven.</note> against which the Water coming
to beat, may also return backwards with a contrary motion, like
as experience sheweth us in the course of Rivers; for according as
the Water in the unevenness of the Banks, meeteth with some
parts that stand out, or make with their Meanders some Reach or
Bay, here the Water turneth again, and is seen to retreat back
a considerable space. Upon this I hold, That of those effects
from which you argue the Earths mobility, and alledge it as a
cause of them, there may be assigned a cause sufficiently valid,
retaining the Earth stedfast, and restoring the mobility of
Heaven.</p>

                        <p>It cannot be denied, but that your discourse is ingenious,
&amp; hath much of probability, I mean probability in appearance, but
not in reality &amp; existence: It consisteth of two parts: In the first it
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:96976:216"/>
assignes a reason of the continual motion of the Eastern Winde,
and also of a like motion in the Water. In the second, It would
draw from the same Sourse the cause of the Ebbing and Flowing.
The first part hath (as I have said) some appearance of probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
but yet extreamly less then that which we take from the
Terrestrial motion. The second is not onely wholly improbable,
but altogether impossible and false.<note place="margin">A reason of the continual motion of the Air and VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be given, making the Earth moveable, then by making it immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</note> And coming to the first,
whereas it is said that the Concave of the Moon carrieth about
the element of Fire, and the whole Air, even to the tops of the
higher Mountains. I answer first, that it is dubious whether
there be any element of Fire: But suppose there be, it is much
doubted of the Orbe of the Moon, as also of all the rest; that is,
Whether there be any such solid bodies and vast, or elss, Whether
beyond the Air there be extended a continuate expansion of a
substance of much more tenuity and purity than our Air, up and
down which the Planets go wandring, as now at last a good part
of those very Phylosophers begin to think:<note place="margin">Its improbable that the element of Fire should be carried round by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave of the Moon.</note> But be it in this or in
that manner, there is no reason for which the Fire, by a simple
contract to a superficies, which you your self grant to be smooth
and terse, should be according to its whole depth carried round in
a motion different from its natural inclination; as hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusely
proved, and with sensible reasons demonstrated by<note n="†" place="margin">A Treatise of our Author formerly cited.</note> 
                           <hi>Il Sag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giatore:</hi>
Besides the other improbability of the said motions
transfusing it self from the subtilest Fire throughout the Air, much
more dense; and from that also again to the Water. But that
a body of rugged and mountainous surface, by revolving in it
self, should carry with it the Air contiguous to it, and against
which its promontaries beat, is not onely probable but necessary,
and experience thereof may be daily seen; though without see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, I believe that there is no judgement that doubts thereof.
As to the other part, supposing that the motion of Heaven did
carry round the Air, and also the Water; yet would that motion
for all that have nothing to do with the Ebbing and Flowing.
For being that from one onely and uniform cause, there can fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
but one sole and uniform effect;<note place="margin">The Ebbing and Flowing cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the motion of Heaven.</note> that which should be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in the Water, would be a continuate and uniform course
from East to West; and in that a Sea onely, which running com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
environeth the whole Globe. But in determinate Seas, such
as is the Mediterrane shut up in the East, there could be no such
motion. For if its Water might be driven by the course of
Heaven towards the West, it would have been dry many ages
since: Besides that our Water runneth not onely towards the
West, But returneth backwards towards the East, and that in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
Periods: And whereas you say by the example of Rivers,
that though the course of the Sea were Originally that onely
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:96976:217"/>
from East to West, yet nevertheless the different Position of the
Shores may make part of the Water regurgitate, and return
backwards: I grant it you, but it is necessary that you take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
my <hi>Simplicius,</hi> that where the Water upon that account
returneth backwards, it doth so there perpetually; and where
it runneth straight forwards, it runneth there alwayes in the same
manner; for so the example of the Rivers shewes you. But in the
case of the ebbing and flowing, you must finde and give us some
reason why it doth in the self same place run one while one way,
and another while another; Effects that being contrary &amp; irregular,
can never be deduced from any uniform and constant Cause:
And this Argument, that overthrows the Hypothesis of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
contributed to the Sea from the Heavens diurnal motion,
doth also confute that Position of those who would admit the sole
diurnal motion of the Earth, and believe that they are able with
that alone to give a reason of the Flux and Reflux: Of which
effect since it is irregular, the cause must of necessity be irregular
and alterable.</p>

the diurnal period of the ebbing and flowing; of which we have in

Cause, without which, no such effect would follow: Afterw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

passing to the particular Accidents, various, and in a certain sort
irregular, that are observed therein: We have handled the secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary
and concommitant Causes upon which they depend. Now
follow the two other Periods, Monethly, and Annual, which do
not bring with them new and different Accidents, other than
those already considered in the diurnal Period; but they ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
on the same Accidents, by rendring them greater and lesser
in several parts of the Lunar Moneth, and in several times of
the Solar Year; as if that the Moon and Sun did each conceive
it self apart in operating and producing of those Effects; a thing
that totally clasheth with my understanding, which seeing how
that this of Seas is a local and sensible motion, made in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense
mass of Water, it cannot be brought to subscribe to
Lights, to temperate Heats, to predominacies by occult Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and to such like vain Imaginations, that are so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or being possible to be Causes of the Tide; that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:96976:217"/>
the Tide is the cause of them, that is, of bringing them
into the brains more apt for loquacity and ostentation, than for
the speculation and discovering of the more abstruse secrets of
Nature; which kind of people, before they can be brought to
pronounce that wise, ingenious, and modest sentence, <hi>I know it
not,</hi> suffer to escape from their mouths and pens all manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies.
And the onely observing, that the same Moon, and
the same Sun operate not with their light with their motion, with
great heat, or with temperate, on the lesser reeeptacl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s of Water,
but that to effect their flowing by heat, they must be reduced to
little lesse than boiling, and in short, we not being able artificially
to imitate any way the motions of the Tide, save only by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Vessel, ought it not to satisfie every one, that all
the other things alledged, as causes of those effects, are
vaine fancies, and altogether estranged from the Truth. I
say,<note place="margin">The alterations in the effects argue alteration in the cause.</note> therefore, that if it be true, that of one effect there is but
one sole primary cause, and that between the cause and effect,
there is a firm and constant connection; it is necessary that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
there is seen a firm and constant alteration in the effect,
there be a firm and constant alteration in the cause. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the alterations that happen in the ebbing and flowing in
several parts of the Year and Moneths, have their periods firm and
constant, it is necessary to say, that a regular alteration in those
same times happeneth in the primary cause of the ebbings and
flowings.<note place="margin">The causes as large assigned of the Periods Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethly and Annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of the ebbings and flowings.</note> And as for the alteration that in those times happens
in the ebbings and flowings consisteth onely in their greatness;
that is, in the Waters rising and falling more or lesse, and in
running with greater or lesse <hi>impetus;</hi> therefore it is necessary,
that that which is the primary cause of the ebbing and flowing,
doth in those same determinate times increase and diminish its
force. But we have already concluded upon the inequality and
irregularity of the motion of the Vessels containing the Water to
be the primary cause of the ebbings and flowings. Therefore
it is necessary, that that irregularity, from time to time, corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondently
grow more irregular, that is, grow greater and lesser.
Now it is requisite, that we call to minde, that the irregularity,
that is, the different velocity of the motions of the Vessels, to
wit, of the parts of the Terrestrial Superficies, dependeth on
their moving with a compound motion, resulting from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtion
of the two motions, Annual and Diurnal, proper to the
whole Terrestrial Globe; of which the Diurnal conversion, by
one while adding to, and another while substracting from, the
Annual motion, is that which produceth the irregularity in the
compound motion; so that, in the additions and substractions,
that the Diurnal revolution maketh from the Annual motion,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:96976:218"/>
consisteth the original cause of the irregular motion of the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
<note place="margin">The monethly and annual altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the tide can depend upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, save on the alteration of the additions &amp; sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions of the diurnal period from the annual.</note> and consequently of the Ebbing and Flowing: insomuch
that if these additions and substractions should alwayes proceed
in the same proportion, in respect of the Annual motion, the
cause of the Ebbing and Flowing would indeed continue, but
yet so as that they would perpetually return in the self same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
But we are to finde out the cause of making the same Eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bings
and Flowings in divers times greater and lesser: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must (if we will retain the identity of the cause) find the
alteration in these additions and substractions, that make them
more &amp; less potent, in producing those effects which depend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.
But I see not how that potency and impotence can be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
unlesse by making the same additions and substractions,
one while greater, and another while lesser; so that the accelera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and the retardment of the compound motion, may be made,
sometimes in greater, and sometimes in lesser proportion.</p>

                        <p>I am ready to serve you: We were upon an inquiry
in what manner the additions and substractions of the Terrestri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:96976:218"/>
conversion from the Annual motion, could be made, one
while in a greater, and another while in a lesser proportion;
which diversity, and no other thing, could be assigned for the
cause of the alterations, Monethly and Annual, that are seen in
the greatnesse of the Ebbings and Flowings. I will now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
how this proportion of the additions and substractions of
the Diurnal Revolution,<note place="margin">Three wayes of altering the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Revolution to the annual motion.</note> and Annual motion may grow greater
and lesser three several wayes. One is by increasing and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
the velocity of the Annual motion, retaining the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and substractions made by the Diurnal conversion in the
same greatnesse, because the Annual motion being about three
times greater, that is, more velocious than the Diurnal motion
(considered likewise in the Grand Circle) if we increase it
anew, the additions and substractions of the Diurnal motion
will occasion lesse alteration therein: but, on the other side,
making it more slow, it will be altered in greater proportion, by
that same diurnal motion, just as the adding or substracting
four degrees of velocity from one that moveth with twenty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
altereth his course lesse, than those very four degrees would
do, added or substracted from one that should move onely with
ten degrees. The second way would be, by making the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and substractions greater and lesser, retaining the annual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the same velocity; which is as easie to be understood, as it
is manifest, that a velocity <hi>v. gr.</hi> of 20 degr. is more altered by the
addition or substraction of 10. deg. than by the addition or substra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of 4. The third way would be, in case these two were joyned
together, diminishing the annual motion, &amp; increasing the diurnal
additions and substractions. Hitherto, as you see, it was no
hard matter to attain, but yet it proved to me very hard to find
by what means this might be effected in Nature.<note place="margin">That which to us is hard to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, is with Nature easie to be effected.</note> Yet in the end,
I finde that she doth admirably make use thereof, and in wayes
almost incredible: I mean, admirable and incredible to us, but
not to her, who worketh even those very things, which, to our
capacity, are of infinite wonder, with extraordinary facility and
simplicity: and that which it is hard for us to understand, is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
for her to effect. Now to proceed, having shewn that the
proportion between the additions and substractions of the Diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
conversion and Annual motion may be made greater and les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser,
two wayes, (and I say two, because the third is comprized in
the two first) I adde, that Nature maketh use of them both:
and farthermore, I subjoyn, that if she did make use but of one
alone, it would be necessary to take away one of the two Perio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical
alterations.<note place="margin">If the Diurnal motion should not alter, the annual Period would cease</note> That of the Monethly Period would cease, if
the annual motion should not alter. And in case the additions
and substractions of the diurnal revolution should continually
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:96976:219"/>
be equal, the alterations of the annual Period would fail.</p>

                        <p>It seems then, that the Monethly alteration of eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bings
and flowings dependeth on the alteration of the annual
motion of the Earth? And the annual alteration of those eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bings
and flowings do, it seems, depend on the additions and
substractions of the diurnal conversion? And here now I finde
my self worse puzzled than before, and more out of hope of
being able to comprehend how this intricacy may be, which is
more inextricable, in my judgment, than the Gordian knot. And
I envy <hi>Simplicius,</hi> from whose silence I argue that he doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend

                        <p>I will endeavour it to the utmost of my harsh way of
expressing my self, the obtusenesse of which, the acutenesse of
your wit shall supply. The accidents of which we are to enquire
the causes are two: The first respecteth the varieties that happen
in the ebbings and flowings in the Monethly Period; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thr
relateth to the Annual. We will first speak of the Moneth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and then treat of the Annual; and it is convenient that we
resolve them all according to the Fundamentals and Hypothesis
already laid down, without introducing any novelty either in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomy,
or in the Universe, in favour of the ebbings and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
therefore let us demonstrate that of all the several acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
in them observed, the causes reside in the things already
known,<note place="margin">The true Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis may dispatch its revolutions in a shorter time, in lesser circles than in greater; the which is proved by two examples.</note> and received for true and undoubted. I say therefore,
that it is a truly natural, yea necessary thing, that one and the same
moveable made to move round by the same moving virtue in a
longer time, do make its course by a greater circle, rather than
by a lesser; and this is a truth received by all, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by all experiments,<note place="margin">The first ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</note> of which we will produce a few.
In the wheel-clocks, and particularly in the great ones, to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:96976:219"/>
the time, the Artificers that make them accomodate a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
voluble staffe horozontally, and at each end of it they fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
two Weights of Lead, and when the time goeth too slow,
by the onely removing those Leads a little nearer to the centre
of the staffe, they render its vibrations more frequent; and on
the contrary to retard it, it is but drawing those Weights more
towards the ends; for so the vibrations are made more seldome,
and consequently the intervals of the hours are prolonged.</p>
                        <p>Here the movent vertue is the same,<note place="margin">The second ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</note> namely the counterpoise,
the moveables are those same Weights of lead, and their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations
are more frequent when they are neerer to the centre,
that is, when they move by lesser circles. Hanging equal
Weights at unequal cords, and being removed from their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularity,
letting them go; we shall see those that are pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
at the shorter cords, to make their vibrations under shorter
times, as those that move by lesser circles. Again, let such a
kind of Weight be fastened to a cord, which cord let play upon
a staple fastened in the Seeling, and do you hold the other end
of the cord in your hand, and having given the motion to the
pendent Weight, whilst it is making its vibrations, pull the
end of the cord that you hold in your hand, so that the Weight
may rise higher and higher: In its rising you shall see the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency
of its vibrations encrease, in regard that they are made
successively by lesser and lesser circies.<note place="margin">Two particular notable accidents in the <hi>penduli</hi> and their vibrations.</note> And here I desire you to
take notice of two particulars worthy to be observed. One is
that the vibrations of one of those plummets are made with such
a necessity under such determinate times, that it is altogether
impossible to cause them to be made under other times, unlesse
it be by prolonging, or abreviating the cord; of which you
may also at this very instant ascertain your selves by experience,
tying a stone to a pack-threed, and holding the other end in
your hand, trying whether you can ever by any artifice be able
to swing it this way and that way in other than one determinate
time, unlesse by lengthening of shortening the string, which
you will find to be absolutely impossible. The other particular
truly admirable is, that the self same <hi>pendulum</hi> makes its vibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
with one and the same frequency, or very little, and as it
were insensibly different, whether they be made by very great,
or very small arches of the self-same circumference. I mean that
whether we remove the <hi>pendulum</hi> from perpendicularity one, two,
or three degrees onely, or whether we remove it 70. 80. nay to
an entire quadrant, it being let go, will in the one case and in
the other make its vibrations with the same frequency, as well
the former where it is to move by an arch of but four or six de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
as the second, where it is to passe arches of 160. or more
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:96976:220"/>
degrees. Which may the better be seen, by hanging two weights
at two strings of equal length, and then removing them from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularity,
one a little way, and the other very far; the which
being set at liberty, will go &amp; return under the same times, the one
by arches very small, &amp; the other by very great ones, from whence
followeth the conclusion of an admirable Problem;<note place="margin">Admirable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems of movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles descending by the Quadrant of a Circle, and of those descending by all the cords of the whole Circle.</note> which is,
That a Quadrant of a Circle being given (take a little diagram of
the same, [in <hi>Fig. 3.]</hi>) as for instance: AB erect to the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon,
so as that it rest upon the plain touching in the point B. and
an Arch being made with a Hoop well plained and smoothed in
the concave part, bending it according to the curvity of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference
ADB. So that a Bullet very round and smooth
may freely run to and again within it (the rim of a Sieve is very
proper for the experiment) I say, that the Bullet being put in any
what ever place, neer or far from the lowest term B. As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
putting it in the point C, or here in D, or in E; and then
let go, it will in equal times, or insensibly different arrive at the
term B, departing from C, or from D, or from E, or from what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
other place; an accident truly wonderfull. We may add
another accident no less strange than this, which is, That more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
by all the cords drawn from the point B to the points C,
D, E; and to any other whatsoever, taken not onely in the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant
BA, but in all the whole circumference of the Circle the
said moveable shall descend in times absolutely equal; insomuch
that it shall be no longer in descending by the whole Diameter
erect perpendicularly upon the point B, then it shall in descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by B. C. although it do sublend but one sole degree, or a les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
Arch. Let us add the other wonder, which is, That the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the falling bodies made by the Arches of the Quadrant
AB; are made in shorter times than those that are made by the
cords of those same Arches; so that the swiftest motion, and
made by a moveable in the shortest time, to arrive from the
point A, to the term B, shall be that which is made, not by the
right line A, B, (although it be the shortest of all those that can
de drawn between the points A. B.) but by the circumference
ADB. And any point being taken in the said Arch; as for
example: The point D. and two cords drawn AD, and D. B.
the moveable departing from the qoint A, shall in a less time
come to B, moving by the two cords AD and DB. than by the
sole cord A, B. But the shortest of all the times shall be that of
the fall by the Arch ADB. And the self same accidents are
to be understood of all the other lesser Arches taken from the
lowermost term B. upwards.</p>

I intreat you to vouchsafe me, having once dispatcht the business
of the ebbings and flowings, to do this honour to my house (and
yours) some other dayes, and to discourse upon the so many other
Problems that we have left in suspence; and which perhaps are

                        <p>I shall be ready to serve you, but we must make more
than one or two Sessions; if besides the other questions reserved
to be handled apart, we would discusse those many that pertain
to the local motion, as well of natural moveables, as of the reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
an Argument largely treated of by our <hi>Lyncean Accade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick.</hi>
But turning to our first purpose, where we were about to
declare, That the bodies moving circularly by a movent virtue,
which continually remaineth the same, the times of the circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were prefixt and determined, and impossible to be made
longer or shorter, having given examples, and produced experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
thereof, sensible, and feasible, we may confirm the same
truth by the experiences of the Celestial motions of the Planets;
in which we see the same rule observed; for those that move by
greater Circles, confirm longer times in passing them. A most
pertinent observation of this we have from the <hi>Medicaean</hi> Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
which in short times make their revolutions about <hi>Jupiter:</hi>
Insomuch that it is not to be questioned, nay we may hold it for
sure and certain, that if for example, the Moon continuing to be
moved by the same movent faculty, should retire by little and
little in lesser Circles, it would acquire a power of abreviating
the times of its Periods, according to that <hi>Pendulum,</hi> of which in
the course of its vibrations, we by degrees shortned the cord, that
is contracted the Semidiameter of the circumferences by it passed.
Know now that this that I have alledged an example of it in the
Moon, is seen and verified essentially in fact. Let us call to mind,
that it hath been already concluded by us, together with <hi>Coperni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The Earths an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual motion by the Ecliptick, unequal by means of the Moons motion,</note> That it is not possible to separate the Moon from the Earth,
about which it without dispute revolveth in a Moneth: Let us
remember also that the Terrestrial Globe, accompanyed alwayes
by the Moon, goeth along the circumference of the Grand Orb
about the Sun in a year, in which time the Moon revolveth about
the Earth almost thirteen times; from which revolution it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that the said Moon sometimes is found near the Sun; that is,
when it is between the Sun and the Earth, and sometimes
much more remote, that is, when the Earth is situate between
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:96976:221"/>
the Moon and Sun; neer, in a word, at the time of its conjun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ction
and change; remote, in its Full and Opposition; and the
greatest vicinity differ the quantity of the Diameter of the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar
Orb. Now if it be true that the virtue which moveth the
Earth and Moon, about the Sun, be alwayes maintained in
the same vigour; and if it be true that the same moveable
moved by the same virtue, but in circles unequal, do in shorter
times passe like arches of lesser circles, it must needs be granted,
that the Moon when it is at a lesse distance from the Sun, that is
in the time of conjunction, passeth greater arches of the Grand
Orb, than when it is at a greater distance, that is in its Opppsition
and Full. And this Lunar inequality must of necessity be imparted
to the Earth also; for if we shall suppose a right line produced from
the centre of the Sun by the centre of the Terrestrial Globe, and
prolonged as far as the Orb of the Moon, this shall be the semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diameter
of the Grand Orb, in which the Earth, in case it were
alone, would move uniformly, but if in the same semidiameter we
should place another body to be carried about, placing it one
while between the Earth and Sun, and another while beyond
the Earth, at a greater distance from the Sun, it is necessary,
that in this second case the motion common to both, according
to the circumference of the great Orb by means of the distance
of the Moon, do prove a little slower than in the other case,
when the Moon is between the Earth and Sun, that is at a lesser
distance. So that in this businesse the very same happeneth that
befals in the time of the clock; that lead which is placed one
while farther from the centre, to make the vibrations of the
staffe or ballance lesse frequent, and another while nearer, to
make them thicker, representing the Moon. Hence it may be
manifest, that the annual motion of the Earth in the Grand
Orb, and under the Ecliptick, is not uniform, and that its ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularity
proceedeth from the Moon, and hath its Monethly
Periods and Returns. And because it hath been concluded, that
the Monethly and Annual Periodick alterations of the ebbings
and flowings, cannot be deduced from any other cause than
from the altered proportion between the annual motion and the
additions and substractions of the diurnal conversion; and that
those alterations might be made two wayes, that is by altering
the annual motion, keeping the quantity of the additions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altered,
or by changing of the bignesse of these, reteining the
uniformity of annual motion. We have already found the first
of these, depending on the irregularity of the annual motion
occasioned by the Moon, and which hath its Monethly Periods.
It is therefore necessary, that upon that account the ebbings
and flowings have a Monethly Period in which they do grow
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:96976:221"/>
greater and lesser. Now you see that the cause of the Monethly
Period resideth in the annual motion; and withal you see how
much the Moon is concerned in this business, and how it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
interrupted apart, without having any thing to do with either,
with Seas or Waters.</p>

                        <p>If one that never had seen any kinde of Stairs or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
were shewed a very high Tower, and asked if ever he hoped
to climb to the top of it, I verily believe that he would answer he
did not, not conceiving how one should come thither any way
except by flying; but shewing him a stone of but a foot high, and
asking him whether he thought he could get to the top of that,
I am certain that he would answer he could; and farther, that he
would not deny, but that it was not onely one, but ten, twenty,
and an hundred times easier to climb that: But now if he should
be shewed the Stairs, by means whereof, with the facility by him
granted, it is possible to get thither, whither he a little before had
affirmed it was impossible to ascend, I do think that laughing at
himself he would confess his dulness of apprehension. Thus,

                        <p>You ask a rational question, and answering to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
<note place="margin">Many things may remain as yet unobserved in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomy.</note> I say; That although <hi>Astronomy</hi> in the courses of many
ages hath made a great progress in discovering the constitution
and motions of the Celestial bodies, yet is it not hitherto arrived
at that height, but that very many things remain undecided, and
haply many others also undiscovered. It is to be supposed that the
first observers of Heaven knew no more but one motion common
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:96976:222"/>
to all the Stars, as is this diurnal one: yet I believe that in few
dayes they perceived that the Moon was inconstant in keeping
company with the other Stars; but yet withal, that many years
past, before that they distinguished all the Planets: And in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,

superiour Planets were known, as also their approximations and
recessions from the Earth, necessary occasions of introducing the
Eccentrix and Epicicles, things unknown even to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> for
that he makes no mention thereof. <hi>Mercury,</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> with
their admirable apparitions; how long did they keep Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
in suspence, before that they could resolve (not to speak of
any other of their qualities) upon their situation? Insomuch
that the very order onely of the Mundane bodies, and the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gral
structure of the parts of the Universe by us known, hath been
doubted of untill the time of <hi>Copernicus,</hi> who hath at last given
us notice of the true constitution, and real systeme, according to
which those parts are disposed; so that at length we are certain
that <hi>Mercury, Venus,</hi> and the other Planets do revolve about
the Sun; and that the Moon revolveth about the Earth. But
how each Planet governeth it self in its particular revolution,<note place="margin">Particular stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of the Orbs of the Planets not yet well resolved.</note> and
how precisely the structure of its Orb is framed; which is that
which is vulgarly called the <hi>Theory</hi> of the <hi>Planets,</hi> we cannot as
yet undoubtedly resolve. <hi>Mars,</hi> that hath so much puzled our
Modern Astronomers, is a proof of this: And to the Moon her
self there have been assigned several Theories, after that the said
<hi>Copernicus</hi> had much altered it from that of <hi>Ptolomy.</hi> And to
descend to our particular case, that is to say, to the apparent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Sun and Moon; touching the former, there hath been
observed a certain great irregularity, whereby it passeth the two
semicircles of the Ecliptick,<note place="margin">The Sun pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth one half of the Zodiack nine days sooner than the other.</note> divided by the points of the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxes
in very different times; in passing one of which, it spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
about nine dayes more than in passing the other; a difference,
as you see, very great and notable. But if in passing small arches,
such for example as are the twelve Signs, he maintain a most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
motion, or else proceed with paces, one while a little more
swift, and another more slow, as it is necessary that it do, in case
the annual motion belong to the Sun onely in appearance, but
in reality to the Earth in company with the Moon, it is what hath
not hitherto been observed,<note place="margin">The Moons mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion principally sought in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Eclipses.</note> nor it may be, sought. Touching
the Moon in the next place, whose restitutions have been prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally

to have an exact knowledge of its motion about the Earth,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:96976:222"/>
it hath not been likewise with a perfect curiosity inquired, what

                           </gap> course is thorow the particular arches of the Zodiack. That
therefore the Earth and Moon in running through the Zodiack,
that is round the Grand Orb, do somewhat accellerate at the
Moons change, and retard at its full, ought not to be doubted;
for that the said difference is not manifest, which cometh to be
unobserved upon two accounts; First, Because it hath not been
lookt for. Secondly, Because that its possible it may not be very
great. Nor is there any need that it should be great, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
the effect that we see in the alteration of the greatness of
ebbings and flowings.<note place="margin">Ebbings and flowings are petty things in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the vastness of Seas and of the velocity of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial Globe.</note> For not onely those alterations, but the
Tides themselves are but small matters in respect of the grandure
of the subjects on which they work; albeit that to us, and to our
littleness they seem great. For the addition or subduction of
one degree of velocity where there are naturally 700, or 1000,
can be called no great alteration, either in that which conferreth
it, or in that Which receiveth it: the Water of our Mediterrane
carried about by the diurnal revolution, maketh about 700 miles
an hour, (which is the motion common to the Earth and to it, and
therefore not perceptible to us) &amp; that which we sensibly discern
to be made in the streams or currents, is not at the rate of full one
mile an hour, (I speak of the main Seas, and not of the Straights)
and this is that which altereth the first, naturall, and grand mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and this motion is very great in respect of us, and of Ships:
for a Vessel that in a standing Water by the help of Oares can
make <hi>v. g.</hi> three miles an hour, in that same current will row
twice as far with the stream as against it: A notable difference
in the motion of the Boat, though but very small in the motion
of the Sea, which is altered but its seven hundredth part. The
like I say of its rising, and falling one, two, or three feet; and
scarcely four or five in the utmost bounds of a streight, two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
or more miles long, and where there are depths of hundreds
of feet; this alteration is much less than if in one of the Boats
that bring us fresh Water, the said Water upon the arrest of the
Boat should rise at the Prow the thickness of a leaf. I conclude
therefore that very small alterations in respect of the immense
greatness, and extraordinary velocity of the Seas, is sufficient to
make therein great mutations in relation to our smallness, and to
our accidents.</p>

intelligible,<note place="margin">The causes of the inequality of the additions and substractions of the diurnal conversion from the annual motion.</note> but the difficulty of the accident it self, and the
great attention of mind requisite for the comprehending of it,
constrains me to be obscure. The unequalities of the additions
and substractions, that the diurnal motion maketh to or from
the annual dependeth upon the inclination of the Axis of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal
motion upon the plane of the Grand Orb, or, if you please,
of the Ecliptick; by means of which inclination the Equinoctial
intersecteth the said Ecliptick, remaining inclined and oblique
upon the same according to the said inclination of Axis. And the
quantity of the additions importeth as much as the whole diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the said Equinoctial, the Earths centre being at the same
time in the Solstitial points; but being out of them it importeth
lesse and lesse, according as the said centre successively approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
to the points of the Equinoxes, where those additions are
lesser than in any other places. This is the whole businesse, but
wrapt up in the obscurity that you see.</p>

                        <p>I have already foretold it. Neverthelesse we will try
whether by drawing a Diagram thereof, we can give some
small light to the same; though indeed it might better be set
forth by solid bodies than by bare Schemes; yet we will help our
selves with Perspective and fore-shortning. Let us draw there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as before, the circumference of the Grand Orb, <hi>[as in
Fig. 4.]</hi> in which the point A is understood to be one of the
Solstitials, and the diameter AP the common Section of the
Solstitial Colure, and of the plane of the Grand Orb or Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick;
and in that same point A let us suppose the centre of the
Terrestrial Globe to be placed, the Axis of which CAB, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
upon the Plane of the Grand Orb, falleth on the plane of
the said Colure that passeth thorow both the Axis of the Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctial,
and of the Ecliptick. And for to prevent confusion, let
us only draw the Equinoctial circle, marking it with these chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
DGEF, the common section of which, with the plane of
the grand Orb, let be the line DE, so that half of the said E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctial
DFE will remain inclined below the plane of the
Grand Orb, and the other half DGE elevated above. Let
now the Revolution of the said Equinoctial be made, according
to the order of the points DGEF, and the motion of the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
from A towards E. And because the centre of the Earth
being in A, the Axis CB (which is erect upon the diameter of
the Equinoctial DE) falleth, as hath been said, in the Solsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Colure, the common Section of which and of the
Grand Orb, is the diameter PA, the said line PA shall
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:96976:223"/>
be perpendicular to the same DE, by reason that the Colure is
erect upon the grand Orb; and therefore the said DE,
shall be the Tangent of the grand Orb in the point A.
So that in this Position the motion of the Centre by the arch
AE; that is, of one degree every day differeth very little; yea,
is as if it were made by the Tangent DAE. And because by
means of the diurnal motion the point D, carried about by G,
unto E, encreaseth the motion of the Centre moved almost in the
same line DE, as much as the whole diameter DE amounts
unto; and on the other side diminisheth as much, moving about
the other semicircle EFD. The additions and subductions
in this place therefore, that is in the time of the solstice, shall be
measured by the whole diameter DE.</p>
                        <p>Let us in the next place enquire, Whether they be of the same
bigness in the times of the Equinoxes; and transporting the
Centre of the Earth to the point I, distant a Quadrant of a
Circle from the point A. Let us suppose the said Equinoctial
to be GEFD, its common section with the grand Orb DE, the
Axis with the same inclination CB; but the Tangent of the grand
Orb in the point I shall be no longer DE, but another which
shall cut that at right Angles; and let it be this marked HIL,
according to which the motion of the Centre I, shall make its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress,
proceeding along the circumference of this grand Orb.
Now in this state the Additions and Substractions are no longer
measured by the diameter DE, as before was done; because that
diameter not distending it self according to the line of the annual
motion HL, rather cutting it at right angles, those terms DE, do
neither add nor substract any thing; but the Additions and
Substractons are to be taken from that diameter that falleth
in the plane that is errect upon the plane of the grand Orb, and
that intersects it according to the line HL; which diameter in this
case shall be this GF and the Adjective, if I may so say, shall
be that made by the point G, about the semicircle GEF, and the
Ablative shall be the rest made by the other semicircle FDG.
Now this diameter, as not being in the same line HL of the
annual motion, but rather cutting it, as we see in the point I, the
term G being elevated above, and E depressed below the plane
of the grand Orb, doth not determine the Additions and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions
according to its whole length, but the quantity of those
first ought to be taken from the part of the line HL, that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted
between the perpendiculars drawn upon it from the
terms GF; namely, these two GS, and FV: So that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the additions is the line SV lesser then GF, or then DE;
which was the measure of the additions in the Solstice A. And
so successively, according as the centre of the Earth shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:96976:224"/>
in other points of the Quadrant AI, drawing the Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
in the said points, and the perpendiculars upon the same fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
from the terms of the diameters of the Equinoctial drawn
from the errect planes by the said Tangents to the plane of the
grand Orb; the parts of the said Tangents (which shall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
be lesser towards the Equinoctials, and greater towards the
Solstices) shall give us the quantities of the additions and substra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
How much in the next place the least additions differ from
the greatest, is easie to be known, because there is the same dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt them, as between the whole Axis or Diameter of
the Sphere, and the part thereof that lyeth between the Polar-Circles;
the which is less than the whole diameter by very near a
twelfth part, supposing yet that we speak of the additions and
substractions made in the Equinoctial; but in the other Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels
they are lesser, according as their diameters do diminish.</p>
                        <p>This is all that I have to say upon this Argument, and all perhaps
that can fall under the comprehension of our knowledge, which,
as you well know, may not entertain any conclusions, save onely
those that are firm and constant, such as are the three kinds of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods
of the ebbings and flowings; for that they depend on causes
that are invariabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>, simple, and eternal. But because that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary
and particular causes, able to make many alterations, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termix
with these that are the primary and universal; and these
secondary causes being part of them inconstant, and not to be
observed; as for example, The alteration of Winds, and part
(though terminate and fixed) unobserved for their multiplicity,
as are the lengths of the Straights, their various inclinations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
this or that part, the so many and so different depths of the
Waters, who shall be able, unless after very long observations, and
very certain relations, to frame so expeditious Histories thereof, as
that they may serve for Hypotheses, and certain suppositions to
such as will by their combinations give adequate reasons of all the
appearances, and as I may say, Anomalie, and particular irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
that may be discovered in the motions of the Waters? I
will content my self with advertising you, that the accidental
causes are in nature, and are able to produce many alterations;
for the more minute observations, I remit them to be made by
those that frequent several Seas: and onely by way of a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to this our conference, I will propose to be considered, how
that the precise times of the fluxes and refluxes do not onely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to be altered by the length of Straights, and by the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of depths; but I believe that a notable alteration may also
proceed from the comparing together of sundry tarcts of Sea,
different in greatness; and in position, or, if you will, inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
which difference happeneth exactly here in the <hi>Adriatick</hi>
                           <pb n="421" facs="tcp:96976:224"/>
Gulph, lesse by far than the rest of the Mediterrane, and placed in
so different an inclination, that whereas that hath its bounds that
incloseth it on the Eastern part, as are the Coasts of <hi>Syria,</hi> this is
shut up in its more Westerly part: and because the ebbings and
flowings are much greater towards the extremities, yea, because
the Seas risings and fallings are there onely greatest, it may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
happen that the times of Flood at <hi>Venice</hi> may be the time of
low Water in the other Sea, which, as being much greater, and
distended more directly from West to East, cometh in a certain
sort to have dominion over the <hi>Adriatick:</hi> and therefore it
would be no wonder, in case the effects depending on the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
causes, should not hold true in the times that they ought,
and that correspond to the periods in the <hi>Adriatick,</hi> as it doth
in the rest of the Mediterrane. But these Particularities require
long Observations, which I neither have made as yet, nor shall I
ever be able to make the same for the future.</p>

                        <p>You have, in my opinion, done enough in opening us
the way to so lofty a speculation, of which, if you had given us
no more than that first general Proposition that seemeth to me to
admit of no reply, where you declare very rationally, that the
Vessels containing the Sea-waters continuing stedfast, it would
be impossible, according to the common course of Nature, that
those motions should follow in them which we see do follow;
and that, on the other side, granting the motions ascribed, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
respects, by <hi>Copernicus</hi> to the Terrestrial Globe, these same
alterations ought to ensue in the Seas, if I say you had told us no
more, this alone in my judgment, so far exceeds the vanities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
by so many others, that my meer looking on them
makes me nauseate them, and I very much admire, that among
men of sublime wit, of which nevertheless there are not a few,
not one hath ever considered the incompatibility that is between
the reciprocal motion of the Water contained, and the immobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Vessel containing, which contradiction seemeth to me

thoughts of some to refer the cause of the Tide to the motion of
the Earth, therein shewing a more than common apprehension,
they should, in afterwards driving home the motion close with

motion, one while accelerated, and another while retarded:
for when the motion of the Vessels are uniforme, the waters
contained will habituate themselves thereto, without ever ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
any alteration. To say also (as it is related of an ancient
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:96976:225"/>
Mathematician) that the motion of the Earth meeting with the
motion of the Lunar Orb,<note place="margin">The opinion of <hi>Seleucus</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematician censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> the concurrence of them occasioneth

it is not exprest, nor seen how it should so happen, but the
falsity is obvious, for that the Revolution of the Earth is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the motion of the Moon, but is towards the same way.
So that all that hath been hitherto said, and imagined by others,
is, in my judgment, altogether invalid. But amongst all the

for the full understanding of which I stand in need of a little

of it hath hitherto hindred me from doing: but I despair not, but
that when I return in my solitude and silence to ruminate that
which remaineth in my fancy, not very well digested, I shall
make it my own. We have now, from these four dayes Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
great attestations, in favour of the <hi>Copernican</hi> Systeme,

Retrogradations of the Planets, and from their approaches, and
recessions from the Earth; the second, from the Suns revolving
in it self, and from what is observed in its spots; the third, from
the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea do shew very rational and

other of his Works shall come to appear in publique, we may be
aforehand assured, that they will be received, as things of great

                        <p>Now because it is time to put an end to our Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
it remaineth, that I intreat you, that if, at more leasure go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over the things again that have been alledged you meet
with any doubts, or scruples not well resolved, you will excuse
my oversight, as well for the novelty of the Notion, as for the
weaknesse of my wit, as also for the grandure of the Subject,
as also finally, because I do not, nor have pretended to that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
from others, which I my self do not give to this conceit,
which I could very easily grant to be a <hi>Chymaera,</hi> and a meer
paradox; and you <hi>Sagredus,</hi> although in the Discourses past
you have many times, with great applause, declared, that you
were pleased with some of my conjectures, yet do I believe, that
that was in part more occasioned by the novelty than by the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of them, but much more by your courtesie, which did
think and desire, by its assent, to procure me that content which
we naturally use to take in the approbation and applause of our
own matters: and as your civility hath obliged me to you; so
am I also pleased with the ingenuity of <hi>Simplicius.</hi> Nay, his
constancy in maintaining the Doctrine of his Master, with so
much strength &amp; undauntedness, hath made me much to love him.
And as I am to give you thanks, <hi>Sagredus,</hi> for your courteous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
so of <hi>Simplicius,</hi> I ask pardon, if I have sometimes
moved him with my too bold and resolute speaking: and let him
be assured that I have not done the same out of any inducement
of sinister affection, but onely to give him occasion to set before
us more lofty fancies that might make me the more knowing.</p>

                        <p>There is no reason why you should make all these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses,
that are needlesse, and especially to me, that being accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
to be at Conferences and publique Disputes, have an
hundred times seen the Disputants not onely to grow hot and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
at one another, but likewise to break forth into injurious
words, and sometimes to come very neer to blows. As for the
past Discourses, and particulatly in this last, of the reason of
the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea, I do not, to speak the truth,
very well apprehend the same, but by that slight <hi>Idea,</hi> what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it be, that I have formed thereof to my self, I confesse that
your conceit seemeth to me far more ingenuous than any of all
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:96976:226"/>
those that I ever heard besides, but yet neverthelesse I esteem it
not true and concluding: but keeping alwayes before the eyes
of my mind a solid Doctrine that I have learn't from a most
learned and ingenuous person, and with which it is necessary to
sit down; I know that both you being asked, Whether God, by
his infinite Power and Wisdome might confer upon the Element
of Water the reciprocal motion which we observe in the same in
any other way, than by making the containing Vessel to move; I
know, I say, that you will answer, that he might, and knew how
to have done the same many wayes, and those unimaginable to
our shallow understanding: upon which I forthwith conclude,
that this being granted, it would be an extravagant boldnesse
for any one to goe about to limit and confine the Divine
Power and Wisdome to some one particular conjecture of
his own.</p>

                        <p>This of yours is admirable, and truly Angelical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
to which very exactly that other accords, in like manner
divine, which whilst it giveth us leave to dispute, touching the
constitution of the World, addeth withall (perhaps to the end,
that the exercise of the minds of men might neither be discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
nor made bold) that we cannot find out the works made
by his hands. Let therefore the Disquisition permitted and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
us by God, assist us in the knowing, and so much more
admiring his greatnesse, by how much lesse we finde our selves
too dull to penetrate the profound Abysses of his infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>

Disputations, after which, if it seem good to <hi>Salviatus,</hi> to take
some time to rest himself, our curiosity must, of necessity, grant
him the same, yet upon condition, that when it is lesse incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
for him, he will return and satisfie my desire in particular
concerning the Problemes that remain to be discust, and that I
have set down to be propounded at one or two other Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
according to our agreement: and above all, I shall very
impatiently wait to hear the Elements of the new Science of our
<hi>Academick</hi> about the natural and violent local Motions. And
in the mean time, we may, according to our custome, spend an
hour in taking the Air in the <hi>Gondola</hi> that waiteth for us.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome years since, as Your most Serene Highness well
knoweth, I did discover many particulars in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
that had been unseen and unheard of untill
this our Age; which, as well for their novelty, as
for certain consequences which depend upon
them, clashing with some Physical Propositions commonly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the Schools, did stir up against me no small number of
such as professed the vulgar Philosophy in the Universities; as if
I had with my own hand newly placed these things in Heaven to
obscure and disturb Nature and the Sciences: who forgetting
that the multitude of Truths contribute, and concur to the inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigation,
augmentation, and establishment of the Arts, and not to
their diminution, and destruction; and at the same time shewing
themselves more affectionate to their own Opinions, than to
Truth, went about to deny, and to disprove those Novelties; of
which their very sense, had they but pleased to have intentsly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
them, would have rendered them thorowly assured. And
to this purpose they alledged sundry things, and published cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Papers fraughted with vain discourses; and which was a
more gross errour, interwoven with the attestations of the Sacred
Scriptures, taken from places by them not rightly understood,
and which did not any thing concern the point for which they
were produced Into which errour perhaps they would not
have run, if they had but been advertised of a most profitable
Document which S. <hi>Augustine</hi> giveth us, concerning our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
warily, in making positive determinations in points that
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:96976:242"/>
are obscure and hard to be understood by the meer help of
ratiocination; where treating (as we) of a certain natural conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
concerning Celestial Bodies, he thus writes:<note n="a" place="margin">Nunc au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem servatâ sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per moderatione praegravitatis, nihil credere de re ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servá temerè de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemus, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        <hi>But now
having evermore a respect to the moderation of pious Gravity,
we ought to believe nothing unadvisedly in a doubtful point; lest
we conceive a prejudice against that, in favour to our Errour,
which Truth hereafter may discover to be no wise contrary to the
Sacred Books either of the Old or New Testament.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It hath since come to pass, that Time hath by degrees disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to every one the truths before by me indicated: and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the truth of the fact, a discovery hath been made of
the difference of humours between those who simply and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
passion did refuse to admit such like <hi>Phaenomena</hi> for true, and
those who to their incredulity had added some discomposed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection:
<note place="margin">Lib. 2. Genesi ad Literam in fine.</note> For as those who were better grounded in the Science of
Astronomy, and Natural Philosophy, became satisfied upon my
first intimation of the news; so all those who stood not in the
Negative, or in doubt for any other reason, but because it was
an unlookt-for-Novelty, and because they had not an occasion of
seeing a sensible experiment thereof, did by degrees come to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
themselves: But those, who besides the love they bore to
to their first Errour, have I know not what imaginary interess to
render them disaffected; not so much towards the things, as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Author of them, not being able any longer to deny
them, conceal themselves under an obstinate silence; and being
exasperated more than ever by that whereby those others were
satisfied and convinced, they divert their thoughts to other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and seek to prejudice me some other wayes: of whom I
profess that I would make no more account than I have done of
those who heretofore have contradicted me (at whom I alwaies
laugh, as being assured of the issue that the business is to have)
but that I see that those new Calumnies and Persecutions do not
determine in our greater or lesser Learning (in which I will scarce
pretend to any thing) but extend so far as to attempt to asperse
me with Crimes which ought to be, and are more abhorred by me
than Death it self: Nor ought I to content my self that they
are known to be unjust by those onely who know me and them,
but by all men whatsoever. They persisting therefore in their
first Resolution, Of ruining me and whatsoever is mine, by all
imaginable waies; and knowing how that I in my Studies of
Astronomy and Philosophy hold, as to the Worlds Systeme,
That the Sun, without changing place, is situate in the Centre
of the Conversion of the Celestial Orbes; and that the Earth,
convertible about its own Axis, moveth it self about the Sun:
And moreover understanding, that I proceed to maintain this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:96976:242"/>
not onely by refuting the Reasons of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> and <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi>
but by producing many on the contrary; and in particular,
some Physical pertaining to Natural Effects, the causes of which
perhaps can be by no other way assigned; and others Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
depending upon many circumstances and encounters of
new Discoveries in Heaven, which manifestly confute the Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maick
Systeme, and admirably agree with and confirm this other
Hypothesis: and possibly being ashamed to see the known truth
of other Positions by me asserted, different from those that have
been commonly received; and therefore distrusting their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
so long as they should continue in the Field of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy:
for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>se respects, I say, they have resolved to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they could make a Shield for the fallacies of their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Mantle of a feigned Religion, and of the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Sacred Scriptures, applyed by them with little judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the confutation of such Reasons of mine as they had
neither understood, nor so much as heard.</p>
                     <p>And first, they have indeavoured, as much as in them lay, to
divulge an opiniou thorow the Universe, that those Propositions
are contrary to the Holy Letters, and consequently Damnable
and Heretical: And thereupon perceiving, that for the most
part, the inclination of Mans Nature is more prone to imbrace
those enterprizes, whereby his Neighbour may, although un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly,
be oppressed, than those from whence he may receive
just incouragement; it was no hard matter to find those Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices,
who for such (that is, for Damnable and Heretical) did
from their Pulpits with unwonted confidence preach it, with but
an unmerciful and less considerate injury, not only to this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and to its followers, but to all Mathematicks and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians
together. Hereupon assuming greater confidence,
and vainly hoping that that Seed which first took root in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound
mindes, might spread its branches, and ascend towards
Heaven, they went scattering rumours up and down among the
People, That it would, ere long be condemned by Supreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
and knowing that such a <hi>Censure</hi> would supplant
not onely these two Conclusions of the VVorlds Systeme, but
would make all other Astronomical and Physical Observations
that have correspondence and necessary connection therewith to
become damnable, to facilitate the business they seek all they
can to make this opinion (at least among the vulgar) to seem new,
and peculiar to my self, not owning to know that <hi>Nicholas Coper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi>
was its Authour, or rather Restorer and Confirmer: a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
who was not only a Catholick, but a Priest, Canonick, and
so esteemed, that there being a Dispute in the <hi>Lateran Council,</hi>
under <hi>Leo X.</hi> touching the correction of the Ecclesiastick Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lender,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:96976:243"/>
he was sent for to <hi>Rome</hi> from the remotest parts of
<hi>Germany,</hi> for to assist in this Reformation, which for that time
was left imperfect, onely because as then the true measure of
the Year and Lunar Moneth was not exactly known: whereupon
it was given him in charge by the Bishop of <hi>Sempronia,</hi> at that
time Super-intendent in that Affair, to search with reiterated
studies and pains for greater light and certainty, touching those
Coelestial Motions. Upon which, with a labour truly <hi>Atlantick</hi>
and with his admirable Wit, setting himself again to that Study,
he made such a progress in these Sciences, and reduced the
knowledge of the Coelestial Motions to such exactnesse, that he
gained the title of an Excellent <hi>Astronomer.</hi> And, according
unto his Doctrine, not only the Calendar hath been since regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
but the Tables of all the Motions of the Planets have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
been calculated: and having reduced the said Doctrine into
six Books, he published them to the World at the instance of
the Cardinal of <hi>Capua,</hi> and of the Bishop of <hi>Culma.</hi> And in
regard that he had re-assumed this so laborious an enterprize by
the order of The Pope; he dedicated his Book <hi>De Revolutioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
Coelestibus</hi> to His Successour, namely <hi>Paul III.</hi> which, being
then also Printed, hath been received by The Holy Church, and
read and studied by all the World, without any the least um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage
of scruple that hath ever been conceived at his Doctrine;
The which, whilst it is now proved by manifest Experiments and
necessary Demonstrations to have been well grounded, there
want not persons that, though they never saw that same Book in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept
the reward of those many Labours to its Authour, by
causing him to be censured and pronounced an Heretick; and
this, only to satisfie a particular displeasure conceived, without
any cause, against another man, that hath no other interest in
<hi>Copernicus,</hi> but only as he is an approver of his Doctrine.</p>
                     <p>Now in regard of these false aspersions, which they so unjustly
seek to throw upon me, I have thought it necessary for my justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
before the World (of whose judgment in matters of
Religion and Reputation I ought to make great esteem) to
discourse concerning those Particulars, which these men produce
to scandalize and subvert this Opinion, and in a word, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
it, not only as false, but also as Heretical; continually
making an Hipocritical Zeal for Religion their shield; going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
moreover to interest the Sacred Scriptures in the Dispute,
and to make them in a certain sense Ministers of their deceiptful
purposes: and farthermore desiring, if I mistake not, contrary to
the intention of them, and of the Holy Fathers to extend (that I
may not say abuse) their Authority, so as that even in Conclusions
meerly Natural, and not <hi>de Fide,</hi> they would have us altogether
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:96976:243"/>
leave Sense and Demonstrative Reasons, for some place of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
which sometimes under the apparent words may contain
a different sense. Now I hope to shew with how much
greater Piety and Religious Zeal I proceed, than they do, in that
I propose not, that the Book of <hi>Copernicus</hi> is not to be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but that it is not to be condemned, as they would have it;
without understanding it, hearing it, or so much as seeing it;
and especially he being an Author that never treateth of matters
of Religion or Faith; nor by Reasons any way depending on the
Authority of Sacred Scriptures whereupon he may have erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
interpreted them; but alwaies insists upon Natural Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
belonging to the Celestial Motions, handled with Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
and Geometrical Demonstrations. Not that he had not a
respect to the places of the Sacred Leaves, but because he knew
very well that his said Doctrine being demonstrated, it could
not contradict the Scriptures, rightly, and according to their true
meaning understood. And therefore in the end of his Epistle
Dedicatory, speaking to The Pope, he saith thus;<note n="c" place="margin">Si fortasscerunt Mataeologi qui cum omnum Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicum igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri sint, tamen de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>If there
should chance to be any Mataeologists, who though ignorant in all
the Mathematicks, yet pretending a skill in those Learnings,
should dare, upon the authority of some place of Scripture wrested
to their purpose, to condemn and censure this my Hypothesis, I
value them not, but shall slight their inconsiderate Judgement. For
it is not unknown, that</hi> Lactantius (<hi>otherwise a Famous Author,
though mean Mathematician) writeth very childishly touching the
Form of the Earth, when he scoffs at those who affirm the Earth to
be in Form of a Globe. So that it ought not to seem strange to the
Ingenious, if any such should likewise now deride us. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks
are written for Mathematitians, to whom (if I deceive
not my self) these Labours of mine shall seem to add something,
as also to the Common-weale of the Church, whose Government is
now in the hands of Your Holiness.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And of this kinde do these appear to be who indeavour to
perswade that <hi>Copernicus</hi> may be condemned before his Book is
read; and to make the World believe that it is not onely lawfull
but commendable so to do, produce certain Authorities of the
Scripture, of Divines, and of Councils; which as they are by me
had in reverence, and held of Supream Authority, insomuch that
I should esteem it high temerity for any one to contradict them
whilst they are used according to the In stitutes of Holy Church,
so I believe that it is no errour to speak, so long as one hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to suspect that a person hath a desire, for some concern of
his own, to produce and alledge them, to purposes different from
those that are in the most Sacred intention of The Holy Church.
Therefore I not onely protest (and my sincerity shall manifest it
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:96976:244"/>
self) that I intend to submit my self freely to renounce those er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
into which, through ignorance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I may run in this Discourse
of matters pertaining to Religion; but I farther declare, that I
desire not in these matters to engage dispute with any one, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it should be in points that are disputable: for my end
tendeth onely to this, That if in these considerations, besides my
own profession, amongst the errours that may be in them, there
be any thing apt to give others an hint of some Notion beneficial
to the Holy Church, touching the determining about the <hi>Coper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nican</hi>
Systeme, it may be taken and improved as shall seem best
to my Superiours: If not, let my Book be torn and burnt; for
that I do neither intend, nor pretend to gain to my self any fruit
from my writings, that is not Pious and Catholick. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
although that many of the things that I observe have been
spoken in my own hearing, yet I shall freely admit and grant to
those that spake them, that they never said them, if so they
please, but confess that I might have been mistaken: And
therefore what I say, let it be supposed to be spoken not by them,
but by those which were of this opinion.</p>
                     <p>The motive therefore that they produce to condemn the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Mobility of the Earth, and Stability of the Sun, is, that
reading in the Sacred Leaves, in many places, that the Sun mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,
that the Earth standeth still; and the Scripture not being
capable of lying, or erring, it followeth upon necessary conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
that the Position of those is Erronious and Heretical, who
maintain that the Sun of it self is immoveable, and the Earth
moveable.</p>
                     <p>Touching this Reason I think it fit in the first place, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
That it is both piously spoken, and prudently affirmed, That
the Sacred Scripture can never lye, when ever its true meaning is
understood: Which I believe none will deny to be many times
very abstruce, and very different from that which the bare sound
of the words signifieth. Whence it cometh to pass, that if ever
any one should constantly confine himself to the naked Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Sence, he might, erring himself, make not only Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
and Propositions remote from Truth to appear in the
Scriptures, but also gross Heresies and Blasphemies: For that we
should be forced to assign to God feet, and hands, and eyes, yea
more corporal and humane affections, as of Anger, of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
of Hatred, nay, and sometimes the Forgetting of things
past, and Ignorance of those to come: Which Propositions, like
as (so the Holy Ghost affirmeth) they were in that manner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
by the Sacred Scriptures, that they might be accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
to the Capacity of the Vulgar, who are very rude and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned;
so likewise, for the sakes of those that deserve to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:96976:244"/>
from the Vulgar, it is necessary that grave and skilful
Expositors produce the true senses of them, and shew the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Reasons why they are dictated under such and such words.
And this is a Doctrine so true and common amongst Divines,
that it would be superfluous to produce any attestation
thereof.</p>
                     <p>Hence me thinks I may with much more reason conclude, that
the same holy Writ, when ever it hath had occasion to pronounce
any natural Conclusion, and especially, any of those which are
more abstruce, and difficult to be understood, hath not failed to
observe this Rule, that so it might not cause confusion in the
mindes of those very people, and render them the more contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macious
against the Doctrines that were more sublimely mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
For (like as we have said, and as it plainly appeareth) out
of the sole respect of condescending to Popular Capacity, the
Scripture hath not scrupled to shadow over most principal and
fundamental Truths, attributing, even to God himself, qualities
extreamly remote from, and contrary unto his Essence. Who
would positively affirm that the Scripture, laying aside that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
in speaking but occasionally of the Earth, of the Water, of
the Sun, or of any other Creature, hath chosen to confine it
self, with all rigour, within the bare and narrow literal sense of
the words? And especially, in mentioning of those Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
things not at all concerning the primary Institution of
the same Sacred Volume, to wit, the Service of God, and the
salvation of Souls, and in things infinitely beyond the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of the Vulgar?</p>
                     <p>This therefore being granted, methinks that in the Discussion
of Natural Problemes, we ought not to begin at the authority
of places of Scripture; but at Sensible Experiments and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Demonstrations: For, from the Divine Word, the
Sacred Scripture and Nature did both alike proceed; the first,
as the Holy Ghosts Inspiration; the second, as the most obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
Executrix of Gods Commands: And moreover it being
convenient in the Scriptures (by way of condescension to the
understanding of all men) to speak many things different, in
appearance; and so far as concernes the naked signification of
the words, from absolute truth: But on the contrary, Nature
being inexorable and immutable, and never passing the bounds
of the Laws assigned her, as one that nothing careth whether
her abstruse reasons and methods of operating be, or be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to the Capacity of Men; I conceive that that, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Natural Effects, which either Sensible Experience sets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our eyes, or Necessary Demonstrations do prove unto us,
ought not, upon any account, to be called into question, much
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:96976:245"/>
less condemned upon the testimony of Texts of Scripture, which
may, under their words, couch Senses seemingly contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
In regard that every Expression of Scripture is not tied to
so strict conditions, as every Effect of Nature: Nor doth God
less admirably discover himself unto us in Nature's Actions, than
in the Scriptures Sacred Dictions. Which peradventure <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
intended to express in those words:<note n="c" place="margin">Not definimus, Deum, primò N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>We conclude, God

Word preached.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I will not hence affirm, but that we ought to have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
esteem for the Places of Sacred Scripture, nay, being
come to a certainty in any Natural Conclusions,<note place="margin">Tertul. adver. Marcion. lib. 1. cap. 18.</note> we ought
to make use of them, as most apposite helps to the true Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of the same Scriptures, and to the investigation of those
Senses which are necessarily conteined in them, as most true, and
concordant with the Truths demonstrated.</p>
                     <p>This maketh me to suppose, that the Authority of the Sacred
Volumes was intended principally to perswade men to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of those Articles and Propositions, which, by reason they
surpass all humane discourse, could not by any other Science, or
by any other means be made credible, than by the Mouth of
the Holy Spirit it self. Besides that, even in those Propositions,
which are not <hi>de Fide,</hi> the Authority of the same Sacred Leaves
ought to be preferred to the Authority of all Humane Sciences
that are not written in a Demonstrative Method, but either with
bare Narrations, or else with probable Reasons; and this I hold
to be so far convenient and necessary, by how far the said Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Wisdome surpasseth all humane Judgment and Conjecture.
But that that self same God who hath indued us with Senses,
Discourse, and Understanding hath intended, laying aside the
use of these, to give the knowledg of those things by other means,
which we may attain by these, so as that even in those Natural
Conclusions, which either by Sensible Experiments or Necessary
Demonstrations are set before our eyes, or our Understanding, we
ought to deny Sense and Reason, I do not conceive that I am
bound to believe it; and especially in those Sciences, of which
but a small part, and that divided into Conclusions is to be
found in the Scripture: Such as, for instance, is that of <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,</hi>
of which there is so small a part in Holy Writ, that it doth
not so much as name any of the Planets, except the Sun and the
Moon, and once or twice onely <hi>Venus</hi> under the name of <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</hi>
For if the Holy Writers had had any intention to perswade
People to believe the Dispositions and Motions of the Coelestial
Bodies; and that consequently we are still to derive that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:96976:245"/>
from the Sacred Books they would not, in my opinion, have
spoken so little thereof, that it is as much as nothing, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
of the infinite admirable Conclusions, which in that Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
are comprized and demonstrated. Nay, that the Authours
of the Holy Volumes did not only not pretend to teach us the
Constitutions and Motions of the Heavens and Stars, their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
Magnitudes, and Distances, but that intentionally (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
that all these things were very well known unto them) they
forbore to speak of them, is the opinion of the Most Holy &amp; Most
Learned Fathers: and in S. <hi>Augustine</hi> we read the following words.

                        <hi>It is likewise commonly asked, of what Form and Figure
we may believe Heaven to be, according to the Scriptures: For
many contend much about those matters, which the greater pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of our Authors hath forborn to speak of, as nothing further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Learners in relation to a blessed life; and, (which is
the chiefest thing) taking up much of that time which should be
spent in holy exercises. For what is it to me whether Heaven, as
a Sphere, doth on all sides environ the Earth, a Mass ballanced in
the middle of the World; or whether like a Dish it doth onely cover
or overcast the same? But because belief of Scripture is urged for
that cause, which we have oft mentioned, that is, That none through
ignorance of Divine Phrases, when they shall find any thing of this
nature in, or hear any thing cited out of our Bibles which may seem
to oppose manifest Conclusions, should be induced to suspect their
truth, when they admonish, relate, &amp; deliver more profitable matters
Briefly be it spoken, touching the Figure of Heaven, that our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
knew the truth: But the H. Spirit would not, that men should
learn what is profitable to none for salvation.</hi>

are some of the Brethren that start a question concerning the motion
of Heaven, Whether it be fixed, or moved: For if it be moved
(say they) how is it a Firmament? If it stand still, how do these
Stars which are held to be fixed go round from East to West, the
more Northern performing shorter Circuits near the Pole; so that
Heaven, if there be another Pole, to us unknown, may seem to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
upon some other Axis; but if there be not another Pole, it
may be thought to move as a Discus? To whom I reply, that
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:96976:246"/>
these points require many subtil and profound Reasons, for the
making out whether they be really so, or no; the undertakeing and
discussing of which is neither consistent with my leasure, nor their
duty, vvhom I desire to instruct in the necessary matters more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
conducing to their salvation, and to the benefit of The Holy
Church.</p>
                     <p>From which (that we may come nearer to our particular case)
it necessarily followeth, that the Holy Ghost not having intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to teach us, whether Heaven moveth or standeth still; nor
whether its Figure be in Form of a Sphere, or of a Discus, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stended
<hi>in Planum:</hi> Nor whether the Earth be contained in the
Centre of it, or on one side; he hath much less had an intention
to assure us of other Conclusions of the same kinde, and in such
a manner, connected to these already named, that without the
dedermination of them, one can neither affirm one or the other
part; which are, The determining of the Motion and Rest of the
said Earth, and of the Sun. And if the same Holy Spirit hath
purposely pretermitted to teach us those Propositions, as nothing
concerning his intention, that is, our salvation; how can it be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
that the holding of one part rather than the other, should
be so necessary, as that it is <hi>de Fide,</hi> and the other erronious?
Can an Opinion be Heretical, and yet nothing concerning the
salvation of souls? Or can it be said that the Holy Ghost purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
not to teach us a thing that concerned our salvation? I might
here insert the Opinion of an Ecclesiastical<note n="*" place="margin">Card. Baronius.</note> Person,<note place="margin">Spiritui sancto mentem fuisse, nos docere, quomodo ad Caelum eatur: non autem, quomodo Caelum gradiatur.</note> raised to the

nor ought any persons to be displeased, if others do not
hold, in natural Disputes to that opinion which best pleaseth
them; and especially touching Problems that have, for thousands
of years, been controverted amongst the greatest Philosophers, as is
the Stability of the Sun, and Mobility of the Earth, an opinion
held by <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and by his whole Sect; by <hi>Heraclides Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus,</hi>
who was of the same opininion; by <hi>Phylolaus,</hi> the Master
of <hi>Plato;</hi> and by <hi>Plato</hi> himself, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> relateth, and of
which <hi>Plutarch</hi> writeth in the life of <hi>Numa,</hi> that the said <hi>Plato,</hi>
when he was grown old, said, It is a most absurd thing to think
otherwise: The same was believed by <hi>Aristarchus Samius,</hi> as
we have it in <hi>Archimedes;</hi> and probably by <hi>Archimedes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:96976:247"/>
by <hi>Nicetas</hi> the Philosopher, upon the testimony of <hi>Scicero,</hi>
and by many others. And this opinion hath, finally, been am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified,
and with many Observations and Demonstrations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by <hi>Nicholaus Copernicus.</hi> And <hi>Seneca,</hi> a most eminent

ought, with great diligence, seek for an assured knowledge,
whether it be Heaven, or the Earth, in which the Diurnal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
resides.</p>
                     <p>And for this cause, it would probably be prudent and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
counsel, if besides the Articles which concern our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the establishment of our Faith (against the stability of
which there is no fear that any valid and solid Doctrine can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
rise up) men would not aggregate and heap up more, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
necessity: And if it be so, it would certainly be a preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
thing to introduce such Articles at the request of persons
who, besides that we know not that they speak by inspiration
of Divine Grace, we plainly see that there might be wished in
them the understanding which would be necessary first to enable
them to comprehend, and then to discuss the Demonstrations
wherewith the subtiler Sciences proceed in confirming such like
Conclusions. Nay, more I should say, (were it lawful to speak
my judgment freely on this Argument) that it would haply
more suit with the <hi>Decorum</hi> and Majesty of those Sacred Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes,
if care were taken that every shallow and vulgar Writer
might not authorize his Books (which are not seldome grounded
upon foolish fancies) by inserting into them Places of Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
interpreted, or rather distorted to Senses as remote from
the right meaning of the said Scripture, as they are neer to deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rision,
who not without ostentation flourish out their Writings
therewith. Examples of such like abuses there might many be
produced, but for this time I will confine my self to two, not
much besides these matters of <hi>Astronomy:</hi> One of which, is that
of those Pamphlets which were published against the <hi>Medicean</hi>
Planets, of which I had the fortune to make the discovery; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the existence of which there were brought many places of
Sacred Scripture: Now, that all the World seeth them to be
Planets, I would gladly hear with what new interpretations
those very Antagonists do expound the Scripture, and excuse their
own simplicity. The other example is of him who but very
lately hath Printed against <hi>Astronomers</hi> and <hi>Philosophers,</hi> that
the Moon doth not receive its light from the Sun, but is of its own
nature resplendent: which imagination he in the close confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
or, to say better, perswadeth himself that he confirmeth by
sundry Texts of Scripture, which he thinks cannot be reconciled
unlesse his opinion should be true and necessary. Neverthelesse,
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:96976:247"/>
the Moon of it self is Tenebrose, and yet it is no lesse lucid than
the Splendor of the Sun.</p>
                     <p>Hence it is manifest, that these kinde of Authors, in regard they
did not dive into the true Sence of the Scriptures, would (in case
their authority were of any great moment) have imposed a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
upon others to believe such Conclusions for true as were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to manifest Reason, and to Sense. Which abuse <hi>Deus
avertat,</hi> that it do not gain Countenance and Authority; for if it
should, it would in a short time be necessary to proscribe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
all the Contemplative Sciences. For being that by nature
the number of such as are very unapt to understand perfectly
both the Sacred Scriptures, and the other Sciences is much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than that of the skilfull and intelligent; those of the first sort
superficially running over the Scriptures, would arrogate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
an Authority of decreeing upon all the Questions in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
by vertue of some Word by them misunderstood, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by the Sacred Pen-men to another purpose: Nor would
the small number of the Intelligent be able to repress the furious
Torrent of those men, who would finde so many the more fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
in that the gaining the reputation of Wise men without
pains or Study, is far more grateful to humane Nature, than the
consuming our selves with restless contemplations about the most
painfull Arts. Therefore we ought to return infinite thanks to
Almighty God, who of his Goodness freeth us from this fear, in
that he depriveth such kinde of persons of all Authority and, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
the Consulting, Resolving, and Decreeing upon so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Determinations in the extraordinary Wisdom and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
of most Sacred Fathers; and in the Supream Authority of
those, who being guided by his Holy Spirit, cannot but determin
Holily: So ordering things, that of the levity of those other men,
there is no account made. This kinde of men are those, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
against whom, not without Reason, Grave, and Holy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

                        <hi>This</hi> (Scilicet <hi>the Sacred Scripture) the talking
old woman, the doting old man, the talkative Sophister, all venture
upon, lacerate, teach, and that before they have learnt it. Others
induced by Pride, diving into hard words, Philosophate amongst
Women, touching the Holy Scriptures. Others (Oh shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful!)
Learn of Women what they teach to Men; and, as if this
were nothing, in a certain facility of words, I may say of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
expound to others what they understand not themselves. I
forbear to speak of those of my own Profession, who, if after Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Learning they chance to attain to the Holy Scriptures, and
tickle the ears of the people with affected and Studied expressions,
they affirm that all they say, is to be entertained as the Law of God;
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:96976:248"/>
and not stooping to learn what the Prophets and Apostles held,
they force incongruous testimonies to their own Sense: As if it
were the genuine, and not corrupt way of teaching to deprave Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
and Wrest the Scripture according to their own singular and
contradictory humour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I will not rank among these same secular Writers any <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logists,</hi>
whom I repute to be men of profound Learning, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Manners, and therefore hold them in great esteem and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
Yet I cannot deny but that I have a certain scruple in
my mind, and consequently am desirous to have it removed,
whilst I hear that they pretend to a power of constraining others
by Authority of the Scriptures to follow that opinion in Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Disputations, which they think most agreeth with the Texts
of that: Holding withall, that they are not bound to answer
the Reasons and Experiments on the contrary: In Explication
and Confirmation of which their judgement they say, That <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologie</hi>
being the Queen of all the Sciences, she ought not upon
any account to stoop to accomodate her self to the Positions of
the rest, less worthy, and inferior to her: But that they ought
to refer themselves to her (as to their Supream Emperess) and
change and alter their Conclusions, according to <hi>Theological</hi>
Statutes and Decrees. And they further add, That if in the
inferior Science there should be any Conclusion certain by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of Demonstrations or experiments, to which there is found
in Scripture another Conclusion repugnant; the very Professors
of that Science ought of themselves to resolve their Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and discover the falacies of their own Experiments, without
repairing to Theologers and Textuaries, it not suiting (as hath
been said) with the dignity of <hi>Theologie</hi> to stoop to the investiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the falacies of the inferior Sciences: But it sufficeth her,
to determine the truth of the Conclusion with her absolute Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and by her infallibility. And then the Natural Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
in which they say that we ought to bide by the meer Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Scripture, without glossing, or expounding it to
Senses different from the Words, they affirm to be Those of
which the Scripture speaketh alwaies in the same manner; and
the Holy Fathers all receive, and expound to the same
Sense.</p>
                     <p>Now as to these Determinations, I have had occasion to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
some particulars (which I will purpose) for that I was made
cautious thereof, by those who understand more than I in these
businesses, and to whose judgements I alwaies submit my self.
And first I could say, that there might possibly a certain kinde of
equivocation interpose, in that they do not distinguish the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minences
whereby Sacred <hi>Theologie</hi> meriteth the Title of Queen.
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:96976:248"/>
For it might be called so, either because that that which is taught
by all the other Sciences, is found to be comprized and demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in it, but with more excellent means, and with more sublime
Learning; in like manner, as for example; The Rules of measuring
of Land, &amp; of Accountantship are much more excellently contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Arithmatick and Geometry of <hi>Euclid,</hi> than in the Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Surveyours and Accomptants: Or because the Subject about
which <hi>Theologie</hi> is conversant, excelleth in Dignity all the other
Subjects, that are the Matters of other Sciences: As also because
its Documents are divulged by nobler waies. That the Title
and Authority of Queen belongeth to <hi>Theologie</hi> in the first
Sense, I think that no Theologers will affirm, that have but any
in-sight into the other Sciences; of which there are none (as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve)
that will say that Geometry, Astronomy Musick, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
are much more excellently and exactly contained in the
Sacred Volumes, than in the Books of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> in <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> in
<hi>Boetius,</hi> and in <hi>Galen.</hi> Therefore it is probable that the Regal
Preheminence is given her upon the second account, namely, By
reason of the Subject, and the admirable communicating of the
Divine Revelations in those Conclusions which by other means
could not be conceived by men, and which chiefly concern the
acquist of eternal Beatitude. Now if <hi>Theologie</hi> being conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
about the loftiest Divine Contemplation, and residing for
Dignity in the Regal Throne of the Sciences, (whereby she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
of highest Authority) descendeth not to the more mean
and humble Speculations of the inferior Sciences: Nay; (as hath
been declared above) hath no regard to them, as not concerning
Beatitude; the Professors thereof ought not to arrogate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the Authority to determin of Controversies in those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
which have been neither practised nor studied by them.
For this would be as if an Absolute Prince, knowing that he
might freely command, and cause himself to be obeyed, should
(being neither Phisitian nor Architect) undertake to administer
Medicines, and erect Buildings after his own fashion, to the great
endangering af the lives of the poor Patients, and to the manifest
destruction of the Edifices.</p>
                     <p>Again, to command the very Professors of <hi>Astronomy,</hi> that
they of themselves see to the confuting of their own Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Demonstrations, as those that can be no other but
Falacies and Sophismes, is to enjoyn a thing beyond all possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of doing: For it is not onely to command them that they do
not see that which they see, and that they do not understand
that which they understand; but that in seeking, they finde the
contrary of that which they happen to meet with. Therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that this is to be done, it would be necessary that they were
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:96976:249"/>
shewed the way how to make the Powers of the Soul to command
one another, and the inferior the Superior; so that the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and will might, and should believe contrary to what the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
understands: I still mean in Propositions purely Natural, and
which are not <hi>de Fide,</hi> and not in the Supernatural, which are
<hi>de Fide.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I would entreat these Wise and Prudent Fathers, that they
would withal diligence consider the difference that is between
Opinable and Demonstrative Doctrines: To the end, that well
weighing in their minds with what force Necessary Illations ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige,
they might the better ascertain themselves, that it is not in
the Power of the Professors of Demonstrative Sciences to change
their Opinions at pleasure, and apply themselves one while to
one side, and another while to another; and that there is a great
difference between commanding a Methametitian or a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
and the disposing of a Lawyer or a Merchant; and that the
demonstrated Conclusions touching the things of Nature and of
the Heavens cannot be changed with the same facility, as the
Opinions are touching what is lawful or not in a Contract, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
or Bill of Exchange. This difference was well understood
by the Learned and Holy Fathers, as their having been at great
pains to confute many Arguments, or to say better, many Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical
Fallacies, doth prove unto us; and as may expresly be
read in some of them, and particularly we have in S. <hi>Augustine</hi>
the following words:<note n="g" place="margin">Hoc indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitanter tenendum est, ut quicquid Sapientes hujus Mundi, de Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra rerum veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter demonstrare potuerint, ostenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, nostris libris non esse contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um: quicquid au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem illi, in suis vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminibus, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium Sacris Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris docent, sine ulla dubitatione credamus, id falsis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simum esse, &amp; quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quo modo possu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, etiam osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus; atque ita teneamus Fidem Domini nostri, in quasunt absconditi omnes thesauri Sapientiae, ut ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que falsae Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiae loquacitate seducamur, neque simulata Religio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis superstitione terreamur.</note> 
                        <hi>This is to be held for an undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Truth, That we may be confident, that whatever the Sages of
this World have demonstrated touching Natural Points, is no waies
contrary to our Bibles: And in case they teach any thing in their
Books that is contrary to the Holy Scriptures, we may without any
scruple conclude it to be most false; And according to our ability
let us make the same appear: And let us so keep the Faith of our
Lord, in whom are hidden all the Treasures of Wisdom; that we
be neither seduced with the Loquacity of false Philosophy, nor
scared by the superstition of a counterfeit Religion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From which words, I conceive that I may collect this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
namely, That in the Books of the Wise of this World,
there are contained some Natural truths that are solidly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated,
and others again that are barely taught; and that as to
the first sort, it is the Office of wise Divines to shew that they
are not contrary to the Sacred Scriptures; As to the rest, taught,
but not necessarily demonstrated, if they shall contain any thing
contrary to the Sacred Leaves, it ought to be held undoubtedly
false, and such it ought by all possible waies to be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated.</p>
                     <p>If therefore Natural Conclusions veritably demonstrated,<note place="margin">Gen. as Litteram. <hi>lib</hi> I. Cap.25.</note> are
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:96976:249"/>
not to be postposed to the Places of Scripture, but that it ought
to be shewn how those Places do not interfer with the said Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions;
then its necessary before a Physical Proposition be
condemned, to shew that it is not necessarily demonstrated; and
this is to be done not by them who hold it to be true, but by those
who judge it to be false. And this seemeth very reasonable,
and agreeable to Nature; that is to say, that they may much
more easily find the fallacies in a Discourse, who believe it to be
false, than those who account it true and concludent. Nay, in
this particular it will come to passe, that the followers of this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
the more that they shall turn over Books, examine the
Arguments, repeat the Observations, and compare the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the more shall they be confirmed in this belief. And your
Highness knoweth what happened to the late Mathematick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor
in the University of <hi>Pisa,</hi> Who betook himself in his old
age to look into the Doctrine of <hi>Copernicus,</hi> with hope that he
might be able solidly to confute it (for that he held it so far to
be false, as that he had never studied it) but it was his fortune,
that as soon as he had understood the grounds, proceedings, and
demonstrations of <hi>Copernicus,</hi> he found himself to be perswaded,
and of an opposer became his most confident Defender. I
might also nominate other<note n="*" place="margin">P. Clavius the Jesuite.</note> Mathematicians, who being moved
by my last Discoveries, have confessed it necessary to change the
formerly received Constitution of the World, it not being able
by any means to subsist any longer.</p>
                     <p>If for the banishing this Opinion and Hypothesis out of the
World, it were enough to stop the mouth of one alone, as it
may be they perswade themselves who measuring others judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
by their own, think it impossible that this Doctrine should
be able to subsist and finde any followers, this would be very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
to be done, but the business standeth otherwise: For to
execute such a determination, it would be necessary to prohibite
not onely the Book of <hi>Copernicus,</hi> and the Writings of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Authors that follow the same opinion, but to interdict the
whole Science of <hi>Astronomy;</hi> and which is more, to forbid men
looking towards Heaven, that so they might not see <hi>Mars</hi> and
<hi>Venus</hi> at one time neer to the Earth, and at another farther off,
with such a difference that the latter is found to be fourty times,
and the former sixty times bigger in surface at one time than at
another; and to the end, that the same <hi>Venus</hi> might not be
discovered to be one while round, and another while forked, with
most subtil hornes: and many other sensible Observations which
can never by any means be reconciled to the <hi>Ptolomaick</hi> Systeme,
but are unanswerable Arguments for the <hi>Copernican.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the prohibiting of <hi>Copernicus</hi> his Book, now that by many
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:96976:250"/>
new Observations, and by the application of many of the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the reading of him, his Hypothesis and Doctrine doth
every day appear to be more true, having admitted and tolerated
it for so many years, whilst he was lesse followed, studied, and
confirmed, would seem, in my judgment, an affront to Truth,
and a seeking the more to obscure and suppresse her, the more
she sheweth her self clear and perspicuous.</p>
                     <p>The abolishing and censuring, not of the whole Book, but
onely so much of it as concerns this particular opinion of the
<hi>Earths Mobility,</hi> would, if I mistake not, be a greater detriment
to souls, it being an occasion of great scandal, to see a Position
proved, and to see it afterwards made an Heresie to believe it.</p>
                     <p>The prohibiting of the whole Science, what other would it
be but an open contempt of an hundred Texts of the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
which teach us, That the Glory, and the Greatnesse of
Almighty God is admirably discerned in all his Works, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely
read in the Open Book of Heaven? Nor let any one
think that the Lecture of the lofty conceits that are written in
those Leaves finish in only beholding the Splendour of the Sun,
and of the Stars, and their rising and setting, (which is the term
to which the eyes of bruits and of the vulgar reach) but there
are couched in them mysteries so profound, and conceipts so sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime,
that the vigils, labours, and studies of an hundred and an
hundred acute Wits, have not yet been able thorowly to dive
into them after the continual disquisition of some thousands of
years. But let the Unlearned believe, that like as that which
their eyes discern in beholding the aspect of a humane body, is
very little in comparison of the stupendious Artifices, which an
exquisite and curious Anatomist or Philosopher finds in the same
when he is searching for the use of so many Muscles, Tendons,
Nerves, and Bones; and examining the Offices of the Heart,
and of the other principal Members, seeking the seat of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Faculties, noting and observing the admirable structures of
the Instruments of the Senses, and, without ever making an end
of satisfying his curiosity and wonder, contemplating the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles
of the Imagination, of the Memory, and of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding;
So that which represents it self to the meer sight,
is as nothing in comparison and proportion to the strange Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
that by help of long and accurate Observations the Wit
of Learned Men discovereth in Heaven. And this is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of what I had to consider touching this particular.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, as to those that adde, That those Natural
Propositions of which the Scripture still speaks in one constant
tenour, and which the Fathers all unanimously receive in the
same sense, ought to be accepted according to the naked and
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:96976:250"/>
literal sense of the Words, without glosses and interpretations;
and received and held for most certain and true; and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
the Mobility of the Sun, and Stability of the Earth,
as being such, are <hi>de Fide</hi> to be held for true, and the contrary
opinion to be deemed Heretical. I shall propose to considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in the first place, That of Natural Propositions, some there
are, of which all humane Science and Discourse can furnish us
only with some plausible opinion, and probable conjecture ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than with any certain and demonstrative knowledge; as for
example, whether the Stars be animated: Others there are, of
which we have, or may confidently believe that we may have,
by Experiments, long Observations, and Necessary Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
an undubitable assurance; as for instance, whether the
Earth and Heavens move, or not; whether the Heavens are
Spherical, or otherwise. As to the first sort, I doubt not in the
least, that if humane Ratiocinations cannot reach them, and
that consequently there is no Science to be had of them, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an Opinion or Belief, we ought fully and absolutely to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with the meer Verbal Sense of the Scripture: But as to the
other Positions, I should think (as hath been said above) That
we are first to ascertain our selves of the fact it self, which will
assist us in finding out the true senses of the Scriptures; which
shall most certainly be found to accord with the fact demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
for two truths can never contradict each other. And
this I take to be a Doctrine orthodox and undoubted, for that I
finde it written in Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> who speaking to our point
of the Figure of Heaven, and what it is to be believed to be, in
regard that which Astronomers affirm concerning it seemeth to
be, contrary to the Scripture, (they holding it to be rotund,
and the Scripture calling it as it were a<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Pelle,</hi> a Skin in the Original, but in our Bibles a Curtain.</note> Curtain, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
that we are not at all to regard that the Scripture contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts
Astronomers; but to believe its Authority, if that which
they say shall be false, and founded only on the conjectures of
humane infirmity: but if that which which they affirm be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by indubitable Reasons, this Holy Father doth not say,
that the Astronomers are to be enjoyned, that they themselves
resolving and renouncing their Demonstrations do declare their
Conclusion to be false, but saith, that it ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated,
That what is said in Scripture of a Curtain is not

methinks that the circumspection of this Saint is worthy to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired

                        <hi>Which
particular, although (at present) it cannot easily be comprehended,
yet I suppose in our farther Progress of handling the Scriptures,
we may meet with some more pertinent places, upon which it will
be permitted us (if not to determin any thing for certain, yet) to
suggest somewhat concerning this matter, according to the dictates
of Sacred Authority. But novv, the moderation of pious gravity
being alwaies observed, vve ought to receive nothing rashly in
a doubtful point, least perhaps vve reject that out of respect to
our Errour, vvhich hereafter Truth may discover, to be in no
vvise repugnant to the Sacred Volumes of the Old and Nevv Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By this and other places (if I deceive not my self) the intent
of the Holy Fathers appeareth to be, That in Natural questions,
and which are not <hi>de Fide,</hi> it is first to be considered, whether
they be indubitably demonstrated, or by sensible Experiments
known; or whether such a knowledge and demonstration is to be
had; which having obtained, and it being the gift of God, it
ought to be applyed to find out the true Sences of the Sacred Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in those places, which in appearance might seem to speak to
a contrary meaning: Which will unquestionably be pierced into
by Prudent Divines, together with the occasions that moved the
Holy Ghost,<note place="margin">Id. D Aug. in Gen. <hi>ad Litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram,</hi> lib. 1. <hi>in sine.</hi>
                        </note> (for our exercise, or for some other reason to me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known)
to veil it self sometimes under words of different signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications.</p>
                     <p>As to the other point, Of our regarding the Primary Scope of
those Sacred Volumes, I cannot think that their having spoken
alwaies in the same tenour, doth any thing at all disturb this
Rule. For if it hath been the Scope of the Scripture by way of
condescention to the capacity of the Vulgar at any time, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:96976:251"/>
a Proposition in words, that bear a sense different from the
Essence of the said Proposition; why might it not have observed
the same, and for the same respect, as often as it had occasion to
speak of the same thing? Nay I conceive, that to have done
otherwise, would but have encreased the confusion, and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
the credit that these Sacred Records ought to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Common People.</p>
                     <p>Again, that touching the Rest and Motion of the Sun and
Earth, it was necessary, for accommodation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to Popular Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
to assert that which the Litteral sense of the Scripture im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth,
experience plainly proveth: For that even to our dayes
people far less rude, do continue in the same Opinion upon Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
that if they were well weighed and examined, would be
found to be extream trivial, and upon Experiments, either whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
false, or altogether besides the purpose. Nor is it worth
while to go about to remove them from it, they being incapable
of the contrary Reasons that depend upon too exquisite Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
and too subtil Demonstrations, grounded upon Abstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
which, for the comprehending of them, require too strong
an Imagination. Whereupon, although that the Stability of
Heaveu, and Motion of the Earth should be more than certain
and demonstrated to the Wise; yet nevertheless it would be
necessary, for the conservation of credit amongst the Vulgar, to
affirm the contrary: For that of a thousand ordinary men, that
come to be questioned concerning these particulars, its probab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e
that there will not be found so much as one that will not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
that he thinketh, and so certainly he doth, that the Sun
moveth, and the Earth standeth still. But yet none ought to
take this common Popular Assent to be any Argument of the
truth of that which is affirmed: For if we should examine
these very men touching the grounds and motives by which they
are induced to believe in that manner; and on the other side
should hear what Experiments and Demonstrations perswade
those few others to believe the contrary, we should finde these
latter to be moved by most solid Reasons, and the former by
simple appearances, and vain and ridiculous occurrences. That
therefore it was necessary to assign Motion to the Sun, and Rest
to the earth, lest the shallow capacity of the Vulgar should be
confounded, amused, and rendred obstinate and contumacious,
in giving credit to the principal Articles, and which are absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>de fide,</hi> it is sufficiently obvious. And if it was necessary so
to do, it is not at all to be wondred at, that it was with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Wisdom so done, in the Divine Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>But I will alledge further, That not onely a respect to the
Incapacity of the Vulgar, but the current Opinion of those times
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:96976:252"/>
made the Sacred Writers, in the points that were not necessary
to salvation, to accommodate themselves more to the received
use, than to the true Essence of things: Of which S. <hi>Hierom</hi>
treating, writeth:<note n="k" place="margin">Quasi non mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </note> 
                        <hi>As if many things were not spoken in
the Holy Scriptures according to the judgement of those times
in which they were acted, and not according to that which
truth contained.</hi> And elsewhere, the same Saint:<note n="l" place="margin">Consuetudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis Scripturarum est, ut opinionem multarum rerum sic narret Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, quomodo eo tempore ab omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus credebatur. <hi>In cap. 13. Matth.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>It is the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
for the Pen-men of Scripture, to deliver their Judgments in
many things, according to the common received opinion that their
times had of them.</hi> And<note n="*" place="margin">D. Thomas, in cap. 26. Job. v. 7.</note> S. <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> in <hi>Job</hi> upon those
words, <hi>Qui extendit Aquilonem super vacuum, &amp; appendit
Terram super nihilum:</hi> Noteth that the Scripture calleth that
space <hi>Vacuum</hi> and <hi>Nihilum,</hi> which imbraceth and invironeth the
Earth, and which we know, not to be empty, bat filled with Air,
Neverthelesse, saith he, The Scripture to comply with the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of the Vulgar, who think that in that same space there
is nothing, calleth it <hi>Vacuum</hi> and <hi>Nihilum.</hi> Here the words of
S. <hi>Thomas, Quod de superiori Haemisphaerio Coeli nihil nobis ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paret,
nisi spatium aëre plenum, quod vulgares homines reputant
Vacuum; loquitur enim secundum existimationem vulgarium ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum,
prout est mos in Sacra Scriptura.</hi> Now from this Place
I think one may very Logically argue, That the Sacred Scripture
for the same respect had much more reason to phrase the Sun mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable,
and the Earth immoveable. For if we should try the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of the Common People, we should find them much more
unapt to be perswaded of the stability of the Sun, and Motion
of the Earth, than that the space that environeth it is full of Air.
Therefore if the sacred Authors, in this point, which had not so
much difficulty to be beat into the capacity of the Vulgar, have
notwithstanding forborn to attempt perswading them unto it, it
must needs seem very reasonable that in other Propositions much
more abstruse they have observed the same stile. Nay <hi>Copernicus</hi>
himself, knowing what power an antiquated custome and way
of conceiving things become familiar to us from our infancy
hath in our Fancy, that he might not increase confusion and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
in our apprehensions, after he had first demonstrated,
That the Motions which appear to us to belong to the Sun, or to
the Firmament, are really in the Earth; in proceeding after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to reduce them into Tables, and to apply them to use, he
calleth them the Motions of the Sun, and of the Heaven that is
above the Planets; expresly terming them the Rising and Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the Sun and Stars; and mutations in the obliquity of
the Zodiack, and variations in the points of the Equinoxes, the
Middle Motion, <hi>Anomalia, Prosthaphaeresis</hi> of the Sun; and such
other things; which do in reality belong to the Earth: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:96976:252"/>
being joyned to it, and consequently having a share in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of its motions, we cannot immediately discern them in her, but
are forced to refer them to the Celestial Bodies in which they
appear; therefore we call them as if they were made there, where
they seem to us to be made. Whence it is to be noted how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessary
it is to accommodate our discourse to our old and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
manner of understanding.</p>
                     <p>That, in the next place, the common consent of Fathers, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
a Natural Proposition of Scripture, all in the same sense
ought to Authorize it so far, as to make it become a matter of
Faith to believe it to be<note n="*" place="margin">Namely, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Sense.</note> so, I should think that it ought at most
to be understood of those Conclusions onely, which have been by
the said Fathers discussed, and sifted with all possible diligence,
and debated on the one side, and on the other, and all things in
the end concurring to disprove the one, and prove the other. But
the Mobility of the Earth, and Stability of the Sun, are not of
this kinde; For, that the said Opinion was in those times total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
buried, and never brought amongst the Questions of the Schools,
and not considered, much less followed by any one: So that it is to
be believed that it never so much as entered into the thought of
the Fathers to dispute it, the Places of Scripture, their own Opinion,
and the assent of men having all concurred in the same judgement,
without the contradiction of any one, so far as we can finde.</p>
                     <p>Besides, it is not enough to say that the Fathers all admit the
stability of the Earth, &amp;c. Therefore to believe it is a matter of
Faith: But its necessary to prove that they have condemned the
contrary Opinion: For I may affirm and bide by this, That their
not having occasion to make satisfaction upon the same, and to
discuss it, hath made them to omit and admit it, onely as cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
but not as resolved and proved. And I think I have very
good Reason for what I say; For either the Fathers did make
reflection upon this Conclusion as controverted, or not: If not,
then they could determin nothing concerning it, no not in their
private thoughts; and their incogitance doth not oblige us to
receive those Precepts which they have not, so much as in their
intentions enjoyned. But if they did reflect and consider there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they would long since have condemned it, if they had judged
it erroneous; which we do not find that they have done. Nay, after
that some Divines have began to consider it, we find that they
have not deem'd it erroneous; as we read in the Commentaries of
<hi>Didacus a Stunica</hi> upon <hi>Job,</hi> in <hi>Cap. 9, v.</hi> 6. on the words, <hi>Qui com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movet
Terram de loco suo,</hi> &amp;c. Where he at large discourseth upon
the <hi>Copernican</hi> Hypothesis, and concludeth, <hi>That the Mobility
of the Earth, is not contrary to Scripture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Withal, I may justly question the truth of that determination,
namely, That the Church enjoyneth us to hold such like Natural
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:96976:253"/>
Conclusions as matters of Faith, onely because they bear the
stamp of an unanimous Interpretation of all the Fathers: And
I do suppose that it may possibly be, that those who hold in this
manner, might possibly have gone about in favour of their own
Opinion, to have amplified the Decretal of the Councils; which
I cannot finde in this case to prohibit any other, save onely, <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
to Senses contrary to that of Holy Church, or of the
concurrent consent of Fathers, those places, and those onely that
do pertain either to Faith or Manners, or concern our edification
in the Doctrine of Christianity: And thus speaks the Council of
Trent.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Concil. Trid. Sess. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Sess.</hi> 4. But the Mobility or Stability of the Earth, or
of the Sun, are not matters of Faith, nor contrary to Manners,
nor is there any one, that for the stablishing of this Opinion,
will pervert places of Scripture in opposition to the Holy Church,
or to the Fathers: Nay, Those who have writ of this Doctrine,
did never make use of Texts of Scripture; that they might leave
it still in the breasts of Grave and Prudent Divines to interpret
the said Places, according to their true meaning.</p>
                     <p>And how far the Decrees of Councills do comply with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Fathers in these particulars, may be sufficiently manifest, in
that they are so far from enjoyning to receive such like Natural
Conclusions for matters of Faith, or from censuring the contrary
Opinions as erronious; that rather respecting the Primitive and
primary intention of the Holy Church, they do adjudge it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
to be busied in examining the truth thereof. Let

                        <hi>To these I

or go thorow with, nor is it any way necessary for those,
whom we desire to inform of things that more nearly
concern their own salvation and The Churches Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But yet although in Natural Propositions we were to take the
resolution of condemning or admitting them from Texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
unanimously expounded in the same Sense by all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
yet do I not see how this Rule can hold in our Case; for that
upon the same Places we read several Expositions in the Fathers;
<note n="m" place="margin">Non solem, sed Primum Mobile immotum consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisse: <hi>Dionis. Areop.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Dionysius Areopagita</hi> saying, <hi>That the Primum Mobile, and
not the Sun stand still.</hi> Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> is of the same Opinion;
<note n="n" place="margin">Omnia cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pora Caelestia, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mota substitisse:</note> 
                        <hi>All the Celestial Bodies were immoveable.</hi> And with them
concurreth <hi>Abulensis.</hi> But which is more, amongst the Jewish
Authors (whom <hi>Josephus</hi> applauds) some have held,<note n="o" place="margin">Solem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vera non substitis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se immotum, sed probrevi tempore, intra quod Israeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae, hostes suos fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derunt, id ita vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumesse.</note> 
                        <hi>That
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:96976:253"/>
The Sun did not really stand still, but seemed so to do, during the
short time in which Israel gave the overthrow to their Enemies.</hi>
So for the Miracle in the time of <hi>Hezekiah, Paulus Burgensis</hi> is of
opinion that it was not wrought on the Sun, but on the Diall.
But that, in short, it is necessary to Glosse and Interpret the
words of the Text in <hi>Joshua,</hi> when ever the Worlds Systeme
is in dispute,<note place="margin">Isa. Cap. 38.</note> I shall shew anon. Now finally, granting to these
Gentlemen more than they demand, to wit, That we are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to acquiesce in the judgment of Judicious Divines, and that
in regard that such a particular Disquisition is not found to
have been made by the Ancient Fathers, it may be undertaken
by the Sages of our Age, who having first heard the Experiments,
Observations, Reasons, and Demonstrations of Philosophers and
Astronomers, on the one side, and on the other (seeing that the
Controversie is about Natural Problems, and Necessary <hi>Dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's,</hi>
and which cannot possibly be otherwise than in one of
the two manners in controversie) they may with competent cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
determine what Divine Inspirations shall dictate to them.
But that without minutely examining and discussing all the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
on both sides; and without ever comming to any certainty
of the truth of the Case, such a Resolution should be taken, Is
not to be hoped from those who do not stick to hazzard the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
and Dignity of the Sacred Scripture, in defending the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of their vain Fancies; Nor to be feared from those
who make it their whole businesse, to examine with all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensness,
what the Grounds of this Doctrine are; and that only
in an Holy Zeal for Truth, the Sacred Scriptures, and for the
Majesty, Dignity, and Authority, in which every Christian
should indeavour to have them maintained. Which Dignity,
who seeth not that it is with greater Zeal desired and procured
by those who, absolutely submitting themselves to the Holy
Church, desire, not that this, or that opinion may be prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but onely that such things may be proposed to considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as may the more ascertain her in the safest choice, than by
those who being blinded by their particular Interest, or stimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by malitious suggestions, preach that she should, without
more ado, thunder out Curses, for that she had power so to do:
Not considering that all that may be done is not alwayes conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to be done. The Holy Fathers of old were not of this
opinion, but rather knowing of how great prejudice, and how
much against the primary intent of the Catholick Church, it
would be to go about from Texts of Scripture to decide Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Conclusions, touching which, either Experiments or necessary
Demonstrations, might in time to come evince the contrary, of

Truths demonstrated. And therefore we ought, by help of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
Truth, to seek the undoubted sense of Scripture:

wherewith this Pious Author proceedeth, is,
that not trusting to his observing, that both Demonstrative
Reasons, and the sense that the words of Scripture and the rest
of the Context both precedent and subsequent, do conspire to
prove the same thing, he addeth the following words.</p>

disprove this to be the Authors Sense, it yet remains to enquire,
Whether the other may not be intended also. <hi>And not yet resolving
to accept of one Sense, or reject another, but thinking that he

so be we finde that the other may be also meant, it vvill be doubted
which of them he would have to stand; or which in probability he

weighed. <hi>And lastly, intending to render a Reason of this his
Rule, by shewing us to what perils those men expose the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
and the Church; who, more respecting the support of
their own errours, than the Scriptures Dignity, would stretch its
Authority beyond the Bounds which it prescribeth to it self, he
subjoyns the ensuing words, which of themselves alone might
suffice to repress and moderate the excessive liberty, which some
think that they may assume to themselves:</hi>

Elements; the Motion, Conversion, Magnitude, and Distances of
the Stars, the certain defects of the Sun and Moon, the Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

in an errour should be laught at, but that our Authors should be
thought by them that are without, to be of the same Opinion, and to
the great prejudice of those, whose salvation we wait for, sensured
and rejected as unlearned. For when they shal confute any one of the

the Scriptures, not considering that the more they cite them, and
the more they persist in affirming that they are very clear, and
do admit no other senses, save those which they force upon
them, the greater injury they do to the Dignity of them (if we
allowed that their judgments were of any great Authority) in
case that the Truth coming to be manifestly known to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
should occasion any confusion, at least to those who are
separated from the Holy Church; of whom yet she is very solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,

those Persons proceed, who in Natural Disputations do range

Texts too many times, as are but superficially understood by them.</p>
                     <p>But if these men do verily think, &amp; absolutely believe that they
have the true sence of Such a particular place of Scripture, it must
needs follow of consequence, that they do likewise hold for, certain,
that they have found the absolute truth of that Natural Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which they intend to dispute: And that withal, they do know
that they have a great advantage of their Adversary, whose Lot it
is to defend the part that is false; in regard that he who maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Truth, may have many sensible experiments, and many ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary

make use of no other than deceitful appearances, <hi>Paralogisms</hi> and
<hi>Sophisms.</hi> Now if they keeping within natural bounds, &amp; produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
no other Weapons but those of Philosophy, pretend however,
to have so much advantage of their Enemy; why do they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:96976:255"/>
in coming to engage, presently betake themselves to a Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
inevitable &amp; dreadful to terrifie their Opponent with the sole
beholding of it? But if I may speak the truth, I believe that they are
the first that are affrighted, and that perceiving themselves unable
to bear up against the assaults of theit Adversary, go about to find
out ways how to keep them far enough off, forbidding unto them
the use of the Reason which the Divine Bounty had vouchsafed
them, &amp; abusing the most equitable Authority of sacred Scripture,
which rightly understood and applyed, can never, according to
the common Maxime of Divines, oppose the Manifest Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or Necessary Demonstrations. But these mens running
to the Scriptures for a Cloak to their inability to comprehend,
not to say resolve the Reasons alledged against them, ought (if I
be not mistaken) to stand them in no stead: the Opinion which
they oppose having never as yet been condemned by Holy
Church. So that if they would proceed with Candor, they
should either by silence confess themselves unable to handle such
like points, or first consider that it is not in the power of them or
others,<note place="margin">If this passage seem harsh, the Reader must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that I do but Translate.</note> but onely in that of the Pope, and of Sacred Councils to
censure a Position to be Erroneous: But that it is left to their
freedome to dispute concerning its falsity. And thereupon,
knowing that it is impossible that a Proposition should at the
same time be True and Heretical; they ought, I say, to imploy
themselves in that work which is most proper to them, namely,
in demonstrating the falsity thereof: whereby they may see
how needlesse the prohibiting of it is, its falshood being once
discovered, for that none would follow it: or the Prohibition
would be safe, and without all danger of Scandal. Therefore
first let these men apply themselves to examine the Arguments
of <hi>Copernicus</hi> and others; and leave the condemning of them
for Erroneous and Heretical to whom it belongeth: But yet let
them not hope ever to finde such rash and precipitous Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the Wary and Holy Fathers, or in the absolute Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of him that cannot erre, as those into which they suffer
themselves to be hurried by some particular Affection or Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of their own. In these and such other Positions, which are
not directly <hi>de Fide,</hi> certainly no man doubts but His Holiness
hath alwayes an absolute power of Admitting or Condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, but it is not in the power of any Creature to make
them to be true or false, otherwise than of their own nature,
and <hi>de facto</hi> they are.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it is in my judgment more discretion to assure us
first of the necessary and immutable Truth of the Fact, (over
which none hath power) than without that certainty by condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
one part to deprive ones self of that authority of freedome
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:96976:256"/>
to elect, making those Determinations to become necessary,
which at present are indifferent and arbitrary, and rest in the
will of Supreme Authority. And in a word, if it be not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
that a Conclusion should be declared Heretical, whilst we
are not certain, but that it may be true, their pains are in vain
who pretend to condemn the Mobility of the Earth and Stabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Sun, unlesse they have first demonstrated it to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
and false.</p>
                     <p>It remaineth now, that we consider whether it be true, that
the Place in <hi>Joshuah</hi> may be taken without altering the pure sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of the words: and how it can be that the Sun, obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the command of <hi>Joshuah,</hi> which was, <hi>That it should stand
still,</hi> the day might thereupon be much lengthened. Which bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse,
if the Celestial Motions be taken according to the <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maick</hi>
Systeme, can never any wayes happen, for that the Sun
moving thorow the Ecliptick, according to the order of the
Signes, which is from East to West (which is that which maketh
Day and Night) it is a thing manifest, that the Sun ceasing its
true and proper Motion, the day would become shorter and not
longer; and that on the contrary, the way to lengthen it would
be to hasten and velocitate the Suns motion; insomuch that to
cause the Sun to stay above the Horizon for some time, in one
and the same place, without declining towards the West, it would
be necessary to accelerate its motion in such a manner as that it
might seem equal to that of the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> which would be
an accelerating it about three hundred and sixty times more than
ordinary. If therefore <hi>Joshuah</hi> had had an intention that his
words should be taken in their pure and proper signification, he
would have bid the Sun to have accelerated its Motion so, that
the Rapture of the <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> might not carry it to the
West: but because his words were heard by people which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
knew no other Celestial Motion, save this grand and common
one, from East to West, stooping to their Capacity, and having
no intention to teach them the Constitution of the Spheres, but
only that they should perceive the greatness of the Miracle
wrought, in the lengthening of the Day, he spoke according to
their apprehension. Possibly this Consideration moved <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius
Areopagita</hi> to say that in this Miracle the <hi>Primum Mobile</hi>
stood still, and this stopping, all the Celestial Spheres did of
consequence stay: of which opinion is S. <hi>Augustine</hi> himself, and
<hi>Abulensis</hi> at large confirmeth it. Yea, that <hi>Joshua's</hi> intention
was, that the whole Systeme of the Celestial Spheres should
stand still, is collected from the command he gave at the same
time to the Moon, although that it had nothing to do in the
lengthening of the day; and under the injunction laid upon the
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:96976:256"/>
Moon, we are to understand the Orbes of all the other Planets,
passed over in silence here, as also in all other places of the Sacred
Scriptures; the intention of which, was not to teach us the Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical
Sciences. I suppose therefore, (if I be not deceived)
that it is very plain, that if we allow the <hi>Ptolemaick</hi> Systeme, we
must of necessity interpret the words to some sense different from
their strict signification. Which Interpretation (being admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
by the most usefull precepts of S. <hi>Augustine</hi>) I will not
affirm to be of necessity this above-mentioned, since that some
other man may haply think of some other more proper, and more
agreeable Sense.</p>
                     <p>But now, if this same passage may be understood in the <hi>Coper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nican</hi>
Systeme, to agree better with what we read in <hi>Joshuah,</hi>
with the help of another Observation by me newly shewen in
the Body of the Sun; I will propound it to consideration, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alwaies with those safe Reserves; That I am not so affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to my own inventions, as to prefer them before those of
other men, and to believe that better and more agreeable to the
intention of the Sacred Volumes cannot be produced.</p>
                     <p>Supposing therefore in the first place, that in the Miracle of
<hi>Joshuah,</hi> the whole Systeme of the Celestial Revolutions stood
still, according to the judgement of the afore-named Authors:
And this is the rather to be admitted, to the end, that by the
staying of one alone, all the Constitutions might not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded,
and a great disorder needlesly introduced in the whole
course of Nature: I come in the second place to consider how the
Solar Body, although stable in one constant place, doth neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
revolve in it self, making an entire Conversion in the space
of a Month, or thereabouts; as I conceive I have solidly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
in my Letters <hi>Delle Machie Solari:</hi> Which motion we
sensibly see to be in the upper part of its Globe, inclined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the South; and thence towards the lower part, to encline
towards the North, just in the same manner as all the other Orbs
of the Planets do. Thirdly, If we respect the Nobility of the
Sun, and his being the Fountain of Light, by which, (as I neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
demonstrate) not onely the Moon and Earth, but all the
other Planets (all in the same manner dark of themselves) become
illuminated; I conceive that it will be no unlogicall Illation to say,
That it, as the Grand Minister of Nature, and in a certain sense
the Soul and Heart of the World, infuseth into the other Bodies
which environ it; not onely Light, but Motion also; by revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

                        <hi>If this Sun which
we see, as touching the Essences and Qualities of those things
which fall vvithin our Sense, being very many and different; yet
if he vvho is one, and equally bestovves his Light, doth renew,
nourish, defend, perfect, divide, conjoyn, cherish, make fruitfull,
encrease, change, fix, produce, move, and fashion all living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
And every thing in this Vniverse at this Pleasure, is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker
of one and the same Sun; and the causes of many things
which participate of him, are equally auticipated in him: Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by greater reason;</hi> &amp;c. The Sun therefore being the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of Light and, Principle of Motion, God intending, that at
the Command of <hi>Joshua,</hi> all the Worlds Systeme, should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
many hours in the same state, it sufficeth to make the Sun
stand still, upon whose stay (all the other Conversions ceasing)
the Earth, the Moon, the Sun did abide in the same Constitution
as before, as likewise all the other Planets: Nor in all that time
did the Day decline towards Night, but it was miraculously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed:
And in this manner, upon the standing still of the Sun,
without altering, or in the least disturbing the other Aspects and
mutual Positions of the Stars, the Day might be lengthned on
Earth; which exactly agreeth with the Litteral sense of the Sacred
Text.</p>
                     <p>But that of which, if I be not mistaken, we are to make no
small account, is, That by help of this <hi>Copernican</hi> Hypothesis,
we have the Litteral, apert, and Natural Sense of another parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
that we read of in the same Miracle; which is, That the
Sun stood still <hi>in Medio Caeli:</hi> Upon which passage grave Divines
raise many questions, in regard it seemeth very probable, That
when <hi>Joshuah</hi> desired the lengthning of the Day, the Sun was
near setting, and not in the Meridian; for if it had been in the
Meridian, it being then about the Summer <hi>Solstice,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
the dayes being at the longest, it doth not seem likely
that it was necessary to pray for the lengthning of the day, to
prosecute Victory in a Battail, the space of seven hours and more,
which remained to Night, being sufficient for that purpose.
Upon which Grave Divines have been induced to think that the
Sun was near setting: And so the words themselves seem to
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:96976:257"/>
sound, saying, <hi>Ne movearis Sol, ne movearis.</hi> For if it had
been in the Meridian, either it had been needless to have asked
a Mircale, or it would have been sufficient to have onely praid
for some retardment. Of this opinion is <hi>Cajetan,</hi> to which sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth
<hi>Magaglianes,</hi> confirming it by saying, that <hi>Joshua</hi> had
that very day done so many other things before his commanding
the Sun, as were not possibly to be dispatch't in half a day.
Whereupon they are forced to read the Words <hi>in Medio Coeli</hi>
(to confess the truth) with a little harshness, saying that they
import no more than this: <hi>That the Sun stood still, being in our
Hemisphere,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Solem stetisse, dum adhuc in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misphaerio nostro, supra scilicet Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontem existeret. <hi>Cajetan</hi> in loco.</note> 
                        <hi>that is, above the Horizon.</hi> But (if I do not erre)
we shall avoid that and all other harsh expositions, if according
to the <hi>Copernican</hi> Systeme we place the Sun in the midst, that
is, in the Centre of the Coelestial Orbes, and of the Planetary
Conversions, as it is most requisite to do. For supposing any
hour of the day (either Noon, or any other, as you shall please
neerer to the Evening) the Day was lengthened, and all the
Coelestial Revolutions stayed by the Suns standing still, <hi>In the
midst,</hi> that is, <hi>in the Centre of Heaven,</hi> where it resides: A
Sense so much the more accomodate to the Letter (besides what
hath been said already) in that, if the Text had desired to have
affirmed the Suns Rest to have been caused at Noon-day, the
proper expression of it had been to say, <hi>It stood still at Noon-day,</hi>
or <hi>in the Meridian Circle,</hi> and not <hi>in the midst of Heaven:</hi> In
regard that the true and only <hi>Middle</hi> of a Spherical Body (as is
Heaven) is the Centre.</p>
                     <p>Again, as to other places of Scripture, which seem contrary to
this position, I do not doubt but that if it were acknowledged
for True and Demonstrated those very Divines who so long as
they repute it false, hold those places incapable of Expositions
that agree with it would finde such Interpretations for them, as
should very well suit therewith; and especially if to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Divine Learning they would but adde some knowledge
of the Astronomical Sciences: And as at present, whilst they
deem it false they think they meet in Scripture only with such
places as make against it, if they shall but once have entertained
another conceipt thereof, they would meet peradventure as many
others that accord with it, and haply would judge, that the Holy
Church doth very appositly teach, That God placed the Sun in
the Centre of Heaven, and that thereupon by revolving it in it
self, after the manner of a Wheel, He contributed the ordinary
Courses to the Moon and other Erratick Stars, whilst that she

ABSTRACT
OF THE
Learned Treatise
OF
JOHANNIS KEPLERUS,
The Emperours Mathematician:
ENTITULED
His Introduction upon MARS:</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T must be confessed, that there are very
many who are devoted to Holinesse,
that dissent from the Judgment of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernicus,</hi>
fearing to give the Lye to the
Holy Ghost speaking in the Scriptures,
if they should say, that the Earth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,
and the Sun stands still. But let
such consider, that since we judge of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
many, and those the most principal
things by the Sense of Seeing, it is impossible that we should ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enate
our Speech from this Sense of our Eyes. Therefore many
things daily occur, of which we speak according to the Sense of
Sight, when as we certainly know that the things themselves are
otherwise. An Example whereof we have in that Verse of
<hi>Virgil;</hi>
                     <q>Provehimur portu, Terraeque urbesque recedunt.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>So when we come forth of the narrow straight of some Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
we say that a large Field discovereth it self. So Christ to
<hi>Peter, Duc in altum;</hi> [Lanch forth into the Deep, or on high,]
as if the Sea were higher than its Shores; For so it seemeth to
the Eye, but the Opticks shew the cause of this fallacy. Yet
Christ useth the most received Speech, although it proceed from
this delusion of the Eyes. Thus we conceive of the Rising and
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:96976:259"/>
Setting of the Stars, that is to say, of their Ascension and Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension;
when at the same time that we affirm the Sun riseth, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
say, that it goeth down. See my <hi>Optices Astronomiae, cap.
10. fol.</hi> 327. So in like manner, the <hi>Ptolomaicks</hi> affirm, that the
Planets <hi>stand still,</hi> when for some dayes together they seem to be
fixed, although they believe them at that very time to be moved
in a direct line, either downwards to, or upwards from the
Earth. Thus the Writers of all Nations use the word <hi>Solstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
and yet they deny that the Sun doth really stand still. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
there will never any man be so devoted to <hi>Copernicus,</hi> but
he will say, the Sun entereth into <hi>Cancer</hi> and <hi>Leo,</hi> although he
granteth that the Earth enters <hi>Capricorn</hi> or <hi>Aquarius:</hi> And so
in other cases of the like nature. But now the Sacred Scriptures,
speaking to men of vulgar matters (in which they were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to instruct men) after the manner of men, that so they
might be understood by men, do use such Expressions as are
granted by all, thereby to insinuate other things more Mysterious
and Divine. What wonder is it then, if the Scripture speaks
according to mans apprehension, at such time when the Truth
of things doth dissent from the Conception that all men, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Learned or Unlearned have of them? Who knows not
that it is a Poetical allusion, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. where, whilst under the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
of the Sun, the Course of the Gospel, as also the Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grination
of our Lord Christ in this World, undertaken for our
sakes, is described, <hi>The Sun</hi> is said <hi>to come forth of his Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi>
of the Horizon, <hi>as a Bridegroom out of his Chamber, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
as a Giant to run a Race?</hi> Which <hi>Virgil</hi> thus imitates;
<q>Tithono croceum linquens Aurora cubile:</q>
For the first Poets were amongst the Jews. The Psalmist knew that
the Sun went not forth of the Horizon, as out of its Tabernacle,
&amp; yet it seemeth to the Eye so to do: Nor did he believe, that the
Sun moved, for that it appeared to his sight so to do. And yet he
saith both, for that both were so to his seeming. Neither is it
to be adjudged false in either Sense: for the perception of the
Eyes hath its verity, fit for the more secret purpose of the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
in shadowing forth the current passage of the Gospel, as
also the Peregrination of the Son of God. <hi>Joshua</hi> likewise
mentioneth the Vallies on or in, which the Sun and Moon mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
for that they appeared to him at <hi>Jordan</hi> so to do: And yet
both these Pen-men may obtain their ends. <hi>David,</hi> (and with
him <hi>Syracides</hi>) the magnificence of God being made known,
which caused these things to be in this manner represented to
sight, or otherwise, the mystical meaning, by means of these
Visibles being discerned: And <hi>Joshua,</hi> in that the Sun, as to his
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:96976:259"/>
Sense of Seeing, staid a whole day in the midst of Heaven, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
at the same time to others it lay hid under the Earth. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitant
persons onely look upon the contrariety of the words,
<hi>The Sun stood still,</hi> that is, <hi>The Earth stood still;</hi> not considering
that this contradiction is confined within the limits of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
and Astronomy: For which cause it is not outwardly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to the notice and use of men: Nor will they understand
that the onely thing <hi>Joshuah</hi> prayed for, was that the Mountains
might not intercept the Sun from him; which request he expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in words, that suited with his Ocular Sense: Besides it had
been very unseasonable at that time to think of Astronomy, or
the Errours in Sight; for if any one should have told him that
the Sun could not really move upon the Valley of <hi>Ajalon,</hi> but
onely in relation to Sense, would not <hi>Joshuah</hi> have replyed, that
his desire was that the day might be prolonged, so it were by
any means whatsoever? In like manner would he have answered
if any one had started a question about the Suns Mobility, and
the Earths Motion. But God easily understood by <hi>Joshuahs</hi>
words what he asked for, and by arresting the Earths Motion,
made the Sun in his apprehension seem to stand still. For the
summ of <hi>Joshuahs</hi> Prayer amounts to no more but this, that it
might thus appear to him, let it in the mean time <hi>be what it
would</hi> of it self. For that its so seeming, was not in vain and
ridiculous, but accompanied with the desired effect. But read
the tenth <hi>Chap.</hi> of my <hi>Book,</hi> that treats of <hi>the Optick part of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomy,</hi>
where thou shalt finde the Reasons why the Sun doth
in this manner seem to all mens thinking to be moved, and not
the Earth; as namely, because the Sun appeareth small, and the
Earth bigg. Again, the Motion of the Sun is not discerned by
the eye, by reason of his seeming tardity, but by ratiocina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
onely; in that after some time it varieth not its proximity to
such and such Mountains. Therefore it is impossible that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
unless it be first instructed, should frame to it self any other
apprehension, than that the Earth with Heavens Arch placed
over it, is as it were a great House, in which, being immoveable,
the Sun like a Bird flying in the Air, passeth in so small a Species
out of one Climate into another. Which imagination of all
Man-kinde being thus, gave the first line in the Sacred Leaves:
<hi>In the beginning</hi> (saith <hi>Moses) God created the Heaven and the
Earth;</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> Chp. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> v. 1.</note> for that these two are most obvious to the eye. As if
<hi>Moses</hi> should have said thus to Man; This whole Mundane Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
which thou seest, lucid above, and dark, and of a vast ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
beneath, wherein thou hast thy being, and with which thou
art covered, was created by God.</p>
                  <p>In another place Man is questioned; <hi>Whether he can finde out
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:96976:260"/>
the height of Heaven above, or depth of the Earth beneath:</hi> for
that each of them appeareth to men of ordinary capacity, to have
equally an infinite extent. And yet no man that is in his right
mind will by these words circumscribe and bound the diligence
of Astronomers, whether in demonstrating the most contemptible
Minuity of the Earth, in comparison of Heaven, or in searching
out Astronomical <hi>Distances:</hi> Since those words speak not of the
Rational, but real Dimention; which to a Humane Body,
whilst confin'd to the Earth, and breathing in the open Air, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
impossible. Read the whole 38. Chapter of <hi>Job,</hi> and
compare it with those Points which are disputed in Astronomy,
and Physiologie. If any one do alledge from <hi>Psal.</hi> 24. That<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 24. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>The
Earth is founded upon the Seas,</hi> to the end that he may thence
infer some new Principle in Philosophy, absurd to hear; as, That
the Earth doth float upon the Waters; may it not truly be told
him, That he ought not to meddle with the Holy Spirit, nor to
bring him with contempt into the School of Physiologie.
For the Psalmist in that place means nothing else but
that which men fore-know, and daily see by experience; namely,
That the Earth (being lifted up after the separation of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters)
doth swim between the Grand Oceans, and float about the
Sea. Nor is it strange that the expression should be the same
where the <hi>Israelites</hi> sing,<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 137. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>That they sate on the River of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon;</hi>
that is, <hi>by</hi> the River side. or on the Banks of <hi>Euphrates</hi> and
<hi>Tygris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any one receive this Reading without scruple, why not the
other; that so in those same Texts which are wont to be alledged
against the Motion of the Earth, we may in like manner turn our
eyes from Natural Philosophy, to the scope and intent of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
<hi>One Generation passeth away,</hi> (saith <hi>Ecclesiastes) and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Generation cometh: But the Earth abideth for ever.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 1. v. 4, to 9.</note> As
if <hi>Solomon</hi> did here dispute with Astronomers, and not rather put
men in minde of their Mutability; whenas the Earth, Mankindes
habitation, doth alwaies remain the same: The Suns Motion
doth continually return into what it was at first: The Wind is
acted in a Circle, and returns in the same manner: The Rivers
flow from their Fountains into the Sea, and return again from
thence unto their Fountains: To conclude, The Men of this
Age dying, others are born in their room; the Fable of Life is
ever the same; there is nothing new under the Sun. Here is no
reference to any Physical Opinion. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is Moral of a thing in it
self manifest, and seen by the eyes of all, but little regarded: Tis
that therefore which <hi>Solomon</hi> doth inculcate. For who knows not
that the Earth is alwaies the same? Who sees not that the Sun
dotharise from the East; That the Rivers continually run into
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:96976:260"/>
the Sea; That the vicissitudes of the Windes return into their
primitive State; That some men succeed others? But who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidereth
that the self-same <hi>Scene</hi> of Life is ever acting, by diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
persons; and that nothing is <hi>new</hi> in humane affairs? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Solomon</hi> instancing in those things which all men see, doth
put men in minde of that which many thorowly know, but too
slightly consider.</p>
                  <p>But the 104. <hi>Psalm</hi> is thought by some to contain a Discourse
altogether Physical, in regard it onely concerns Natural Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.
Now God is there said,<note place="margin">Psal. 104. v. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>To have laid the Foundations of
the Earth, that it should not be removed for ever.</hi> But here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the Psalmist is far from the Speculation of Physical Causes:
For he doth wholly acquiesce in the Greatnesse of God,
who did all these things, and sings an Hymne to God the
Maker of them, in which he runneth over the World in order,
as it appeared to his eyes. And if you well consider this
Psalme, it is a Paraphrase upon the six dayes work of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
For as in it the three first dayes were spent in the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Regions; the first of Light from the exteriour Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
the second, of the Waters from the Waters, by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the Firmament; the third, of the Sea from Land;
when also the Earth was cloathed with Herbage and Plants:
And the three last dayes were spent in the filling the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
thus distinguished; the fourth, of Heaven; the
fifth, of the Seas and Aire; the sixth, of the Earth: So
here in this Psalme there are so many distinct parts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to the Analogy of the six dayes Works. For
in <hi>Verse</hi> 2. he cloaths and covereth the Creator with Light
(the first of Creatures, and work of the first day) as with a
Garment. The second part beginneth at <hi>Verse</hi> 3. and treats of
the Waters above the Heavens, the extent of Heaven and of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors
(which the Psalmist seemeth to intend by the Waters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove)
as namely of Clouds, Winds, Whirl-winds, Lightnings.
The third part begins at <hi>Verse</hi> 6. and doth celebrate the Earth
as the foundation of all those things which he here considereth.
For he referreth all things to the Earth, and to those Animals
which inhabit it, for that in the judgment of Sight the two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
parts of the World are Heaven and Earth. He therefore
here observeth that the Earth after so many Ages hath not falte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
tired, or decayed; when as notwithstanding no man hath
yet discovered upon what it is founded. He goeth not about to
teach men what they do not know, but putteth them in minde
of what they neglect, to wit, the Greatnesse and Power of God
in creating so huge a Mass so firm and stedfast. If an Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
should teach that the Earth is placed among the Planets, he
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:96976:261"/>
overthroweth not what the Psalmist here saith, nor doth he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
Common Experience; for it is true notwithstanding,
that the Earth, the Structure of God its Architect, doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
(as our Buildings are wont to do) by age, or consume by
wormes, nor sway and leane to this or that side; that the Seats
and Nests of Living Creatures are not molested; that the
Mountains and Shores stand immoveable against the violence of
the Winds and Waves, as they were at the beginning. But the
Psalmist addeth a most Elegant Hypothesis of the Separation of
the Waters from the Continent or Main-land, and adorns it
with the production of Fountains, and the benefits that Springs
and Rocks exhibit to Birds and Beasts. Nor doth he omit the
apparelling the Earths Surface, mentioned by <hi>Moses</hi> amongst the
works of the third Day, but more sublimely describeth it in his
Case in expressions infused from Divine Inspiration; and flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
out the commemoration of the many commodities which
redound from that Exornation for the Nourishment and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of Man, and<note n="*" place="margin">Shelter.</note> Covert of Beasts. The fourth part begins
at <hi>Verse</hi> 20. celebrating the fourth dayes work, <hi>viz.</hi> The Sun
and Moon, but chiefly the commodiousnesse of those things,
which in their Seasons befall to all Living Creatures and to Man;
this being the subject matter of his Discourse: So that it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appeareth he acted not the part of an Astronomer. For if he
had, he would not then have omitted to mention the five Planets,
than whose moiton nothing is more admirable, nothing more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
nothing that can more evidently set forth the Wisdome
of the Creator amongst the Learned. The fifth part begins,
<hi>Verse</hi> 25. with the fifth Dayes work. And it stores the Seas with
Fishes, and covers them with Ships. The sixth part is more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely
hinted at, <hi>Verse</hi> 28. and alludeth to the Land-Creatures
that were created the sixth day. And lastly, he declareth the
goodnesse of God in general, who daily createth and preserveth
all things? So that whatever he said of the World is in relation
to Living Creatures; He speaks of nothing but what is granted
on all hands; for that it was his intent to extol things known,
and not to dive into hidden matters, but to invite men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
the Benefits that redound unto them from the works of
each of these dayes.</p>
                  <p>And I do also beseech my Reader, not forgetting the Divine
Goodnesse conferred on Mankind; the consideration of which
the Psalmist doth chiefly urge, that when he returneth from the
Temple, and enters into the School of <hi>Astronomy,</hi> he would
with me praise and admire the Wisdome and Greatnesse of the
Creator, which I discover to him by a more narrow explication
of the Worlds Form, the Disquisition of Causes, and Detection
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:96976:261"/>
of the Errours of Sight: And so he will not onely extoll the
Bounty of God in the preservation of Living Creatures of all
kindes, and establishment of the Earth; but even in its Motion
also, which is so strange; so admirable, he will acknowledge the
Wisdome of the Creator. But he who is so stupid as not to
comprehend the Science of <hi>Astronomy,</hi> or so weak and scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
as to think it an offence of Piety to adhere to <hi>Copernicus,</hi>
him I advise, that leaving the Study of <hi>Astronomy,</hi> and censuring
the opinions of Philosophers at pleasure, he betake himself to
his own concerns, and that desisting from further pursuit of these
intricate Studies, he keep at home and manure his own Ground;
and with those Eyes wherewith alone he seeth, being eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
towards this to be admired Heaven, let him pour forth his
whole heart in thanks and praises to God the Creator; and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
himself that he shall therein perform as much Worship to
God, as the <hi>Astronomer,</hi> on whom God hath bestowed this Gift,
that though he seeth more clearly with the Eye of his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing;
yet whatever he hath attained to, he is both able and
willing to extoll his God above it.</p>
                  <p>And thus much concerning the Authority of Sacred Scripture.
Now as touching the opinions of the Saints about these Natural
Points. I answer in one word, That in Theology the weight of
Authority, but in Philosophy the weight of Reason is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.
Therefore Sacred was <hi>Lactantius,</hi> who denyed the
Earths rotundity; Sacred was <hi>Augustine,</hi> who granted the Earth
to be round, but denyed the <hi>Antipodes;</hi> Sacred is the<note n="*" place="margin">Officium</note> Liturgy of
our Moderns, who admit the smallnesse of the Earth, but deny
its Motion: But to me more sacred than all these is Truth, who
with respect to the Doctors of the Church, do demonstrate
from Philosophy that the Earth is both round, circumhabited by
<hi>Antipodes,</hi> of a most contemptible smalnesse, and in a word,
that it is ranked amongst the Planets.</p>

ABSTRACT
OF
Some passages in the Commentaries of
Didacus à Stunica,
OF
SALAMANCA
Upon JOB:
The Toledo Edition, Printed by JOHN RODERICK,
Anno 1584, in Quarto, Pag. 205. &amp; seqq. on
these Words, Chap. 9. Verse 6.</head>
                  <q>Who shaketh the Earth out of her place, and the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
thereof Tremble.</q>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Sacred Pen-man here sets down another ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
whereby God sheweth his Almighty Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
joyned with infinite Wisdom. Which
place, though it must be confessed very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to understand, might be greatly cleared
by the Opinion of the <hi>Pythagorians,</hi> who
hold the Earth to be moved of its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and that the Motion of the Stars can no other way be ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
they being so extreamly different in tardity and velocity.
Of which judgement was <hi>Philolaus,</hi> and <hi>Heraclides Ponticus,</hi> as
<hi>Plutarch</hi> relateth in his Book <hi>De Placitis Philosophorum:</hi> Who
were followed by <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> and, which I more regard,
The Divine <hi>Plato</hi> in his old age; insomuch that he affirmed that
it was most absurd to think otherwise, as the same <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells
us in his<note n="*" place="margin">In vita ejus.</note> 
                     <hi>Numa.</hi> And <hi>Hypocrates</hi> in his Book <hi>De Flatibus,</hi>
calleth the Air <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> The Earths Chariot. But in this
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:96976:262"/>
our Age, <hi>Copernicus</hi> doth demonstrate the courses of the Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
to be according to this Opinion. Nor is it to be doubted
but that the Planets Places may be more exactly and certainly
assigned by his Doctrine, than by <hi>Ptolomies</hi> Great Almogest or
Systeme, or the Opinions of any others. For its manifest, that
<hi>Ptolomy</hi> could never describe either the Motion of the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxes,
or assign the certain and positive beginning of the Year:
the which he ingeniously confesseth in <hi>Lib. 3. De Almagest. Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.
Ch.</hi> 2. and which he leaveth to be discovered in after times
by those Astronomers, who coming into the World much later
than he, might be able to invent some way to make more accurate
observations. And although the<note n="*" place="margin">Followers of that Learned Kings Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis.</note> 
                     <hi>Alphonsines</hi> &amp; <hi>Thebith Ben Core</hi>
have attempted to explain them; yet it appeareth that they have
done as much as nothing. For the Positions of the <hi>Alphonsines</hi>
disagree amongst themselves, as <hi>Ricius</hi> proveth. And although
the Reason of <hi>Thebith</hi> be more acute, and that thereby he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
the certain beginning of the year, (being that which
<hi>Ptolomy</hi> sought for) yet it is now clear, that the Progressions of
the Equinoxes are much longer than he conceived they could be.
Moreover, the Sun is found to be much nearer to us than it was
held to be in times past, by above fourty thousand<note n="*" place="margin">That is 5000 miles; eight of these making an <hi>Italian.</hi> or <hi>English</hi> mile of a 1000. paces every pac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Stadia,</hi> or
furlongs. The Cause and Reason of whose Motion, neither
<hi>Ptolomy</hi> nor any other Astrologers could ever comprehend: And
yet the Reasons of these things are most plainly explained and
demonstrated by <hi>Copernicus</hi> from the Motion of the Earth, with
which he sheweth that all the other <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the Universe
do more aptly accord. Which opinion of his is not in the least
contradicted by what <hi>Solomon</hi> saith in<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 1. v. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Ecclesiastes: But the
Earth abideth for ever.</hi> For that Text signifieth no more but
this, That although the succession of Ages, and generations of
Men on Earth, be various; yet the Earth it self is still one and
the same, and continueth without any sensible alteration; For
the words run thus: <hi>One Generation passeth away, and another
Generation cometh; but the Earth abideth for ever.</hi> So that it
hath no coherence with its Context,<note place="margin">The Motion of the Earth, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Scripture.</note> (as Philosophers shew) if it
be expounded to speak of the Earths immobility. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in this Chapter <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> and in many others, Holy
Writ ascribes Motion to the Sun, which <hi>Copernicus</hi> will have to
stand fixed in the Centre of the Universe; yet it makes nothing
against his Position. For the Motion that belongs to the Earth,
is by way of speech assigned to the Sun, even by <hi>Copernicus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and those who are his followers, so that the Revolution of
the Earth is often by them phrased, The Revolution of the Sun.
To conclude, No place can be produced out of Holy Scripture,
which so clearly speaks the Earths Immobility, as this doth its
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:96976:263"/>
Mobility. Therefore this Text, of which we have spoken, is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
reconciled to this Opinion. And to set forth the Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
power and Wisdome of God, who can indue and actuate the
Frame of the Whole Earth (it being of a monstrous weight by
Nature) with Motion, this our Divine pen-man addeth; <hi>And
the pillars thereof tremble:</hi> As if he would teach us, from the
Doctrine laid down, that it is moved from its Foundations.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N obedience to the command of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Signore Vincenzo Carraffa,</hi> a Neapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan,
and Knight of S. <hi>John of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
(a person, to speak the truth, of
so great Merit, that in him Nobility of
Birth, Affability of Manners, Universal
knowledge of Arts and things, Piety
and Vertue do all contend for prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence)
I resolved with my self to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
the Defence of the Writings of the New, or rather Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed,
and from the Dust of Oblivion (in which it hath long
lain hid) lately Revived Opinion, <hi>Of the Mobility of the Earth,
and Stability of the Sun,</hi> in times past found out first by <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras,</hi>
and at last reduced into Practice by <hi>Copernicus;</hi> who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
hath deduced the Position of the Systeme and Constitution
of the World and its parts from that Hypothesis: on which
Subject I have formerly writ to You, Most Reverend Sir: But
in regard I am bound for <hi>Rome</hi> to preach there by your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
and since this Speculation may seem more proper for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Treatise, to wit, a Volume of <hi>Cosmography,</hi> which I am
in hand with, and which I am daily busie about, that it may
come forth in company with my <hi>Compendium of the Liberal Arts,</hi>
which I have already finished, rather than now to discuss it by it
self, I thought to forbear, imparting what I have done for the
present; Yet I was desirous to give, in the mean time, a brief ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of this my Determination, and to shew You, Most Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Father, (to whom I owe all my indeavours, and my very
self) the Foundations on which this Opinion may be grounded,
least, whilst otherwise it is favoured with much probability, it be
found in reality to be extreamly repugnant (as at first sight it
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:96976:265"/>
seems) not onely to Physical Reasons, and Common Principles
received on all hands (which cannot do so much harm) but also
(which would be of far worse consequence) to many Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of sacred Scripture: Upon which account many at their
first looking into it, explode it as the most fond Paradox and
Monstrous <hi>Capriccio</hi> that ever was heard of. Which thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
only from an antiquated and long confirmed Custome,
which hath so hardened men in, and habituated them to Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
Plausible, and for that cause by all men (aswell learned as
unlearned) Approved Opinions, that they cannot be removed
one step from them: So great is the force of Custome (which
not unfitly is stiled a second Nature) prevailing over the whole
World, that touching things men are rather pleased with, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
in, and desirous of those, which, though evil and obnox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious,
are by use made familiar to them, than such, wherewith,
though better, they are not accustomed and acquainted. So in
like manner, and that chiefly, in <hi>Opinions,</hi> which when once they
are rooted in the Mind, men start at, and reject all others
whatsoever; not only those that are contrary to, but even all
that ever so little disagree with or vary from theirs, as harsh to
the Ear, discoloured to the Eye, unpleasant to the Smell, nause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the Tast, rough to the Touch. And no wonder: For
Physical Truths are ordinarily judged and considered by men,
not according to their Essence, but according to the prescript of
some one whose description or definition of them gaines him
Authority amongst the vulgar. Which authority nevertheless
(since 'tis no more than humane) ought not to be so esteemed, as
that that which doth manifestly appear to the contrary, whether
from better Reasons lately found out, or from Sense it self, should
for its sake be contemned and slighted; Nor is Posterity so to be
confined, but that it may, and dares, not only proceed farther,
but also bring to light better and truer Experiments than those
which have been delivered to us by the Ancients. For the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius's</hi>
of the Antients, as in Inventions they did not much sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
the Wits of our times; so for the perfecting of Inventions
this Age of ours seems not only to equal, but far to excell former
Ages; Knowledge, whether in the Liberal or Mechanical Arts,
daily growing to a greater height. Which Assertion might be
easily proved, were it not that in so clear a case, there would be
more danger of obscuring, than hopes of illustrating it with any
farther light.</p>
                     <p>But (that I may not wholly be silent in this point) have not the
several Experiments of Moderns, in many things, stopped the
mouth of Venerable Antiquity, and proved many of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
and weightiest Opinions, to be vain and false? The Doctrine
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:96976:265"/>
of the <hi>Antipodes</hi> by many of the Antients of approved Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and Learning was held a Paradox no less absurd than this
Our Opinion of the <hi>Earths Motion</hi> may seem to be; as likewise
that of the <hi>Habitablenesse of the Torrid Zone:</hi> Of these Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the first was accounted unpossible by many, but the latter
was absolutely denyed by the unanimous consent of all: But
later Authors (to the great felicity and perpetual Glory of
their Age) have, not so much by Authority, as by accurate
diligence and indefatigable study to finde out the truth, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
them both to be undoubtedly true. Thus I affirm that
the Antients were deceived, and that in too lightly challenging
Credid and Authority for their Inventions, they discovered too
much folly. Here for brevities sake I pass by many Dreams
lately detected, both of <hi>Aristotle</hi> and other of the antient Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers;
who in all likelihood if they had dived into the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
of Modern Writers, and understood their Reasons, would,
by changing their judgements, have given them the precedency,
and would have subscribed to their manifest Truth. Hereby we
see that we are not to have so high a respect for the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tiens, that
whatever they assert should be taken upon trust, and that Faith
should be given to their sayings, as if they were Oracles and
Truths sent down from Heaven. But yet (which indeed is
chiefly to be regarded in these matters) if any thing be found out
that is repugnant to Divine Authority, or to the Sacred Leaves,
that were dictated by the Holy Ghost, and by His Inspiration
expounded by the Holy Doctors of the Church,<note place="margin">Faith is more certain, than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sense or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> in this case not
onely Humane reason, but even Sense it self is to submitt:
which, though by all manner of weighty Conditions and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
it should hold forth any thing contrary to Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
(which indeed is so plain, that there is no way left to evade
the right understanding of it) yet is it to be rejected; and we
must conclude our selves deceived by it, and believe that that is
not true which Sense and Reason represents unto us: For, however
we judge of things, we have, both in this and all other cases, a
more certain knowledge, which proceeds from Divine Faith; as
S. <hi>Peter</hi> hath most excellently exprest it: Who though with his
Senses he saw, and perceived the Glory of our Lord in his
Transfiguration, and heard his words manifesting his great Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
yet nevertheless all these things compared with the Light of
Faith, he adds:<note n="*" place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>We have also a more sure word of Prophecy,</hi> &amp;c.
Wherefore since this Opinion of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Copernicus</hi> hath
entred upon the Stage of the World in so strange a Dress, and at
the first appearance (besides the rest) doth seem to oppose sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
Authorities of Sacred Scripture, it hath (this being granted)
been justly rejected of all men as a meer absurdity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="476" facs="tcp:96976:266"/>
But yet because the common Systeme of the World devised by
<hi>Ptolomy</hi> hath hitherto satisfied none of the Learned, hereupon a
suspition is risen up amongst all, even <hi>Ptolemy's</hi> followers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that there must be some other Systeme, which is more true
than this of <hi>Ptolemy;</hi> For although the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Celestial
Bodys may seem to be generally resolved by this Hypothesis, yet
they are found to be involved with many difficulties, and refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to many devices; as namely, of Orbes of sundry Forms and
Figures, Epicicles, Equations, Differences, Excentricks, and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
such like fancies and Chymaera's which savour of the
<hi>Ens Rationis</hi> of Logicians, rather than of any <hi>Realem Essentiam.</hi>
Of which kinde is that of the <hi>Rapid Motion,</hi> than which I finde
not any thing that can be more weakly grounded, and more easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
controverted and disproved: And such is that conceit of the
<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Or</hi> Primum Mobile.</note> Heaven void of Stars, moving the inferior Heavens or Orbes:
All which are introduced upon occasion of the variety of the
Motions of Celestial Bodyes, which seemed impossible, by any
other way, to be reduced to any certain and determinate Rule.
So that the Assertors of that common Opinion, freely confess,
that in describing the Worlds Systeme, they cannot as yet disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
or teach the true Hypothesis thereof: But that their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
are onely to finde out, amongst many things, what is most
agreeable with truth, and may, upon better and more accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
Reasons, answer the Celestial <hi>Phaenomena.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Since that, the Telescope (an Optick Invention) hath been found
out, by help of which, many remarkable things in the Heavens,
most worthy to be known, and till then unthought of, were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
by manifest sensation; as for instance, That the Moon is
Mountainous; <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Saturn</hi> Tricorporeal; and <hi>Jupiter</hi>
Quadricorporeal: Likewise that in the <hi>Via Lactea,</hi> in the <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iades,</hi>
and in the Stars called <hi>Nobulosae</hi> there are many Stars, and
those of the greatest Magnitude which are by turns adjacent to
one another; and in the end it hath discovered to us, new fixed
Stars, new planets, and new Worlds. And by this same Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it appears very probable, that <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> do not
move properly about the Earth, but rather about the Sun; and
that the Moon alone moveth about the Earth. What therefore
can be inferred from hence, but that the Sun doth stand immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
in the Centre, and that the Earth, with the other Celestial
Orbes, is circumvolved about it? Wherefore by this and many
other Reasons it appears, That the Opinion of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and
<hi>Copernicus</hi> doth not disagree with Astronomical and Cosmogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
Principles; yea, that it carryeth with it a great likelihood
and probability of Truth: Whereas amongst the so many seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Opinions, that deviate from the common Systeme, and devise
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:96976:266"/>
others, such as were those of <hi>Plato, Calippus, Eudoxus;</hi> and since
them of <hi>Averroe,</hi>

and Modern, there is not one found that is more facile, more

and Motions of the Heavens, without <hi>Epicycles, Excentrix, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocentricks</hi>
Deferents, and the supputation of the Rapid Motion.
And this Hypothesis hath been asserted for true, not onely by
<hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and, after him, by <hi>Copernicus,</hi> but by many famous
men, as namely, <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> and <hi>Ecphantus, Pythagoreans,</hi> all the
Disciples of that Sect, <hi>Miceta</hi> of <hi>Syracuse, Martianus Capella,</hi> and
many more. Amongst whom, those (as we have said) that
have attempted the finding out of New Systemes (for they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
both this of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and that of <hi>Ptolemy</hi>) are numberless:
who yet notwithstanding allowed this Opinion of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> to
carry with it much probability, and indirectly confirmed it; inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as that they rejected the common one as imperfect, defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
and attended with many contradictions and difficulties.
Amongst these may be numbered Father<note n="*" place="margin">P. Clavius in ultima suor. Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum editione.</note> 
                        <hi>Clavius,</hi> a most learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Jesuite; who, although he refutes the Systeme of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi>
yet acknowledgeth the Levity of the common Systeme, and he
ingeniously confesseth, that for the removal of difficulties, in which
the common Systeme will not serve the turn, Astronomers are
forced to enquire after another Systeme, to the discovery of
which, he doth very earnestly exhort them.</p>
                     <p>Now can there a better or more commodious Hypothesis
be devised, than this of <hi>Copernicus,?</hi> For this Cause many Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Authors are induced to approve of, and follow it: but
with much haesitancy, and fear, in regard that it seemeth in their
Opinion so to contradict the Holy Scriptures, as that it cannot
possibly be reconciled to them. Which is the Reason that this
Opinion hath been long supprest, and is now entertained by men
in a modest manner, ad as it were with a veiled Face; according
to that advice of the Poet:
<q>
                           <l>Judicium populi nunquam contempseris unus,</l>
                           <l>Ne nullis placeas, dum vis contemnere multos.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon consideration of which, (out of my very great love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Sciences, and my ardent desire to see the encrease and
perfection of them, and the Light of Truth freed from all Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
and Obscurities) I began to argue with my self touching
this Point after this manner: This Opinion of the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi>
is either true, or false; If false, it ought not to be mentioned, and
deserves not to be divulged: If true, it matters not, though it
contradict all, as well Philosophers as Astronomers: And though
for its establishment and reducement to use a new Philosophy
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:96976:267"/>
and Astronomy, (founded upon new Principles and Hypothese)
should be constituted: For the Authority of Sacred Scripture
will not oppose it; neither doth one Truth contradict another.
If therefore the Opinion of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> be true, without doubt
God hath disposed and dictated the words of of Holy Writ in
such a manner, that they may admit an apt sense and reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with that Hypothesis. Being moved by these Reasons, and
the probability of the said Opinion, I thought good to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Texts of Sacred Scripture might be expounded according to
Theological and Physical Principles, and might be reconciled to
it, so that (in regard that hitherto it hath been held probable) it
may in after times, coming without scruple to be acknowledged
for true, advance it self, and appear in publick with an uncover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Face, without any mans prohibition, and may lawfully and

Opinion. Although I doubt not but they, and many other
Learned Men might easily have found out these or the like Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliations
of Scriptural expressions; to whom nevertheless I
have thought fit (in respect of that profession which I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
upon the faith of my soul, and the propensity that I have
towards Truth) to offer that of the Poet,
<q>Nullius addictus jurare in verba Magistri.</q>

that they will accept them, with a Candor equal to that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
I have written them.</p>
                     <p>Therefore to come to the business: All Authorities of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Writ which seem to oppose this Opinion, are reducible to
six Classes: The first is of those that affirm the Earth to stand
still, and not to move: as <hi>Psal. 92. He framed the round World
so sure, that it cannot be moved:</hi> Also <hi>Psal. 104. Who laid the
Foundations of the Earth, that it should not be removed for ever:</hi>
And <hi>Ecclesiastes 1. But the Earth abideth for ever:</hi> And others
of the like sense.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The second is of those which attest the Sun to move, and
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:96976:267"/>
Revolve about the Earth; as</hi> Psal. 19.<note n="b" place="margin">Or <hi>In Sole posuit tabernacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum suum,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor followeth.</note> In them hath he set a
Tabernacle for the Sun, which cometh forth as a Bridegroom out
of his chamber, and rejoyceth as a Gyant to run his Course. It
cometh forth from the uttermost part of the Heaven, and runneth
about unto the end of it again; and there is nothing hid from the
heat thereof. <hi>And</hi> Ecclesiast. 1. The Sun riseth, and the Sun go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
down, and hasteth to the place where he arose: it goeth towards
the South, and turneth about unto the North. <hi>Whereupon the
Suns Retrogradation is mentioned as a Miracle,</hi> Isaiah 38. The
Sun returned ten degrees. <hi>And</hi> Ecclesiasticus 48. In his time the
Sun went backward, and lengthened the life of the King. <hi>And
for this reason it is related for a Miracle, in the Book of</hi> Joshuah,
<hi>that at the Prayers of that great Captain the Sun stood still, its
motion being forbidden it, by him:</hi> Josh. 10. Sun stand thou
still upon Gibeon. <hi>Now if the Sun should stand still, and the
Earth move about it, its station at that time was no Miracle;
and if</hi> Joshuah <hi>had intended, that the light of the day should
have been prolonged by the Suns splendour, he would not have
said,</hi> Sun stand thou still, <hi>but rather</hi> Earth stand thou still.</p>
                     <p>The third Classis is of those Authorities which say, that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is <hi>above,</hi> and the Earth <hi>beneath;</hi> of which sort is that place
of <hi>Joel, chap.</hi> 2. cited by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> in <hi>Acts. 2. I will shew wonders
in Heaven above, and signes in the Earth beneath,</hi> with others of
the like purport. Hereupon Christ at his Incarnation is said to
<hi>come down from Heaven;</hi> and after his Resurrection to have <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
up into heaven.</hi> But if the Earth should move about
the Sun, it would be, as one may say, in Heaven, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
would rather be <hi>above</hi> Heaven than <hi>beneath</hi> it. And
this is confirmed; For that the Opinion which placeth the Sun in
the Centre, doth likewise place <hi>Mercury</hi> above the Sun, and
<hi>Venus</hi> above <hi>Mercury;</hi> and the Earth above <hi>Venus,</hi> together
with the Moon, which revolves about the Earth, and therefore
the Earth, together with the Moon, is placed in the third Heaven.
If therefore in Spherical Bodies,<note place="margin">In Sphericall Bodies, <hi>Deorsum</hi> is the Centre, and <hi>Sursum</hi> the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference.</note> as in the World, <hi>beneath</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
no more than to be neer to the centre, and <hi>above,</hi> than to
approach the Circumference, it must needs follow, that for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
good of Theological Positions concerning the Ascension
and Descension of Christ, the Earth is to be placed in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
and the Sun, with the other Heavens in the Circumference;
and not according to <hi>Copernicus,</hi> whose Hypothesis inverts this
Order: with which one cannot see how the true Ascension and
Descension can be consistent.</p>
                     <p>The fourth Classis is of those Authorities which make Hell to
be in the Centre of the World, which is the Common Opinion
of Divines, and confirmed by this Reason, That since Hell (ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:96976:268"/>
in its strict denomination) ought to be in the lowest part of
the World, and since that in a Sphere there is no part lower
then the Centre, Hell shall be, as it were, in the Centre of the
World, which being of a Spherical Figure, it must follow, that
Hell is either in the Sun (forasmuch as it is supposed by this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis
to be in the Centre of the World) or else supposing
that Hell is in the Centre of the Earth,<note place="margin">Hell is in the centre of the Earth, not of the World.</note> if the Earth should move
about the Sun, it would necessarily ensue, that Hell, together
with the Earth, is in Heaven, and with it revolveth about the third
Heaven; than which nothing more absurd can be said or imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                     <p>The fifth Classis,<note place="margin">Heaven and Eart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           </gap> opposed to each other.</note> is of those Authorities which alwayes op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Heaven to the Earth, and so again the Earth to Heaven; as
if there were the same relation betwixt them, with that of the
Centre to the Circumference, and of the Circumference to the
Centre. But if the Earth were in Heaven, it should be on one
side thereof, and would not stand in the Middle, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there would be no such relation betwixt them; which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
do, not only in Sacred Writ, but even in Common Speech,
ever and every where answer to each other with a mutual Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.
Whence that of <hi>Genes. 1. In the beginning God created
the Heaven and the Earth:</hi> and <hi>Psal. 115. The Heaven, even
the Heavens are the Lords; but the Earth hath he given to the
Children of men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>:</hi> and our Saviour in that Prayer which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth
to us, <hi>Matth. 6. Thy will be done in Earth, as it is in
Heaven:</hi> and S. <hi>Paul, 1 Corinth. 15. The first man is of the
Earth, earthy; the second man is of Heaven, heavenly:</hi> and
<hi>Coloss. 1. By him were all things created that are in Heaven, and
that are in Earth:</hi> and again, <hi>Having made peace through the
Blood of his Crosse for all things, whether they be things in Earth
or things in Heaven:</hi> and <hi>Chap. 3. Set your affections on things
above, not on things on the Earth;</hi> with innumerable other such
like places. Since therefore these two Bodies are alwayes mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
opposed to each other, and Heaven, without all doubt,
referreth to the Circumference, it must of necessity follow, that
the Earth is to be adjudged the place of the Centre.</p>
                     <p>The sixth and last Classis is of those Authorities, which (being
rather of Fathers and Divines, than of the Sacred Scripture) say,
That the Sun, after the day of Judgment shall stand immoveable
in the East,<note place="margin">After the day of Judgment the Earth shall stand immoveable.</note> and the Moon in the West. Which Station, if the
<hi>Pythagorick</hi> Opinion hold true, ought rather to be ascribed to
the Earth, than to the Sun; for if it be true, that the Earth doth
now move about the Sun, it is necessary that after the day of
Judgment it should stand immoveable. And truth is, if it must
subsist without motion in one constant place, there is no reason
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:96976:268"/>
why it should rather stand in one site of that Place than in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or why it should rather turn one part of it than another to
the Sun, if so be that every of its parts without distinction, which
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> destitute of the Suns light, cannot choose but be dismal, and
much worse affected than that part which is illuminated. Hence
also would arise many other absurdities besides these.</p>
                     <p>These are the Classes, &amp;c. from which great assaults are made
against the structure of the Pythagorick Systeme; yet by that
time I shall have first laid down six Maximes or Principles, as
impregnable Bulwarks erected against them, it will be easie to
batter them, and to defend the Hypothesis of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> from
being attaqued by them. Which before I propound, I do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ess
(with that Humility and Modesty which becometh a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
and a person in Religious Orders) that I do with reverence
submit what I am about to speak to the Judgment of Holy
Church. Nor have I undertaken to write these things out of
any inducements of Temerity, or Ambition, but out of Charity
and a Desire to be auxiliary to my neighbour in his inquisition
after Truth. And there is nothing in all this Controversie
maintained by me (that expect to be better instructed by those
who profess these Studies) which I shall not retract, if any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
shall by solid Reasons &amp; reiterated Experiments, prove some
other Hypothesis to be more probable; but yet, until such time as
they shall decide the Point, I shall labour all I can for its support.</p>
                     <p>My first and chiefest Maxime is this; When any thing is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
in Holy Writ, to God, or to a Creature, thats not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming
to, or incommensurate with them, it must of necessity
be received and expounded one, or more of the four following
wayes; First, it may be said to agree with them <hi>Metaphorically,
and Proportionally, or by Similitude.</hi> Secondly, <hi>According to
our manner of Considering, Apprehending, Conceiving, Vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Knowing, &amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>according to the Opinion of the
Vulgar, and the Common way of Speaking:</hi> to which Vulgar
Speech the Holy Ghost doth very often with much study acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
it self. Fourthly, <hi>In respect of our selves, and for that
he makes himself like unto us.</hi> Of each of these wayes there are
these examples: God doth not walk, since he is Infinite and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable;
He hath no Bodily Members, since he is a Pure Act;
and consequently is void of all Passion of Minde; and yet in
Sacred Scripture, <hi>Gen. 3. vers.</hi> 8. it is said, <hi>He walked in the cool of
the day:</hi> and <hi>Job 22. vers.</hi> 14. it is said, <hi>He walketh in the</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Circa Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Coeli.</note> 
                        <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit
of Heaven:</hi> and in many other places coming, departing,
making hast is ascribed to God; and likewise Bodily parts, as
Eyes, Ears, Lips, Face, Voice, Countenance, Hands, Feet, Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>,
Garments, Arms; as also many Passions, such as Anger,
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:96976:269"/>
Sorrow, Repentance, and the like. What shall we say there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?
Without doubt such like Attributes agree with God (to
use the Schoolmens words <hi>Metaphorically, Proportionally, and by
Similitude:</hi> And touching Passions, it may be said, that God
condescendeth to represent himself after that manner: as for
instance, <hi>The Lord is angry;</hi> i. e. <hi>He revealeth himself as one that
is angry: He grieved;</hi> i. e. <hi>He revealeth himself, as one that
is sorrowful: It repented him that he had made man;</hi> i. e. <hi>He see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
as one that repented.</hi> And indeed all these things are <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parativè
ad nos,</hi> and in respect of us. So God is said to be in
Heaven, to move in time, to shew himself, to hide himself, to
observe and mark our steps; to seek us, to stand at the door,
to knock at the door; not that he can be contained in a bodily
place, nor that he is really moved, nor in time; nor that humane
manners or customes can agree with him, save only according to
our manner of Apprehension: This Conception of ours orderly
distinguisheth these Attributes in him one from another, when,
notwithstanding, they are one and the same with him: This Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of ours divideth also his actions into several times,
which, neverthelesse, for the most part, are produced in one and
the same instant: And this, to conclude, alwayes apprehendeth
those things with some defect, which, notwithstanding are in
God most perfect. For this reas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n doth the Sacred Scripture
express it self <hi>according to the Vulgar Opinion,</hi> whilst it ascribes
to the Earth Ends and Foundations, which yet it hath not; to
the Sea a Depth not to be fathomed; to Death (which is a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and consequently a Non-entity) it appropriates Actions,
Motion, Passions, and other such like Accidents, of all which it is
deprived, as also Epithites and Adjuncts, which really cannot
suit with it: <hi>Is not the bitternesse of Death past?</hi> 1 Sam. 15. 32.
<hi>Let death come upon them,</hi> Psal 6. <hi>He hath prepared the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Death,</hi> Psal. 7. 14. <hi>Thou raisest me from the gates of
Death,</hi> Psal. 84. <hi>In the midst of the shadow of Death,</hi> Psal. 23.
<hi>Love is strong as Death,</hi> Cant. 8. 9. <hi>The First-Born of Death.</hi> Job
18. 13. <hi>Destruction and Death say, &amp;c.</hi> Job 28. 22. And who knows
not that the whole History of the rich Glutton doth consist of
the like phrases of <hi>Vulgar Speech?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luke 16.</note> So <hi>Ecclesiasticus,</hi> Chap. 27.
vers. 11. <hi>The godly man abideth in wisdome, as the Sun; but a

real truth of the matter no wayes changeth, but abides the same
for ever, as <hi>Astronomers</hi> demonstrate, one half thereof remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alwayes lucid, and the other alwayes opacous. Not at any
time doth this state vary in it, unlesse <hi>in respect of us,</hi> and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the opinion of the Vulgar.</hi> Hence it is cleer, that the
holy Scripture speaks according to the common form of speech u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:96976:269"/>
amongst the unlearned, and according to the appearance of
things, and not according to their true Existence. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<hi>Genes.</hi> 1. in the description of the Creation of all things,
the Light is said to be made first of all, and yet it followeth in
the Text, <hi>And the Evening and the Morning made the first day:</hi>
and a little after the several Acts of the Creation are distinguished
and assigned to several days, and concerning each of them it is
said in the Text, <hi>And the Evening and the Morning made the
second day;</hi> and then <hi>the third day, the fourth day, &amp;c.</hi> Hence
many doubts arise, all which I shall propound according to the
common Systeme, that it may appear even from the Hypothesis
of that Systeme, that the sacred Scripture sometimes, for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyding
of emergent difficulties, is to be understood in a vulgar
sense and meaning, and in respect of us, and not according to
the nature of things.<note place="margin">Alia sunt notio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra nobis, alia, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiora natura, vel secundum se, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist. lib. 1. Phys.</hi>
                        </note> Which distinction even <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself
seemeth to have hinted, when he saith, * <hi>Some things are more
intelligible to us; others by nature,</hi> or <hi>secundum se.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First therefore; If the light were made before heaven, then
it rolled about without heaven to the making of the distinction
of Day and Night. Now this is contrary to the very doctrine
of these men, who affirm that no Coelestial Body can be moved
unlesse <hi>per accidens,</hi> and by the motion of Heaven, <hi>and as a knot
in a board at the motion of the board.</hi> Again, if it be said, that
the Light was created at the same time with Heaven, and began
to be moved with Heaven, another doubt ariseth, that likewise
opposeth the foresaid common <hi>Hypothesis:</hi> For it being said,
that Day and Night, Morning and Evening were made, that same
is either in respect of the Universe, or onely in respect of the
Earth and us. If so be that the Sun turning round (according to
the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of the Common Systeme) doth not cause the
Night and Day, but only to opacous Bodies which are destitute
of all other light, but that of the Sun, whilst in their half part
(which is their <hi>Hemisphaere</hi>) and no more, (for that the Suns
light passeth over but one half of an opacous Body, unless a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
small matter more in those of lesser bulk) they are illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Suns aspect, the other half remaining dark and tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,
by reason of a shadow proceeding from its own Body.
Therefore the distinction of dayes by the light of heaven, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the description of them in the sacred Scriptures, must
not be understood <hi>absolutely,</hi> and <hi>secundum se,</hi> and <hi>Nature her
self;</hi> but in respect of the Earth, and of us its inhabitants, and
consequently <hi>secundum nos.</hi> 'Tis not therefore new, nor unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
in sacred Scripture to speak of things <hi>secundum nos,</hi> and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>in respect of us,</hi> and <hi>secundum apparentiam;</hi> but not <hi>secundum
se,</hi> and <hi>rei naturam,</hi> or <hi>Absolutely</hi> and <hi>Simply.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="484" facs="tcp:96976:270"/>
And if any one would understand these Days of sacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
not only <hi>secundum nos,</hi> but also <hi>secundum naturam,</hi> as
circulations of Coelestial Light returning to the self same point
from whence it did at first proceed; so as that there needs no
respect to be had to Night or to<note n="*" place="margin">Aut ad Umbram</note> Darknesse, for which sole rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
we are fain to imbrace the Interpretation of sacred Scripture
<hi>secundum nos;</hi> In opposition to this we may thus argue: If the
sacred Scripture be understood to speak <hi>absolutely,</hi> of iterated
and successive circulations of light, and not <hi>respectu nostri,</hi> as if
these words <hi>Evening and Morning</hi> had never been inserted, which
in their natural acceptation denote the Suns habitude to us and to
the Earth: For that the <hi>Morning</hi> is that time when the Sun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to wax light, and to rise above the <hi>Horizon</hi> in the East,
and become visible in our <hi>Hemisphaere,</hi> and <hi>Evening</hi> is the time
in which the Sun declines in the West, and approacheth with its
light neerer to the other opposite <hi>Horizon</hi> and <hi>Hemisphaere,</hi>
which is contiguous to this of ours. But the word <hi>Day</hi> is a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relative
to the word <hi>Night.</hi> From hence therefore it evidently
appeareth, that these three words <hi>Evening, Morning,</hi> and <hi>Day,</hi>
cannot be understood of a Circulation of Light <hi>secundum se,</hi>
and <hi>absolutè,</hi> but only <hi>secundum nos,</hi> and <hi>respectu nostri;</hi> and in
that sense indeed the <hi>Morning</hi> and <hi>Evening</hi> do make the <hi>Night</hi>
and <hi>Day,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In like manner, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 16. it is said, <hi>God made two great Lights;
the greater Light to rule the Day, and the lesser Light to rule the
Night, and the Stars.</hi> Where both in the Proposition and in the
specification of it, things are spoken which are very disagreeing
with Coelestial Bodies. Therefore those words are in that place
to be interpreted according to the foresaid Rules; namely, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the third and fourth; so that they may be said to be
understood <hi>according to the sense of the vulgar, and the common
way of speaking,</hi> which is all one, as if we should say, <hi>secundum
apparentiam,</hi> and <hi>secundum nos, vel respectu nostri.</hi> For first, it
is said in the Proposition, <hi>And God made two great Lights;</hi>
meaning by them the Sun and Moon, whereas according to the
truth of the matter these are not the Greater Lights; For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Sun may be reckoned amongst the Greater, the Moon
may not be so, unless <hi>in respect of us.</hi> Because amongst
those that are absolutely the Greater, and a little lesser than the
Sun (nay in a manner equal to it) and far bigger than the Moon,<note place="margin">Which are really the great Lights in Heaven.</note>
we may with great reason enumerate <hi>Saturn,</hi> or some of the
Fixed Stars of the first Magnitude, such as <hi>Canopus,</hi> (otherwise
called <hi>Arcanar</hi>) in the end of a River; or the <hi>Little Dog</hi> in
the mouth of the <hi>Great Dog;</hi> or the Foot of <hi>Orion,</hi> called <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,</hi>
or his <hi>Right shoulder,</hi> or any other of that Magnitude.
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:96976:270"/>
Therefore the <hi>two great Lights</hi> are to be understood in respect of
us, and according to vulgar estimation, and not according to the
true and reall existence of such Bodies. Secondly, in the speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the Proposition it is said, <hi>The greater Light to rule the
Day;</hi> hereby denoting the Sun; in which the verbal sense of
Scripture agreeth with the Truth of the Thing; For that the Sun
is the Greatest of all Luminaries, and Globes. But that which
followeth immediately after, <hi>And the lesser Light to rule the
Night,</hi> meaning the Moon, cannot be taken in the true and real
sense of the words: For the Moon is not the lesser Light, but
<hi>Mercury;</hi> which is not only much lesser than the Moon, but also
than any other Star. And if, again, it be said, That the Holy
Text doth not speak of the Stars, but onely of the Luminaries,
for that presently after they are mentioned apart, <hi>And the Stars;</hi>
and that what we say is true touching the comparison of the Stars
amongst themselves, but not in respect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Luminaries, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Sun and Moon: This reply doth discover a man to be
utterly ignorant in these Studies, and such who having not the
least smattering in them, doth conceive an absurd and erroneous
Opinion of the Coelestial Bodies. For the Moon and Sun, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
in themselves, and as they appear to us, if they should
be a far greater distance from us, than indeed they are, would be
no other, nor would appear to us otherwise than Stars, as the
rest do in the Firmament. But Great Luminaries they neither
are,<note place="margin">The Sun, Moon, and Stars are one &amp; the same thing.</note> nor seem to be, save only <hi>in respect of us:</hi> And so, on
the other side, the Stars, as to themselves, are no other than so
many Suns and so many Moons; yet are so far remote from us,
that by reason of their distance they appear thus small, and dim
of light, as we behold them. For the greater and lesser distance
of heavenly Bodies (<hi>caeteris paribus</hi>) doth augment and diminish
their appearance both as to Magnitude and Light. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the words which follow in that place of <hi>Genesis, And the
Stars</hi> (as distinguishing the Stars from the Sun and Moon) are
to be taken in no other acceptation than that which we have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, namely, <hi>according to the sense of the Vulgar, and the
common manner of speech.</hi> For indeed, according to the truth
of the matter, all Coelestial Bodies, being shining Globes, are of
a vast bigness, to which if we should be so neer as we are to the
Moon, they would seem to us of as great, yea a greater magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
than the Moon: As likewise on the contrary, if we were as
far distant from the Sun and Moon, as we are from them, both
Moon and Sun would shew but as stars to us. And yet the
splendor of the Sun would doubtless be greater <hi>intensivè</hi> than
that of any other star. For, although it should be granted that
some stars (as those of the Fixed that twinkle) do shine of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:96976:271"/>
aud by their own nature, as the Sun, that derives not its
light from others (which yet remains undecided and doubtful)
and borrow not their light from the Sun; Nevertheless since the
brightness of none of the stars may be compared with the Suns
splendour, which was created by God first, and before all other
Luminaries, in the highest kind of Light, it would therefore
notwithstanding follow, that none of those stars, although pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the same proximity to us with the Sun, and therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
to us of the same Magnitude as the Sun, can bestow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us so much Light as we receive from the Sun: As on the
contrary, the Sun, at the same remotenesse from us as they are,
would indeed, as to its Magnitude, appear to us as one of those
stars, but of a splendour much more <hi>intense</hi> than that of theirs.
So that,<note place="margin">The Earth is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Moon or Star.</note> now, the Earth is nothing else but another Moon or star,
and so would it appear to us, if we should behold it from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
distance <hi>on high.</hi> And in it might be observed (in that
variety of Light and Darkness which the Sun produceth in it by
making Day and Night) the same difference of Aspects that are
seen in the Moon, and such as are observed in tricorporate <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi>
in like manner also 'tis very probable that the same might
be discerned in other Planets, which shine by no light of their
own, but by one borrowed from the Sun. What ever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may touching these matters be delivered in the sacred Leaves
or the common speech of men, dissenting from the real truth, it
ought (as we have said before) absolutely to be received and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
<hi>secundum vulgi sententiam, &amp; communem loquendi &amp;
concipiendi stylum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And so, to return to our purpose, if, all this considered, the
<hi>Pythagorian</hi> opinion be true, it will be easie, according to the
same Rule, to reconcile the authority of sacred Scriptures with
it, however they seem to oppose it, and in particular those of the
first and second Classis, <hi>scilicet</hi> by my first <hi>Maxime:</hi> For that in
those places the holy Records speak according to our manner of
understanding, and according to that which appeareth in respect
of us;<note place="margin">Why the Sunne seemeth to us to move, &amp; not the Earth.</note> 
                        <hi>For thus it is with those Bodies, in comparison of us, and
as they are described by the vulgar and commune way of humane
Discourse; So that the Earth appears as if it were standing still
and immoveable, and the Sun, as if it were circumambient about
her.</hi> And so the Holy Scripture is used in the Commune and
Vulgar way of speaking; because in respect of our sight, the
Earth seems rather to stand fixed in the Centre, and the Sun to
circumvolve about it, than otherwise: as it happens to those that
are putting off from the Banks of a River to whom the shore
seems to move backwards, and go from them: but they do not
perceive (which yet is the truth) that they themselves go forwards.
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:96976:271"/>
Which fallacy of our sight is noted, and the Reason thereof as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
by the Opticks; upon wich, as being strange to, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
my purpose, I will not stay) and on this account is <hi>Aeneas</hi>
brought in by <hi>Virgil,</hi> saying;
<q>Provehimur portu, terraeque urbesque recedunt.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it will not be amiss to consider why the sacred Scripture
doth so studiously comply with the opinions of the Vulgar,<note place="margin">Aeneid. 3.</note> and
why it doth not rather accurately instruct men in the truth of the
matters, and the secrets of Nature. The Reason is, first, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity
of Divine Wisdome, whereby it sweetly accomodates it
self to all things, in proportion to their Capacity and Nature.
Whence in Natural Sciences, it useth natural and necessary cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
but in Liberal Arts it worketh liberally, upon Generous
Persons after a sublime and lofty manner; upon the Common
People, familiarly and humbly; upon the Skilful, learnedly;
upon the Simple, vulgarly; and so on every one, according to
his condition and quality. Secondly, because it is not its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to fill our mindes in this life with vain and various curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osities,
which might occasion our doubt and suspense. For the
truth is,<note n="a" place="margin">
                           <hi>Eccles.</hi> c. 1. v. ult.</note> 
                        <hi>He that increaseth knowledge, increaseth sorrow.</hi>
Moreover it did not only permit, but even decree, that the
World should be very much busied in Controversies and Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and that it should be imployed about the uncertainty of
things; according to that saying of <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Chap. 3. v. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>He hath
set the World in their heart; so that no man can find out the work
that God maketh from the beginning unto the end.</hi> And touching
those doubts, God will not permit that they shall be discovered
to us before the end of the World:<note n="c" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> c. 4. v. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>At which time he will

                        <hi>in which we see through a
Glasse darkly,</hi> could be known by us but imperfectly and <hi>à poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiori,</hi>
and that not without much pains and study. For this
cause the Wisdome of God, revealed to us in the sacred Leaves,
is not stiled Wisdome absolutely, but<note n="g" place="margin">Ecclesiast. 15. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Saving Wisdome;</hi>
Its onely end being to lead us to salvation. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> saith;<note n="h" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> c. 2. v. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>I determined to know nothing
among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified:</hi> whereas not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
he was thorowly instructed, and profoundly learned
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:96976:272"/>
in all humane Sciences; but making no account of these things
he professeth that it was his desire to teach them no more but the
way to Heaven. Hence is that which God speaketh to us by
<hi>Isaiah,</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">
                           <hi>Isa.</hi> c. 48. v. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>Ego Dominus Deus, docens te utilia [I am the Lord
thy God which teacheth thee profitable things:]</hi> Where the <hi>Glos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi>
addeth, <hi>non subtilia</hi> [not subtilties.] for God neither taught
us, Whether the <hi>Materia Prima</hi> of Heaven, and the Elements
be the same; nor Whether <hi>Continual</hi> be composed of Indivisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
or whether it be divisible <hi>in infinitum;</hi> nor, whether the
Elements are formally <hi>mixt;</hi> nor how many the Coelestial
Spheres, and their Orbs are; Whether there be Epicycles or
Eccentricks; nor the Vertues of Plants and Stones; nor the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Animals; nor the Motion and Influence of the Planets;
nor the Order of the Universe; nor the Wonders of Minerals,
and universal Nature: but only <hi>[utilia:]</hi> things profitable, to
wit, his Holy Law ordained to the end, that we being put into
possession of Blessedness, might at length be made capable of all
perfect knowledge, and the vision of the whole Order and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Harmony, as also the Sympathy and Antipathy of the
Universe and its parts, <hi>in his Word,</hi> wherein all those
things shall most clearly and distinctly, then, appear to us, which
mean while, in this life, he hath remitted (as far as its ability
reacheth) to humane search and enquiry: But it was not his
purpose to determine any thing, directly or indirectly, touching
the truth of them. Because as the knowledge thereof would lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
or nothing profit Us, but might in some cases prove prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial;
so the ignorance thereof can doubtless be no detriment,
but may in some cases be very beneficial to us. And therefore
by his most admirable Wisdome it comes to pass, that though all
things in this World are dubious, uncertain, wavering, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed;
yet his Holy Faith alone is most certain; and although
the opinions about Philosophical and Doctrinal points be divers,
there is in the Church but one Truth of Faith and Salvation.
Which Faith, as necessary to Salvation, is so ordered by Divine
Providence, that it might not only be indubitable, but also un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaken,
sure, immutable, and manifest to all men: the infallible
Rule of which he hath appointed the Holy Church, that is wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with his precious Blood, and governed by his Holy Spirit, to
whom belongs our Sanctification, as being his work.<note place="margin">1 Thess. 4.</note> This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is the Reason why God would have Speculative Questions,
which nothing conduce to our Salvation and Edification, and why
the Holy Ghost hath very often condescended to Vulgar Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Capacities, and hath discovered nothing that is singular
or hidden to us, besides those things that pertain to Salvation.
So that consequently it is clear by what hath been said, how and
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:96976:272"/>
why nothing of certainty can be evinced from the foresaid Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities
to the determining of Controversies of this Nature; as
also with what Reason from this first <hi>Axiome</hi> the Objections of
the first and second Classe are easily answered, as also any other
Authority of sacred Scripture produced against the <hi>Pythagorian</hi>
and <hi>Copernican</hi> Systeme so long as by other proofs it is true.</p>
                     <p>And the Authorities of the second Classe in particular by
this same Maxime, <hi>Of the ordinary manner of apprehending
things as they appear to us, and after the common way of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
may be thus reconciled and expounded; namely, Oftentimes
an Agent is commonly, and not improperly said to move, (though
it have no motion) not because it doth indeed move, but <hi>by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick
denomination,</hi> because receiving its influence and action at
the motion of the Subject; the Form and Quality infused to
the Subject by the said Agent doth likewise move. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
a Fire burning in a Chimney is an immoveable Agent,
before which a man opprest with cold sits to warm himself who
being warmed on one side, turns the other to the Fire, that he
may be warmed on that side also, and so in like manner he holds
every part to the Fire successively, till his whole body be warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
'Tis clear, that although the Fire do not move, yet at the
Motion of the Subject, to wit the Man, who receiveth the heat
and action of the Fire, the Form and Quality of its Heat doth
move <hi>singulatim, &amp; per partes,</hi> round about the mans body, and
alwayes seeketh out a new place: and so, though the Fire do
not move, yet by reason of its effect, it is said to go round all
the parts of the Mans body, and to warm it, not indeed by a
true and real motion of the Fire it self, since it is supposed (and
that not untruly) not to move, but by the motion to which the
Body is excited, out of a desire of receiving the heat of the Fire
in each of its parts. The same may be applied to the Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
impressed successively on the parts of any Globe, which
moves Orbicularly at the aspect of a shining immoveable
Light. And in the same manner may the Sun be said to rise and
set, and to move above the Earth, although in reality he doth
not move, nor suffer any mutation; that is to say, Inasmuch as
his Light (which effect is the Form and Quality proceeding from
him, as the Agent, to the Earth as the Subject) doth sensibly
glide forwards, by reason of the Orbicular motion of the Earth;
and doth alwayes betake it self to some new place of her surface;
upon which ground he is truly said (<hi>secundum vulgarem sermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem</hi>)
to move above, and revolve about the Earth: Not that the
Sun doth move, (for by this Opinion we affirm the Earth to
move, that it may receive the Sun one while in one, another
while in another part of it) but that at the motion of the Earth
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:96976:273"/>
her self a contrary way, the Quality diffused into her, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
upon her by the Sun, namely the Light of the Day is
moved, which riseth in one part of her, and sets in another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to that, according to the nature and condition of her motion;
And for this reason the Sun it self by consequence is said to rise
and set, (which notwithstanding <hi>ex Hypothesi</hi> stands immovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
and that no otherwise then <hi>per donominationem extrinsecam,</hi>
as hath been said.</p>
                     <p>After this manner the command of <hi>Joshuah,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Joshua</hi> c. 10. ver. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>Sun stand thou
still,</hi> and the Miracle of the Suns cessation of Motion wrought
by him, may be so understood, as that not the Solar Body pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
but the Suns splendour upon the Earth stood still; so that
not the Sun it self, (being of it self before that time immovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
but the Earth that receiveth its splendour, stayed her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
which, as she incessantly pursuing her ordinary Motion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the East,<note n="*" place="margin">expected.</note> called up the Light of the Sun in the West, so
standing still, the Suns light imprest upon it likewise stood still.
After the same manner proportionally is that Text of <hi>Isaiah</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Isa.</hi> c. 38. v. 8.</note> touching the Suns going ten degrees backward upon the
Dial of <hi>Ahaz.</hi> So (which may serve for another Example) the
Hand being moved about the flame of a burning Candle that
stand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> still, the Light moveth on the Hand, that is to say, the
said Hand is illustrated now in one part, anon in another, when
as the Candle it self all the while removes not out of its place:
whereupon <hi>per denominationem extrinsecam,</hi> the said Light may
be affirmed to rise and set upon the Hand, namely, by the sole
motion of the said Hand, the Candle it self never moving all the
while. And let this suffice for the explanation of my first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
or <hi>Maxime,</hi> which by reason of its difficulty and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
weight required some prolixity in the handling of it.</p>
                     <p>My second Maxime is this, Things both Spiritual and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal,
Durable and Corruptible, Moveable and Immoveable,
have received from God a perpetual, unchangeable, and inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Law, constituting the Essence and Nature of every one of
them: according to which Law all of them in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
persisting in a certain Order and Constancy, and observing
the same perpetual Course, may deservedly be stiled most Stable
and Determinate. Thus Fortune (than which there is nothing
in the World more inconstant or fickle) is said to be constant
and unalterable in her continual volubility, vicissitude, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy,
which was the occasion of that Verse,
<q>Et semper constans in levitate sua est.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus the motion of Heaven (which by the constan Law

of Nature ought to be perpetual) may be said to be immutable
and immoveable, and the Heavens themselves to be immovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
moved, and Terrene things to be immutably changed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
those never cease moving, nor these changing. By this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
or Maxime all difficulties belonging to the first Classis are
cleared, by which the Earth is said to be stable and immoveable,
that is, by understanding this one thing, That the Earth, as to its
own Nature, though it include in it self a local Motion, and that
threefold,<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> Several Motions of the Earth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Coper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus.</hi>
                        </note> according to the opinion of <hi>Copernicus (scilicet</hi> Diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
with which it revolveth about its own Centre; Annual,
by which it moveth through the twelve Signes of the Zodiack,
and the motion of Inclination, by which its Axis is alwayes op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to the same part of the World) as also other Species of
Mutation, such as Generation and Corruption, Accretion and
Diminution, and Alteration of divers kinds; yet in all these she
is stable &amp; constant, never deviating from that Order which God
hath appointed her, but moveth continually, constantly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutably,
according to the six before named Species of Motion.</p>
                     <p>My third Maxime shall be this; When a thing is moved ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to some part of it, and not according to its whole, it
cannot be said to be <hi>simply</hi> &amp; <hi>absolutely</hi> moved, but only <hi>per acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi>
for that stability taken simply &amp; absolutly do rather accord
with the same. As for example, if a Barrel or other measure of
Water be taken out of the Sea, and transferred to another place,
the Sea may not therefore <hi>absolutely</hi> &amp; <hi>simply</hi> be said to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from place to place, but only <hi>per accidens,</hi> and <hi>secundum
quid,</hi> that is, according to a part of it, but rather (to speak sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply)
we should say that the Sea cannot be carried or moved out of
its proper place,, though as to its parts it be moved, and transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to &amp; again. This Maxime is manifest of it self, and by it may
the Authorities be explained which seem to make for the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of the Earth in this manner; namely, The Earth <hi>per se &amp;
absolutè</hi> considered as to its <hi>Whole,</hi> is not mutable, seeing it is
neither generated nor corrupted neither increased nor diminished;
neither is it altered <hi>secundum totum,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Earth <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum Totum</hi> is Immutable, though not Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable.</note> but only <hi>secundum partes.</hi>
Now it plainly appears, that this is the genuine and true Sense of
what is ascribed to it out of <hi>Ecclesiastes, cap. 1. v. 4. One Generation
passeth away, and another Generation cometh, but the Earth abideth
for ever:</hi> as if he should say; although the Earth, according to its
parts, doth generate and corrupt, and is liable to the vicissitudes of
Generation and corruption, yet in reference to its Whole it never
generateth nor Corrupteth, but abideth immutable for ever:
Like as a Ship, which though it be mended one while in the Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
another while in the Stern, and afterwards in other parts
it yet remains the same Ship as it was at first. But tis to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertized,
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:96976:274"/>
that that Scripture doth not speak of a Local Motion,
but of Mutations of another nature; as in the very substance,
quantity or quality of the Earth it self. But if it be said, that
it is to be understood of a Local Motion, then it may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
by the insuing Maxime, that is to say, a respect being had
to the natural Place assigned it in the Universe, as shall be shewed
by and by.</p>
                     <p>The fourth Axiome is this; That every Corporeal thing, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable
or immoveable from its very first Creation, is alotted its
proper and natural place; and being drawn or removed from
thence, its motion is violent, and it hath a natural tendency to
move back thither again: also that nothing can be moved from
its natural place, <hi>secundum Totum;</hi> For most great and dreadful
mischiefs would follow from that perturbation of things in the
Universe.<note place="margin">The Earth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>Secundum To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> remove out of its Natural Place.</note> Therefore neither the whole Earth, nor the whole
Water, nor the whole Air can <hi>secundum totum</hi> be driuen or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
out of their proper place, site, or Systeme in the Universe,
in respect of the order and disposition of other mundane Bodies.
And thus there is no Star (though Erratick) Orb or Sphere that
can desert its natural place, although it may otherwise have some
kind of motion. Therefore all things, how moveable soever,
are notwithstanding said to be stable and immoveable in their
proper place, according to the foresaid sense, <hi>i.e. secundum to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum;</hi>
For nothing hinders, but that <hi>secundum partes</hi> they may
some waymove; which motion shall not be natural, but violent.
Therefore the Earth, although it should be moveable, yet it
might be said to be immoveable, according to the precedent
Maxime, for that its neither moved in a right Motion nor out of
the Course assigned it in its Creation for the standing Rule of its
motion; but keep within its own site, being placed in that
which is called the Grand Orb,<note place="margin">The Natural Place of the Earth.</note> above <hi>Venus,</hi> and beneath <hi>Mars,</hi>
and being in the middle betwixt these (which according to the
common opinion is the Suns place) it equally and continually
moveth about the Sun, and the two other intermediate Planets,
namely <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> and hath the Moon (which is another
Earth,<note place="margin">The Moon is an Aetherial Body.</note> but Aetherial, as <hi>Macrobius</hi> after some of the ancient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,
will have it) about it self. From whence, inasmuch as
she persisteth uniformly in her Course, and never at any time
departeth from it, she may be said to be stable and immoveable:
and in the same sense Heaven likewise, with all the Elements,
may be said to be immoveable.</p>
                     <p>The fifth Maxime followeth, being little different from the
former. Amongst the things created by God, some are of such a
nature, that their parts may be <hi>ab invicem,</hi> or by turns, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from themselves, and dis-joyned from their Whole;
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:96976:274"/>
others may not, at least, taken <hi>collectively:</hi> now those are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishable,
but these perpetual. The Earth therefore since it
is reckoned amongst those things that are permanent,<note place="margin">The Earths Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre keepeth it in its Natural Place.</note> as hath
been said already, hath its parts, not dissipable, nor <hi>ab invicem,</hi>
separable from its Centre (whereby its true and proper place is
assigned it) and from its whole, taken collectively: because ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to its whole it is always preserved, compact, united, and
cohaerent in it self, nor can its parts be seperated from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
or from one another, unless it may so fall out <hi>per accidens,</hi>
and violently in some of its parts; which afterwards, the obstacle
being removed, return to their Natural Station spontaneously,
and without any impulse. In this Sense therefore the Earth is
said to be Immoveable, and Immutable: yea even the Sea, Aire,
Heaven, and any other thing (although otherwise moveable) so
long as its parts are not dissipable and seperable, may be said to
be Immoveable, at last taken <hi>collectively.</hi> This Principle
or Maxim differeth from the precedent only in that this referrs
to the parts in order to <hi>Place,</hi> and this, in order to the Whole.</p>
                     <p>From this Speculation another Secret is discovered.<note place="margin">Gravity and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of Bodies, what it is.</note> For hence
it is manifest wherein the proper and genuine formality of the
Gravity aad Levity of Bodyes consisteth; a point which is not so
clearly held forth, nor so undeniably explained by the Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Phylosophy. <hi>Gravity</hi> therefore is nothing else according to
the Principles of this new Opinion, than a certain power and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
of the Parts to rejoyn with their Whole, and there to rest
as in their proper place. Which Faculty or Disposition is by
Divine Providence bestowed not only on the Earth, and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene
Bodies,<note place="margin">All Coelestial Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies have Gravity and Levity.</note> but, as is believed, on Coelestial Bodies also, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Sun, Moon, and Stars; all whose parts are by this Impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
connected, and conserved together, cleaving closely to each
other, and on all sides pressing towards their Centre, until they
come to rest there. From which Concourse and Compression a
Sphaerical and Orbicular Figure of the Caelestial Orbes is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
wherein by this occult Quality naturally incident to
each of them they of themselves subsist, and are alwayes preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
But <hi>Levity</hi> is the Extrusion and Exclusion of a more te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuose
and thin Body from the Commerce of one more Solid and
dense,<note place="margin">Compressive Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, proper to Gravity; the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensive, to Levity.</note> that is Heterogeneal to it, by vertue of Heat. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
as the Motion of Grave Bodies is <hi>Compressive,</hi> so the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Light Bodies is <hi>Extensive:</hi> For its the propperty of Heat
to dilate and rarify those things to which it doth apply, conjoine
and communicate it self. And for this reason we find Levity
and Gravity not only in respect of this our Terestrial Globe, and
the Bodies adjacent to it, but also in respect of those Bodies
which are said to be in the Heavens, in which those parts which
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:96976:275"/>
by reason of their proclivity make towards their Centre are
Grave, and those that incline to the Circumference Light. And
so in the Sun, Moon, and Starrs, there are parts as well Grave as
Light.<note place="margin">Heaven is not composed of a fift Essence differing from the matter of inferior Bodies.</note> And consequently Heaven it self that so Noble Body,

and the Sun it self, as tis probable, exhaling or attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sundry vapours to the surface of its Body, may perhaps pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
those Spots which were observed to be so various, and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
in its <hi>Discus:</hi> of which <hi>Galilaeus</hi> in a perticular<note n="*" place="margin">Delle Macchie solarj.</note> Treatise
hath most excellently and most accurately spoken; insomuch,
that though it were not besides my present purpose, yet it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
that I forbear to speak any thing touching those matters,

now if there be found in the Sacred Scriptures any Authority
contrary to these things, it may be salved by the foresaid Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
Analogically applyed. And furthermore it may be said,
that that Solidity is to be so understood, <hi>as that it admits of no
vacuum, cleft, or penetration from whence the least vacuity might
proceed.</hi> For the truth is, as that cannot be admitted in bodily
Creatures, so it is likewise repugnant to Heaven it self, being
indeed a Body of its own Nature the most Rare of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

                     <p>It is clear also from these Principles how false these words of
<hi>Aristotle</hi> are, that: <hi>Of one simple Body, there is one simple Motion;

from the medium, and to the medium; the first of Light Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes,
as the Aire and Fire: the second of Grave Bodyes, as the
Water and Earth: the Circular, which is about the medium, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to Heaven, which is neither Grave nor Light:</hi> For all this
Philosophy is now forsaken, and of it self grown into dis-esteem;
for though it be received for an unquestionable truth in this new
Opinion, that to a simple body appertains one only simple Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<note n="*" place="margin">Vide Coperni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum de Revolutio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus Coelest.</note> yet it granteth no Motion but what is Circular, by which alone
a simple body is conserved in its naturall Place, and subsists in its
Unity,<note place="margin">Simple Motion peculiar to only Simple Bodies.</note> and is properly said to move <hi>in loco [in a place:]</hi> whereby
it comes to pass that a Body for this reason doth continue to move
in it self, <hi>[or about its own axis;]</hi> and although it have a Motion,
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:96976:275"/>
yet it abideth still in the same place, as if it were perpetually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable.
But right Motion, which is properly <hi>ad locum, [to a
place]</hi> can be ascribed only to those things which are out of their
naturall place, being far from union with one another, and from
unity with their whole, yea that are seperated and divided from
it: Which being that it is contrary to the Nature and forme of
the Universe,<note place="margin">Right Motion belongeth to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Bodies, and that are out of their natural Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> it necessarily followeth, that right Motion doth in
short sute with those things which are destitute of that perfection,
that according to their proper Nature belongeth to them, and
which by this same right Motion they labour to obtaine, untill
they are redintigrated with their Whole, and with one another,
and restored to their Naturall place; in which at the length,
having obtained their perfection, they settle and remaine immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
<note place="margin">Right Motion cannot be Simple.</note> Therefore in right Motions there can be no Uniformity,
nor simplicity; for that they vary by reason of the uncertaine
Levity or Gravity of their respective Bodyes: for which cause
they do not persevere in the same Velocity or Tardity to the end
which they had in the beginning. Hence we see that those things
whose weight maketh them tend downwards, do descend at first
with a slow Motion; but afterwards, as they approach neerer
and neerer to the Centre, they precipitate more and more swiftly.
And on the otherside, those things which by reason of their light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
are carryed upwards (as this our Terrestriall fire, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but a smoak that burneth, and is inkindled into a flame)
are no sooner ascended on high, but, in almost the self-same mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they fly and vanish out of sight; by reason of the rare-faction
and extension, that they as soon as they acquire, are freed
from those bonds which violently and against their own Nature
kept them under,<note place="margin">Right Motion is ever mixt with the Circular.</note> and deteined them here below. For which
reason, it is very apparent, that no Right Motion can be called
Simple, not only in regard that (as hath been said) it is not
<note n="*" place="margin">aequabilis.</note> even and uniforme, but also because it is mixt with the Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
which lurketh in the Right by an occult consent, <hi>scilicet</hi> by
reason of the Natural affection of the Parts to conforme unto
their Whole. For when the Whole moveth Circularly, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
likewith that the Parts, to the end that they may be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to their Whole, (howbeit <hi>per accidens</hi> they are sometimes
moved with a Right Motion) do move (though not so appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently)
with a Circular Motion, as doth their Whole. And thus
at length we have envinced that Circular Motion only is Simple,
Uniform and<note n="*" place="margin">Even. Circular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is truly Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Perpetual.</note> Aequable, and of the same tenor <hi>[or rate]</hi> for that
it is never destitute of its interne Cause: whereas on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
Right Motion, (which pertains to things both Heavy and
Light) hath a Cause that is imperfect and deficient, yea that ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
from Defect it self, and that tendeth to, and seeketh after
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:96976:276"/>
nothing else but the end and termination of it self: in regard
that Grave and Light Bodies, when once they have attained their
proper and Natural Place, do desist from that Motion to which
they were incited by Levity and Gravity.<note place="margin">Circular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion belongeth to the Whole Body, and the Right to its parts.</note> Therefore: since Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Motion is proper <hi>to the Whole,</hi> and Right Motion <hi>to the
Parts,</hi> these differences are not rightly referred to Motion, so as
to call one Motion Right, another Circular, as if they were not
consistent with one another:<note place="margin">Circular and Right Motion co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incedent, and may consist together in the same Body.</note> For they may be both together, and
that Naturally, in the same Body; no lesse than it is equally
Natural for a Man to participate of Sense and Reason, seeing
that these differences are not directly opposite to one another.
Hereupon Rest and Immobility only are opposed to Motion;
and not one Species of Motion to another. And for the other
differences <hi>à medio, ad medium,</hi> and <hi>circa medium,</hi> they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
not <hi>really,</hi> but only <hi>formally,</hi> as the Point, Line and
Superficies, none of which can be without the other two, or
without a Body. Hence it appears, that in as much as this Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
differs from that of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> so in like manner doth this
New Cosmographical System vary from the Common one, that
hath been hitherto received. But this by the way, upon occasion
of explaining the Fifth Maxim: For as to the truth or falshood
of these foregoing Positions (although I conceive them very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable)
I am resolved to determine nothing at present, neither
shall I make any farther enquiry into them.</p>
                     <p>The Sixth and Last Maxim is this. Every thing is Simply deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
such as it is in comparison of all things, or of many
things which make the greater number of that kinde, but not in
respect of a few which make but the lesser part of them. As,
for instance, a Vessel shall not be called absolutely Great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is so whilst it is compared with two or three others: but
it shall be said to be great absolutely, and will be so, if it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in magnitude all indivials, or the greater part of them. Nor
again shall a Man be said to be absolutely Big, because he is big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than a Pigmey; nor yet absolutely Little, because lesse than
a Gyant: but he shall be termed absolutely Big or Little in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of the ordinary Stature of the greater part of Men. Thus
the Earth cannot absolutely be said to be High or Low for that it
is found to be so in respect of some small part of the Universe; nor
again shall it be absolutely affirmed to be High, being compared
to the Centre of the World, or some few parts of the Universe,
more near to the said Centre, as is the <hi>Sun, Mercury</hi> or <hi>Venus:</hi>
but it shall receive its absolute denomination according as it shall
be found to be in comparison of the greater number of the
Spheres and Bodies of the Universe.<note place="margin">The Earth in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

comparison of the whole Circuit of the Eighth Sphaere which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:96976:276"/>
all Corporeal Creatures, and in comparison of <hi>Jupiter,
Mars,</hi> and <hi>Saturn</hi> together with the <hi>Moon,</hi> and much more in
comparison of other Bodies, (if any such there be) above the
Eighth Sphere and especially the Empyrial Heaven, may be truly
said to be in the lowest place of the World, and almost in the
Centre of it; nor can it he said to be above any of them, except
the <hi>Sun, Mercury</hi> and <hi>Venus:</hi> So that one may apply unto it the
name of an Infime and Low, but not a Supreme or Middle Body.
And so to come down from Heaven, especially the Empyrian, to it
(as it is accepted in the Descent of Christ from Heaven to his Holy
Incarnation) and from it to go up to Heaven (as in Christs return
to Heaven in his Glorious Ascention) is truly and properly to
<hi>Descend</hi> from the Circumference to the Centre,<note place="margin">Christ in his Incarnation tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly descended from Heaven, and in his Asce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from the parts which are nearest to the Centre of the World
to its utmost Circumference. This Maxim therefore may easily
and according to truth explain Theologicall Propositions: and
this is so much the more confirmed, in that (as I have observed)
almost all Texts of Sacred Scripture which oppose the Earth to
Heaven, are most conveniently and aptly understood of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyrial
Heaven (being the Highest of all the Heavens, and Spiritual
in respect of its end) but not of the inferiour or intermediate Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
which are a Corporeal, and were framed for the benefit of
Corporeal Creatures: and thus when in the Plural Number
Heavens are mentioned, then all the Heavens promiscuously and
without distinction are to be understood, as well the Empyrian
it self as the Inferiour Heavens. And this Exposition indeed any
man (that doth but take notice of it) may find to be most true.
And so for this Reason the Third Heaveu into which St. <hi>Paul</hi>
was wrapt up,<note place="margin">2 Cor. c. 12. v. 3. Whether in the body or out of the body, I cannot tell, The Sun is King, Heart and Lamp of the World him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self being <gap reason="foreign">

if for the the First Heaven we understand that immense Space of
Erratick and Moveable Bodies illuminated by the Sun, in which
are comprehended the Planets, as also the Earth moveable, and
the Sun immoveable, Who like a King upon his August Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
sits with venerable Majesty immoveable and constant in
Centre of all the Sphaeres, and, with his Divine Beames, doth
bountifully exhilerate all Coelestial Bodies that stand in need of
his vital Light, for which they cravingly wander about him; and
doth liberally and on every side comfort and illustrate the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
of the whole World, and all its parts, even the very least, like
an immortal and perpetual Lamp of high and unspeakable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue.
The Second Heaven shall be the Starry Heaven, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called the Eighth Sphaere, or the Firmament, wherein are all
the Fixed Starrs, which according to this Opinion of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi>
is (like as the Sun and Centre) void of all Motion, the Centre
and utmost Circumference mutually agreeing with each other in
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:96976:277"/>
Immobility. And the Third shall be the Empyrean Heaven, that
is the Seat of the Blessed. And in this manner we may come to

                        <hi>All things are about the King of all things, Second things
about the second, and Third things about the Third:</hi> For that
God being the Centre of Spiritual things, the Sun, of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal,
Christ, of those that are Mixt, or made up of both, things
do doubtlesse depend of that of these three Centres that is most
correspondent and proportionable to them, and the Centre is
ever adjudged to be the nobler and worthier place: and therefore
in Animals the Heart, in Vegitables the Pith or Kernell wherein
the Seed lyeth that conserveth their perpetuity, and virtually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
the whole Plant, are in the Midst, and in the Centre: and
thus much shall suffice to have hinted at, since there may another
occasion offer it self for a larger Explication of these things. By
this Maxim the Authorities and Arguments of the Third Fourth
and Fifth Classes are resolved.</p>
                     <p>It may be added withall, that even the <hi>Sun, Mercury</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
(that is to say in respect of the Earth) are to be thought
<hi>aboue,</hi> and not <hi>beneath</hi> the Earth it self, although in respect of
the Universe, yea and also absolutely, they are <hi>below.</hi> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is, because in respect of the Earth they alwayes appear above
its Surface: and although they do not environe it, yet by the
Motion of the said Earth they behold one while one part, another
while another part of its Circumference. Since therefore those
things which in a Sphaerical Body are nearer to the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and more remote from the Cenrre are said to be <hi>above,</hi> but
those that are next adjoyning to the Centre are said to be <hi>below;</hi>
it clearly followeth that whilst the <hi>Sun, Mercury</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> are
not only turned towards the Surface and Circumference of the
said Earth, but are at a very great distance without it, successively
turned about it, and every way have a view of it, and are very
far remote from its Centre, they may, in respect of the said Earth,
be said to be <hi>above</hi> it; as also on the other side, the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ath in
respect of them may be said to be <hi>beneath:</hi> howbeit on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
in respect of the Universe, the Earth in reality is much
higher than they. And thus is salved the Authority of <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astes</hi>
in many places,<note place="margin">Eccles. c. 1. 2. 3. <hi>and almost tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</hi>
                        </note> expressing those things that are, or are done

the Sun,</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Quod fiunt, vel sunt sub sole.</note> And in the same manner those words are reduced to their
true Sense wherein it is said, That we are <hi>under the Sun,</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Moon,</hi> whereupon Terrene things are expressed by the
name of <hi>Sublunary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Sixth Classis threatneth a difficulty which is common as
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:96976:277"/>
well to this of <hi>Copernicus,</hi> as to the Vulgar Opinion; so that they
are both alike concerned in the solution of it: But so far as it
opposeth that of <hi>Copernicus,</hi> its answer is easy from the First
Maxim.</p>
                     <p>But that which is added in the Fourth Classe, That it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from this Opinion, that Hell (for that it is included by the
Earth, as is commonly held) doth move circularly about the
Sun, and in Heaven, and that so Hell it self will be found to be
in Heaven; discovers, in my judgment, nothing but Ignorance
and Calumny, that insinuate the belief of their Arguments ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by a corrupt sense of the Words, than by solid Reasons
taken from the bosome of the Nature of things. For in this
place Heaven is no wise to be taken for Paradice, nor according
to the Sense of Common Opinion,<note place="margin">Heaven accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Copernicus is the same with the most<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tenuous Aether; but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, which sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passeth all the Heavens.</note> but (as hath been said above)
according to the <hi>Copernican</hi> Hypothesis, for the subtilest and
Purest Aire, far more tenuous and rare than this of ours; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Solid Bodies of the Stars, Moon, and Earth, in their
Circular and Ordinary Motions, do passe thorow it, (the Sphaere
of Fire being by this Opinion taken away.) And as according
to the Common Opinion it was no absurdity to say, That Hell
being demerged in the Centre of the Earth and of the World it
self, hath Heaven and Paradice above and below it, yea and on
all sides of it, and that it is in the middle of all the Coelestial
Bodies (as if it were posited in a more unworthy place) so, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in this will it be deemed an Error, if from the other System,
which differeth not much from the Vulgar one, those or the like
things follow as do in that. For both in that of <hi>Copernicus,</hi> and
the Vulgar Hypothesis, Hell is supposed to be placed amongst the
very dreggs of the Elements, and in the Centre of the Earth it
self, for the confinement and punishment of the damned. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ought not for want of Reasons to trifle away time in
vain and impertinent strife about words, since their true Sense
is clouded then with no obscurity, and in regard that it is very
clear to any man indued with a refined Intellect, and that hath
but an indifferent judgment in the Liberal Arts, and especially
in the Mathematicks, that the same, or not very different Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
do flow from both these Opinions.</p>
                     <p>By these Maxims and their Interpretations it appears, that
the <hi>Pythagorick</hi> and <hi>Copernican</hi> Opinion is so probable, that its
possible it may exceed even the <hi>Ptolemaick</hi> in probability; and
since there may be deduced from it a most ordinate Systeme, and
a more admirable and mysterious Hypothesis of the World
than from that of <hi>Ptolomy:</hi> the Authorities of Sacred Scripture
and Theological Tenents in the mean while not opposing it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
opportunely and appositely (as I have shown how they may
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:96976:278"/>
be) reconciled with it: And since that by it not only the Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena
of all the Coelestial Bodies are most readily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

also many Natural Reasons are discovered, which could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,

                        <hi>Three Bowls made like unto Almonds,

is, the shallownesse of my understanding cannot fathome the

depth of all the Mysteries that are couched in this most wise
disposure of things: neverthelesse being amazed, and transported
with admiration, I will say; Who knows but that those three
Bowls like unto Almonds to be represented on each of the
Branches of the Candlestick may signifie those Globes which are
apter (as is this our Earth) for the receiving than emitting of Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences?
Perhaps also they denote those Globes of late discovered
by the help of the Optick Telescope, which participate with
<hi>Saturn, Jupiter, Venus,</hi> and possibly also with the other Planets?
Who knows likewise, but that there may be some occult propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
between these Globes and those Mysterious Knops and
Lilies insinuated unto us in the sacred Scriptures? But this
shall here suffice to bound humane Presumption, and to teach us
to exspect with an Harpocratick silence from Time, the Indice of
Truth, a discovery of these Mysteries:<note n="g" place="margin">1 Kings <hi>c. 7. v.</hi> 49. 2 Chron. <hi>c. 4. vers.</hi> 7.</note> 
                        <hi>Solomon</hi> made ten
Candlesticks by the same Patern of <hi>Moses,</hi> which he placed, five
on one hand and five on another, in the Temple erected by him
in honour of the most High God; which very thing doth also,
without all question, contain most abstruse significations. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
that Apple of the Knowledg of Good and Evil prohibited
our first Parents by God is not without a Mystery; which some
say was an Indian Figg. In which these things are to be observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
First, That it is replete with many Kernels, every one of
which hath a particular Centre. Secondly, Though of it self it
be hard and solid, yet about its Circumference it is of a more rare
and tenuouse substance; herein resembling the Earth, which
though in its Centre, and those parts which are nearest to it, it
be stony, Metallick, and compact, yet the nearer one approacheth
to the Circumference, its parts are seen to be the more rare and
tenuouse: and withall it hath another body, more rare than its
own, namely the Water, above which there is yet another, more
subtil than all the rest of inferiour Bodyes, that is to say,
the Aire,</p>
                     <p>The same Representation with that of the Indian Figg is held
forth to us by the <hi>Malum Punicum,</hi> or Pomegranate, with its
innumerable polycentrick Stones or Kernels, all which in the parts
more remote from their Centre, and nearer approaching towards
the Circumference, are of a substance so subtil and rare, that being
but lightly compressed, they in a manner wholly convert into a
most tenuose Liquor or juice: Of which fruit it pleased Divine
Wisdom to make mention, and ordained that its Figure should be
imbroidered and wrought with a needle in the <hi>sacerdotal</hi> Garment
of <hi>Aaron:</hi>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>ON BENEDETTO CASTELLI,</hi>
the famous Authour of these ensuing
Discourses of the <hi>Mensuration of
Running Waters,</hi> is descended from
the Worshipful FAMILY of the
<hi>CASTELLII,</hi> and took his
first breath near to the lake THRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIMENVS,
(where <hi>Hanibal</hi> gave
a fatal overthrow to the <hi>Roman</hi>
Legions) in that sweet and fertile part
of happy <hi>ITALY,</hi> called the <hi>Territory</hi>
of <hi>PERUGIA,</hi> a branch of the Dukedome of <hi>TUSCANY,</hi> which
at present submitteth to the Jurisdiction of the Church, as being a
part of <hi>St. PETER'S Patrimony.</hi> His Parents, who were more
zealous of the good of his Soul than observant of the Propension of
his Genius, dedicated him (according to the Devotion of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try)
to the Service of the Church; and entered him into the Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
Order of Black-Friers, called from the place Moncks
of <hi>Monte Casino,</hi> and from the Founder <hi>Benedictines.</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that She might consummate the Profusion of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
upon him, sent him into the World in an Age that was so
ennobled and illuminated with Eminent Scholars in all Kinds of
Literature, that hardly any Century since the Creation can boast
the like.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:96976:284"/>
                     <hi>§.</hi> In particular, the <hi>SCIENCES MATHEMATI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CAL</hi>
had then got that Fame and Esteem in the Learned World,
that all men of Spirit or Quality became either Students in, or
Patrons of those Sublime Knowledges. On this occasion the Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity
of our <hi>AUTHOUR</hi> being awakened, his Active Wit
could not endure to be any longer confined to the Slavish Tuition
of Hermetical Pedagogues; but in concurrence with the Genius
of the Age, he also betook himself to those most Generous and
Liberal Studies. His helps in this his design were so many, and
so extraordinary, that had his Inclination been weaker, or his
Apprehension lesser, he could hardly have failed attaining more
than a Common Eminency in these Sciences. For besides the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
of Learned and Vseful Books, which the Presse at that
time sent forth from all parts of <hi>EUROPE,</hi> he had the good
Fortune to fall into the Acquaintance, and under the Instruction
of the most Demonstrative and most Familiar Man in the World,
the Famous <hi>GALILEO:</hi> whose successe being no lesse upon
this his <hi>Pupil</hi> than upon the rest of those Illustrious and Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Persons that resorted from all parts to sit under his Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Lectures, he in a short time attained to that Name in the
Mathematicks, that he was invited to <hi>ROME,</hi> Complemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and Preferred by his then Holinesse the Eighth <hi>URBAN,</hi>
upon his very first Accession to the <hi>Papacy,</hi> which was in the
Year 1623.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>§.</hi> This Pope being moved with a Paternal Providence for the
Concerns of his Subjects in that part of <hi>ITALY</hi> about <hi>BO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOGNA,
FERRARA,</hi> and <hi>COMMACHIO,</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
between the Rivers of <hi>PO</hi> and <hi>RENO,</hi> which is part of
<hi>Lo Stato della Chiesa,</hi> or the Church Patrimony, appoints this
our <hi>CASTELLI</hi> in the Year 1625, to accompany the Right
Honourable <hi>Monsignore CORSINI</hi> (a most observant and
intelligent person in these affaires, and at that time Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of the General Draines, and President of <hi>ROMAGNA</hi>)
in the Grand Visitation which he was then ordered to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the disorders occasioned by the Waters of those parts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>§. CASTELLI,</hi> having now an Opportunity to employ,
yea more, to improve such Notions as he had imbued from the
Lectures of his Excellent <hi>MASTER,</hi> falls to his work with
all industry: and in the time that his Occasions detained him in
<hi>ROMAGNA</hi> he perfected the First Book of this his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
concerning the <hi>Mensuration of Running Waters.</hi> He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
that he had some years before applyed himself to this part
of Practical Geometry, and from several Observations collected
part of that Doctrine which at this time he put into Method, and
which had procured him the Repute of so much Skill that he began
<pb facs="tcp:96976:284"/>
to be Courted by sundry Princes, and great Prelates. In particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
about the beginning of the Year 1623. and before his Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to <hi>ROME</hi> he was employed by Prince <hi>Ferdinando I,</hi> Grand
Duke of <hi>TUSCANY,</hi> to remedy the Disorders which at that
time happened in the Valley of <hi>PISA</hi> in the Meadows that lye
upon the Banks of <hi>Serchio</hi> and <hi>Fiume Morto:</hi> and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the Grand Duke, Grand Dutchesse Mother, the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners
of Sewers, and sundry other Persons in a few hours he
made so great a progresse in that affair, as gave his Most Serene
Highnesse high satisfaction, and gained himself much Honour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>§.</hi> No sooner had he in his fore-mentioned Voiage to <hi>RO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAGNA</hi>
(which was but few Moneths after, in the same
Year) committed his Conceptions to paper, but he communicated
them to certain of his Friends. In which number we finde <hi>Signo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
Giampoli</hi> Secretary of the Popes Private Affaires; whom in
the beginning of the First Book he gratefully acknowledgeth to
have been contributary, in his Purse, towards defraying the
charge of Experiments, and in his Person, towards the debating
and compleating of Arguments upon this Subject. Some few years
after the Importunity of Friends, and the Zeal he had for the
Publique Good prevailed with him to present the World with his
First Discourse, accompanied with a Treatise of the Geometrical
Demonstrations of his whole Doctrine. What Reception it found
with the Judicious must needs be imagined by any one that hath
observed how <hi>Novelty</hi> and <hi>Facility</hi> in conjunction with <hi>Verity</hi>
make a Charm of irresistable Operation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>§. New</hi> it was, for that no man before him had ever attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Demonstrate all the three Dimensions, to wit, the Length,
Breadth and Profundity, of this Fluid and Current Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And he detecteth such grosse Errours in those few that
had untertook to write upon the Subject (of which he instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
in <hi>Frontinus</hi> and <hi>Fontana,</hi> as those that include the rest)
and delivereth such singular and unheard of Paradoxes (for so
they sound in Vulgar Eares) as cannot but procure unspeakable
delight to his Reader.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>§. Easie</hi> it is likewise and <hi>True;</hi> and that upon so Familiar
Experiments and Manifest Demonstrations, that I have oft que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned
with my self which merited the greater wonder, he, for
discovering, or all men that handled the Argument before him
for not discovering a Doctrine of such strange Facility and Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility.
But yet as if our Authour designed to oblige the whole
World to him by so excellent a <hi>Present,</hi> he selects a Subject that
he knew would be carressed by all persons of Nobler Souls, upon
the accounts afore-named, and by all Mankind in General, as
gratifying them in their much adored Idol <hi>Utility.</hi> And to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:96976:285"/>
his Art the more profitable, he reduceth the lofty, and easie to-be-mistaken
Speculations of the Theory, into certain and facile
Directions for Practice; teaching us how to prevent and repaire
the Breaches of Seas, and Inundations of Rivers; to draine
and recover Fenns and Marches; to divert, conveigh and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute
Waters for the Flowing and Stercoration of Grounds,
strengthening of Fortifications, serving of Aquaducts, preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of Health (by cleansing Streets, and scowring Sewers) and
maintaining of Commerse (by defending Bridges, cleering Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and opening Pores and Channels) with innumerable other
Benefits of the like nature. And, that I may omit no circumstance
that may recommend my Authour, the Fortune of this his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
hath been such, that as if he intended a <hi>Plus ultra</hi> by it,
or as if all men despaired to out-do it, or lastly, as if <hi>CA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STELLI</hi>
hath been so great a <hi>Master</hi> that none have presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to take Pencil in hand for the finishing of what he <hi>Pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foild,</hi>
this small Tract like the Arabian Phoenix (of which it is
said <hi>Unica semper Avis</hi>) did for several years together continue
single in the World, till that to verifie it to be truly <hi>Phoenician,</hi>
it renewed its Age by undergoing a second Impression. And as if
this did not make out the Immortal vertue of it, it hath had
<hi>Anno</hi> 1660 a third Circulation, and risen in this last Edition as
it were from the Vrne of its Authour; and that so improved by
the Addition of a second part, that it promiseth to perpetuate
his Merits to all Posterity. To be brief, the meer Fame of this
Work resounded the Honourable Name of <hi>CASTELLI</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all the Corners of <hi>Italy,</hi> I may say of <hi>Europe;</hi> insomuch,
that, in hopes to reap great benefit by his Art, the respective
Grandees of the adjacent Countries courted his Judgment and
Advice about their Draining of Fenns, Diversion of Rivers,
Evacuation of Ports, Preventing of Inundations, &amp;c. So that
every Summer he made one or more of these Journies or Visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Particularly, the Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> consulted him about their
Lake; to whom he delivered his Opinion in <hi>May</hi> 1641. and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
farther thoughts he presented them with another Paper of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
the 20 <hi>December</hi> following. Prince <hi>LEOPOLDO</hi>
of <hi>TUSCANY</hi> likewise requested his Advice in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the ensuing year 1642, which occasioned his Letter to
Father <hi>Francesco di San Giuseppe,</hi> bearing date <hi>February</hi> 1,
To which <hi>Signore Bartolotti</hi> opposing, he writes a second Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
directed to one of the Commissioners of Sewers, vindicating
his former, and refuting <hi>Bartolotti,</hi> both which I here give
you.</p>
                  <p>§. The Preferments which his Merits recommended him unto,
were first to be Abbot of <hi>Cassino,</hi> from which he was removed
<pb facs="tcp:96976:285"/>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1640, or thereabouts, unto the Abbey of <hi>Santo Benedet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Aloysio;</hi> and much about the same time preferred to the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Chief Mathematician to his grand Patron Pope <hi>URBAN
VIII.</hi> and Publique Professour of Mathematicks in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of <hi>ROME.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>§.</hi> Here a Stop was put to the Carier of his Fortunes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fuller of Honour than of Years, was by Death, the Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Intrerupter of Generous Designs, prevented in doing that
farther Good which the World had good reason to promise it self
from so Profound and Industrious a Personage, leaving many
Friends and Disciples of all Degrees and Qualities to lament
his losse, and honour his Memory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>§.</hi> His singular Virtues and Abilities had gained him the
Friendship of very many; as to instance in some, he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
strict Amity with <hi>Monsignore Maffei Barberino</hi> a Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
Praefect of the Publique Wayes, and afterwards Pope with
the Name of <hi>URBAN VIII.</hi> as was said before; with the
above-named <hi>Monsignore Corsini</hi> Superintendant of the General
Draines: with <hi>Monsignore Piccolomini</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Siena:</hi>
with Cardinal <hi>Serra:</hi> with Cardinal <hi>Caponi,</hi> who hath studied
much and writ well upon this Subject; and with Cardinal <hi>Gae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tano</hi>
who frequently consulted with him in his design of Drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Fenns of <hi>ROMAGNA.</hi> Moreover Prince <hi>LEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POLDO,</hi>
and his Brother the Grand Duke had very great
kindnesse for him; which speaks no small attractions in him,
considering him as a favourite of the Family of <hi>Barberini,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
whom and the House of <hi>Medeci</hi> there is an inveterate
Fewd. Amongst persons of a lower Quality he acknowledgeth
<hi>Signore Ciampoli</hi> the Popes Secretary, <hi>Sig. Ferrante Cesarini,
Sig. Giovanni Basadonna</hi> Senator of <hi>Venice;</hi> and I find menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<hi>Sig. Lana, Sig. Albano, Padre Serafino, Pad. Francesco
de San. Giuseppe,</hi> and many others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>§.</hi> The Works in which he will survive to all succeeding Ages
are first His solid and sober Confutation of the Arguments of
<hi>Signore Lodovico dell Columbo,</hi> and <hi>Signore Vincentio di
Gratia</hi> against the Tract of <hi>Galileo Delle cose che stanno sopra
Aqua,</hi> wherein he vindicates bis said <hi>Master</hi> with a Gratitude
that Tutors very rarely reap from the pains they take in Culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating
their Pupils. This Apology was first Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1615.
and was a second time published, as also those of his Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,
amongst the Works of <hi>GALILEO,</hi> set forth by the
Learned <hi>Viviani</hi> 1656. He hath likewise writ several other
curious Pieces, as I am informed by the most Courteous <hi>Carolo
Manolessi</hi> of <hi>Bologna;</hi> amongst others an excellent Treatise
concerning <hi>Colours,</hi> which he putteth me in hopes to see printed
<pb facs="tcp:96976:286"/>
very speedily. And last of all these Discourses and Reflections
upon the <hi>Mensuration of Running Waters,</hi> with the addition of
a Second Book, three Epistles, and four Considerations upon
the same Argument, which conduce much to Illustrate his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Facilitate the Practice of it; and which with a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Monsignore Corsini,</hi> make the second part of my First
Tome.</p>
                  <p>§. <hi>I might here sally forth into the Citation of sundry Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
of Good Account, that have transmitted his Character
to Posterity, but shall confine my self to onely two; the one is
of his</hi> Master, <hi>the other of his</hi> Scholar; <hi>than whom there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be two more competent Judges of his Accomplishments. To
begin with his</hi> Master, <hi>the Quick-sighted, and truly Lyncean</hi>
GALILEO, <hi>who speaking of his Abilities in Astronomy saith</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Nella continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atione dell Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio siderio.</note> Che la felicità del suo ingegno non la fà bisognosa dell' o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pera
suo. <hi>And again, submitting a certain Demonstration,
which he intended to divulge, to the Judgment of this our Abbot, he
writes to him in this manner:</hi>

And because that in the years past I had occasion by Order of
our Lord Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> 8. to apply my thoughts to the motion of
the Waters of Rivers, (a matter difficult, most important, and
little handled by others) having concerning the same observed
some particulars not well observed, or considered till now, but of
great moment both in publick and private affairs; I have thought
good to publish them, to the end that ingenious spirits might
have occasion to discusse more exactly then hitherto hath been
done, so necessary and profitable a matter, and to supply also my
defects in this short and difficult Tractate. Difficult I say, for
the truth is, these knowledges, though of things next our senses,
are sometimes more abstruce and hidden, then the knowledge of
things more remote; and much better, and with greater exquisit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
are known the motions of the Planets, and Periods of the
Stars, than those of Rivers and Seas: As that singular light of
Philosophie of our times, and my Master <hi>Signore Galileo Galilei</hi>
wisely observeth in his Book concerning the Solar spots. And
to proceed with a due order in Sciences, I will take some suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
and cognitions sufficiently clear; from which I will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
proceed to the deducing of the principal conclusions. But
to the end that what I have written at the end of this discourse in
a demonstrative and Geometrical method, may also be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of those which never have applyed their thoughts to the
study of Geometry; I have endeavoured to explain my conceit
by an example, and with the consideration of the natural things
themselves, must after the same order in which I began to doubt
in this matter; and have placed this particular Treatise here in
the beginning, adverting nevertheless, that he who desires more
full and absolute solidity of Reasons, may overpass this prefatory
discourse, and onely consider what is treated of in the demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
placed towards the end, and return afterwards to the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the things collected in the <hi>Corollaries</hi> and Appendices;
which demonstrations notwithstanding, may be pretermitted by
him that hath not seen at least the first six Books of the Elements
of Euclid; so that he diligently observeth that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
                     <p>I say therefore, that having in times past, on divers occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
heard speak of the measures of the waters of Rivers, and
Fountains, saying, such a River is two or three thousand feet of
water; such a spring-water is twenty, thirty, or forty inches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Although in such manner I have found all to treat thereof in
word and writing, without variety, and as we are wont to say,
<hi>constanti sermone,</hi> yea even Artists and Ingeneers, as if it were
a thing that admitted not of any doubt, yet howsoever I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
still infolded in such an obscurity, that I well knew I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96976:288"/>
nothing at all, of that which others pretended full and
clearly to understand. And my doubt arose from my frequent
observation of many Trenches and Channels, which carry
water to turn Mills, in which Trenches, and Channels, the
water being measured, was found pretty deep; but if afterwards
the same water was measured in the fall it made to turn the
Wheel of the Mill, it was much lesse, not amounting often to the
tenth part, nor sometimes to the twentieth, insomuch, that the
same running water came to be one while more, another while less
in measure, in divers parts of its Channel; and for that reason this
vulgar manner of measuring running Waters, as indeterminate and
uncertain, was by me justly suspected, the measure being to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate,
and the same. And here I freely confesse that I had sin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gular
help to resolve this difficulty from the excellent &amp; accurate
way of discoursing, as in allother matters, so also in this, of the
Right Honourable and Truly Noble Signior <hi>Ciampoli,</hi> Secretary
of the Popes secret affairs. Who moreover, not sparing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>or the costs
of the same, generously gave me occasion a few years past to try by
exact experiments that which past concerning this particular. And
to explain all more clearly with an example; we suppose a Vessel
filled with Water, as for instance a Butt, which is kept full, though
still water runneth out, and the Water run out by two Taps equal
of bignesse, one put in the bottom of the Vessel, and the other in
the upper part; it is manifest that in the time wherein from the
upper part shall issue a determinate measure of water from
the inferiour part there shall issue four, five, and many more of
the same measures, according to the difference of the height of
the Taps, and the distance of the upper Tap from the Superfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
and level of the water of the Vessel: and all this will alwayes
follow, though, as hath been said, the Taps be equal, and the
water in discharging keep the said Taps alwayes full. Where first
we note, that, although the measure of the Taps be equal, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
there issueth from them in equal times unequal quantities
of water, And if we should more attentively consider this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
we should find, that the water by the lower Tap, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
and passeth with much greater velocity, then it doth by the
upper, whatever is the reason. If therefore we would have
such a quantity of Water discharge from the upper tap, as
would discharge from the neather in the same time, it is plain, that
either the upper Taps must be multiplyed in such sort, that so
many more Taps in number be placed above than below, as the
neather tap shall be more swift than the upper, or the upper Tap
made so much bigger than the nether, by how much that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
shall be more swift than that above; and so then in equal
times, the same quantity of Water shall discharge from the upper,
as doth fromth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e neather part.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:96976:289"/>
I will declare my self by another example. If we should ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that two cords or lines of equal thickness, be drawn through
two holes of equal bore; but so that the first pass with quadruple
velocity to the second: It is manifest, that if in a determinate
time, we shall by the first bore have drawn four Ells of the line,
in the same time, by the second hole we shall have drawn but one
Ell of cord onely; and if by the first there passe twelve Ells, then
through the second there shall passe onely three Ells; and in
short the quantity of cord shall have the same proportion to the
cord, that the volocity hath to the velocity. And therefore we
desiring to compensate the tardity of the second cord, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the same tardity to draw through the second hole as much
cord as through the first, it will be necessary to draw through the
second bore four ends of cord; so that the thickness of all the
cords by the second hole, have the same proportion to the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the cord which passeth onely by the first, as the velocity
of the cord by the first hole hath reciprocally to the velocity of
the cod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s by the second hole. And thus its clear, that when
there is drawn through two holes equal quantity of cords in
equal time, but with unequal velocity, it will be necessary, that
the thickness of all the four cords shall have the same reciprocal
proportion to the thickness of the swifter cord, that the velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of the swifter cord hath to the velocity of the slower. The
which is verified likewise in the fluid Element of Water.</p>
                     <p>And to the end that this principal fundamental be well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
I will also note a certain observation made my me in the
Art of Wyer-drawing, or spinning Gold, Silver, Brass, and Iron,
and it is this; That such Artificers desiring more and more to
disgrosse and subtillize the said Metals, having wound about a
Rocket or Barrel, the thread of the Metal, they place the Roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
in a frame upon a stedfast Axis, in such sort that the Rocket
may turn about in it self; then making one end of the thread to
passe by force through a Plate of Steel pierced with divers holes,
greater and lesser, as need requireth, fastning the same end of the
thread to another Rocket, they wind up the thread, which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
through a bore less than the thicknesse of the thread, is of
force constrained to disgrosse and subtillize. Now that which is
intensly to be observed in this business, is this, That the parts of
the thread before the hole, are of such a thicknesse, but the parts
of the same thread after it is passed the hole, are of a lesser thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
and yet neverthelesse the masse and weight of the thread
which is drawn forth, is ever equal to the masse and weight of the
thread which is winded up. But if we should well consider the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
we should finde, that the thicker the thread before the hole is,
than the thread passed the hole, the greater reciprocally is the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96976:289"/>
velocity of the parts of the thread passed the hole, than the volo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of the parts before the hole: Insomuch that if <hi>verbi gratia</hi>
the thicknesse of the thread before the hole, were double to the
thicknesse after the hole, in such case the velocity of the parts of
the thread passed the hole, should be double to the velocity of the
parts of the thread before the hole; and thus the thicknesse
compensates the velocity, and the velocity compensates the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
So that the same occurreth in the solid Metals of Gold,
Silver, Brass, Iron, &amp;c. that eveneth also in the fluid Element of
Water, and other liquids, namely, That the velocity beareth the
same proportion to the velocity, that the thicknesse of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
or Water, hath to the thicknesse.</p>
                     <p>And therefore granting this discourse, we may say, that as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
as two Taps with different velocity discharge equal quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Water in equal times, it will be necessary that the Tap
lesse swift be so much greater, and larger, than the Tap more
swift, by how much the swifter superates in velocity the slower;
and to pronounce the Proposition in more proper terms, we say;
That if two Taps of unequal velocity, discharge in equal times
equal quantities of Water, the greatnesse of the first shall be to
the greatnesse of the second, in reciprocal proportion, as the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity
of the second to the velocity of the first. As for example,
if the first Tap shall be ten times swifter than the second Tap, it
will be necessary, that the second be ten times bigger and larger
than the first; and in such case the Taps shall discharge equall
quantities of water in equal times; and this is the principal and
most important point, which ought to be kept alwayes in minde,
for that on it well understood depend many things profitable,
and worthy of our knowledge.</p>
                     <p>Now applying all that hath been said neerer to our purpose, I
consider, that it being most true, that in divers parts of the same
River or Current of running water, there doth always passe equal
quantity of Water in equal time (which thing is also demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
in our first Proposition) and it being also true, that in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
parts the same River may have various and different veloci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
it follows of necessary consequence, that where the River
hath lesse velocity, it shall be of greater measure, and in those
parts, in which it hath greater velocity, it shall be of lesse mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
and in sum, the velocity of several parts of the said River,
shall have eternally reciprocall and like proportion with
their measures. This principle and fundamental well establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the same Current of Water changeth measure, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to its varying of velocity; that is, lessening the measure,
when the velocity encreaseth, and encreasing the measure, when
the velocity decreaseth; I passe to the consideration of many
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96976:290"/>
particular accidents in this admirable matter, and all depending
on this sole Proposition, the sense of which I have oft repeated,
that it might be well understood.</p>

                        <p>ANd first, we hence conclude, that the same Streams of a
Torrent, namely, those streams which carry equal quantity of
Water in equal times, make not the same depths or measures in
the River, in which they enter, unlesse when in the entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the River they acquire; or to say better, keep the same velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city;
because if the velocicities acquired in the River shall be
different, also the measures shall be diverse; and consequently
the depths, as is demonstrated.</p>

                        <p>ANd because successively, as the River is more and more full,
it is constituted ordinarily in greater &amp; greater velocity: hence
it is that the same streams of the Torrent, that enter into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
make lesse and lesse depths, as the River grows more and
more full; since that also the Waters of the Torrent being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
into the River, go acquiring greater and greater velocities,
and therefore diminish in measure and height.</p>

                        <p>WE observe also, that while the main River is shallow, if there
fall but a gentle rain, it suddenly much increaseth and riseth;
but when the River is already swelled, though there fall again a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
new violent shower, yet it increaseth not at the same rate
as before, proportionably to the rain which fell: which thing
we may affirm particularly to depend on this, that in the first
case, while the River is low, it is found also very slow, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the little water which entereth into it, passeth and runs with
little velocity, and consequently occupieth a great measure:
But when the River is once augmented, by new water being also
made more swift, it causeth the great Flood of water which fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
to bear a lesse measure, and not to make such a depth.</p>

                        <p>FRom the things demonstrated is manifest also, that whilst a
Torrent entereth into a River, at the time of Ebbe, then the
Torrent moveth with such a certain velocity, what ever it be,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96976:290"/>
passing by its extreamest parts, wherewith it communicateth with
the River; in which parts, the Torrent being measured, shall
have such a certain measure: but the River swelling and rising,
also those parts of the Torrent augment in greatnesse and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
though the Torrent, in that instant, dis-imbogue no more
water than it did before: so that the River being swelled, we
are to consider two mouths of the same Torrent, one lesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the rising, the other greater after the rising, which mouths
discharge equal quantities of water in equal times; therefore the
velocity by the lesser mouth shall be greater than the velocity by
the greater mouth; and thus the Torrent shall be retarded from
its ordinary course.</p>

                        <p>FRom which operation of Nature proceedeth another effect
worthy of consideration; and it is, that the course of the water
retarding, as hath been said in those ultimate parts of the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
if it shall happen that the Torrent grow torbid and mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and its streame be retarded in such a degree, that it is not
able to carry away those minute grains of Earth, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the muddinesse; in this case the Torrent shall clear away
the mud, and carry away the Sand at the bottome of its own
Chanel, in the extream parts of its mouth, which raised and
voided Sand, shall again afterwards be carried away, when the
River abating, the Torrent shall return to move with its primitive
velocity.</p>

                        <p>WHilst it is demonstrated, that the same water hath different
measures in its Chanel or course, according as it varieth in
velocity; so that the measure of the water is alwayes greater, where
the velocity is lesser; and on the contrary, the measure lesser,
where the velocity is greater: from hence we may most ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly
render the reason of the usual Proverb, <hi>Take heed of the
still waters:</hi> For that if we consider the self same water of a
River in those parts, wherein it is less swift, and thence called <hi>still</hi>
or <hi>smooth</hi> water, it shall be, of necessity, of greater measure
than in those parts, in which it is more swift, and therefore ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
shall be also more deep and dangerous for passengers;
whence it is well said, <hi>Take heed of the still Waters;</hi> and this
saying hath been since applied to things moral.</p>

                        <p>LIkewise, from the things demonstrated may be concluded,
that the windes, which stop a River, and blowing against the
Current, retard its course and ordinary velocity shall necessarily
amplifie the measure of the same River, and consequently shall
be, in great part, causes; or we may say, potent con-causes of
making the extraordinary inundations which Rivers use to make.
And its most certain, that as often as a strong and continual wind
shall blow against the Current of a River, and shall reduce the
water of the River to such tardity of motion, that in the time
wherein before it run five miles, it now moveth but one, such a
River will increase to five times the measure, though there should
not be added any other quantity of water; which thing indeed
hath in it something of strange, but it is most certain, for that
look what proportion the waters velocity before the winde, hath
to the velocity after the winde, and sueh reciprocally is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the same water after the winde, to the measure before
the winde; and because it hath been supposed in our case that the
velocity is diminished to a fifth part, therefore the measure shall
be increased five times more than that, which it was before.</p>

the Torrents may increase, and of themselves alone exorbitantly

altering the measures of running Waters; but we most

they increase in velocity.</p>

                        <p>THrough the ignorance of the force of the velocity of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
in altering its measure, &amp; augmenting it when the velocity
diminisheth; and diminishing it when the velocity augmenteth:
The Architect <hi>Giovanni Fontana,</hi> endeavoured to measure, and
and to cause to be measured by his Nephew, all the Brooks and
Rivers which discharged their Waters into <hi>Tiber,</hi> at the time of
the Innundation; which happened at <hi>Rome</hi> in the year 1598,
and published a small Treatise thereof, wherein he summeth up
the measures of the extraordinary Water which fell into <hi>Tiber,</hi>
and made account that it was about five hundred Ells more than
ordinary; and in the end of that Treatise concludeth, that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the Innundation wholly from <hi>Rome,</hi> it would be necessary
to make two other Channels, equal to that at present, and that
lesse would not suffice; and finding afterwards that the whole
Stream passed under the Bridge <hi>Quattro-Capi,</hi> (the Arch where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is of a far less measure then five hundred Ells) concludeth,
that under the said Bridge past a hundred fifty one Ells of Water
compressed, (I have set down the precise term of comprest Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
written by <hi>Fontana</hi>) wherein I finde many errors.</p>
                        <p>The first of which is to think that the measures of these Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
compressed in the Channels of those Brooks and Rivers,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96976:292"/>
should maintain themselves the same in <hi>Tiber,</hi> which by his leave,
is most false, when ever those waters reduced into <hi>Tiber,</hi> retain
not the same velocity which they had in the place in which <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana</hi>
and his Nephew measured them: And all this is manifest
from the things which we have above explained; for, if the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
reduced into <hi>Tiber</hi> increase in velocity, they decrease in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
and if they decrease in velocity, they increase in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, I consider that the measures of those Brooks and
Rivers, which enter into <hi>Tiber</hi> at the time of Innundation, are
not between themselves really the same, when their velocities are
not equal, though they have the same names of Ells and Feet;
for that its possible that a disinboguement of ten Ells requadrated
(to speak in the phrase of <hi>Fontana</hi>) of one of those Brooks,
might discharge into <hi>Tiber</hi> at the time of Innundation, four, ten,
and twenty times less Water, than another mouth equal to the
first in greatness, as would occur when the first mouth were four,
ten, or twenty times less swift than the second. Whereupon,
whilst <hi>Fontana</hi> summes up the Ells and Feet of the measures of
those Brooks and Rivers into a total aggregate, he commits the
same error with him, which would add into one summe diverse
moneys of diverse values, and diverse places, but that had the
same name; as if one should say ten Crowns of <hi>Roman</hi> money,
four Crowns of Gold, thirteen Crowns of <hi>Florence,</hi> five Crowns
of <hi>Venice,</hi> and eight Crowns of <hi>Mantua,</hi> should make the same
summe with forty Crowns of Gold, or forty Crowns of <hi>Mantua.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, It might happen that some River or Current in the
parts nearer <hi>Rome,</hi> in the time of its flowing, did not send forth
more Water than ordinary; and however, its a thing very clear,
that whilst the stream came from the superior parts, that same
Brook or River would be augmented in measure, as hath been
noted in the fourth <hi>Corollary;</hi> in such sort, that <hi>Fontana</hi> might
have inculcated, and noted that same River or Current as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
to the Innundation, although it were therein altogether
unconcerned.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, in the fourth place we must note, That it might
so fall out, that such a River not onely was uninteressed in the
Innundation, though augmented in measure, but it might I say
happen, that it was instrumental to the asswaging the Innunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by augmenting in the measure of its own Channel; which
matter is sufficiently evident; for if it be supposed that the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in the time of flood, had not had of it self, and from its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
springs more Water than ordinary, its a thing certain, that
the Water of <hi>Tiber</hi> rising and increasing; also that River, to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
it self with the Water of <hi>Tiber,</hi> would have retained some of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96976:292"/>
its Waters in its own Chanel, without discharging them into <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
or else would have ingorged and swallowed (if I may so say)
some of the water of <hi>Tyber;</hi> and in this case, at the time of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation,
lesse abundance of water would have come to <hi>Rome,</hi>
and yet neverthelesse the measure of that River would have been
increased.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, <hi>Fontana</hi> deceiveth himself, when he concludeth, that
to remove the Inundation from <hi>Rome,</hi> it would be necessary to
make two other Chanels of Rivers, that were as large as that,
which is the present one, and that less would not suffice, which,
I say, is a fallacy: and to convince him easily of his errour, it
sufficeth to say, that all the Streams being passed under the Bridge
<hi>Quattro-Capi,</hi> as he himself attests, a Channel would suffice on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the capacity of the said Bridge, provided that the water
there might run with the same velocity, as it did under the Bridge
at the time of Inundation; and on the contrary, twenty Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
of capacity equal to the present one, would not suffice, if
the water should run with twenty times less velocity, than it made
at the time of the Inundation.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, to me it seemeth a great weaknesse to say, that there
should passe under the Bridge <hi>Quattro-Capi,</hi> an hundred fifty one
ells of water compressed; for that I do not understand that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is like Cotton or Wool, which matters may be prest and trod,
as it happeneth also to the air, which receiveth compression in
such sort, that after that in some certain place a quantity of air
shall be reduced to its natural constitution; and having taken up
all the said place, yet neverthelesse compressing the first Air
with force and violence, it is reduced into far less room, and will
admit four or six times as much air, as before, as is experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
<note n="*" place="margin">And as is at large demonstrated by that most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able personage Mr. <hi>Boile</hi> in the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious experiment of his Pneumatical Engine.</note> seen in the Wind-Gun, invented in our dayes by <hi>M. Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenzo
Vincenti</hi> of <hi>Vrbin,</hi> which property of the Air of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
condensation, is also seen in the portable Fountains of the
same <hi>M. Vincenzo:</hi> which Fountains spirt the Water on high,
by force of the Air compressed, which whilst it seeks to reduce
its self to its natural constitution, in the dilation causeth that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence.
But the water can never, for any thing I know, crowd,
or press so, as that if before the compression it held or possest a
place, being in its natural constitution, I believe not, I say, that it
is possible, by pressing and crowding to make it possess less room,
for if it were possible to compress the Water, and make it to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy
a less place, it would thence follow, that two Vessels of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
measure, but of unequal height, should be of unequal capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
and that should hold more water which was higher; also a
Cylinder, or other Vessel more high than broad, would containe
more water erected, than being laid along; for that being erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96976:293"/>
the water put therein would be more pressed and crowded.</p>
                        <p>And therefore, in our case, according to our principles we will
say, that the water of that Stream passeth all under the said
Bridge <hi>Quattro-Capi,</hi> for that being there most swift, it ought of
consequence to be less in measure.</p>
                        <p>And here one may see, into how many errours a man may run
through ignorance of a true and real Principle, which once known
and well understood, takes away all mists of doubting, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
resolveth all difficulties.</p>

                        <p>THrough the same inadvertency of not regarding the variation
of velocity in the same Current, there are committed by Ingi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers
and Learned men, errours of very great moment (and I
could thereof produce examples, but for good reasons I pass
them over in silence) when they think, and propose, by deriving
new Channels from great Rivers, to diminish the measure of the
water in the River, and to diminish it proportionally, according
to the measure of the Water which they make to pass through
the Channel, as making <hi>v. g.</hi> a Channel fifty foot broad, in which
the derived water is to run waste, ten foot deep, they think they
have diminished the measure of the Water in the River five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
feet, which thing doth not indeed so fall out; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is plain; for that the Chanel being derived, the rest of the
main River, diminisheth in velocity, and therefore retains a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
measure than it had at first before the derivation of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel;
and moreover, if the Chanel being derived, it shall not
conserve the same velocity which it had at first in the main Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
but shall diminish it, it will be necessary, that it hath a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
measure than it had before in the River; and therefore
to accompt aright, there shall not be so much water derived into
the Channel, as shall diminish the River, according to the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the water in the Channel, as is pretended.</p>

                        <p>THis same consideration giveth me occasion to discover a most
ordinary errour, observed by me in the businesse of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Ferara,</hi> when I was in those parts, in service of the most
Reverend and Illustrious Monsignor <hi>Corsini;</hi> the sublime wit of
whom hath been a very great help to me in these contemplations;
its very true, I have been much perplexed, whether I should
commit this particular to paper, or passe it over in silence, for
that I have ever doubted, that the opinion so common and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96976:293"/>
moreover confirmed with a most manifest experiment, may not
onely make this my conjecture to be esteemed far from true,
but also to discredit with the World the rest of this my Treatise:
Neverthelesse I have at last resolved not to be wanting to my
self, and to truth in a matter of it self, and for other conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
most important; nor doth it seem to me requisite in
difficult matters, such as these we have in hand, to resigne our
selves to the common opinion, since it would be very strange if
the multitude in such matters should hit on the truth, nor ought
that to be held difficult, in which even the vulgar do know the
truth and right; besides that I hope morever to prove all in such
sort, that persons of solid judgment, shall rest fully perswaded,
so that they but keep in mind the principal ground and foundation
of all this Treatise; and though that which I will propose, be a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
as I have said, pertaining onely to the interests of <hi>Ferara;</hi>
yet neverthelesse from this particular Doctrine well understood,
good judgement may be made of other the like cases in general.</p>
                        <p>I say then, for greater perspecuity, and better understanding
of the whole, That about thirteen miles above <hi>Ferara,</hi> near to
<hi>Stellata,</hi> the main of <hi>Po,</hi> branching it self into two parts, with one
of its Arms it cometh close to <hi>Ferara,</hi> retaining the name of the
Po of <hi>Ferara;</hi> and here again it divideth it self into two other
branches, and that which continueth on the right hand, is called
the Po of <hi>Argenta,</hi> and of <hi>Primaro;</hi> and that on the left the Po
of <hi>Volana.</hi> But for that the bed of the Po of <hi>Ferara</hi> being here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
augmented and raised, it followeth that it resteth wholly
deprived of the Water of the great Po, except in the time of its
greater swelling; for in that case, this Po of <hi>Ferara</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
with a Bank near to <hi>Bondeno,</hi> would come also in the
overflowings of the main Po, to be free from its Waters: But the
Lords of <hi>Ferara</hi> are wont at such time as the Po threateneth to
break out, to cut the bank; by which cutting, there dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorgeth
such a Torrent of Water, that it is observed, that the
main Po in the space of some few hours abateth near a foot, and
all persons that I have spoken with hitherto, moved by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,
think that it is of great profit and benefit to keep ready
this Vent, and to make use of it in the time of its fullnesse. And
indeed, the thing considered simply, and at the first appearance,
it seemeth that none can think otherwise; the rather, for that
many examining the matter narrowly, measure that body of
Water which runneth by the Channel, or Bed of the Po of <hi>Fera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi>
and make account, that the body of the Water of the great
Po, is diminished the quantity of the body of the Water which
runneth by the Po of <hi>Ferara.</hi> But if we well remember what
hath been said in the beginning of the Treatise, and how much
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96976:294"/>
the variety of the velocities of the said Water importeth, and the
knowledge of them is necessary to conclude the true quantity of
the running Water, we shall finde it manifest, that the benefit of
this Vent is far lesse than it is generally thought: And mereover,
we shall finde, if I deceive not my self, that there follow from
thence so many mischiefs, that I could greatly incline to believe,
that it were more to the purpose wholly to stop it up, than to
maintain it open: yet I am not so wedded to my opinion, but
that I am ready to change my judgement upon strength of better
reasons; especially of one that shall have first well understood
the beginning of this my discourse, which I frequently inculcate,
because its absolutely impossible without this advertisement to
treat of these matters, and not commit very great errours.</p>
                        <p>I propose therefore to consideration, that although it be true,
that whilst the water of the main <hi>Po</hi> is at its greatest height, the
Bank and Dam then cut of the <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Ferara,</hi> and the superior
waters having a very great fall into the Channel of <hi>Ferara,</hi> they
precipitate into the same with great violence and velocity, and
with the same in the beginning, or little lesse, they run towards
the <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Volana,</hi> and of <hi>Argenta</hi> on the sea coasts; yet after the
space of some few hours, the <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Ferara</hi> being full, and the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
Waters not finding so great a diclivity there, as they had
at the beginning of the cutting, they fall not into the same with
the former velocity, but with far lesse, and thereby a great deal
lesse Water begins to issue from the great <hi>Po;</hi> and if we dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
compare the velocity at the first cutting, with the velocity
of the Water after the cutting made, and when the <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Ferara</hi>
shall be full of Water, we shall finde perhaps that to be fifteen or
twenty times greater than this, and consequently the Water
which issues from the great <hi>Po,</hi> that first impetuosity being past,
shall be onely the fifteenth or twentieth part of that which issued
at the beginning; and therefore the Waters of the main <hi>Po</hi> will
return in a small time almost to the first height. And here I will
pray those who rest not wholly satisfied with what hath been said,
that for the love of truth, and the common good, they would
please to make diligent observation whether in the time of great
Floods, the said Bank or Dam at <hi>Bondeno</hi> is cut, and that in few
hours the main <hi>Po</hi> diminisheth, as hath been said about a foot in
its height; that they would observe I say, whether, a day or two
being past, the Waters of the main <hi>Po</hi> return almost to their first
height; for if this should follow, it would be very clear, that the
benefit which resulteth from this diversion or Vent, is not so great
as is universally presumed; I say, it is not so great as is
presumed; because, though it be granted for true, that
the Waters of the main <hi>Po,</hi> abate at the beginning of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96976:294"/>
the Vent, yet this benefit happens to be but temporary and for a
few hours: If the rising of <hi>Po,</hi> and the dangers of breaking forth
were of short duration, as it ordinarily befalleth in the overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Torrents, in such a case the profit of the Vent would be
of some esteem: But because the swellings of <hi>Po</hi> continue for
thirty, or sometimes for forty dayes, therefore the gain which
results from the Vent proveth to be inconsiderable. It remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
now to consider the notable harms which follow the said
Sluice or Vent, that so reflection being made, and the profit and
the detriment compared, one may rightly judge, and choose that
which shall be most convenient. The first prejudice therefore
which ariseth from this Vent or Sluice, is; That the Channels of
<hi>Ferara, Primaro,</hi> and <hi>Volana</hi> filling with Water, all those parts
from <hi>Bondeno</hi> to the Sea side are allarmed and endangered
thereby. Secondly, The Waters of the <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Primaro</hi> having
free ingresse into the upper Valleys, they fill them to the great
damage of the Fields adjacent, and obstruct the course of the
ordinary Trenches in the same Valleys; insomuch that all the
care, cost, and labour about the draining, and freeing the upper
Valleys from Water, would also become vain and ineffectual.
Thirdly, I consider that these Waters of the <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Ferara</hi> being
passed downwards towards the Sea, at the time that the main <hi>Po</hi>
was in its greater excrescences and heights, it is manifest by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
that when the great <hi>Po</hi> diminisheth, then these Waters
passed by the <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Ferara</hi> begin to retard in their course, and
finally come to turn the current upwards towards <hi>Stellata,</hi> resting
first iu the intermediate time, almost fixed and standing, and
therefore deposing the muddinesse, they fill up the Channel of
the River or Current of <hi>Ferara.</hi> Fourthly and lastly, There
followeth from this same diversion another notable damage, and
it is like to that which followeth the breaches made by Rivers;
near to which breaches in the lower parts, namely below the
breach, there is begot in the Channel of the River, a certain ridge
or shelf, that is, the bottom of the River is raised, as is sufficiently
manifest by experience; and thus just in the same manner cutting
the Bank at <hi>Bondeno,</hi> there is at it were a breach made, from which
followeth the rising in the lower parts of the main <hi>Po,</hi> being past
the mouth of <hi>Pamaro;</hi> which thing, how pernitious it is, let any one
judge that understandeth these matters. And therefore both for
the small benefit, and so many harms that ensue from maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this diversion, I should think it were more sound advice to
keep that Bank alwaies whole at <hi>Bondeno,</hi> or in any other conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
place, and not to permit that the Water of the Grand <hi>Po</hi>
should ever come near to <hi>Ferara.</hi>

excrescencies, its observed that far from the Sea, they need
Banks of a notable height; which height goeth afterwards by
degrees diminishing, the more it approacheth to the Sea-coasts:
in such sort, that the Po, distant from the Sea about fifty or sixty
miles at <hi>Ferara,</hi> shall have Banks that be above twenty feet
higher than the ordinary Water-marks; but ten or twelve miles
from the Sea, the Banks are not twelve feet higher than the said
ordinary Water-marks, though the breadth of the River be the
same, so that the excrescence of the same Innundation happens
to be far greater in measure remote from the Sea, then near; and
yet it should seem, that the same quantity of Water passing by
every place, the River should need to have the same altitude of
Banks in all places: But we by our Principles and fundamentals
may be able to render the reason of that effect, and say; That
that excesse of quantity of Water, above the ordinary Water,
goeth alwaies acquiring greater velocity; the nearer it approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Sea, and therefore decreaseth in measure, and consequently
in height. And this perhaps might have been the cause in great
part, why the <hi>Tyber</hi> in the Innundation <hi>Anno</hi> 1578. issued not

the more they remove from the beginning of their motion, the
more they acquire of swiftnesse; and therefore the Water, as a

thought that so much difference might proceed from the negligence
of the Measures; and when afterwards with his own industry he
measured the same water at the beginning of the Aqueducts,
finding it neer 10000. <hi>Quinaries</hi> bigger than it was <hi>in Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riis</hi>
he judged, that the overplus was imbeziled by Ministers and
Partakers; which in part might be so, for it is but too true, that
the publique is almost alwayes defrauded; yet neverthelesse, I
verily believe withal, that besides the frauds of these Officers,
the velocities of the water in the place wherein <hi>Frontino</hi> measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

all those learned men, which to prevent the diversion of
the <hi>Reno</hi> of <hi>Bologna</hi> into <hi>Po</hi> by the Channels, through
which it at present runneth, judged, that the <hi>Reno</hi> being in its

1000. feet broad, they judged, I say, that letting the <hi>Reno</hi> into

rise, they concluded afterwards most exorbitant disorders, either
of extraordinary Inundations, or else of immense and intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

it is manifest, That the measure of the <hi>Reno</hi> in <hi>Reno,</hi> would
be different from the measure of <hi>Reno</hi> in <hi>Po;</hi> in case that the

be had by those which part and divide VVaters; for the
watering of fields, as is done in the Territories of <hi>Brescia, Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gama,
Crema, Pavia, Lodigiano, Cremona,</hi> and other places:
For if they have not regard to the most important point of the
variation of the velocity of the VVater, but onely to the bare
Vulgar measure, there will alwaies very great disorders and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
ensue to the persons concerned.</p>

                        <p>IT seemeth that one may observe, that whilst the Water run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
along a Channel, Current, or Conduit, its velocity is
retarded, withheld, and impeded by its touching the Bank or
side of the said Channel or Current; which, as immoveable, not
following the motion of the VVater, interrupteth its velocity:
From which particular, being true, as I believe it to be most
true, and from our considerations, we have an occasion of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
a very nice mistake, into which those commonly fall
who divide the VVaters of Fountains. VVhich division is wont
to be, by what I have seen here in <hi>Rome,</hi> performed two wayes;
The first of which is with the measures of like figures, as Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
or Squares, having cut through a Plate of metal several
Circles or Squares, one of half an inch, another of one inch,
another of two, of three, of four, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with which they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
adjust the Cocks to dispence the VVaters. The other
manner of dividing the VVaters of Fountains, is with rectangle
paralellograms, of the same height, but of different Bases, in such
sort likewise, that one paralellogram be of half an inch, another
of one, two, three, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In which manner of measuring and
dividing the Water, it should seem that the Cocks being placed
in one and the same plain, equidistant from the level, or superior
superficies of the water of the Well; and the said measures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
most exactly made, the VVater ought consequently also to
be equally divided, and parted according to the proportion of
the measures. But if we well consider every particular, we shall
finde, that the Cocks, as they successively are greater, discharge
alwaies more VVater than the just quantity, in comparison of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96976:297"/>
the lesser; that is, to speak more properly, The VVater which
passeth through the greater Cock, hath alwaies a greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to that which passeth through the lesser, than the greater
Cock hath to the lesser. All which I will declare by an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                        <p>Let there be supposed for more plainness two Squares; (the
same may be understood of Circles, and other like Figures) The
first Square is, as we will suppose, quadruple to the other, and
these Squares are the mouths of two Cocks; one of four inches,
the other of one: Now its manifest by what hath been said, that
the VVater which passeth by the less Cock, findeth its velocity
impeded in the circumference of the Cock; which impediment
is measured by the said circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
Now it is to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that if we would have the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which passeth through the
greater Cock, to be onely qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druple
to that which passeth
through the lesse, in equal spaces of time, it would be necessary,
that not onely the capacity and the measure of the greater Cock
be quadruple to the lesser Cock, but that also the impediment be
quadrupled. Now in our case it is true, That the belly and
mouth of the Cock is quadrupled, and yet the impediment is not
quadrupled, but is onely doubled, seeing that the circumference
of the greater Square, is onely double to the circumference of
the lesser Square; for the greater circumference containeth eight
of those parts, of which the lesser containeth but four, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
by the described Figure; and for that cause there shall
pass by the greater Cock, above four times as much VVater, as
shall pass by the lesser Cock.
<figure/>
                        </p>
                        <p>The like errour occurreth also in the other manner of measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

which being <hi>v. g.</hi> fourty fathom, and the Bridge being to consist
of four Arches, it sufficeth them, that the breadth of all the four
Arches taken together, be fourty fathom; not considering that
in the ordinary Channel of the River, the Water hath onely
two impediments which retard its velocity; namely, the touching
and gliding along the two sides or shores of the River: but
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96976:297"/>
the same water in passing under the Bridge, in our case meeteth
with eight of the same impediments, bearing, and thrusting upon
two sides of each Arch (to omit the impediment of the bottom,
for that it is the same in the River, and under the Bridge) from
which inadvertency sometimes follow very great disorders, as
quotidian practice shews us.</p>

                        <p>IT is also worthy to consider the great and admirable benefit
that those fields receive, which are wont to drink up the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water
with difficulty, through the height of the water in the
principal Ditches, in which case the careful Husbandman cutteth
away the reeds and rushes in the Ditches, through which the
waters pass; whereupon may be presently seen, so soon as the
reeds and rushes are cut, a notable Ebb in the level of the water
in the Ditches, insomuch that sometimes it is observed, that the
water is abated after the said cutting a third and more, of what it
was before the cutting. The which effect seemingly might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on this, That, before those weeds took up room in the
Ditch, and for that cause the water kept a higher level, and the
said Plants being afterwards cut and removed, the water came to
abate, possessing the place that before was occupied by the
weeds. Which opinion, though probable, and at first sight sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory,
is nevertheless insufficient to give the total reason of
that notable abatement which hath been spoken of: But it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to have recourse to our consideration of the velocity in
the course of the water, the chiefest and true cause of the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the measure of the same Running-Water<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>; for, that
multitudes of reeds, weeds, and plants dispersed through the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of the Ditch, do chance notably to retard the course of the
water, and therefore the measure of the water increaseth; and
those impediments removed, the same water gaineth velocity,
and therefore decreaseth in measure, and consequently in
height.</p>
                        <p>And perhaps this point well understood, may be of great
profit to the fields adjacent to the <hi>Pontine</hi> Fens, and I doubt not
but if the River <hi>Ninfa,</hi> and the other principal Brooks of those
Territories were kept well cleansed from weeds, their waters
would be at a lower level, and consequently the drains of the
fields would run into them more readily; it being alwayes to be
held for undoubted, that the measure of the water before the
cleansing, hath the same proportion to the measure after clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
that the velocity after the cleansing hath to the velocity
before the cleansing: And be cause those weeds being cleansed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96976:298"/>
away, the course ef the water notably increaseth, it is therefore
necessary that the said water abate in measure, and become
lower.</p>

in distributing the waters of Fountains, and those
that serve to water fields; it seemeth now fit, by way of
a close to this discourse, to advertise by what means these divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions

that one might two several wayes exquisitly divide the water of
Fountains; The first would be by diligently examining, First,
how much water the whole Fountain dischargeth in a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

in a set time; and in case you are afterwards to distribute
the water, distribute it at the rate of so many Barrels or Tuns, in
that same time; and in this case the participants would have
their punctual shares: Nor could it ever happen to send out more
water, than is reckoned to be in the principal Fountain; as befel
<hi>Giulio Frontino,</hi> and as also it frequently happeneth in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Aqueducts, to the publick and private detriment.</p>
                        <p>The other way of dividing the same waters of a Fountain, is
also sufficiently exact and easie, and may be, by having one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
size for the Cock or Pipe, as suppose of an inch, or of half an
inch; and when the case requireth to dispence two, three, and
more inches, take so many Cocks of the said measure as do eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate
the water, which is to be emitted; and if we are to make
use onely of one greater Cock, we being to place one to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
for example four inches; and having the former sole mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of an inch, we must make a Cock that is bigger, its true, than
the Cock of one inch; but not simply in a quadruple propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for that it would discharge more than just so much water,
as hath been said above; but we ought to examine diligently
how much water the little Cock emitteth in an hour; and then
enlarge, and contract the greater Cock, so, that it may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
four times as much water as the lesser in the same time;
and by this means we shall avoid the disorder hinted in the
seventh Appendix. It would be necessary nevertheless, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodate
the Cocks of the Cistern so, that the level of the
water in the Cistern may alwayes rest at one determinate mark
above the Cock, otherwise the Cocks will emit sometimes
greater, and sometimes lesse abundance of water: And because
it may be that the same water of the Fountain may be sometimes
more abundant, sometimes less; in such case it will be necessary
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96976:298"/>
to adjust the Cistern so, that the excess above the ordinary wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
discharge into the publick Fountains, that so the particular
participants may have alwayes the same abundance of
water.</p>

                        <p>MUch more difficult is the division of the waters which
serve to water the fields, it not being possible to observe
so commodiously, what quantity of water the whole
Ditch sends forth in one determinate time, as may be done in
Fountains: Yet nevertheless, if the second proposition by us a
little below demonstrated, be well understood, there may be
thence taken a very safe and just way to distribute such waters.
The Proposition therefore by us demonstrated is this: If there
be two Sections, (namely two mouths of Rivers) the quantity of
the water which passeth by the first, hath a proportion to that
which passeth by the second, compounded of the proportions of
the first Section to the second, and of the velocity through
the first, to the velocity through the second: As I will declare
for example by help of practice, that I may be understood by
all, in a matter so important. Let the two mouths of the
Rivers be A, and B, and let
<figure/>
the mouth A be in measure
and content thirty two feet,
and the mouth B, eight feet.
Here you must take notice,
that it is not alwayes true, that
the Water which passeth by A,
hath the same proportion to that which passeth by B, that the
mouth A hath to the mouth B; but onely when the velocityes
by each of those passages are equal: But if the velocityes shall
be unequal, it may be that the said mouths may emit equal
quantity of Water in equal times, though their measure be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal;
and it may be also, that the bigger doth discharge a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
quantity of Water: And lastly, it may be, that the less mouth
dischargeth more Water than the greater; and all this is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
by the things noted in the beginning of this discourse, and
by the said second Proposition. Now to examine the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Water that passeth by one Ditch, to that which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
by another, that this being known, the same Waters and
mouths of Ditches may be then adjusted; we are to keep ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
not onely of the greatness of the mouths or passages of the
Water, but of the velocity also; which we will do, by first find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
two numbers that have the same proportion between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96976:299"/>
as have the mouths, which are the numbers 32 and 8
in our example: Then this
<figure/>
being done, let the velocity
of the Water by the passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
A and B, be examined
(which may be done keeping
account what space a piece
of Wood, or other body that
swimmeth, is carried by the stream in one determinate time; as
for instance in 50 pulses) and then work by the golden Rule, as
the velocity by A, is to the velocity by B, so is the number 8, to
another number, which is 4. It is clear by what is demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the said second Proposition, that the quantity of water,
which passeth by the mouth A, shall have the same proportion of
that which passeth by the mouth B, that 8 hath to 1. Such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
being composed of the proportions of 32 to 8, and of 8 to
4; namely, to the greatness of the mouth A, to the greatness of the
mouth B, and of the velocity in A, to the velocity in B. This being
done, we must then contract the mouth which dischargeth more
then its just quantity of water, or enlarge the other which dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
less, as shal be most commodious in practice, which to him that
hath understood this little that hath been delivered, will be very
afie.</p>

                        <p>THese opperations about Water, as I have hitherto on sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
occasions observed, are involved in so many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and such a multiplicity of most extravagant accidents,
that it is no marvel if continually many, and very important er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
be therein committed by many, and even by Ingeneers
themselves, and Learned-men; and because many times they
concern not onely the publique, but private interests: Hence it
is, that it not onely belongeth to Artists to treat thereof, but very
oft even the vulgar themselves pretend to give their judgement
therein: And I have been troubled many times with a necessity
of treating, not onely with those, which either by practice, or
particular study, understood somewhat in these matters; but also
with people wholly void of those notions, which are necessary for
one that would on good grounds discourse about this particular;
and thus many times have met with more difficulty in the thick
skulls of men, than in precipitious Torrents, and vast Fennes.
And in particular, I had occasion some years past to go see the
Cave or Emissary of the Lake of <hi>Perugia,</hi> made many years agon
by <hi>Braccio Fortobraccio,</hi> but for that it was with great ruines by
Time decayed, and rendred unuseful, it was repaired with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96976:299"/>
truly heroicall and admirable, by Monsignor <hi>Maffei Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herino,</hi>
then Prefect for the Wayes, and now Pope. And being
necessitated, that I might be able to walk in the Cave, and for
other causes, I let down the Sluices of the said Cave, at the mouth
of the Lake: No sooner were they stopt, but a great many of the
people of the Towns and Villages coasting upon the Lake
flocking thither, began to make grievous complaints, that if those
Sluices were kept shut, not onely the Lake would want its due
Vent, but also the parts adjacent to the Lake would be over
flown to their very great detriment. And because at first appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
their motion seemed very reasonable, I found my self hard
put to it, seeing no way to perswade such a multitude, that the
prejudice which they pretended I should do them by keeping
the Sluices shut for two dayes, was absolutely insensible; and that
by keeping them open, the Lake did not ebb in the same time so
much as the thickness of a sheet of Paper: And therefore I was
necessitated to make use of the authority I had, and so followed
my business as cause required, without any regard to that Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
tumultuously assembled. Now when I am not working with
Mattock or Spade, but with the Pen and Discourse, I intend to
demonstrate clearly to those that are capable of reason, and that
have well understood the ground of this my Treatise, that the
fear was altogether vain which those people conceited. And
therefore I say, that the Emissary or Sluice of the Lake of <hi>Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi>
standing in the same manner as at present, and the water
passing thorow it with the same velocity as now; to examine
how much the Lake may abate in two days space, we ought to
consider, what proportion the superficies of the whole Lake hath
to the measure of the Section of the Emissary, and afterwards to
infer, that the velocity of the water by the Emissary or Sluice,
shall have the same proportion to the abatement of the Lake,
and to prove thorowly and clearly this discourse, I intend to
demonstrate the following Proposition.</p>
                        <p>Suppose a Vessel of any bignesse, and that it hath an Emissary
or Cock, by which it dischargeth its water. And look what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
the superficies of the
<figure/>
vessel hath to the measure of
the section of the cock, such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
shall the velocity of the
Water in the Cock have to the
abatement of the Lake. Let the
Vessel be ABCD, HILB, through which the Water runneth,
the superficies of the Water in the Vessel AD, and the section
of the Cock HL: and let the Water in the Vessel
be supposed to have falne in one determinate time from A to F.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96976:300"/>
I say that the proportion of the superficies of the Vessel AD is
in proportion to the measure of the section of the Emissary
HL, as the velocity of the Emissary or Cock to the line AF;
which is manifest, for that the Water in the Vessel moving by
the line AF; as far as F, and the whole mass of Water AG
discharging it self, and in the same time the same quantity of
Water being discharged by the section of the Emissary HL; it
is necessary by what I have demonstrated in the third Proposition,
and also explained in the beginning of this Treatise, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity
by the Emissary or Cock be in proportion to the velocity
of the abatement, as the superficies of the Vessel to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the section of the Emissary, which was to be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated.</p>
                        <p>That which hath been demonstrated in the Vessel, falls out ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
also in our Lake of <hi>Perugia,</hi> and its Emissary; and because
the immensity of the superficies of the Lake is in proportion to
the superficies of the Emissary or Sluice, as many millions to
one, as may be easily calculated; it is manifest, that such abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
shall be imperceptible, and almost nothing, in two dayes
space, nay in four or six: and all this will be true, when we
suppose that for that time there entreth no other Water into the
Lake from Ditches or Rivolets, which falling into the Lake would
render such abatement yet less.</p>
                        <p>Now we see, that it's necessary to examine such abatements
and risings, with excellent reasons, or at least, with accurate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments,
before we resolve and conclude any thing; and how
farre the vulgar are distant from a right judgement in such
matters.</p>

                        <head>APPENDIX XIII.</head>
                        <p>FOR greater confirmation of all this which I have said, I
will instance in another like case, which also I met with here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,
wherein, for that the business was not rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
many disorders, vast expences, and considerable mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
have followed. There was heretofore an Emissary or
Sluice made to drain the Waters, which from Rains, Springs, and
Rivolets fall into a Lake; to the end, the shores adjoyning on
the Lake, should be free from the overflowing of the Waters;
but because perhaps the enterprize was not well managed and
carried on, it fell out, that the Fields adjacent to the said Chanel
could not drain, but continued under water; to which disorders
a present remedy hath been used, namely, in a time convenient
to stop up the Sluice, by meanes of certain Floodgates kept on
purpose for that end; and thus abating the Level of the Water
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96976:300"/>
in the Emissary, in the space of three or four dayes, the Fields
have been haply drained. But on the other part, the proprietors
bordering on the Lake opposed this, grievously complaining, that
whilst the Floodgates are shut, and the course of the Water of
the Sluice hindered, the Lake overflowes the Lands adjacent, by
meanes of the Rivers that fell into it, to their very great damage;
and so continuing their suits, they got more of vexation than sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.
Now, being asked my opinion herein, I judged it
requisite (since the point in controversie was about the rising
and falling of the Lake) that the said abatement, when the
Floodgates are open, and increase when they are shut should be
exactly measured, and told them, that it might be easily done at
a time when no extraordinary Waters fell into the Lake, neither
of Rain, or otherwise; and the Lake was undisturbed by winds
that might drive the Water to any side, by planting neer to an
Islet, which is about the middle of the Lake, a thick post, on
which should be made the marks of the Lakes rising and falling
for two or three dayes. I would not, at that time, pawn, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
declare, my judgment, in regard I might be, by divers
accidents misled. But this I told them, that (by what I have
demonstrated, and particularly that which I have said above
touching the Lake of <hi>Perugia</hi>) I inclined greatly to think,
that these risings and fallings would prove imperceptible, and
inconsiderable; and therefore, that in case experience should
make good my reason, it would be to no purpose for them to
continue disputing and wrangling, which causeth, (according
to the Proverb) <hi>A great deal of cry,</hi> but produceth not much
<hi>Wool.</hi>

                        <p>Lastly, it importing very much to know what a Rain conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued

representing unto you some of my Considerations
made upon the Lake <hi>Thrasimeno,</hi> I say, That in times
past, being in <hi>Perugia,</hi> where we held our General
Convention, having understood that the Lake <hi>Thrasimeno,</hi> by
the great drought of many Moneths was much abated, It came
into my head, to go privately and see this novelty, both for my
particular satisfaction, as also that I might be able to relate the
whole to my Patrons, upon the certitude of my own sight of the
place. And so being come to the Emissary of the Lake, I found
that the Level of the Lakes surface was ebbed about five Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Palmes of its wonted watermark, insomuch that it was lower
than the transome of the mouth of the Emissary, by the length
of—this described line, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no Water issued out of the Lake, to the great prejudice of
all the places and villages circumjacent, in regard that the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which used to run from the said Lake turned 22 Mills, which
not going, necessitated the inhabitants of those parts to go a
dayes journey and more, to grinde upon the <hi>Tiber.</hi> Being retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to <hi>Perugia,</hi> there followed a Rain, not very great, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
and even, which lasted for the space of eight hours, or
thereabouts; and it came into my thoughts to examine, being
in <hi>Perugia,</hi> how much the Lake was increased and raised by this
Rain, supposing (as it was probable enough) that the Rain had
been universal over all the Lake; and like to that which fell in
<hi>Perugia,</hi> and to this purpose I took a Glasse formed like a Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder,
about a palme high, and half a palme broad; and having
put in water sufficient to cover the bottome of the Glasse, I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
diligently the mark of the height of the Water in the Glasse,
and afterwards exposed it to the open weather, to receive the
Raine-water, which fell into it; and I let it stand for the
space of an hour; and having observed that in that time the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was risen in the Vessel the height of the following line—,
I considered that if I had exposed to the same rain such other ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
equal to that, the Water would have risen in them all accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that measure: And thereupon concluded, that also in all
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96976:301"/>
the whole extent of the Lake, it was necessary the Water should
be raised in the space of an hour the same measure. Yet here I
considered two difficulties that might disturb and altar such an
effect, or at least render it inobserveable, which afterwards well
weighed, and resolved, left me (as I will tell you anon) in the
conclusion the more confirmed; that the Lake ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
in the space of eight hours, that the rain lasted eight
times that measure. And whilst I again exposed the Glass to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
the experiment, there came unto me an Ingeneer to talk
with me touching certain affairs of our Monastary of <hi>Perugia,</hi> and
discoursing with him, I shewed him the Glass out at my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-window,
exposed in a Court-yard; and communicated to
him my fancy, relating unto him all that I had done. But I
soon perceived that this brave fellow conceited me to be but of
a dull brain, for he smiling said unto me; Sir, you deceive
your self: I am of opinion that the Lake will not be increas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by this rain, so much as the thicknesse of<note n="*" place="margin">A Coyn of Pope <hi>Julius</hi> worth six pence.</note> 
                                 <hi>Julio.</hi>
Hearing him pronounce this his opinion with freeness and
confidence, I urged him to give me some reason for what he
said, assuring him, that I would change my judgement, when I
saw the strength of his Arguments: To which he answered, that
he had been very conversant about the Lake, and was every day
upon it, and was well assured that it was not at all increased. And
importuning him further, that he would give me some reason
for his so thinking, he proposed to my consideration the great
drought passed, and that that same rain was nothing for the
great parching: To which I answered, I believe Sir that the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the Lake, on which the rain had fallen was moistned; and
therefore saw not how its drought, which was nothing at all,
could have drunk up any part of the rain. For all this he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
in his conceit, without yielding in the least to my allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
he granted in the end (I believe in civility to me) that
my reason was plausible and good, but that in practise it could
not hold. At last to clear up all, I made one be called, and
sent him to the mouth of the Emissary of the Lake, with order
to bring me an exact account, how he found the water of the
Lake, in respect of the Transome of the Sluice. Now here,
Signore <hi>Galilaeo,</hi> I would not have you think that I had brought
the matter in hand to concern me in my honour; but believe me
(and there are witnesses of the same still living) that my messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
returning in the evening to <hi>Perugia,</hi> he brought me word,
that the water of the Lake began to run through the Cave; and
that it was risen almost a fingers breadth above the Transome:
Insomuch, that adding this measure, to that of the lowness of
the surface of the Lake, beneath the Transome before the rain,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96976:302"/>
it was manifest that the rising of the Lake caused by the rain, was
to a hair those four fingers breadth that I had judged it to be.
Two dayes after I had another bout with the Ingeneer, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to him the whole business, to which he knew not what to
answer.</p>
                              <p>Now the two difficulties which I thought of, able to impede
my conclusion, were these following: first, I considered that
it might be, that the Wind blowing from the side where the
Sluice stood, to the Lake-ward; the mole and mass of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Lake might be driven to the contrary shore; on which
the Water rising, it might be fallen at the mouth of the Emissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and so the observation might be much obscured. But this
difficulty wholly vanished by reason of the Aires great tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
which it kept at that time, for no Wind was stirring on any
side, neither whilst it rained, nor afterwards.</p>
                              <p>The second difficulty which put the rising in doubt, was, That
having observed in <hi>Florence,</hi> and elsewhere, those Ponds into
which the rain-water, falling from the house, is conveyed
through the Common-shores: And that they are not thereby
ever filled, but that they swallow all that abundance of water,
that runs into them by those conveyances which serve them with
water; insomuch that those conveyances which in time of
drought maintain the Pond, when there come new abundance
of water into the Pond, they drink it up, and swallow it: A like
effect might also fall out in the Lake, in which there being many
veins (as it is very likely) that maintain and feed the Lake; these
veins might imbibe the new addition of the Rain-water, and so
by that means annull the rising; or else diminish it in such sort, as
to render it inobservable. But this difficulty was easily resolved
by considering my Treatise of the measure of Running-Waters;
forasmuch as having demonstrated, that the abatement of a Lake
beareth the reciprocal proportion to the velocity of the Emissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which the measure of the Section of the Emissary of the Lake,
hath to the measure of the surface of the Lake: making the
calculation and account, though in gross; by supposing that its
veins were sufficiently large, and that the velocity in them were
notable in drinking up the water of the Lake; yet I found never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless,
that many weeks and moneths would be spent in drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the new-come abundance of water by the rain, so that
I rested sure, that the rising would ensue, as in effect it did.</p>
                              <p>And because many of accurate judgement, have again caused
me to question this rising, setting before me, that the Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
parched by the great drought, that had so long continued, it
might be, that that Bank of Earth which environed the brink of
the Lake, being dry, and imbibing great abundance of Water
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96976:302"/>
from the increasing Lake, would not suffer it to increase in
height: I say therefore, that if we would rightly consider this
doubt here proposed, we should, in the very consideration of it,
see it resolved; for, it being supposed that that list or border of
Banks which was to be occupied by the increase of the Lake, be
a Brace in breadth quite round the Lake, and that by reason of
its dryness it sucks in water, and that by that means this propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of water co-operates not in raising of the Lake: It is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary on the other hand, that we consider, That the
Circuit of the water of the Lake being thirty miles, as its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
held, that is to say, Ninety thousand Braces of <hi>Florence</hi>
in compass; and therefore admitting for true, that each Brace of
this Bank drink two quarts of water, and that for the spreading
it require three quarts more, we shall finde, that the whole agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
of this portion of water, which is not imployed in the raising
of the Lake, will be four hundred and fifty thousand Quarts of
water; and supposing that the Lake be sixty square miles, three
thousand Braces long, we shall finde, that to dispence the water
possest by the Bank about the Lake, above the total surface of
the Lake, it ought to be spread so thin, that one sole quart of
water may over-spread ten thousand square Braces of surface:
such a thinness, as must much exceed that of a leaf of beaten
Gold, and also less than that skin of water which covers the Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of it: and such would that be, which those men would have
substracted from the rising of the Lake: But again, in the space
of a quarter of an hour at the beginning of the rain, all that
Bank is soaked by the said rain, so that we need not for the
moistning of it, imploy a drop of that water which falleth into
the Lake. Besides we have not brought to account that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of water which runs in time of rain into the Lake, from
the steepness of the adjacent Hills and Mountains; which would
be enough to supply all our occasions: So that, neither ought
we for this reason to question our pretended rising. And this
is what hath fallen in my way touching the consideration of the
<hi>Thrasimenian</hi> Lake.</p>
                              <p>After which, perhaps somewhat rashly, wandring beyond my
bounds, I proceeded to another contemplation, which I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to you, hoping that you will receive it, as collected with
these cautions requisite in such like affairs; wherein we ought
not too positively to affirm any thing of our own heads for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
but ought to submit all to the sound and secure delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Holy Mother-Church, as I do this of mine, and all
others; most ready to change my judgement, and conform my
self alwaies to the deliberations of my Superiors. Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96976:303"/>
therefore my above-said conceit about the rising of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the glass tried before, it came into my minde, that the
forementioned rain having been very gentle, it might well be,
that if there should have faln a Rain fifty, an hundred, or a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
times greater than this, and much more intense (which
would insue as oft as those falling drops were four, five or ten
times bigger than those of the above-mentioned rain, keeping
the same number) in such a case its manifest, that in the space
of an hour the Water would rise in our Glass, two, three, and
perhaps more Yards or Braces; and consequently, if such a
Raine should fall upon a Lake, that the said Lake would
rise, according to the same rate: And likewise, if such a
Rain were universall, over the whole Terrestriall Globe, it
would necessarily, in the space of an hour, make a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of two, or three braces round about the said Globe.
And because we have from Sacred Records, that in the
time of the Deluge, it rained fourty dayes and fourty nights;
namely, for the space of 960 houres; its clear, that if the said
Rain had been ten times bigger than ours at <hi>Perugia,</hi> the rising
of the Waters above the Terrestrial Globe would reach and pass
a mile higher than the tops of the Hills and Mountains that are
upon the superficies of the Earth; and they also would concur
to increase the rise. And therefore I conclude, that the rise of
the Waters of the Deluge have a rational congruity with natural
Discourses, of which I know very well that the eternal truths of
the Divine leaves have no need; but however I think so clear an
agreement is worthy of our consideration, which gives us occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to adore and admire the greatnesse of God in his mighty
Works, in that we are sometimes able, in some sort, to measure
them by the short Standard of our Reason.</p>
                              <p>Many Lessons also may be deduced from the same Doctrine,
which I passe by, for that every man of himself may easily know
them, having once stablished this Maxime; That it is not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to pronounce any thing, of a certainty, touching the quantity
of Running Waters, by considering only the single vulgar mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the Water without the velocity; and so on the contrary,
he that computes only the velocity, without the measure, shall
commit very great errours; for treating of the measure of Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Waters, it is necessary, the water being a body, in handling
its quantity, to consider in it all the three dimensions of breadth,
depth, and length: the two first dimensions are observed by all
in the common manner, and ordinary way of measuring Running
Waters; but the third dimension of length is omitted; and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
such an oversight is committed, by reason the length of Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96976:303"/>
Water is reputed in some sense infinite, in that it never cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
to move away, and as infinite is judged incomprehensible;
and such as that there is no exact knowledge to be had thereof;
&amp; so there comes to be no account made thereof; but if we should
make strict reflection upon our consideration of the velocity of
Water, we should find, that keeping account of the same, there
is a reckoning also made of the length; forasmuch as whilst we
say, the Water of such a Spring runs with the velocity of passing
a thousand or two thousand paces an hour: this in substance is
no other than if we had said, such a Fountain dischargeth in an
hour a Water of a thousand or two thousand paces long. So
that, albeit the total length of Running water be incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
as being infinite, yet neverthelesse its rendered intelligible
by parts in its velocity. And so much sufficeth to have hinted
about this matter, hoping to impart on some other occasion other
more accurate Observations in this affair.</p>

                        <p>BEcause it will often be requisite to measure the time exactly
in the following Problems, we take that to be an excellent
way to measure the time, which was shewed me many years since
by <hi>Signore Galilaeo Galilaei,</hi> which is as followeth.</p>
                        <p>A string is to be taken three Roman feet long, to the end of
which a Bullet of Lead is to be hanged, of about two or three
ounces; and holding it by the other end, the Plummet is to be
removed from its perpendicularity a Palm, more or less, and then
let go, which will make many swings to and again, passing and
repassing the Perpendicular, before that it stay in the same: Now
it being required to measure the time that is spent in any what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
operation, those vibrations are to be numbred, that are
made whilst the work lasteth; and they shall be so many second
minutes of an hour, if so be, that the string be three Roman feet
long, but in shorter strings, the vibrations are more frequent, and
in longer, less frequent; and all this still followeth, whether the
Plummet be little or much removed from its Perpendicularity, or
whether the weight of the Lead be greater or lesser.</p>
                        <p>These things being pre-supposed, we will lay down some fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:96976:312"/>
Problems, from which we shall pass to the Notions and
questions more subtil and curious; which will also prove profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and not to be sleighted in this business of Waters.</p>

of which passing through a Regulator, is three
Palms; and the height one Palm, little more or
less, to measure what water passeth through the
Regulator in a time given.</head>
                        <p>FIrst, we are to dam up the Chanel; so that there pass not any
water below the Dam; then we must place in the side of the
Chanel, in the parts above the Regulator three, or four, or five
Bent-pipes, or Syphons, according to the quantity of the water
that runneth along the Chanel; in such sort, as that they may
drink up, or draw out of the Chanel all the water that the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
beareth (and then shall we know that the Syphons drink up
all the water, when we see that the water at the Dam doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rise higher, nor abate, but alwaies keepeth in the same Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.)
These things being prepared, taking the Instrument to
measure the time, we will examine the quantity of the water that
issueth by one of those Syphons in the space of twenty vibrations,
and the like will we do one by one with the other Syphons; and
then collecting the whole summe, we will say, that so much is
the water that passeth and runneth thorow the Regulator or
Chanel (the Dam being taken away) in the space of twenty se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
minutes of an hour; and calculating, we may easily reduce
it to hours, dayes, months, and years: And it hath fallen to my

because the two waters GC, and EC, are alike in velocity, by

                        <head type="sub">A Chanel of Water being given whose breadth exceeds not
twenty Palms, or thereabouts and whose quick height
is less than five Palms, to measure the quantity of the
Water that runneth thorow the Chanel in a time
given.</head>
                        <p>PLace in the Chanel a Regulator, and observe the quick
height in the said Regulator; then let the water be turned
away from the Chanel by a Chanellet of three or four Palms
in breadth, or thereabouts: And that being done, measure the
quantity of the water which passeth thorow the said Chanellet,
as hath been taught in the second Proposition; and at the same
time observe exactly how much the quick height shall be abated
in the greater Chanel, by means of the diversion of the Chanel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let;
and all these particulars being performed, multiply the quick
height of the greater Chanel into it self, and likewise multiply
into it self the lesser height of the said bigger Chanel, and the
lesser square being taken, from the greater, the remainder shall
have the same proportion to the whole greater square, as the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Chanellet diverted, hath to the water of the bigger
Chanel: And because the water of the Chanellet is known by
the Method said down in the first Theorem, and the terms of the
Theorem being also known, the quantity of the water which run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
thorow the bigger Chanel, shall be also known by the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Rule, which was that that was desired to be known. We
will explain the whole business by an example.</p>
                        <p>Let a Chanel be, for example, 15 Palms broad, its quick height
before its diversion by the Chanellet shall be supposed to be 24
inches; but after the diversion, let the quick height of the Chanel
be onely 22 inches. Therefore the greater height to the lesser,
is as the number 11. to 12. But the square of 11. is 121, and the
square of 12. is 144, the difference between the said lesser
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:96976:313"/>
square and the greater is 23. Therefore the diverted water, is
to the whole water, as 23. to 144: which is well near as 1 to
6<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>: and that is the proportion that the quantity of the water
which runneth through the Chanellet shall have, to all the water
that runneth thorow the great Chanel. Now if we should finde
by the Rule mentioned above in the first Proposition, that the
quantity of the water that runneth through the Chanellet, is
<hi>v. g.</hi> an hundred Barrels, in the space of 15 second minutes of
an hour, it is manifest, that the water which runneth through the
great Chanel in the said time of 35 min. sec. shall be about 600
Barrels.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The same operation performed another way.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>ANd because very often in applying the Theory to Practice
it happeneth, that all the necessary particulars in the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory
cannot so easily be put in execution; therefore we will
here add another way of performing the same Problem, if it should
chance to happen that the Chanellet could not commodiously be
diverted from the great Chanel, but that it were easier for the
water of another smaller Chanel to be brought into the greater
Chanel; which water of the smaller Chanel might be easily mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
as hath been shewen in the first Probleme; or in case that
there did fall into a greater Chanel, a lesser Chanel that might
be diverted and measured. Therefore I say in the first case, If
we would measure the quantity of the water that runneth in a
certain time thorow the greater Chanel, into which another lesser
Chanel that is measurable may be brought, we must first exactly
measure the Chanellet, and then observe the quick height of the
greater Chanel, before the introduction of the lesser; and having
brought in the said Chanellet, we must agnin find the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that the water of the Chanellet hath to all the water of the
great Chanel; for these terms of the proportion being known, as
also the quantity of the water of the Chanellet, we shall also
come to know the quantity of the water that runneth thorow
the great Chanel. It is likewise manifest, that we shall obtain
our intent, if the case were that there entered into the great
Chanel, another lesser Chanel that was measurable, and that
might be diverted.</p>

                        <p>LEt there be a River, which whilst it is low, runneth thorow
the Regulator DF, with the Quick height AB, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
let a Flood come; and then let it run with the height
DB, I say, that the quantity of the Water that is discharged
through DF, to that which dischargeth through AF, hath the
proportion compounded of the proportions of the velocity
through DF to the velocity through AF, and of the height
DB to the height AB. As the velocity through DF is to the
velocity through AF, so let the line R be to the line S; and as
the height DB is to the height AB; so let the line S be to the
<figure/>
line T. And let a Section be supposed LMN equal to the
Section DF in height and length, but let it be in velocity equal
to the Section AF. Therefore the quantity of the Water that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
through DF to that which runneth through LN, shall be
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:96976:314"/>
as the velocity through DF, to the velocity of LN, that is, to
the velocity through LN, that is, to the velocity through <hi>AF.</hi>
therefore the quantity of Water which runneth through DF,
to that which passeth through LN, shall have the proportion
that R hath to S; but the quantity of the Water that runneth

being equally swift) shall have the proportion that the Section
LN hath to the Section AF, that is, that the height BD hath to
the height BA, that is, that S hath to T. Therefore, by equal
proportion, the quantity of the Water which runneth by DF,
to that which runneth by AF, shall have the proportion of R to
T, that is, shall be compounded of the proportions of the height
DB, to the height AB; and of the velocity through DF, to
the velocity through AF. And therefore if a River increase in
quick height, the quantity of the Water that runneth after the
increase, to that which runneth before the increase, hath the

                           <p>VPon which things dependeth the reason of that which I have
said, in my second Consideration, that if by the diversion of
<hi rend="sup">59</hi>. of the Water that entereth by the Rivers into the Moor or
Fen, the Water be abated such a measure, that same shall be
only one third of its whole height; but moreover diverting the <hi rend="sup">49</hi>, it
shall abate two other thirds, a most principal point; and such,
that its not having been well understood, hath caused very great
disorders, and there would now, more than ever, follow extream
dammage, if one should put in execution the diversion of the <hi>Sile</hi>
and other Rivers; and it is manifest, that in the same manner,
wherewith it hath been demonstrated, that the quantity of the
Water increasing quadruple, the height would increase onely
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:96976:315"/>
double, and the quantity increasing nonuple, the height increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
triple; so that, by adding to units all the odde numbers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Series, the heights increase according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
progression of all the numbers, from units. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
there passing thorow a Regulator such a certain quantity of
Water in one time; adding three of those measures, the quick
height is two of those parts, which at first was one; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
to adde five of those said measures, the height is three of
those parts which at first were one; and thus adding seven, and
then nine, and then 11. and then 13, &amp;c. the heights shall be 4.
then 5, then 6. then 7, &amp;c. And for the greater facility of the
Work, we have described the following Table, of which we will
declare the use: The Table is divided into three Series or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions
of Numbers: the first Series containeth all the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

the Series of the Heights; the second containeth all the odde
numbers, beginning at an unit, and is called the Series of the

                           <p>FIrst, if we suppose the whole quick height of a River of Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Water to be divided into any number of equal parts, at
pleasure, and would abate the same one fift, by means of a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
let there be found in the Table in the Series of heights the
number 5. the denominator of the part which the River is to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
and take the number that is immediately under it in the
row of Additions, which is 9. which let be substracted from the
number 25. placed underneath the same in the row of Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
the remainder 16. signifieth that of the 25. parts of Water
that ran in the River, whilst it was 5 measures high, there do
onely run 16. parts; so that to make it abate ⅕ it is necessary to
take <hi rend="sup">925</hi> from the Water that the whole River did carry; so that
with substracting somewhat more than one third of the Water of
the River, it is abated but only one fift.</p>
                           <p>2. And thus, in the second place, if on the contrary, one would
know how much water is to be added to the said River to make
it increase one fift more in height, so as that it may run in the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:96976:315"/>
Regulator 6. of those parts high; of which it ran before but 5. let
6 be found in the row of heights, and let the number 11. stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under the same be taken and added to the number 25.
that is placed under the number 9. in the Additions, and 5. in
the heights, and you shall have 36; which is the quantity of the
water that runneth with the height of the River, when it is high
6 of those parts, whereof it was before but 5.</p>
                           <p>3. But if it should be desired, to know how much water it is
requisite to add to make the River rise so, as that it may run in
height 8. of those parts of which before it ran but 5; one
ought to take the sum of the number of the Series of Additions
standing under 8. 7. and 6, which are 15. 13. and 11. that is, 39.
and this shall be the summe that must be added to 25: So that
to make the River to run 8. of those parts in height, of which it
before did run 5, it will be necessary to add 39. of those parts,
of which the River before was 25.</p>
                           <p>4. Likewise the same Table giveth the quantity of water
that runneth from time to time through a River, that increaseth
by the addition of new water to the same in one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of its heights, the
quantity of its water be known. As for example: If we knew that
the River in one minute of an hour dischargeth 2500. of those mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of water, and runneth in height 5. parts in the Regulator, and
afterwards should see that it runneth 8 Palms high, finding in the
row of quantity the number placed under 8. which is 64. we would
say that the River heightned, carrieth of water 64. of those parts
whereof it carried before but 25; and because before it carried
2500. measures, by the Golden Rule we will say, that the River
carrieth 6400. of those measures, of which before it carried 2500.</p>
                           <p>In this progress of Nature, is one thing really curious, and that
at first sight seemeth to be somewhat Paradoxal, that we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
ordinately in the diversions and additions, with additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and diversions so unequal, the abatings do notwithstanding
alwaies prove equal, and so do the risings: And who would ever
think that a River in height, <hi>v. g.</hi> 10. Palms, running and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an hundred measures in a minute of an hour, is to abate but
one Palm, onely by the diversion of 19. of those measures; and
then again, that the business cometh to that pass, that it abateth
likewise a Palm by the diversion of three onely of those measures,
nay, by the diversion of but one measure? and yet it is most
certain: And this truth meets with so manifest proofs in experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that it is very admirable! And for the full satisfaction of
those, who not being able to comprehend subtil demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
desire to be clearly inform'd by the matters of fact, and to
see with their bobily eyes, and touch with their hands, what their
understanding and reason cannot reach unto: I will hear add
another very easie way to reduce all to an experiment, the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:96976:316"/>
which may be made in little, in great, or in very great; of
which I make use frequently, to the admiration of such as see it.</p>
                           <p>I prepared an hundred Siphons, or, if you will, bowed Pipes,
all equal; and placed them at the brim of a Vessel, wherein the
water is kept at one and the same level (whether all the Syphons
work, or but a certain number of them) the mouths by which
the water issueth being all placed in the same level, parallel to
the Horizon; but lower in level than the water in the Vessel; and
gathered all the water falling from the Syphons into another
Vessel standing lower than the former, I made it to run away
thorow a Chanel, in such manner inclined, that wanting water
from the Syphons, the said Chanel remained quite dry.</p>
                           <p>And this done, I measured the quick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> height of the Chanel
with care, and afterwards divided it exactly into 10 equal parts,
and causing 19. of those Syphons to be taken away, so that the
Chanel did not run water, save onely with 81 of those Syphons,
I again observed the quick height of the water in the same site
observed before, and found that its height was diminished pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
the tenth part of all its first height; and thus continuing to
take away 17. other Syphons, the height was likewise diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
1/10 of all its first quick height; and trying to take away 15.
Syphons, then 13, then 11, then 9, then 7, then 5, and then 3.
alwaies in these diversions, made in order as hath been said, there
ensued still an abatement of 1/10 of the whole height.</p>
                           <p>And here was one thing worthy of observation, that the water
encreasing in <hi>[or through]</hi> the Chanel, its quick height was diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in different sites of the Chanel, that is still lesser, the more
one approached to the Out-let; notwithstanding which the abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
followed in all places proportionably, that is in all its sites
the first part of the height of that site diminished: And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
the water issued from the Chanel, and dilated into a broader
course, from which likewise having divers Out-lets and Mouths;
yet nevertheless in that breadth also the quick heights successive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
varied and altered in the same proportions. Nor did I here
desist my observation, but the water being diminished, that issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Syphons, and there being but one of them left that
discharged water; I observed the quick height that it made in the
above-said sites, (the which was likewise 1/10 of all the first height)
there being added to the water of that Syphon, the water of
three other Syphons; so that all the water was of 4 Syphons,
and consequently quadruple to the first Syphon; but the quick
height was onely double, and adding five Siphons, the quick
height became triple, and with adding seven Syphons, the height
increased quadruple; and so by adding of 9. it increased quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuple,
and by adding of 11. it increased sextuple, and by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:96976:316"/>
of 13. it increased septuple, and by adding of 15. octuple,
and by adding of 17. nonuple, and lastly by adding 19. Syphons;
so that all the water was centuple to the water of one Syphon,
yet nevertheless the quick height of all this water was onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuple
to the first height conjoyned by the water that issued from
one onely Syphon.</p>
                           <p>For the more clear understanding of all which, I have made
the following Figure; in which we have the mouth A, that
maintaineth the water of the Vessel BC in the same level; though
it continually run; to the brim of the Vessel are put 25. Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phons
(and there may be many more) divided into 5 Classes,
DEFGH, and the first D, are of one onely Syphon; the second
E, of three Syphons; the third F, of five; the fourth G, of 7; the
fifth H, of 9; and one may suppose the sixth of 11, the seventh
of 13 Syphons, and so of the other Classes, all containing in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
odd numbers successively (we are content to represent in
the Figure no more but the five forenamed Classes to avoid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion)
the gathered water DEFGH, which runneth thorow
the Chanel IKL, and falleth into the out-let MNOP; and so
much sufficeth for the explanation of this experiment.</p>

caused by the diversion of the Chanel; and finding the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

let the Water of the Chanel be measured by the second Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme,
and work as above, and you shall have your desire.</p>

                           <p>ANd although it seemeth as if it might prove difficult, and
almost impossible to make use of the Regulator number, if
one be about to measure the water of some great River,
and consequently would be impossible, or at least very difficult
to reduce the Theory of the first Probleme into practice: Yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless,
I could say that such great conceits of measuring the
water of a great River, are not to come into the minds of any
but great Personages, and potent Princes; of whom it is expected
for their extraordinary concerns, that they will make these kinde
of enquiries; as if here in <hi>Italy</hi> it should be of the Rivers <hi>Tyber,
Velino, Chiana, Arno, Serchio, Adice,</hi> in which it seemeth real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
difficult to apply the Regulator, to finde exactly the quick
height of the River: But because in such like cases sometimes
it would turn to account to be at some charge, to come to the
exact and true knowledge of the quantity of water which that
River carrieth, by knowledge whereof, other greater dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bursments
might afterwards be avoided, that would oft times be
made in vain; and prevent the disgusts, which sometimes happen
amongst Princes: Upon this ground I think it will be well to
shew also the way how to make use of the Regulator in these
great Rivers; in which if we will but open our eyes, we shall meet
with good ones, and those made without great cost or labour,
which will serve our turn.</p>
                           <p>For upon such like Rivers there are Wears, or Lockes made,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:96976:317"/>
to cause the Waters to rise, and to turn them for the service of
Mills, or the like. Now in these Cases it is sufficient, that one
erect upon the two extreames of the Weare two Pilasters either
of Wood or Brick, which with the bottome of the Weare do
compose our Regulator, wherewith we may make our desired
operation, yea the Chanel it self diverted shall serve, without
making any other diversion or union. And in brief, if the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesses
be but managed by a judicious person, there may wayes
and helps be made use of, according to occasion, of which it
would be too tedious to speak, and therefore this little that hath
been hinted shall suffice.</p>

Concerning the
LAKE
OF

                  <div n="1" type="consideration">
                     <head>CONSIDERATION I.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough the principal cause be but one
onely, that in my judgment threatneth
irreparable ruine to the Lake of
<hi>Venice,</hi> in the present state in which it
now stands; Yet neverthelesse, I think
that two Heads may be considered.
And this Consideration may peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
serve us for to facilitate and explain
the opportune remedies, though not to
render the state of things absolutely unchangeable and eternal:
an enterprize impossible, and especially in that which having had
some beginning, ought likewise necessarily to have its end; or
at least to prevent the danger for many hundreds of years; and
possibly it may, in the mean time, by the mutation it self be
brought into a better condition.</p>
                     <p>I say therefore, that the present disorder may be considered
under two Heads; One is the very notable discovery of Land
that is observed at the time of low Water, the which, besides
the obstructing of Navigation in the Lake and also in the
Chanels, doth likewise threaten another mischief and disorder
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:96976:319"/>
worthy of very particular consideration, which is, That the Sun
drying up that mudde, especially in the times of hot Summers,
doth raise thence the putrified and pernicious vapours, fogs, and
exhalations that infect the Air, and may render the City unha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable.</p>
                     <p>The second Head is the great Stoppage that daily is grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Ports, especially of <hi>Venice,</hi> at <hi>Malamoco;</hi> concerning
which matters I will hint certain general points, and then
will proceed to the more particular and important affairs.</p>
                     <p>And first, I say, that I hold it altogether impossible to effect
any thing, though never so profitable, which doth not bring with
it some mischief; and therefore the good and the hurt ought to
be very well weighed, and then the lesse harmful part to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I propose to consideration, that the so notable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of Earth &amp; Mud, hath not been long observed, as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
from old persons that can remember passages for fifty
years past; which thing being true, as to me it seemeth most
true, it should appear that it could not but be good to reduce
matters to that passe that they were at formerly, (laying aside
all affection or passion that self-flattering minds have entertained
for their own conceits) or at least it shall be necessary speedily to
consult the whole.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, I hold that it is necessary to weigh, whether from the
foresaid discovery of Land, it followeth, that onely the Earth ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
as it is commonly thought by all, without dispute; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Waters are abated and faln away; or else whether it
proceedeth from both the one and other cause. And here it would
be seasonable to enquire, what share the said causes may have,
each considered apart in the foresaid effect. For, in the first
case, if the Earth have been raised, it would be necessary to
consider of taking it down, and removing it: But if the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
have failed or abated, I believe that it would be extreamly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to restore and raise them: And if both these reasons have
conspired in this effect, it will be necessary to remedy them each
apart. And I do, for my part, think, that the so notable appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Shelves at the time of low Water, proceeds principally
from the decrease and abatement of the Waters, which may
confidently be affirmed to need no other proof, in regard that the
<hi>Brent</hi> hath been actually diverted which did formerly discharge
its Water into the Lake.</p>
                     <p>As to the other point of the great Stoppage of Ports, I hold,
that all proceedeth from the violence of the Sea, which being
sometimes disturbed by windes, especially at the time of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
flowing, doth continually raise from its bottome immense
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:96976:319"/>
heaps of sand, carrying them by the tide; and force of the waves
into the Lake; it not having on its part any sttength of current
that may raise and carry them away, they sink to the bottom, and
so they choke up the Ports. And that this effect happeneth in
this manner, we have most frequent experiences thereof along the
Sea-coasts: And I have observed in <hi>Tuscany</hi> on the <hi>Roman-shores,</hi>
and in the Kingdom of of <hi>Naples,</hi> that when a river fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
into the Sea, there is alwaies seen in the Sea it self, at the place
of the rivers out-let, the resemblance, as it were, of an half-Moon,
or a great shelf of settled sand under water, much higher then the
rest of the shore, and it is called in <hi>Tuscany, il Cavallo;</hi> and here
in <hi>Venice, lo Scanto:</hi> the which cometh to be cut by the current
of the river, one while on the right side, another while on the
left, and sometimes in the midst, according as the Wind sits. And
a like effect I have observed in certain little Rillets of water,
along the Lake of <hi>Bolsena;</hi> with no other difference, save that of
small and great.</p>
                     <p>Now who so well considereth this effect, plainly seeth that it
proceeds from no other, than from the contrariety of the stream
of the River, to the <hi>impetus</hi> of the Sea-waves; seeing that
great abundance of sand which the Sea continually throws upon
the shore, cometh to be driven into the Sea by the stream of the
river; and in that place where those two impediments meet
with equal force, the sand setleth under water, and thereupon is
made that same Shelf or <hi>Cavallo;</hi> the which if the river carry
water, and that any considerable store, it shall be thereby cut
and broken; one while in one place, and another while in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
as hath been said, according as the Wind blows: And
through that Chanel it is that Vessels fall down into the Sea, and
again make to the river, as into a Port. But if the Water of
the river shall not be continual or shall be weak, in that case the
force of the Sea-Wind shall drive such a quantity of sand into
the mouth of the Port, and of the river, as shall wholly choak it
up. And hereupon there are seen along the Sea-side, very many
Lakes and Meers, which at certain times of the year abound with
waters, and the Lakes bear down that enclosure, and run into
the Sea.</p>
                     <p>Now it is necessary to make the like reflections on our Ports
of <hi>Venice, Malamocco, Bondolo,</hi> and <hi>Chiozza;</hi> which in a certain
sense are no other than Creeks, mouths, and openings of the shore
that parts the Lake from the main Sea; and therefore I hold that
if the Waters in the Lake were plentiful, they would have
strength to scowr the mouths of the Ports thorowly, &amp; with great
force; but the Water in the Lake failing, the Sea will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any opposal, bring such a drift of sand into the Ports; that if
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:96976:320"/>
it doth not wholly choke them up, it shall render them at least
unprofitable, and impossible for Barks and great Vessels.</p>
                     <p>Many other considerations might be propounded concerning
these two heads of the stoppage of the Ports, and of the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the Ouze and Mud in the Lakes, but so much shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
us to have hinted, to make way for discoursing of the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
about the oportune remedies.</p>
                     <p>Yet before that I propound my opinion, I say, That I know
very well that my proposal, at first sight, will seem absurd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient;
and therefore, as such, will perhaps be rejected by
the most: and so much the rather, for that it will prove directly
contrary to what hath hitherto been, and as I hear, is intended to
be done: And I am not so wedded to my opinions, but that I
do consider what others may judge thereof: But be it as it will,
I am obliged to speak my thoughts freely, and that being done,
I will leave it to wiser men than my s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lf; when they shall have
well considered my reasons, to judge and deliberate of the <hi>quid
agendum:</hi> And if the sentence shall go against me, I appeal to the
most equitable and inexorable Tribunal of Nature, who not
caring in the least to please either one party or another, will be
alwaies a punctual and inviolable executrix of her eternal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
against which neither humane deliberations, nor our vain
desires, shall ever have power to rebell. I added by word of
mouth that which followeth.</p>
                     <p>Though your Highness interest your self in this Noble Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and cause it to be confirmed in the<note n="*" place="margin">In <hi>Pregadi,</hi> a particular Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, the Senators of which have great Authority.</note> Senate by universal
Vote, that the Winds do not blow, that the Sea doth not fluctuate,
that the Rivers do not run; yet shall the Winds be alwaies deaf,
the Sea shall be constant in its inconstancy, and the Rivers most
obstinate: And these shall be my Judges, and to their determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
I refer my self.</p>
                     <p>By what hath been said, in my opinion, that is made very clear
and manifest, which in the beginning of this discourse I glanced
at; namely, That the whole disorder, although it be divided into
two heads, into the discovery of the Mud, and of the stoppage
Ports, yet nevertheless, by the application of one onely remedy,
and that in my esteem very easie, the whole shall be removed:
And this it is; That there be restored into the Lake as much
Water as can be possible, and in particular from the upper parts
of <hi>Venice,</hi> taking care that the Water be as free from Mud as is
possible. And that this is the true and real remedy of the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
disorders, is manifest: For in the passage that this Water
shall make thorow the Lakes, it shall of it self by degrees clear
the Chanels in sundry parts of them, according to the currents
that it shall successively acquire, and in this manner being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:96976:320"/>
thorow the Lake, it shall maintain the waters in the same,
and in the Chanels much higher, as I shall prove hereafter; a
thing that will make Navigation commodious; and that, which
moreover is of great moment in our businesse; those Shelves
of Mud which now discover themselves at the time of Low-Waters
shall be alwayes covered, so that the putrefaction of
the Air shall also be remedied.</p>
                     <p>And lastly, this abundance of Water being alwayes to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
it self into the Sea by the Ports, I do not doubt, but that
their bottomes will be scoured. And that these effects must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
Nature her self seemeth to perswade, there remaining onely
one great doubt, whether that abundance of Water that shall be
brought into the Lake may be really sufficient to make the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
rise so much as to keep the Shelves covered, and to facilitate
Navigation, which ought to be at least half a<note n="*" place="margin">A <hi>Venice</hi> Brace is 11/16 of our yard.</note> Brace, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts.
And indeed it seemeth at first sight to be impossible,
that the sole Water of the<note n="*" place="margin">A River of that name.</note> 
                        <hi>Brent</hi> let into the Lake, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed
over the same, can occasion so notable an height of water;
and the more to confirm the difficulties, one might say, reducing
the reason to calculation, that in case the <hi>Brent</hi> were 40. Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
broad, and two and an half high, and the breadth of the
Lake were 20000. Braces, it would seem necessary that the
height of the water of the <hi>Brent</hi> dilated and distended thorow
the Lake would be but onely 1/100 of a Brace in height, which is
imperceptible, and would be of no avail to our purpose; nay
more, it being very certain that the <hi>Brent</hi> runneth very muddy
and foul, this would occasion very great mischief, filling and
contracting the Lake, and for that reason this remedy ought, as
pernicious, to be totally excluded and condemned.</p>
                     <p>I here confesse that I am surprized at the forme of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as if I were in a certain manner convinced, that I dare not
adventure to say more, or open my mouth in this matter; but
the strength it self of the Argument, as being founded upon
the means of Geometrical and Arithmetical Calculation, hath
opened me the way to discover a very crafty fraud that is couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the same Argument, which fraud I will make out to any
one that hath but any insight in <hi>Geometry</hi> and <hi>Arithmetick.</hi>
And as it is impossible, that such an argument should be produced
by any but such as have tasted of these, in such affairs, most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
and most necessary Sciences; so do not I pretend to make
my self understood, save onely by such, to whom I will evince
so clearly, as that more it cannot be desired, the errour and fraud
wherein those Ancients and Moderns have been, and alwayes
are intangled, that have in any way yet handled this matter of
considering the Measure and Quantity of the Waters that move.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:96976:321"/>
And so great is the esteem that I have for that which I am now
about to say touching this particular, that I am content that all
the rest of my Discourse be rejected; provided, that that be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
understood, which I am hereafter to propose, I holding
and knowing it to be a main Principle, upon which all that is
founded that can be said either well or handsomely on this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.
The other Discourses may have an appearance of being
probable, but this hits the mark as full as can be desired, arriving
at the highest degree of certainty.</p>
                     <p>I have, seventeen years since, as I represented to the most Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene
Prince, and to the Right Honourable the President of the
Lords the Commissioners of the<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>I. Savii dell' Acque,</hi> a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Council that take care of the Lakes and other Aquatick affairs.</note> Sewers, written a Treatise of the
Measure of the waters that move, in which I Geometrically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
and declare this businesse, and they who shall have
well understood the ground of my Discourse, will rest fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with that which I am now about to propose: But that all
may become rhe more easie, I will more briefly explicate and
declare so much thereof as I have demonstrated in the Discourse,
which will suffice for our purpose: And if that should not be
enough, we have alwayes the experiment of a very easie and
cheap way to clear up the whole businesse. And moreover I
will take the boldnesse to affirm, that in case there should not for
the present any deliberation be made concerning this affair, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to my opinion; yet neverthelesse it will be, at some
time or other; or if it be not, things will grow worse and
worse.</p>
                     <p>For more clear understanding, therefore, it ought to be known,
that it being required, as it is generally used, to measure the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of a River, its breadth and its depth is taken, and these two
dimensions being multiplied together, the product is affirmed to
be the quantity of that River: As for example, if a River shall
be 100. feet broad, and 20. feet high, it will be said, that that
River is 2000 feet of Water, and so if a Ditch shall be 15. feet
broad, and 5. feet high, this same Ditch will be affirmed to be
75. feet of Water: And this manner of measuring Running
Water hath been used by the Ancients, and by Moderns, with
no other difference, save onely that some have made use of the
Foot, others of the Palme, others of the Brace, and others of
other measures.</p>
                     <p>Now because that in observing these Waters that move, I fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
found, that the same Water of the same River was in
some sites of its Chanel pretty big, and in others much lesse,
not arriving in some places to the twentieth, nor to the hundreth
part of that which it is seen to be in other places; therefore this
vulgar way of measuring the Waters that move, for that they did
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:96976:321"/>
not give me a certain and stable measure and quantity of Water,
began deservedly to be suspected by me, as difficult and defective,
being alwayes various, and the measure, on the contrary, being
to be alwayes determinate, and the same; it is therefore written,
that <hi>Pondus &amp; Pondus, Mensura &amp; Mensura, utrumque abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabile
est apud Deum,</hi> Exod. I considered that in the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
of <hi>Brescia,</hi> my native Countrey, and in other places, where
Waters are divided to overflow the Grounds, by the like way of
measuring them, there were committed grievous and most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
errours, to the great prejudice of the Publique and of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
persons, neither they that sell, nor they that buy under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the true quantity of that which is sold and bought: In
regard that the same square measure, as is accustomed in those
parts, assigned one particular person, carried to sometimes above
twice or thrice as much water, as did the same square measure as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to another. Which thing proveth to be the same incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience,
as if the measure wherewith Wine and Oil is bought
and sold, should hold twice or thrice as much Wine or Oil at one
time as at another. Now this Consideration invited my minde
and curiosity to the finding out of the true measure of Running
Waters. And in the end, by occasion of a most important bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
that I was imployed in some years since, with great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensenesse
of minde, and with the sure direction of <hi>Geometry,</hi> I
have discovered the mistake, which was, that we being upon the
businesse of taking the measure of the Waters that move, do make
use of two dimensions onely, namely, breadth and depth, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no account of the length. And yet the Water being, though
running, a Body, it is necessary in forming a conceit of its quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
in relation to another, to keep account of all the three Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions,
that is of length, breadth, and depth.</p>
                     <p>Here an objection hath been put to me, in behalf of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
way of measuring Running Waters, in opposition to what
I have above considered and proposed: and I was told, Its true,
that in measuring a Body that stands still, one ought to take all
the three Dimensions; but in measuring a Body that continually
moveth, as the Water, the case is not the same: For the length
is not to be had, the length of the water that moveth being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
as never finishing its running; and consequently is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible
by humane understanding, and therefore with reason,
nay upon necessity it cometh to be omitted.</p>
                     <p>In answer to this, I say, that in the abovesaid Discourse, two
things are to be considered distinctly; First, whether it be possible
to frame any conceit of the quantity of the Body of the Water
with two Dimensions onely. And secondly, whether this length
be to be found. As to the first, I am very certain that no man, let
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:96976:322"/>
him be never so great a Wit, can never promise to frame a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of the quantity of the Body of Water, without the third
Dimension of length: and hereupon I return to affirm, that the
vulgar Rule of measuring Running water is vain and erroneous.
This point being agreed on, I come to the second, which is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the third Dimension of length may be measured. And I say,
that if one would know the whole length of the water of a
Fountain or River, thereby to come to know the quantity of all
the Water, it would prove an impossible enterprize, nay the
knowing of it would not be useful. But if one would know how
much water a Fountain, or a River carrieth in a determinate time
of an hour, of a day, or of a moneth, &amp;c. I say, that it is a very
possible and profitable enquiry, by reason of the innumerable
benefits that may be derived thence, it much importing to know
how much Water a Chanel carrieth in a time given; and I have
demonstrated the same above in the beginning of this Book; and
of this we stand in need in the businesse of the Lake, that so we
may be able to determine how much shall be the height of the
<hi>Brent,</hi> when it is spread all over the Lake: For the three dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of a Body being given, the Body is known; and the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of a Body being given, if you have but two dimensions, the
third shall be known. And thus diving farther and farther into
this Consideration, I found that the Velocity of the course of the
water may be an hundred times greater or lesser in one part of
its Chanel than in another. And therefore although there should
be two mouths of Waters equal in bignesse; yet nevertheless it
might come to passe, that one might discharge an hundred or a
thousand times more water than another: and this would be, if
the water in one of the mouths should run with an hundred or a
thousand times greater velocity, than the other; for that it
would be the same as to say, that the swifter was an hundred or
a thousand times longer, than the slower: and in this manner I
discovered that to keep account of the velocity, was the keeping
account of the Length.</p>
                     <p>And therefore it is manifest, that when two Mouths discharge
the same quantity of Water in an equal velocity, it is necessary
that the less swift Mouth be so much bigger than the more swift;
as the more swift exceedeth in velocity the less swift; as for
example.</p>
                     <p>In case two Rivers should carry equal quantity of water in
equal times, but that one of them should be four times more
swift than the other, the more slow should of necessity be four
times more large. And because the same River in any part
thereof alwaies dischargeth the same quantity of Water in equal
times (as is demonstrated in the first Proposition of the first
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:96976:322"/>
Book<note n="*" place="margin">He here intends the Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons following, at the end of the first Book</note> of the measure of Running Waters;) but yet doth not
run thorowout with the same velocity: Hence it is, that the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
measures of the said River, in divers parts of its Chanel, are
alwaies divers; insomuch, that if a River passing through its cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
had such velocity, that it ran 100 Braces in the 1/1/60 of an hour-and
afterwards the said River should be reduced to so much tardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of motion, as that in the same time it should not run more than
one Brace, it would be necessary that that same River should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
100. times bigger in that place where it was retarded; I
mean, 100. times bigger than it was in the place where it was
swifter. And let it be kept well in mind, that this point rightly
understood, will clear the understanding to discover very many
accidents worthy to be known. But for this time let it suffice,
that we have onely declared that which makes for our purpose,
referring apprehensive and studious Wits to the perusal of my
aforenamed Treatise; for therein he shall finde profit and delight
both together.</p>
                     <p>Now applying all to our principal intent, I say, That by what
hath been declared it is manifest, that if the <hi>Brent</hi> were 40. Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
broad, and 2 1/2 high, in some one part of its Chanel, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the same Water of the <hi>Brent</hi> falling into the Lake, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
thorow the same to the Sea, it should lose so much of its ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity,
that it should run but one Brace, in the time wherein
whilst it was in its Chanel at the place aforesaid, it ran 100. Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
It would be absolutely necessary, that increasing in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
it should become an hundred times<note n="*" place="margin">Deeper.</note> thicker; and therefore
if we should suppose that the Lake were 20000. Braces, the
<hi>Brent</hi> that already hath been supposed in its Chanel 100. Braces,
being brought into the Lake, should be 100. times 100. Brates;
that is, shall be 10000. Braces in thickness, and consequently shall
be in height half a Brace; that is, 100/200 of a Brace, and not 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>/200 of a
Brace, as was concluded in the Argument.</p>
                     <p>Now one may see into what a gross errour of 99. in 100. one
may fall through the not well understanding the true quantity
of Running Water, which being well understood, doth open a
direct way to our judging aright in this most considerable affair.</p>
                     <p>And therefore admitting that wich hath been demonstrated,
I say, that I would (if it did concern me) greatly encline to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
upon the returning of the <hi>Brent</hi> again into the Lake: For it
being most evident, that the <hi>Brent</hi> in the Chanel of its mouth, is
much swifter than the <hi>Brent</hi> being brought into the Lake, it will
certainly follow thereupon, that the thickness of the Water of
<hi>Brent</hi> in the Lake, shall be so much greater than that of <hi>Brent</hi> in
<hi>Brent,</hi> by how much the <hi>Bront</hi> in <hi>Brent</hi> is swifter than thh <hi>Brent</hi>
in the Lake.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="72" facs="tcp:96976:323"/>
1. From which operation doth follow in the first place, that
the Lake being filled and increased by these Waters, shall be
more Navigable, and passible, than at present we see it to be.</p>
                     <p>2. By the current of these Waters, the Chanels will be scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and will be kept clean from time to time.</p>
                     <p>3. There will not appear at the times of low-waters so many
Shelves, and such heaps of Mud, as do now appear.</p>
                     <p>4. The Ayr will become more wholesom, for that it shall not
be so infected by putrid vapours exhaled by the Sun, so long as
the Miery Ouze shall be covered by the Waters.</p>
                     <p>5. Lastly, in the current of these advantagious Waters,, which
must issue out of the Lake into the Sea, besides those of the Tyde,
the Ports will be kept scoured, and clear: And this is as much as
I shall offer for the present, touching this weighty buisiness; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
submitting my self to sounder judgements.</p>
                     <p>Of the above-said Writing I presented a Copy at <hi>Venice,</hi> at a
full Colledge, in which I read it all, and it was hearkned to with
very great attention; and at last I presented it to the Duke, and
left some Copies thereof with sundry Senators, and went my way,
promising with all intenseness to apply my pains with reiterated
studies in the publick service; and if any other things should come
into my minde, I promised to declare them sincerely, and so took
leave of <hi>His serenity,</hi> and that Noble Council. When I was
returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> this business night and day continually run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in my mind, I hapned to think of another admirable and
most important conceit, which with effectual reasons, confirmed
by exact operations, I with the Divine assistance, made clear and
manifest; and though the thing at first sight seemed to me a most
extravagant Paradox, yet notwithstanding, having satisfied my
self of the whole business, I sent it in writing to the most Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and most Noble <hi>Signore Gio. Basadonna;</hi> who after he had
well considered my Paper, carried it to the Council; and after
that those Lords had for many months maturely considered
thereon, they in the end resolved to suspend the execution of the
diversion which they had before consulted to make of the River
<hi>Sile,</hi> and of four other Rivers, which also fall into the Lake; a
thing by me blamed in this second Paper, as most prejudicial,
and harmful. The writing spake as followeth.</p>

VENICE.</head>
                     <head>CONSIDERATION II.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F the discoursing well about the truth of
things, Most Serene Prince, were as the
carrying of Burdens, in which we see
that an hundred Horses carry a greater
weight than one Horse onely; it would
seem that one might make more account
of the opinion of many men, than of
one alone; But because that discoursing
more resembleth running, than carrying
Burdens, in which we see that one Barb alone runneth faster
than an hundred heavy-heel'd Jades; therefore I have ever more
esteemed one Conclusion well managed, and well considered by
one understanding man, although alone, than the common and
Vulgar opinions; especially, when they concern abstruce and
arduous points: Nay in such cases the opinions moulded and
framed by the most ignorant and stupid Vulgar, have been ever
suspected by me as false, for that it would be a great wonder if
in difficult matters a common capacity should hit upon that
which is handsom, good, and true. Hence I have, and do hold
in very great veneration the summe of the Government of the
most Serene, and eternal Republick of <hi>Venice;</hi> which although,
as being in nature a Common-wealth, it ought to be governed by
the greater part; yet nevertheless, in arduous affairs, it is alwaies
directed by the Grave Judgement of few, and not judged blindly
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:96976:324"/>
by the <hi>Plebeian</hi> Rout. Tis true, that he that propoundeth Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
far above the reach of common capacity, runneth a
great hazard of being very often condemned without further Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
or knowledge of the Cause; but yet for all that, the truth
is not to be deserted in most weighty affairs, but ought rather to
be explained in due place and time with all possible perspicuity;
that so being well understood, and considered, it may come after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
for the Common good to be embraced.</p>
                     <p>This which I speak in general, hath often been my fortune in
very many particulars, not onely when I have kept within the
bounds of meer speculation, but also when I have chanced to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to
Practice, and to Operations: and your Highness know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
very well what befel me the last Summer 1641. when in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to your Soveraign Command, I did in full Colledge repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
my thoughts touching the state of the Lake of <hi>Venice;</hi> for
there not being such wanting, who without so much as vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safing
to understand me, but having onely had an inkling, and
bad apprehension of my opinion, fell furiously upon me, and by
violent means both with the Pen and Press, full of Gall, did abuse
me in reward of the readiness that I had exprest to obey and
serve them: But I was above measure encouraged and pleased, to
see that those few who vouchsafed to hear me, were all either
thorowly perswaded that my opinion was well grounded, or at
least suspended their prudent verdict to more mature deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And though at the first bout I chanced to propose a thing
that was totally contrary to the most received and antiquated
opinion, and to the resolutions and consulations taken above an
hundred years ago: Moved by these things, and to satisfie also
to the promise that I had made of tendering unto them what
should farther offer it self unto me touching the same business; I
have resolved to present to the Throne of your Highness, another
Consideration of no less importance, which perhaps at first sight
will appear a stranger Paradox; but yet brought to the Test and
Touch-stone of experience, it shall prove most clear and evident.
If it shall be accounted of, so that it succeedeth to the benefit of
your Highness, I shall have obtained my desire and intent: And
if not, I shall have satisfied my self, and shall not have been
wanting to the Obligation of your most faithful Servant, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
subject.</p>
                     <p>That which I propounded in the Mouths pass, touching the
most important business of the Lake, though it did onely expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concern the point of the diversion of the Mouth of the Lake,
already made and put in execution; yet it may be understood
and applyed also to the diversion under debate, to be made of
the other five Rivers, and of the <hi>Sile</hi> in particular.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:96976:324"/>
Now touching this, I had the fortune to offer an admirable
accident that we meet with when we come to the effect, which
I verily believe will be an utter ruine to the Lake of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I say therefore, that by diverting these five Rivers that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
although their water that they discharge for the present in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lake is not all taken together 4/5 parts of what the <hi>Brent</hi>
alone did carry, yet neverthelesse the abatement of the water of
the Lake which shall ensue upon this last diversion of four parts,
which was the whole water, shall prove double to that which hath
happened by the diversion of <hi>Brent</hi> onely, although that the
<hi>Brent</hi> alone carried five parts of that water, of which the Rivers
that are to be diverted carry four: A wonder really great, and
altogether unlikely; for the reducing all this Proposition to be
understood, is as if we should say, that there being given us
three Rivers, of which the first dischargeth five parts, the second
three, and the third one, and that from the diversion of the
first, there did follow such a certain abatement or fall; from
the taking away of the second there ought to follow also so
much more abatement; And lastly, from the withdrawing of
the third the water ought to fall so much more, which is wholly
impossible: And yet it is most certain, and besides the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
that perswades me to it, which I shall explain in due
time, I can set before your eyes such an experiment as is not to
be denied by any one, although obstinate: and I will make it
plainly seen and felt, that by taking away only four parts of the
five, which shall have been taken away, the abatement proveth
double to the abatement ensuing upon the diverting first of the
five onely; which thing being true, as most certainly it is, it
will give us to understand how pernicious this diversion of five
Rivers is like to prove, if it shall be put in execution.</p>
                     <p>By this little that I have hinted, and the much that I could
say, let your Highnesse gather with what circumspection this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
ought to be managed, and with how great skill he ought
to be furnished who would behave himself well in these difficult
affairs.</p>
                     <p>I have not at this time explained the demonstration, nor have
I so much as propounded the way to make the Experiment, that
I am able to make in confirmation of what I have said, that so
by some one or others mis-apprehending the Demonstration,
and maiming the Experiment, the truth may not happen to shine
with lesse clarity than it doth, when all mists of difficulty are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved:
and if so be, no account should be made of the Reasons
by me alledged, and that men should shut their eyes against the
Experiments that without cost or charge may be made, I do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:96976:325"/>
and protest that there shall follow very great dammages
to the Fields of the main Land, and extraordinary summes
shall be expended to no purpose. The Lake undoubtedly will
become almost dry, and will prove impassible for Navigation,
with a manifest danger of corrupting the Air: And in the last
place there will unavoidably ensue the choaking and stoppage of
the Ports of <hi>Venice.</hi>

                     <p>Upon the 20th. of <hi>December,</hi> 1641. I imparted this my second
Confideration to the most Excellent <hi>Signore Basadonna,</hi> presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him with a Copy thereof amongst other Writings, which I
have thought good to insert, although they seem not to belong

                     <head>The way to examine the MUD and SAND
that entereth and remaineth in the
LAKE of VENICE.</head>
                     <opener>To the most Excellent
SIGNORE GIO. BASADONNA.</opener>
                     <p>TWo very considerable Objections have been made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
my opinion concerning the Lake of <hi>Venice:</hi> One
was that, of which I have spoken at large in my first
Consideration, namely, that the <hi>Brents</hi> having been taken out of
the Lake, cannot have been the occasion of the notable fall of
the Waters in the Lake, as I pretend, and consequently, that
the turning <hi>Brent</hi> into the Lake would be no considerable reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
in regard that the water of <hi>Brent,</hi> and the great expansion
of the Lake over which the water of <hi>Brent</hi> is to diffuse and
spread being considered, it is found that the rise proveth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible.</p>
                     <p>The second Objection was, that the <hi>Brent</hi> is very muddy, and
therefore if it should fall muddy into the Lake, the Sand would
sink and fill up the same.</p>
                     <p>Touching the first Query, enough hath been said in my first
Consideration, where I have plainly discovered the deceipt of the
Argument, and shewn its fallacy; It remaineth now to examine
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:96976:325"/>
the second: to which in the first place I say, that one of the first
things that I proposed in this affair was, that I held it impossible
to do any act, though never so beneficial, that was not also ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
by some inconvenience and mischief; and therefore
we are to consider well the profit, and the losse and prejudice;
and they both being weighed, we shall be able to choose the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
evil: Secondly, I admit it to be most true, that <hi>Brent</hi> is at some
times muddy, but it is also true, that for the greater part of the
year it is not muddy. Thirdly, I do not see nor understand
what strength this objection hath, being taken so at large, and in
general; and methinks that it is not enough to say, that the
<hi>Brent</hi> runneth muddy, and to assert that it deposeth its Muddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in the Lake, but we ought moreover to proceed to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
and shew how much this Mud is, and in what time this
choaking up of the Ports may be effected. For the Reasons are
but too apparent and particular, that conclude the ruine of the
Lake, and that in a very short time, (for mention is made of
dayes) the Waters diversion being made, and moreover we
have the circumstance of an Experiment, the state of things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
observed to have grown worse since the said diversion. And
I have demonstrated, that in case the Diversion of the <hi>Sile</hi> and
the other Rivers should be put in execution, the Lake would in a
few dayes become almost dry; and the Ports would be lost, with
other mischievous consequences. But on the other side, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
that we did grant the choaking of them, we may very
probably say, that it will not happen, save onely in the succession
of many and many Centuries of years. Nor can I think it pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
counsel to take a resolution and imbrace a Designe now, to
obtain a benefit very uncertain, and more than that, which only
shall concern those who are to come very many Ages after us,
and thereby bring a certain inconvenience upon our selves, and
upon our children that are now alive and present.</p>
                     <p>Let it be alledged therefore, (although I hold it false) that by
the diversions of the Rivers the Lake may be kept in good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
for several years to come.</p>
                     <p>But I say confidently, and hope to demonstrate it; That the
Diversions will bring the Lake, even in our dayes, to be almost
dry, and at least will leave so little water in it, that it shall cease
to be Navigable, and the Ports shall most infallibly be choaked
up. I will therefore say upon experience, in answer to this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
that it is very necessary first well to discourse, and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
to particularize and ascertain the best that may be this
point of the quantity of this sinking Mud or Sand.</p>
                     <p>Now I fear I shall make my self ridiculous to those, who mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
the things of Nature with the shallownesse of their brains
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:96976:326"/>
do think that it is absolutely impossible to make this enquiry, and
will say unto me, <hi>Quis mensus est pugillo aquas, &amp; terram palmo
ponderavit?</hi> Yet nevertheless I will propound a way whereby,
at least in gross, one may find out the same.</p>
                     <p>Take a Vessel of Cylindrical Figure, holding two barrels of
water, or thereabouts; and then fill it with the water of <hi>Brent,</hi>
at its Mouth or Fall into the Lake; but in the Lake at the time
that the <hi>Brent</hi> runneth muddy, and after it hath begun to run
muddy for eight or ten hours, to give the mud time to go as far
as S. <hi>Nicolo,</hi> to issue into the Sea; and at the same time take
another Vessel, like, and equal to the first, and fill it with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Lake towards S. <hi>Nicolo,</hi> (but take notice that this ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
ought to be made at the time when the waters go out,
and when the Sea is calm) and then, when the waters shall have
setled in the aforesaid Vessels, take out the clear water, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the quantity of Sand that remains behind, and let it be set
down, or kept in mind: And I am easily induced to think, that
that shall be a greater quantity of Sand which shall be left in the
first Vessel, than that left in the second Vessel. Afterwards
when the <hi>Brent</hi> shall come to be clear, let both the operations be
repeated, and observe the quantity of Sand in the aforesaid Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels;
for if the Sand in the first Vessel should be most, it would
be a sign, that in the revolution of a year the <hi>Brent</hi> would depose
Sand in the Lake: And in this manner one may calculate to a
small matter what proportion the Sand that entreth into the Lake,
hath to that which remains: And by that proportion one may
judge how expedient it shall be for publick benefit. And if at
several times of the year you carefully repeat the same operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or rather observations, you would come to a more exact
knowledge in this business: And it would be good to make the
said operations at those times, when the Lake is disturbed by
strong high Winds, and made muddy by its own Mud, raised by
the commotion of the Waters.</p>
                     <p>This notion would give us great light, if the same observations
should be made towards the Mouth of <hi>Lio,</hi> at such time as the
waters flow and ebb, in calm seasons; for so one should come to
know whether the waters of the Lake are more thick at the going
out, than at the entrance. I have propounded the foregoing
way of measuring Sands and Mud, to shew that we are not so
generally, and inconsiderately to pronounce any sentence, but
proceed to stricter inquiries, and then deliberate what shall be
most expedient to be done. Others may propose more exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
examinations, but this shall serve me for the present.</p>
                     <p>I will add onely, that if any one had greater curiosity (it would
be profitable to have it) in investigating more exactly the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:96976:326"/>
of the Water that entereth into the Lake, by the means that
I have shewen in the beginning of this Book: When he shall
have found the proportion of the quantity of water to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Sand or Mud, he shall come to know how much Sand the
<hi>Brent</hi> shall leave in the Lake in the space of a year. But to
perform these things, there are required persons of discretion, and
fidelity, and that are imployed by publick Order; for there
would thence result eminent benefit and profit.</p>

                           <p>IN execution of the command that you laid upon me in your
former Letters, by order from the most Serene, my Lord,
<hi>Prince Leopold;</hi> that I should speak my judgement concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the disimboguement of the River called <hi>Fiume morto,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it ought to be let into the Sea, or into <hi>Serchio;</hi> I say, that
I chanced 18. years since to be present, when the said Mouth was
opened into the Sea, and that of <hi>Serchio</hi> stopt; which work was
done to remedy the great Innundation that was made in all that
Country, and Plain of <hi>Pisa,</hi> that lyeth between the River <hi>Arno,</hi>
and the Mountains of <hi>S. Giuliano,</hi> and the River <hi>Serchio;</hi> which
Plain continued long under water, insomuch that not onely in the
Winter, but also for a great part of the Summer, those fields
were overflowed; and when that the Mouth of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> was
effectually opened into the Sea, the place was presently freed from
the waters. and drained, to the great satisfaction of the Owners
of those Grounds. And here I judge it worth your notice, that
for the generality of those that possess estates in those parts, they
desired that the Mouth of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> might stand open to the
Sea, and those who would have it open into <hi>Serchio,</hi> are persons
that have no other concernment there, save the hopes of gaining
by having the dispose of Commissions, and the like, &amp;c,</p>
                           <p>But for the more plain understanding of that which is to be
said, it must be known, That the resolution of opening the said
Mouth into <hi>Serchio,</hi> was taken in the time of the Great Duke
<hi>Ferdinando</hi> the first, upon the same motives that are at this time
again proposed, as your Letters tell me, Since that, it manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appearing, that <hi>Fiume morto</hi> had, and hath its Mouth open to
the Sea, the Plain hath been kept dry; and it being also true, that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:96976:327"/>
the fury of the South, and South-West-Winds carryed such
abundance of sand into the Mouth, or Out-let of <hi>Fiume morto,</hi>
that it wholly stopt it up: especially when the waters on <hi>Pisa</hi>
side were low and shallow, And they think, that turning the
Lake of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> into <hi>Serchio,</hi> and the <hi>Serchio</hi> maintaining
continually its own Mouth with the force of its waters open to the
Sea, and consequently also <hi>Fiume morto,</hi> they would have had the
Out-let clear and open; and in this manner they think, that the
Plain of <hi>Pisa</hi> would have been freed from the waters. The bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
passeth for current, at first sight; but experience proveth
the contrary, and Reason confirmeth the same: For the height
of the water of those Plains, was regulated by the height of the
waters in the Mouth of <hi>Fiume morto;</hi> that is, The waters at the
Mouth being high, the waters also do rise in the fields; and when
the waters at the Mouth are low, the waters of the fields do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
abate: Nor is it enough to say, That the Out-let or Vent
of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> is continual, but it must be very low: Now if
<hi>Fiume morto</hi> did determine in <hi>Serchio,</hi> it is manifest that it
would determine high; for <hi>Serchio</hi> terminating in the Sea, when
ever it more and more aboundeth with water, and riseth, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
that also <hi>Fiume morto</hi> hath its level higher, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
shall keep the waters in the Plains higher. Nay, it hath
happened sometimes (and I speak it upon my own sight) that
<hi>Fiume morto</hi> hath reversed its course upwards towards <hi>Pisa;</hi>
which case will ever happen, whensoever the <hi>Pisan</hi> waters chance
to be lower than the level of those of <hi>Serchio;</hi> for in that case
the waters of <hi>Serchio</hi> return back upon the Plains thorow <hi>Fiume
morto</hi> in such sort, that the Muddinesses, and the <hi>Serchio</hi> have
been observed to be carried by this return as farr as the Walls of
<hi>Pisa;</hi> and then before such time as so great waters can be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaged,
which come in with great fury, and go out by little and
little, there do pass very many days, and moneths, nay some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
one being never able to find the waters of <hi>Serchio,</hi>
when at the shallowest, so low as the Sea in level; (which is the
lowest place of the waters) it thence doth follow, that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> should never at any time of the year, so long
as they determine in <hi>Serchio,</hi> be so low, as they come to be when
the same <hi>Fiume morto</hi> determineth in the Sea. Tis true indeed,
that the Mouth of <hi>Fiume morto,</hi> opened into the Sea, is subject to
the inconvenience of being stopt up by the force of Winds: But
in this case, it is necessary to take some pains in opening it; which
may easily be done, by cutting that Sand a little which stayeth
in the Mouth, after that the Wind is laid; and it is enough if you
make a Trench little more than two Palms in breadth; for the
water once beginning to run into it, it will in a few hours carry
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:96976:327"/>
that Sand away with it, and there will ensue a deep and broad
Trench that will drain away all the water of the Plains in very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
time. And I have found by practice, that there having been
a great quantity of Sand driven back, by the fury of the South-West-Wind,
into the Mouth of <hi>Fiume morto,</hi> I having caused the
little gutter to be made in the Morning, somewhat before Noon,
a Mouth hath been opened of 40. Braces wide, and notably deep,
insomuch that the water, which before had incommoded all the
Champian ran away in less than three dayes, and left the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
free and dry, to the admiration of all men. There was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
upon the place, at this business, on the same day that I
opened the Mouth, the most Serene great Duke, the most Serene
Arch-Dutchess Mother, all the Commissioners of Sewers, with
many other Persons and Peasants of those parts; and they all saw
very well, that it was never possible that a little Bark of eight
Oars, which was come from <hi>Legorn</hi> to wait upon the great
Duke, should ever be able to master the Current, and to make
up into <hi>Fiume morto;</hi> and his Highness, who came with an intent
to cause the said Mouth towards the Sea to be stopt; and that
into <hi>Serchio</hi> to be opened, changed his judgement, giving order
that it should be left open towards the Sea, as it was done. And
if at this day it shall return into <hi>Serchio,</hi> I am very certain that it
will be necessary to open it again into the Sea. And there was
also charge and order given to a person appointed for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that he should take care to open the said Mouth, as hath
been said upon occasion. And thus things have succeeded very
well unto this very time. But from the middle of <hi>October,</hi> until
this first of <hi>February,</hi> there having continued high South, and
South-West-Winds, with frequent and abundant Rains; it is no
wonder that some innundation hath happened; but yet I will
affirm, that greater mischiefs would have followed, if the Mouth
had been opened into <hi>Serchio.</hi> This which I have hitherto said,
is very clear and intelligible to all such as have but competent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight,
and indifferent skill in these affairs. But that which I am
now about to propose farther, will, I am very certain, be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by your self, but it will seem strange and unlikely to many
others. The point is, that I say, That by raising the level of
<hi>Fiume morto,</hi> one half Brace, onely at its Mouth, (it will peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitrate
into <hi>Serchio</hi> farther than it would into the Sea) it shall
cause the waters to rise three, or perhaps more Braces upon the
fields towards <hi>Pisa,</hi> and still more by degrees as they shall recede
farther from the Sea-side; and thus there will follow very great
Innundations, and considerable mischiefs. And to know that
this is true, you are to take notice of an accident, which I give
warning of in my discourse of the Measure of Running Waters:
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:96976:328"/>
where also I give the reason thereof,<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 1.</note> 
                              <hi>Coroll.</hi> 14. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
is this, That there coming a Land-Flood, for example,
into <hi>Arno,</hi> which maketh it to rise above its ordinary Mouth
within <hi>Pisa,</hi> or a little above or below the City six or seven Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
this same height becometh alwaies lesser and lesser, the more
we approach towards the Sea-side; insomuch, that near to the
Sea the said River shall be raised hardly half a Brace: Whence
it followeth of necessary consequence, that should I again be at
the Sea-side, and knowing nothing of what hapneth, should see
the River <hi>Arno</hi> raised by the accession of a Land-flood, one third
of a Brace; I could certainly infer, that the same River was raised
in <hi>Pisa</hi> those same six or seven Braces. And that which I say of
<hi>Arno,</hi> is true of all Rivers that fall into the Sea. Which thing
being true, it is necessary to make great account of every small
rising, that <hi>Fiume morto</hi> maketh towards the Sea-side by fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
into <hi>Serchio.</hi> For although the rising of <hi>Fiume morto,</hi> by
being to disgorge its Waters into <hi>Serchio,</hi> towards the Sea, were
onely a quarter of a Brace; we might very well be sure, that farr
from the Sea, about <hi>Pisa,</hi> and upon those fields the rise shall be
much greater, and shall become two or three Braces: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Countrey lyeth low, that same <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ise will cause a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Innundation of the Plains, like as it did before; I caused the
Mouth to be opened into the Sea. And therefore I conclude
that the Mouth of <hi>Fiume morto,</hi> ought by no means to be opened
into <hi>Serchio;</hi> but ought to be continued into the Sea, using all
diligence to keep it open after the manner aforesaid, so soon as
ever the Wind shall be laid. And if they shall do otherwise, I
confidently affirm, that there will daily follow greater damages;
not onely in the Plains, but also in the wholesomness of the
Air; as hath been seen in times past. And again, It ought with
all care to be procured, that no waters do by any means run or
fall from the Trench of <hi>Libra,</hi> into the Plain of <hi>Pisa,</hi> for these
Waters being to discharge into <hi>Fiume morto,</hi> they maintain it
much higher than is imagined, according to that which I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
in my consideration upon the state of the Lake of
<hi>Venice.</hi> I have said but little, but I speak to you, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth
much, and I submit all to the most refined judgment of
our most Serene Prince <hi>Leopold,</hi> whose hands I beseech you in all
humility to kiss in my name, and implore the continuance of his
Princely favour to me; and so desiring your prayers to God for
me, I take my leave.</p>

                           <head>The answer to a Letter written by BAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOLOTTI,
touching the
difficultyes observed.</head>
                           <p>
                              <hi>The former part of the Letter is omitted, and the discourse
beginneth at the first Head.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>ANd first I say, Whereas I suppose that the level of the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chio</hi>
is higher than that of <hi>Fiume morto;</hi> this is most true,
at such time as the waters of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> are discharged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Sea; but I did never say that things could never be brought
to that pass, as that the level of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> should be higher than
<hi>Serchio:</hi> and so I grant that it will follow, that the waters of
<hi>Fiume morto</hi> shall go into <hi>Serchio,</hi> and its very possible, that the
Drain of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> into <hi>Serchio</hi> may be continuate; and I far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
grant, that its possible, that the <hi>Serchio</hi> doth never disgorge
thorow <hi>Fiume morto</hi> towards <hi>Pisa;</hi> Nay, I will yet farther grant
that it might have happened, that <hi>Fiume morto</hi> might have had
such a fall into <hi>Serchio,</hi> as would have sufficed to have turned
Mills: But then I add withall, that the Plains of <hi>Pisa,</hi> and the
City it self must be a meer Lake.</p>
                           <p>2. <hi>Signore Bartolotti</hi> saith confidently, that when the Sea swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
by the South-West, or other Winds, the level of <hi>Serchio</hi> in
the place marked A in the Platt, distant about 200. Braces, riseth
very little: But that <hi>Fiume morto</hi> in D, and in E, many miles
more up into Land riseth very much, and that certain Fishermen
confirm this, and shew him the signes of the rising of the Water.
I grant it to be very true, and I have seen it with my own eyes:
But this cometh to pass, when the Mouth of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> is stopt
up by the Sea; as I shall shew by and by. And this rising near
the Sea-side, is of no considerable prejudice to the fields. And
this is as much as I find to be true in the assertion of <hi>Signore Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolotti,</hi>
(without his confirming it by any other proof; as indeed
it needs none) That the level of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> riseth in E, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
miles farther upwards it riseth much; nor did I ever affirm the
contrary.</p>
                           <p>3. Concerning the difficulty of opening the Mouth of <hi>Fiume
morto</hi> into the Sea, that which <hi>Il Castellano</hi> saith is most certain;
namely, That at the entrance upon the opening of the Mouth, it
is necessary to make a deep Trench: But I say, that at that time
it is difficult to open it, unless upon great occasions; for that the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:96976:329"/>
difficulty proceedeth from the waters of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> being low,
and the fields drained.</p>
                           <p>4. As to the particular of the Causes that you tell me men
press so much unto the most <hi>Serene Grand Duke,</hi> and to the
Prince, I have not much to say, because it is not my profession;
nor have I considered of the same: Yet I believe, that when the
Prince and his Highnesse see the benefit of his People and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in one scale of the Ballance, and the accomodation of
Huntsmen in the other, his Highnesse will incline to the profit
of his subjects; such have I alwayes found his Clemency and
Noblenesse of minde. But if I were to put in my vote upon
this businesse, I would say, that the points of Spears, and the
mouths of Guns; the yelping of Dogs, the wilynesse of Hunts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who run thorow and narrowly search all those Woods,
Thickets and Heathes, are the true destroyers of Bucks and
Boares, and not a little Salt-water, which setleth at last in some
low places, and spreadeth not very far. Yet neverthelesse, I will
not enter upon any such point, but confine my self solely to the
businesse before me.</p>
                           <p>5. That Experiment of joyning together the water of <hi>Fiume
morto,</hi> and that of <hi>Serchio</hi> by a little trench to see what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
the Level E hath upon the Level I, doth not give me full
satisfaction, taken so particularly, for it may come to passe, that
sometimes E may be higher, and sometimes A lower, and I do
not question but that when <hi>Serchio</hi> is low, and <hi>Fiume morto</hi> full
of Water, the level of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> will be higher than that of
<hi>Serchio.</hi> But <hi>Serchio</hi> being full, and <hi>Fiume morto</hi> scant of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the contrary will follow, if the Mouth shall be opened to
the Sea. And here it should seem to me, that it ought to be
considered, that there is as much advantage from E to the Sea
through the little Trench opened anew into <hi>Serchio,</hi> as from E to
the Sea by the Mouth of <hi>Fiume morto.</hi> But the difficulty (which
is that we are to regard in our case) is, that the course of the
Waters thorow the Trench is three times longer than the course
of the Mouth of <hi>Fiume morto,</hi> as appeareth by the Draught or
Plat which you sent me, which I know to be very exactly drawn,
for that the situation of those places are fresh in my memory.
Here I must give notice, that the waters of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
thorow the Trench in <hi>Serchio</hi> (the waters of which <hi>Fiume
morto</hi> are, for certain, never so low as the Sea) their pendency or
declivity shall, for two causes, be lesse than the pendency of those
waters through the Mouth towards the Sea, that is, because of
the length of the line through the Trench, and because of the
height of their entrance into <hi>Serchio,</hi> a thing which is of very
great import in discharging the waters which come suddenly, as
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:96976:329"/>
he shall plainly see, who shall have understood my Book of the
Measure of Running Waters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this was the Reason why all
the Countrey did grow dry upon the opening of the Mouth into
the Sea. And here I propose to consideration that which the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants
about <hi>Pisa</hi> relate, namely, That the Water in the Fields
doth no considerable harm by continuing there five or six, yea, or
eight dayes. And therefore the work of the Countrey is to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
the Mouth of <hi>Fiume morto,</hi> in such manner, that the Water
being come, they may have the Trench free and ready, when that
the Water cometh it may have a free drain, and may not stay
there above eight or nine dayes, for then the overflowings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
hurtful. It is to be desired also, that if any Proposition is
produced touching these affairs, it might be propounded the most
distinctly that may be possible, and not consist in generals, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when the Dispute is of the risings, of velocity, of tardity,
of much and little water; things that are all to be specified by
measures.</p>
                           <p>6. Your Letter saith, in the next place, that <hi>Signore Barto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotti</hi>
confesseth, that if the Mouth of the <hi>Fiume morto</hi> might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
be kept open, it would be better to let it continue as it is:
the which, that I may not yield to him in courtesie, I confesse,
for the keeping it stopt on all sides would be a thing most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious.
But admitting of his confession I again reply, that <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ume
morto</hi> ought not to be let into <hi>Serchio,</hi> but immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Sea; because although sometimes the Mouth to sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
be stopt up, yet for all that, the raising of the Bank above
the Plains (which is all the businesse of importance) shall be ever
lesser, if we make use of the Mouth leading to the Sea, than u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
that of <hi>Serchio.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>7. I will not omit to mention a kinde of scruple that I have
concerning the position of <hi>Sign. Bartolotti,</hi> that is, where he saith
that the two Mouths A and D are equal to the like Mouths into
the Sea; Now it seems to me, that the Mouth A of <hi>Fiume morto</hi>
into <hi>Serchio</hi> is absolutely within <hi>Serchio,</hi> nor can it be made low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and is regulated by the height of <hi>Serchio:</hi> But the Mouth
of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> terminates, and ought to be understood to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
in the Sea it self, the lowest place. And this I believe
was very well perceived by <hi>Sig. Bartolotti,</hi> but I cannot tell why
he past it over without declaring it: and we see not that the
Mouth D falleth far from the Sea, which Mouth ought to be let
into the Sea it self, and so the advantage of the Mouth into the
Sea more clearly appeareth.</p>
                           <p>8. That which <hi>Sig. Bartolotti</hi> addeth, that when it is high
Waters, at such time as the Waters are out, and when Winds
choak up <hi>Fiume morto,</hi> they not only retard it, but return the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:96976:330"/>
course of the Waters upwards very leasurely, perswadeth me
more readily to believe that <hi>Sig. Bartolotti</hi> knoweth very well,
that the Mouth of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> let into <hi>Serchio</hi> is hurtful: for
by this he acknowledgeth that the Mouth towards the Sea doth
in such sort drain the Countrey of the Waters, as that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
very low; and therefore upon every little <hi>impetus</hi> the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
turn their course: And from the motions, being exceeding
slow, is inferred, that the abundance of Sea-water that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
into <hi>Fiume morto,</hi> is so much as is believed, and as <hi>Sig. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolotti</hi>
affirmeth.</p>
                           <p>9. After that <hi>Sig. Bartolotti</hi> hath said what he promiseth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
namely, that when the Windes blowing strongly do stop
up <hi>Fiume morto,</hi> and not onely retard but turn the course up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
the time being Rainy, and the Mouth of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> shut
up, the Waves of the Sea passe over the Bank of <hi>Fiume morto;</hi> at
that time, saith <hi>Signore Bartolotti,</hi> the Champain shall know the
benefit of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> discharged into <hi>Serchio,</hi> and the mouth A
shall stand alwayes open; and <hi>Fiume morto</hi> may alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
run out, as also the Rains and Rain-waters, although the
hurtful Tempest should last many dayes, &amp;c. And I reply, that
all the Art consists in this; for the benefit of those Fields doth
not depend on, or consist in saying, that <hi>Fiume morto</hi> is alwayes
open, and <hi>Fiume morto</hi> draineth continually; But all the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of profit lyeth and consisteth in maintaining the Waters
low in those Plaines, and those Ditches, which shall never be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
whilst the World stands, if you let <hi>Fiume morto</hi> into <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chio;</hi>
but yet it may, by opening the mouth into the Sea: and
so much reason and nature proveth, and (which importeth) Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
confirmeth.</p>
                           <p>10. In the tenth place I come to consider the answer that
was made to another Proposition in the Letter which I writ to
Father <hi>Francesco,</hi> which prudently of it self alone might serve
to clear this whole businesse. I said in my Letter, That great
account is to be made of every small rising and ebbing of the
Waters neer to the Sea in <hi>Fiume morto,</hi> for that these risings and
fallings, although that they be small neer to the Sea-side, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse,
they operate and are accompanied by notable risings
and fallings within Land, and far from the Sea-side, and I have
declared by an example of <hi>Arno,</hi> in which a Land-flood falling,
that made it increase above its ordinary height within <hi>Pisa</hi> six or
seven Braces, that this height of the same Flood becometh still
lesser, the neerer we approach to the Sea-coasts. Nor shall the
said River be raised hardly half a Brace; whereupon it necess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
followeth, that if I should return to the Sea-side, and not
knowing any think of that which happeneth at <hi>Pisa,</hi> and seeing
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:96976:330"/>
the River <hi>Arno</hi> raised by a Land-flood half a Brace, I might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
affirm the said River to be raised in <hi>Pisa</hi> those six or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Braces, &amp;c. From such like accidents I conclude in the same
Letter, that it is necessary to make great account of every little
rise that <hi>Fiume morto</hi> shall make towards the Sea. Now cometh
<hi>Bartolotti</hi> (and perhaps because I knew not how to express my
self better, understandeth not my Proposition) and speaketh that
which indeed is true, but yet besides our case: Nor have I ever
said the contrary; and withall doth not apply it to his purpose.
Nay I say, that if he had well applyed it, this alone had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to have made him change his opinion. And because he saith,
that I said, that it is true, when the abatement proceedeth from
some cause above, as namely by Rain, or opening of Lakes;
But when the cause is from below, that is, by some stop, as for
instance some Fishers Wears or Locks; or some impediment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from the Sea, although at the Level it shall rise some Braces
where the impediment is, yet that rising shall go upwards; and
here he finisheth his Discourse, and concludeth not any thing
more. To which I say first, that I have also said the same in the
Proposition, namely, that a Flood coming (which maketh <hi>Arno</hi>
to rise in <hi>Pisa</hi> six or seven Braces (which I take to be a superiour
cause whether it be Rain or the opening of Lakes, as best plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
<hi>Bartolotti</hi>) in such a case I say, and in no other (for towards
the Sea-coasts it shall not cause a rising of full half a Brace; and
therefore seeing <hi>Arno</hi> at the Sea-side to be raised by a Flood, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Rain, or of opening of Lakes half a Brace) it may be
inferred, that at <hi>Pisa</hi> it shall be raised those six or seven Braces;
which variety, well considered, explaineth all this affair in favour
of my opinion: For the rising that is made by the impediment
placed below, of Fishing Weares and Locks, operateth at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
raising the Waters that are neer to the impediment;
and afterwards less and less, as we retire upwards from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment:
provided yet that we speak not of a Flood that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
by accession, but onely of the ordinary Water impeded.
But there being a new accession, as in our case, then the Water
of the Flood, I say, shall make a greater rising in the parts superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
far from the impediment; and these impediments shall
come to be those that shall overflow the Plains, as happened
eighteen or nineteen years ago, before the opening of <hi>Fiume
morto</hi> into the Sea, The same will certainly follow, if <hi>Fiume
morto</hi> be let into <hi>Serchio.</hi> Here I could alledge a very pretty
case that befell me in <hi>la</hi>
                              <note n="*" place="margin">The Countrey or Province lying round the City heretofore called <hi>Latium<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Fen they fell more than fifteen Palmes. But the businesse
would be long, and not so easily to be declared, and I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that <hi>Sig. Bartolotti</hi> having considered this, would alter his
judgment, and withall would know that remitting that impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
anew, which I had left for lesse than three <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Sea, the Waters in the Fen would return with the first Floods
and Raines to the same height as before, as likewise <hi>Fiume morto</hi>
will do if it shall be let again into <hi>Serchio.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Here I intreat your Honour to do me the favour to importune
<hi>P. Francesco</hi> in my behalf, that he would be pleased to deelare
my meaning in the aforesaid Letter to <hi>Sig. Bartolotti,</hi> for I hope
that if he will understand this point, he will be no longer so te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious
in his opinion.</p>
                           <p>Next that these Lords in the Commission of Sewers, with the
Right Honourable the Marquesse of S. <hi>Angelo,</hi> and your Honour
do approve of my judgment, doth very much rejoyce me; but
because that I know that they do it not in design to complement
me, but onely to serve his Highness our Grand Duke, I freely
profess that I will pretend no farther obligations from them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
than I account my self to owe to those whose opinions are
contrary to mine, for that I know that they have the same end.
The definitive sentence of this whole business is, that they give
these Plains, these Draines, and these Waters farre fetcht ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations.</p>
                           <p>11. As to the quantity of the Water that <hi>Fiume morto</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth
into the Sea, there are very great disputes about it, and
I have been present at some of them. But let your Honour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me, that as this is not continual, but only during a few
dayes, so it will never be of any great prejudice to these Fields;
and if your Lordship would be ascertained thereof, you may
please to go to <hi>Fiume morto</hi> at about a mile's distance from the
Sea, in the time of these strong Windes, and observe the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from thence upwards, for you shall finde it extream slow,
and consequently will know that the quantity of the Water that
is repuls'd is very small. And this seems to be contradicted by the
rule of Risings proceeding from causes below, which occasion no
considerable alteration far from the Sea.</p>
                           <p>I am necessitated to go to morrow out of <hi>Rome</hi> with his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
Cardinal <hi>Gaetano</hi> about certain affairs touching Waters,
therefore I shall not farther inlarge, but for a close to this tedious
Discourse, I conclude in few words, that <hi>Fiume morto</hi> is by no
means to be let into <hi>Serchio,</hi> nor are there any means intermedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
courses to be taken, for they will alwayes be prejudicial; but
<hi>Fiume morto</hi> is to be discharged immediately into the Sea. When
it is stopt up by the fury of the Sea-waves, I affirm that it is a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:96976:331"/>
sign that there is no need of opening it; and if there be any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to open it, it is easily done. As for the rest your Lordship
may please to keep account of all the particulars that occur, for
the memory of things past is our Tutresse in those that are to
come. If occasion shall offer, I intreat you to bow humbly in
my name to His Highness the Grand Duke, and the most Serene
Prince <hi>Leopold;</hi> and to attend the service of Their Highnesses, for
you serve <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Vpon this occasion I will here insert a Discourse that I made
upon the Draining and improvement of the <hi>Pontine Fens,</hi>
for that I think that whatsoever may be done well and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in this matter hath absolute dependance on the perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of that so important Proposition, by me demonstrated and
explained in my Treatise of the <hi>Mensuration</hi> of <hi>Running Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
namely, That the same water of a River doth continually
change Measures, according as it altereth and changeth the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity
of its course; so that the measure of the thicknesse of a
River in one Site, to the measure of the same River in another
Site, hath the same proportion reciprocally that the velocity in
this site hath to the velocity in the first site. And this is a Truth
so constant and unchangeable, that it altereth not in the least
point on any occurrences of the Water that change: and
being well understood, it openeth the way to the knowledge of
sundry advertisements in these matters, which are all resolved by
this sole Principle; and from it are derived very considerable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits;
and without these it is impossible to do any thing with
absolute perfection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongst the enterprizes by me esteemed, if not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
impossible,, at least exceeding difficult,
one was that famous one of Draining the <hi>Pontine
Fenns;</hi> and therefore I was thorowly resolved
never to apply my minde thereunto, although
by my Patrons I should be commanded to the
same: accounting that it was an occasion rather of losing repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
by the miscarriage of the attempt, than of gaining fame by
reducing things to a better pass then they now are at. Yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless,
having of late years observed the place, and sailed through
those Chanels, and those Waters; after I had made some reflection
thereupon, I thought that the enterprize was not so difficult as
I had at first conceited it to be; and I am the more confirmed in
this opinion, upon the inducement of that which I have written
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:96976:333"/>
Geometrically in my Treatise of the Mensuration of Running
Waters; so that talking with several persons, I adventured to
affirm, in discoures, that this improvement might possibly be
brought into a good estate.</p>
                     <p>Now I have resolved to set down my thoughts in writing, and
to honour this my Paper with the Noble Name of your Lordship,
to render it the more credible and conspi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>uous at the first view,
if it should chance that the Subject I treat of, were not of such
moment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as that it did deserve to be valued for any other reason.
Pardon me, Sir, if I have been too bold, and continue me in the
number of your Servants.</p>
                     <p>The enterprize of Draining a great part of the Territories of
the <hi>Pontine Fenns,</hi> hath been undertaken both in the time of
the antient <hi>Romans,</hi> and last of all, in our days; yea in the late
times by <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. I do not doubt in the least, but that it will
be possible yet to reduce things to a very good pass; and if I be not
mistaken, with a very small charge in comparison of the profit that
would be received from those rich Grounds. This improvement
was of great expence in the time of <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
the thing was not rightly understood, there were made many
Drains; a great part of which were unprofitable and vain: and
amongst so many operations, there hapned some to be made that
succeeded, as was desired; but not being understood, they were
held in no account; and thus the business being neglected, the
waters are returned into the same state as they were at first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the improvement. Here I have by familiar discourses
with my friends, explained this enterprize undertaken by <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
V. and haply also by some more antient, with the example of
the Fable of <hi>Orilo,</hi> in <hi>Ariosto.</hi> This Monster was made up with
such enchantment, that men fought with him alwayes in vain;
for though in the Combate he were cut in pieces, those divided
Members presently re-united, and returned to the fight more
fierce then ever. But the <hi>Paladine Astolfo</hi> coming to undertake
him, after a long dispute, at the end he cut his head sheer off
from the shoulders at one blow; and nimbly alighting from his
Horse, took the Monstrous head, and mounting again, as he rid
away he fell to shave the Pole of that Monster, and so he lost
the Lock of Hair, in which alone the enchantment lay; and then
the horrible Head in an instant manifested signs of death, and the
trunk which ran, seeking to reunite to it anew, gave the last gasp,
and in this manner the enchantment ended. The Book of Fate
served admirably to the <hi>Paladine,</hi> whereby he came to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
that Charm; for by shaving his whole head, the enchanted
hairs came to be cut off amongst the rest: In the same manner, I
say, that it hath sometimes happened in Draining those Fields;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:96976:333"/>
for that amongst so many tryals as have been made, that also
was light upon, on which the improvement and remedy to the
disorder did depend. And to us my fore-named Treatise shall
serve for a Rule, which being well understood, shall make us to
know wherein consisteth, and whereon dependeth this miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
and consequently it will be easie to apply thereunto a seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
remedy.</p>
                     <p>And first I say, That there is no doubt but that the waters
continue so high on those Plains because they are so high in the
principal River, which ought to receive them, and carry them
into the Sea. Now the Causes of the height of the River, may
in my judgement be reduced to one alone; which is that by me
so often mentioned for the most Potent one, and declared in my
afore-named Tractate; to wit, The tardity of the motion of the
waters, which doth alwayes infallibly, and precisely cause the
self same Running Water to change the measure of its thickness
at such a rate, that the more it encreaseth in velocity, the more
it decreaseth in measure; and the more it decreaseth in velocity,
the more it encreaseth in measure: As for example; If a River
run in such a place with the velocity of moving a mile in the
space of an hour, and afterwards the same River in another place
doth encrease in velocity, so as to make three miles an hour;
that same River shall diminish in thickness two thirds: And on
the contrary, If it shall diminish in velocity so, as that it runneth
but half a mile in the same time, it shall encrease the double in
thickness and measure. And in a word, look what proportion
the velocity in the first place, hath to the velocity in the second,
and such hath reciprocally the measure of the thickness in the
second place, to the measure in the first; as I have clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
in my Treatise: Which I repeat so frequently, that I
fear the Professors of Polite Learning will charge me with Tua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tologie,
and vain Repetition. But I am so desirous in this most
important point to be well understood, because it will then be
easie to comprehend all the rest; and without this it is impossible
(I will not say difficult, but absolutely impossible) to understand,
or ever to effect any thing to purpose. And the better to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
<figure/>
the example, let it be supposed,
That the water of a River AD,
runneth high at the level of AF,
with such a certain velocity; and let
it, by the same water, be velocitated
three times more; I say, that it will
abate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, and shall stand at the level
in BE; and if it shall more veloci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,
it will abate the more at the Sea; But if it should retard
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:96976:334"/>
more than it did at the level AF, it would rise yet more above
the said level AF; although that the self same quantity of water
runneth all the while. By the above-named solid Principle I
resolve extravagant Problems in my Treatise, and assign the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of admirable effects of Running Waters: But as for what
concerneth our purpose of the <hi>Pontine Fenns,</hi> we have the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
very plain and clear; for which, by the trampling of Cattle
which pass thorow the <hi>Draining River,</hi> the waters abate so nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
that it is as it were a miracle for those Reeds, Flags, and
Weeds that spring up, encrease, and spread all over the River,
stop and impede that velocity of the waters which they would
have by means of their declivity. But that passage of those Beasts,
treading down those Weeds unto the bottom of the River, in such
sort, as that they no longer hinder the Current of the Water;
and the same Waters increasing in their course, they do dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
in measure and height; and by this meanes the Ditches of the
Plains empty into the same successfully, and leave them free
from Waters, and Drained. But these Weeds in a short
time sprouting up anew, and raising their stalkes thorow the
body of the Waters, they reduce things to the same evil
state, as before, retarding the velocity of the Water, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it to increase in height, and perhaps do occasion grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
mischiefs; seeing that those many knots which each plant
shoots forth, begets a greater multitude of Stalks, which much
more incumbering the Water of the River, are a greater impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment
unto its velocity, and consequently make the height
of the waters to encrease so much the more, and do more mischief
than before.</p>
                     <p>Another head to which these harms may be reduced, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from the same Root, which hath a great part in this
disorder, is the impediment of those Wears in the River which
are made by heightning the bed of the same, for placing of fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-nets;
of which <hi>Piscaries</hi> I reckoned above ten, when I made
a voyage thorow those waters to <hi>Sandolo.</hi> And these Fishing-Wears
are such impediments, that some one of them makes the
water of the River in the upper part to rise half a Palm, and
sometimes a whole Palm, and more; so that when they are all
gathered together, these impediments amount to more than seven,
or possibly than eight Palms.</p>
                     <p>There concurreth for a third most Potent Cause of the waters
continuing high in the evacuating, or Draining Chanel, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
on the Plains; The great abundance of water that issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from <hi>Fiume Sisto,</hi> the waters of which do not keep within its
Banks when they are abundant; but encreasing above its Chanel,
they unite with those of the Evacuator, and dispersing thorow
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:96976:334"/>
the Fens are raised with great prejudice, and much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than is conceived, according to what hath been demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
in the Second Consideration upon the <hi>Lake of Venice.</hi>
Nor is it to any purpose to say, that if we should measure
all the Waters that disimbogue from <hi>Fiume Sisto,</hi> and gather
them into one summe, we should not finde them to be such,
as that they shall be able to make the Waters of the Fens
to increase, by reason of the great expansion of them, over
which that body of water is to distend: for to this instance we
answer with that which we have given notice of in the First Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
touching the <hi>Lake of Venice,</hi> treating of the abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that is caused by the <hi>Brent</hi> let into the Lake. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
if I shall adde thereto that which I write in the Second
Consideration, it will be very apparent how greatly harmfull
and prejudicial these excursions of Waters from <hi>Fiume Sisto</hi>
may be, which are not kept under, and confined within the
River: Therefore, proceeding to the provisions, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
that are to be accounted Principall, I reduce them to
three Heads.</p>
                     <p>In the first place it is necessary to throw down those Weares,
and to take the Pisciaries quite away, observing a Maxime, in
my judgment, infallible, that Fishing and Sowing are two things
that can never consist together; Fishing being on the Water, and
Sowing on land.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it will be necessary to cut under Water in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of the River those Weeds and Plants that grow and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
in the River, and leave them to be carried into the Sea by
the Stream; for by this means these Reeds shall not spring up
and distend along the bottome of the River, by means of the
Beasts treading upon them; And the same ought to be done
often, and with care, and must not be delaied till the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
increase, and the Champain Grounds be drowned, but
one ought to order matters so, as that they may not drown.
And I will affirm, that otherwise this principal point would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a most considerable inconvenience.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it is necessary to make good the Banks of <hi>Fiume Sisto</hi>
on the left hand, and to procure that those Waters may run in
the Chanel, and not break forth. And it is to be noted, that
it is not enough to do one or two of those things, but we are to
put them all in execution; for omitting any thing, the whole
machine will be out of tune, and spoiled. But proceeding with
due care, you shall not only Drain the <hi>Pontine Fens,</hi> but by
means of this last particular the Current of <hi>Fiume Sisto</hi> shall
scowr its own Chanel of its self, even to the carrying part of it
away: and haply with this abundance of water that it shall
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:96976:335"/>
bear, the Mouth <hi>della Torre</hi> may be opened, and kept open
into the Sea. And it would, last of all, be of admirable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to cleanse <hi>Fiume Sisto</hi> from many Trees and Bushes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
it is overgrown.</p>
                     <p>And with this I conclude, that the Improvement or Drain
possible to be made consisteth in these three particulars. First,
in taking away the Fishing Weares, leaving the Course
of the Waters free. Secondly, in keeping the Principal
Rivers clear from Weeds and Plants. Thirdly, in keeping
the water of <hi>Fiume Sisto</hi> in its own Chanel. All which are
things that may be done with very little charge, and to the
manifest benefit of the whole Country, and to the rendering
the Air wholsomer in all those Places adjoyning to the <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
Fens.</hi>

for farther confirmation of that which I have said in this

the Draining of those Plains of <hi>Pisa,</hi> lying between the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:96976:336"/>
aforementioned Cases, and in the present one that we are in hand
with, there have, in times past, very grosse Errours been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
through the not having ever well understood the true
measure of Running waters; and here it is to be noted, that the
businesse is, that in <hi>Venice,</hi> the diversion of the waters of the
Lake, by diverting the <hi>Brent</hi> was debated, and in part executed,
without consideration had how great abatement of water might
follow i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the Lake, if the <hi>Brent</hi> were diverted, as I have shewn
in the first Consideration upon this particular, from which act
there hath insued very bad consequences, not only the difficulty
of Navigation, but it hath infected the wholsomnesse of the Air,
and caused the stoppage of the Ports of <hi>Venice.</hi> And on the
contrary, the same inadvertency of not considering what rising of
the Water the <hi>Reno,</hi> and other Rivers being opened into the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys
of <hi>Bologna</hi> and <hi>Ferrara,</hi> might cause in the said Valleys, is
the certain cause that so many rich and fertile Fields are drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under water, converting the happy habitations and dwellings
of men into miserable receptacles for Fishes: Things which
doubtlesse would never have happened, if those Rivers had been
kept at their height, and <hi>Reno</hi> had been turn'd into <hi>Main-Po,</hi>
and the other Rivers into that of <hi>Argenta,</hi> and of <hi>Volano.</hi> Now
there having sufficient been spoken by the above-named <hi>Monsig.
Corsini</hi> in his Relation, I will only adde one conceit of my own,
which after the Rivers should be regulated, as hath been said, I
verily believe would be of extraordinary profit, I much doubt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
that I shall finde it a hard matter to perswade men to be of
my mind, but yet nevertheless I will not question, but that those,
at least, who shall have understood what I have said and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
concerning the manners and proportions, according to
which the abatements and risings of Running waters proceed,
that are made by the Diversions and Introductions of VVaters,
will apprehend that my conjecture is grounded upon Reason.
And although I descend not to the exactnesse of particulars, I
will open the way to others, who having observed the requisite
Rules of considering the quantity of the waters that are intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
or that happen to be diverted, shall be able with punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
to examine the whole businesse, and then resolve on that
which shall be expedient to be done.</p>
                     <p>Reflecting therefore upon the first Proposition, that the
Risings of a Running Water made by the accession of new water
into the River, are to one another, as the Square-Roots of the
quantity of the water that runneth; and consequently, that the
same cometh to pass in the Diversions: Insomuch, that a River
running in height one such a certain measure, to make it encrease
double in height, the water is to be encreased to three times as

much as it ran before; so that when the water shall be quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the height shall be double; and if the water were centuple,
the height would be decuple onely, and so from one quantity
to another: And on the contrary, in the Diversions; If of the
100. parts of water that run thorow a River, there shall be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
19/1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>, the height of the River diminisheth onely 1/10, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
to divert 17/100, the height of the River abateth likewise 1/10,
and so proceeding to divert 15/100 and then 13/100, and then 11/100, and
then 9/100, and then 7/100, and then 5/100, and then 3/106, alwaies by
each of these diversions, the height of the Running Water di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minisheth
the tenth part: although that the diversions be so une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual.
Reflecting I say upon this infallible Truth, I have had a
conceit, that though the <hi>Reno</hi> and other Rivers were diverted
from the Valleyes, and there was onely left the <hi>Chanel of Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi>
which was onely the 1/20 part of the whole water that fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
into the Valleys; yet nevertheless, the water in those same
Valleyes would retain a tenth part of that height that became
conjoyned by the concourse of all the Rivers: And therefore I
should think that it were the best resolution to maintain the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
of Navigation</hi> (if it were possible) continuate unto the <hi>Po</hi> of
<hi>Ferrara,</hi> and from thence to carry it into the <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Volano;</hi> for
besides that it would be of very great ease in the Navigation of
<hi>Bologna,</hi> and <hi>Ferrara,</hi> the said water would render the <hi>Po</hi> of
<hi>Volano</hi> navigable as far as to the very Walls of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
the Navigation would be continuate from <hi>Bologna</hi> to
the Sea-side.</p>
                     <p>But to manage this enterprize well, it is necessary to measure
the quantity of the Water that the Rivers discharge into the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys,
and that which the <hi>Chanel of Navigation</hi> carryeth, in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as I have demonstrated at the beginning of this Book; for this
once known, we shall also come to know, how profitable this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of the <hi>Chanel of Navigation</hi> from the Valleys is like to
prove; which yet would still be unprofitable, if so be that all
the Rivers that discharge their waters into the Valleys, should
not first be Drained, according to what hath been above ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised.</p>

                     <p>THe <hi>Rheno,</hi> and other Brooks of <hi>Romagna,</hi> were by the
advice of <hi>P. Agostino Spernazzati</hi> the Jesuite, towards
the latter end of the time of <hi>Pope Clement</hi> VIII. notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the opposition of the <hi>Bolognesi,</hi> and others concerned
therein, diverted from their Chanels, for the more commodious
cleansing of the <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and of its two Branches of <hi>Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi>
and <hi>Volano;</hi> in order to the introducing the water of the
<hi>Main-Po</hi> into them, to the end that their wonted Torrents being
restored, they might carry the Muddy-water thence into the Sea,
and restore to the City the Navigation which was last, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
by the Brief of the said <hi>Pope Clement,</hi> directed to the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
San Clemence,</hi> bearing date the 22. of <hi>August,</hi> 1604.</p>
                     <p>The work of the said cleansing, and introducing of the said
<hi>Po,</hi> either as being such in it self, or by the contention of the
<hi>Cardinal Legates</hi> then in these parts; and the jarrings that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
betwixt them, proved so difficult, that after the expence of
vast summs in the space of 21. years, there hath been nothing
done, save the rendring of it the more difficult to be effected.</p>
                     <p>Interim, the Torrents with their waters, both muddy and
clear, have damaged the Grounds lying on the right hand of the
<hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Argenta,</hi> and the <hi>Rheno</hi> those on its Banks; of which I
will speak in the first place, as of that which is of greater impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and from which the principal cause of the mischiefs that
result from the rest doth proceed.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Rheno</hi> having overflowed the<note n="*" place="margin">Or Lordship.</note> Tennency of <hi>Sanmartina,</hi>
in circumference about fourteen miles given it before, and part
of that of <hi>Cominale</hi> given it afterwards, as it were, for a recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle;
from whence, having deposed the matter of its muddiness,
it issued clear by the Mouths of <hi>Masi,</hi> and of <hi>Lievaloro,</hi> into
the <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Primaro,</hi> and of <hi>Volano;</hi> did break down the encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:96976:337"/>
Bank or Dam towards S. <hi>Martino,</hi> and that of its new
Chanel on the right hand neer to <hi>Torre del Fondo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By the breaches on this side it streamed out in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
from the upper part of <hi>Cominale,</hi> and in the parts about
<hi>Raveda, Pioggio, Caprara, Ghiare di Reno, Sant' Agostino, San
Prospero, San Vincenzo,</hi> and others, and made them to become
incultivable: it made also those places above but little fruitful,
by reason of the impediments that their Draines received, finding
the Conveyances called <hi>Riolo</hi> and <hi>Scorsuro,</hi> not only filled by <hi>la
Motta</hi> and <hi>la Belletta,</hi> but that they turned backwards of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                     <p>But by the Mouths in the inclosing Bank or Dam at <hi>Borgo di</hi>
S. <hi>Martino</hi> issuing with violence, it first gave obstruction to the
ancient Navigation of <hi>la Torre della Fossa,</hi> and afterwards to
the moderne of the mouth of <hi>Masi,</hi> so that at present the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
between <hi>Bologna</hi> and <hi>Ferrara</hi> is lost, nor can it ever be
in any durable way renewed, whilst that this exceeds its due
bounds, and what ever moneys shall be imployed about the same
shall be without any equivalent benefit, and to the manifest
and notable prejudice of the<note n="*" place="margin">The Popes Exchequer.</note> Apostolick Chamber.</p>
                     <p>Thence passing into the Valley of <hi>Marzara,</hi> it swelleth high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
not only by the rising of the water, but by the raising of the
bottome, by reason of the matter sunk thither after Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floods,
and dilateth so, that it covereth all the Meadows there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
nor doth it receive with the wonted facility the Drains of
the upper Grounds, of which the next unto it lying under the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that return upwards by the Conveyances, and the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote,
not finding a passage for Rain-waters that settle, become
either altogether unprofitable or little better.</p>
                     <p>From this Valley, by the Trench or Ditch of <hi>Marzara,</hi> or of
<hi>la Duca</hi> by <hi>la Buova,</hi> or mouth of <hi>Castaldo de Rossi,</hi> and by the
new passage it falleth into the <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Argenta,</hi> which being to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it clear, that so it may sink farther therein, and receiving
it muddy, because it hath acquired a quicker course, there will
arise a very contrary effect.</p>
                     <p>Here therefore the superficies of the water keeping high, until
it come to the Sea, hindereth the Valleys of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> where
the River <hi>Senio,</hi> those of <hi>San Bernardino</hi> where <hi>Santerno</hi> was
turned, those of <hi>Buon' acquisto,</hi> and those of <hi>Marmorto,</hi> where
the <hi>Idice, Quaderna, Sellero</hi> fall in, from swallowing and taking
in their Waters by their usual In-lets, yet many times, as I my
self have seen in the <hi>Visitation,</hi> they drink them up plentifully,
whereupon, being conjoyned with the muddinesse of those Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
that fall into the same, they swell, and dilate, and overflow
some grounds, and deprive others of their Drains in like manner
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:96976:338"/>
as hath been said of that of <hi>Marrara,</hi> insomuch that from the
Point of S. <hi>Giorgio,</hi> as far as S. <hi>Alberto</hi> all those that are between
the Valleys and <hi>Po</hi> are spoiled, of those that are between Valley
and Valley many are in a very bad condition, and those that are
some considerable space above not a little damnified.</p>
                     <p>In fine, by raising the bottom or sand of the Valleys, and the
bed of <hi>Reno,</hi> and the too great repletion of the <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Primaro</hi>
with waters, the Valleys of <hi>Comacchio</hi> (on which side the Banks
are very bad) and<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Polesine</hi> is a plat of Ground al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most surrounded with Bogs or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, like an Island</note> 
                        <hi>Polesine di</hi> S. <hi>Grorgio</hi> are threatned with a
danger, that may in time, if it be not remedied, become irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
and at present feeleth the incommodity of the Waters,
which penetrating thorow the pores of the Earth do spring up in
the same, which they call <hi>Purlings,</hi> which is all likely to redound
to the prejudice of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> so noble a City of <hi>Italy,</hi> and so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
to the <hi>Ecclesiastick State.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which particulars all appear to be attested under the hand of
a Notary in the <hi>Visitation</hi> which I made upon the command of
His Holinesse, and are withall known to be true by the<note n="*" place="margin">People of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Ferraresi</hi>
themselves, of whom (besides the request of the <hi>Bolognesi</hi>) the
greater part beg compassion with sundry <hi>Memorials,</hi> and reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
aswell for the mischiefs past, as also for those in time to
come, from which I hold it a duty of Conscience, and of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to deliver them.</p>
                     <p>Pope <hi>Clement</hi> judged, that the sufficient means to effect this
was the said Introduction of the <hi>Main Po</hi> into the Chanel of
<hi>Ferrara;</hi> a resolution truly Heroical, and of no lesse beauty
than benefit to that City, of which I speak not at present, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I think that there is need of a readier and more acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
remedy.</p>
                     <p>So that I see not how any other thing can be so much conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
as the removal of <hi>Reno,</hi> omitting for this time to speak of
<note n="*" place="margin">In Chanels made by hand.</note> inclosing it from Valley to Valley untill it come to the Sea, as
the Dukes of <hi>Ferrara</hi> did design, forasmuch as all those <hi>Ferra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resi</hi>
that have interest in the <hi>Polesine di</hi> S. <hi>Giorgio,</hi> and on the
right hand of the <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Argenta</hi> do not desire it, and do, but too
openly, protest against it; and because that before the Chanel
were made as far as the Sea, many hundreds of years would be
spent, and yet would not remedy the dammages of those who
now are agrieved, but would much increase them, in regard the
Valleys would continue submerged, the Drains stopped, and the
other Brooks obstructed, which would of necessity drown not a
few Lands that lie between Valley and Valley; and in fine, in
regard it hath not from <hi>San Martina</hi> to the Sea for a space of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
miles a greater fall then 19, 8, 6, feet, it would want that force
which they themselves who propound this project do require it to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:96976:338"/>
have, that so it may not depose the matter of the muddiness when
it is intended to be let into <hi>Volana.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that making the Line of the bottome neer to <hi>Vigarano,</hi> it
would rise to those prodigious termes that they do make bigger,
and they may thence expect those mischiefs, for which they
will not admit of introducing it into the said <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Volana.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Amongst the wayes therefore that I have thought of for effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that same remotion, and which I have caused to be viewed by
skilful men that have taken a level thereof, (with the assistance of
the venerable Father, <hi>D. Benedetto Castelli</hi> of <hi>Casina,</hi> a man of
much fidelity and honesty, and no less expert in such like affairs
touching waters, than perfect in the <hi>Mathematick</hi> Disciplines) two
onely, the rest being either too tedious, or too dangerous to the
City, have seemed to me worthy, and one of them also more than
the other, to offer to your Lordship.</p>
                     <p>The one is to remit it into the Chanel of <hi>Volana,</hi> thorow which
it goeth of its own accord to the Sea.</p>
                     <p>The other is to turn it into <hi>Main-Po</hi> at <hi>Stellata,</hi> for, as at other
times it hath done, it will carry it to the Sea happily.</p>
                     <p>As to what concerns the making choice of the first way, that
which seemeth to perswade us to it is, that we therein do nothing
that is new, in that it is but restored to the place whence it was
removed in the year 1522. in the time of Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> by an
agreement made in way of contract, between <hi>Alfonso,</hi> Duke of
<hi>Ferrara,</hi> and the <hi>Bolognesi;</hi> and that it was diverted for reasons,
that are either out of date, or else have been too long time
deferred.</p>
                     <p>In like manner the facility wherewith it may be effected, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it run into the divided <hi>Po,</hi> whereby it will be turned to <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara,</hi>
or else carrying it by <hi>Torre del Fondo,</hi> to the mouth of <hi>Masi,</hi>
and from thence thorow the Trench made by the <hi>Ferraresi,</hi>
along by <hi>Panaro,</hi> where also finding an ample Bed, and high and
thick Banks, that will serve at other times for it, and for the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Po,</hi> there may a great expence be spared.</p>
                     <p>That what ever its Fall be, it would maintain the same, not
having other Rivers, which with their Floods can hinder it; and
that running confined between good Banks, without doubt it
would not leave <hi>la Motto</hi> by the way; but especially, that it
would be sufficient if it came to <hi>Codigoro,</hi> where being assisted by
the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea, it would run no hazard of
having its Chanel filled up from thence downwards.</p>
                     <p>That there might thence many benefits be derived to the City,
by means of the Running Waters, and also no mean Navigation
might be expected.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary it is objected, That it is not convenient to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:96976:339"/>
think of returning this Torrent into the divided <hi>Po,</hi> by reason of
the peril that would thence redound to this City.</p>
                     <p>And that going by <hi>Torre del Fondo,</hi> through <hi>Sanmartina</hi> to
the Mouth <hi>de Masi</hi> by the Chappel of <hi>Vigarano</hi> unto the Sea, it is
by this way 70. miles; nor is the Fall greater than 26. 5. 6. Feet, so
that it would come to fall but 4. inches &amp; an half, or thereabouts
in a mile; whereas the common opinion of the skilfull (to the
end that the Torrents may not depose their sand that they bring
with them in Land-Floods) requireth the twenty fourth part of
the hundredth part of their whole length, which in our case,
accounting according to the measure of these places, is 16. inches
a<note n="*" place="margin">The inch of these places is somewhat bigger than ours.</note> mile; whereupon the sinking of the Mud and Sand would
most certainly follow, and so an immense heightning of the Line
of the Bottom, and consequently a necessity of raising the Banks,
the impossibility of maintaining them, the danger of breaches
and decayes, things very prejudicial to the <hi>Islets</hi> of this City, and
of <hi>San Giorgio,</hi> the obstruction of the Drains, which from the
Tower of <hi>Tienne</hi> downwards, fall into the said Chanel; to wit,
those of the Sluices of <hi>Goro,</hi> and the Drains, of the Meadows of
<hi>Ferrara:</hi> And moreover, the damages that would arise unto the
said <hi>Islet</hi> of S. <hi>Giorgio,</hi> and the Valleys of <hi>Comachio,</hi> by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that should enter into the <hi>Goro</hi> or Dam of the Mills of <hi>Belri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guardo,</hi>
thorow the Trenches of <hi>Quadrea,</hi> which cannot be stopt,
because they belong to the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> who hath right of
diverting the waters of that place at his pleasure to the work of
turning Mills.</p>
                     <p>The greater part of which Objections, others pretend to prove
frivolous, by saying, that its running there till at the last it was
turned another way, is a sign that it had made such an elevation
of the Line, of its Bed as it required; denying that it needeth
so great a declivity as is mentioned above; and that for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it would rise no more.</p>
                     <p>That the said Dra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ns and Ditches did empty into the same,
whilst <hi>Po</hi> was there; so that they must needs be more able to do
so when onely <hi>Reno</hi> runs that way.</p>
                     <p>That there would no Breaches follow, or if they did, they
would be onely of the water of <hi>Reno,</hi> which in few hours might
be taken away (in those parts they call damming up of Breaches,
and mending the Bank, <hi>taking away the Breaches</hi>) and its a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
whether they would procure more inconvenience than bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
for that its Mud and Sand might in many places, by filling
them up, occasion a seasonable improvement.</p>
                     <p>Now omitting to discourse of the solidity of the reasons on the
oneside, or on the other, I will produce those that move me to
suspend my allowance of this design.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="105" facs="tcp:96976:339"/>
The first is, that although I dare not subscribe to the opinion
of those that require 16. inches Declivity in a mile to <hi>Reno,</hi> to
prevent its deposing of Mud; yet would I not be the Author that
should make a trial of it with so much hazard, for having to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
my self in some particulars caused a Level to be taken of
the Rivers <hi>L'amone, Senio,</hi> and <hi>Santerno,</hi> by <hi>Bernardino Aleotti,</hi>
we found that they have more Declivity by much than Artists re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
as also the <hi>Reno</hi> hath from <hi>la Botta de Ghislieri</hi> to the
Chappel of <hi>Vigarano,</hi> for in the space of four miles its Bottom-Line
falleth five feet and five inches. So that I hold it greater
prudence to depend upon that example, than to go contrary to a
common opinion, especially since, that the effects caused by <hi>Reno</hi>
it self do confirm me in the same, for when it was forsaken by
the Po, after a few years, either because it had choaked up its
Chanel with Sand, or because its too long journey did increase
it, it also naturally turned aside, and took the way of the said
Po towards <hi>Stellata.</hi> Nay, in those very years that it did run that
way, it only began (as relations say) to make Breaches, an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
sign that it doth depose Sand, and raise its Bed; which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth
with the testimony of some that were examined in the
<hi>Visitation</hi> of the Publique Notary, who found great benefit by
having Running Water, and some kind of passage for Boats,
and yet nevertheless affirm that it for want of Running Water
had made too high Stoppages and Shelfes of Sand; so that if
it should be restored to the Course that it forsook, I much fear
that after a short time, if not suddenly, it would leave it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>again.</p>
                     <p>The second I take from the observation of what happened to
<hi>Panaro,</hi> when with so great applause of the <hi>Feraresi,</hi> it was
brought by Cardinal <hi>Serra</hi> into the said Chanel of <hi>Volana;</hi> for
that notwithstanding that it had Running Waters in much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
abundance than <hi>Reno;</hi> yet in the time that it continued in
that Chanel it raised its Bed well neer five feet, as is to be seen
below the Sluice made by Cardinal <hi>Capponi</hi> to his new Chanel;
yea, the said Cardinal <hi>Serra</hi> who desired that this his undertaking
should appear to have been of no danger nor damage, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
at its Overflowings, to give it Vent into <hi>Sanmartina,</hi> that
it might not break in upon, and prejudice the City; which dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
I should more fear from <hi>Reno,</hi> in regard it carrieth a greater
abundance of Water and Sand.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, I am much troubled (in the uncertainty of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of the affair) at the great expence thereto required; For in
regard I do not approve of letting it in, neer to the Fortresse,
for many respects, and carrying it by <hi>la Torre del Fondo</hi> to the
Mouth <hi>de Masi,</hi> it will take up eight miles of double Banks, a
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:96976:340"/>
thing not easie to be procured, by reason that the Grounds lie
under Water; but from the Mouth <hi>de Masi</hi> unto <hi>Codigoro,</hi> it
would also be necessary to make new Scowrings of the Chanel;
to the end, that the Water approaching (by wearing and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away the Earth on both shores, might make a Bed sufficient
for its Body, the depth made for <hi>Panaro</hi> not serving the turn, as
I conceive; and if it should suffice, when could the people of
<hi>Ferrara</hi> hope to be re-imbursed and satisfied for the charge
thereof?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, it serves as an Argument with me, to see that the
very individual persons concerned in the Remotion or Diversion
of the said Torrent, namely, the <hi>Bolognesi</hi> do not incline unto it,
and that the whole City of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> even those very persons who
at present receive damage by it, cannot indure to hear thereof.
The reason that induceth these last named to be so averse thereto,
is, either because that this undertaking will render the introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Water of <hi>Main</hi>-Po more difficult; or because they fear
the danger thereof; The others decline the Project, either for
that they know that <hi>Reno</hi> cannot long continue in that Course,
or because they fear that it is too much exposed to those mens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful
Cutting of it who do not desire it should; and if a
man have any other wayes, he ought, in my opinion, to forbear
that, which to such as stand in need of its Removal, is lesse satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory,
and to such as oppose it, more prejudicial.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, I exceedingly honour the judgment of Cardinal
<hi>Capponi,</hi> who having to his Natural Ability and Prudence added
a particular Study, Observation, and Experience of these Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
for the space of three years together, doth not think that
<hi>Reno</hi> can go by <hi>Volana;</hi> to which agreeth the opinion of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
S. <hi>Marcello,</hi> Legate of this City, of whom, for his exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
understanding, we ought to make great account. But if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
this should be resolved on, it would be materially necessary
to unite the Quick and Running Waters of the little Chanel of
<hi>Cento,</hi> of the Chanel <hi>Navilio,</hi> of <hi>Guazzaloca,</hi> and at its very
beginning those of <hi>Dardagna,</hi> which at present, is one of the
Springs or Heads of <hi>Panaro,</hi> that so they might assist it in carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its Sand, and the matter of its Muddiness into the Sea; and
then there would not fail to be a greater evacuation and scowr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but withall the Proprietors in the Islet of <hi>San Giorgio</hi> and
of <hi>Ferrara</hi> must prepare themselves to indure the inconveniences
of Purlings or Sewings of the Water from the River thorow
the Boggy Ground thereabouts.</p>
                     <p>I should more easily incline therefore to carry it into <hi>Main</hi>-Po
at <hi>Stellata,</hi> for the Reasons that Cardinal <hi>Capponi</hi> most ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
enumerates in a short, but well-grounded Tract of his: not
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:96976:340"/>
because that indeed it would not both by Purlings and by Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
occasion some inconvenience; especially, in the beginning:
but because I hold this for the incomodities of it, to be a far less
evil than any of the rest; and because that by this means there is
no occasion given to them of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> to explain that they are
deprived of the hope of ever seeing the Po again under the Walls
of their City: To whom, where it may be done, it is but reason
that satisfaction should be given.</p>
                     <p>It is certain that Po was placed by Nature in the midst of this
great Valley made by the <hi>Appennine</hi> Hills, and by the Alps, to
carry, as the Master-Drain to the Sea, that is the grand receptacle
of all Waters; those particular streams which descend from
them.</p>
                     <p>That the <hi>Reno</hi> by all Geographers, <hi>Strabo, Pliny, Solimas,
Mella,</hi> and others is enumerated among the Rivers that fall into
the said Po.</p>
                     <p>That although Po should of it self change its course, yet would
<hi>Reno</hi> go to look it out, if the works erected by humane industry
did not obstruct its passage; so that it neither is, nor ought to
seem strange, if one for the greater common good should turn it
into the same.</p>
                     <p>Now at <hi>Stellata</hi> it may go several waies into Po, as appeareth
by the levels that were taken by my Order; of all which I should
best like the turning of it to <hi>la Botta de' Ghislieri,</hi> carrying it
above <hi>Bondeno</hi> to the Church of <hi>Gambarone,</hi> or a little higher or
lower, as shall be judged least prejudicial, when it cometh to the
execution, and this for two principal reasons: The one because
that then it will run along by the confines of the Church P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
without separating <hi>Ferrara</hi> from the rest of it; The other
is, Because the Line is shorter, and consequently the fall greater;
for that in a space of ten miles and one third, it falleth twenty six
feet, more by much than is required by Artists; and would go
by places where it could do but little hurt, notwithstanding that
the persons interressed study to amplifie it incredibly.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, there are but onely two objections that are
worthy to be examined; One, That the Drains and Ditches of
S. <hi>Bianca,</hi> of the Chanel of <hi>Cento,</hi> and of <hi>Burana,</hi> and all those
others that enter into Po, do hinder this diversion of <hi>Reno,</hi> by the
encreasing of the waters in the Po. The other is that Po rising
about the Transom of the <hi>Pilaster</hi>-Sluice, very near 20 feet, the
<hi>Reno</hi> would have no fall into the same; whereupon it would rise
to a terrible height, at which it would not be possible to make, or
keep the Banks made, so that it would break out and drown
the Meadowes, and cause mischiefs, and damages unspeakable
and irreparable; as is evident by the experiment made upon
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:96976:341"/>
                        <hi>Panaro,</hi> which being confined between Banks, that it might go
into <hi>Po,</hi> this not being neither in its greatest excrescense, it broke
out into the territories of <hi>Final,</hi> and of <hi>Ferrara.</hi> And though
that might be done, it would thereupon ensue, that there being
let into the Chanel of <hi>Po,</hi> 2800. square feet of water (for so much
we account those of <hi>Reno</hi> and <hi>Panaro,</hi> taken together in their
greatest heights) the superficies of it would rise at least four feet,
insomuch that either it would be requisite to raise its Banks all the
way unto the Sea, to the same height, which the treasures of the
<hi>Indies</hi> would not suffice to effect; or else there would be a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of enduring excessive Breaches. To these two Heads are the
Arguments reduced, which are largely amplified against our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
and I shall answer first to the last, as most material.</p>
                     <p>I say therefore, that there are three cases to be considered:
First, <hi>Po</hi> high, and <hi>Reno</hi> low. Secondly, <hi>Reno</hi> high, and <hi>Po</hi>
low. Thirdly, <hi>Reno</hi> and <hi>Po</hi> both high together.</p>
                     <p>As to the first and second, there is no difficulty in them; for if
<hi>Po</hi> shall not be at its greatest height, <hi>Reno</hi> shall ever have a fall
into it, and there shall need no humane Artifice about the Banks:
And if <hi>Reno</hi> shall be low, <hi>Po</hi> shall regurgitate and flow up into
the Chanel of it; and also from thence no inconvenience shall
follow. The third remains, from which there are expected ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mischiefs; but it is a most undoubted truth, that the excrescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of <hi>Reno,</hi> as coming from the adjacent <hi>Appennines</hi> and Rains,
are to continue but seven, or eight hours at most, and so would
never, or very rarely happen to be at the same time with those of
<hi>Po,</hi> caused by the melting of the snowes of the Alps, at least 400.
miles distance from thence. But because it sometimes may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
I reply, that when it cometh to pass, <hi>Reno</hi> shall not go into
<hi>Po,</hi> but it shall have allowed it one or two Vents; namely, into
the Chanel of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> as it hath ever had; and into <hi>Sanmartina,</hi>
where it runneth at present, and wherewith there is no doubt, but
that the persons concerned will be well pleased, it being a great
benefit to them, to have the water over-flow their grounds once
every four or five years, instead of seeing it anoy them continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.
Yea, the Vent may be regulated, reserving for it the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
in which <hi>Reno</hi> at present runneth; and instead of turning it
by a Dam at <hi>la Betta de Ghislieri,</hi> perhaps, to turn it by help of
strong Sluices, that may upon all occasions be opened and shut.
And for my part, I do not question but that the Proprietors
themselves in <hi>Sanmartina</hi> would make a Chanel for it; which
receiving, and confining it in the time of the Vents, might carry
the Sand into the <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Primaro:</hi> Nor need there thence be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any stoppage by Mud and Sand, since that it is supposed that
there will but very seldom be any necessity of using it; so that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:96976:341"/>
time would be allowed, upon occasion, to scowr and cleanse
it.</p>
                     <p>And in this manner all those Prodigies vanish that are raised
with so much fear from the enterance of the Water of <hi>Reno</hi>
swelled into <hi>Po,</hi> when it is high, to which there needeth no other
answer; yet neverthelesse we do not take that quantity of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that is carried by <hi>Reno,</hi> and by <hi>Panaro,</hi> to be so great as is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
For that P. D. <hi>Benedetto Castelli</hi> hath no lesse accutely
than accurately observed the measures of this kind, noting that
the breadth and depth of a River is not enough to resolve the
question truly, but that there is respect to be had to the velocity
of the Waters, and the term of time, things hitherto not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by the Skilful in these affairs; and therefore they are not
able to say what quantity of Waters the said Rivers carry, nor
to conclude of the risings that will follow thereupon. Nay, it
is most certain, that if all the Rivers that fall into <hi>Po,</hi> which are
above thirty, should rise at the rate that these compute <hi>Reno</hi> to
do, and hundred feet of Banks would not suffice, and yet they
have far fewer: So that this confirmes the Rule of R. P. D. <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detto,</hi>
namely, that the proportion of the height of the Water
of <hi>Reno</hi> in <hi>Reno</hi> to the height of the Water of <hi>Reno</hi> in <hi>Po,</hi> is
compounded of the proportion of the breadth of the Chanel of
<hi>Po</hi> to that of <hi>Reno,</hi> and of the velocity of the Water of <hi>Reno</hi>
in <hi>Po</hi> to the vel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>city of the Water of <hi>Reno</hi> in <hi>Reno;</hi> a manifest
argument that there cannot in it, by this new augmentation of
Waters follow any alteration that necessitates the raising of its
Banks, as appeareth by the example of <hi>Pavaro,</hi> which hath been
so far from swelling <hi>Po,</hi> that it hath rather asswaged it, for it hath
carried away many Shelfs and many Islets that had grown in its
Bed, for want of Waters sufficient to bear away the matter of
Land-floods in so broad a Chanel; and as is learnt by the trial
made by us in <hi>Panaro</hi> with the Water of <hi>Burana;</hi> for erecting
in the River standing marks, and shutting the said Sluice, we could
see no sensible abatement, nor much less after we had opened it
sensible increasment; by which we judge that the same is to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to <hi>Po,</hi> by letting in of <hi>Reno, Burana</hi> having greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to <hi>Panaro</hi> than <hi>Reno</hi> to <hi>Po,</hi> considering the state of those
Rivers in which the Observation was made. So that there is no
longer any occasion for those great raisings of Banks, and the
danger of the ruptures as well of <hi>Reno</hi> as of <hi>Po</hi> do vanish, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the fear lest that the Sluices which empty into <hi>Po</hi> should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
obstruction: which if they should, yet it would be over in
a few hours. And as to the Breaches of <hi>Panaro</hi> which happened
in 1623. I know not why, seeing that it is confessed that the <hi>Po</hi>
was not, at that time, at its height, one should rather charge it
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:96976:342"/>
with the crime, than quit it thereof. The truth is, that the
Bank was not made of proof, since that the same now continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
whole and good, and <hi>Panaro</hi> doth not break out; nay, there
was, when it brake more than a foot and half of its Banks above
the Water, and to spare; but it broke thorow by a Moles wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king;
or by the hole of a Water-Rat, or some such vermine;
and by occasion of the badness of the said Banks, as I finde by
the testimony of some witnesses examined by my command, that
I might know the truth thereof. Nor can I here forbear to say,
that it would be better, if in such matters men were more candid
and sincere. But to secure our selves neverthelesse, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
of our power, from such like Breaches which may happen
at the first, by reason of the newnesse of the Banks, I presuppose
that from <hi>Po</hi> unto the place whence <hi>Reno</hi> is cut, there ought to
be a high and thick Fence made with its Banks, so that there
would be no cause to fear any whatsoever accessions of Water,
although that concurrence of three Rivers, which was by some
more ingeniously aggravated than faithfully stated by that which
was said above were true; to whom I think not my self bound
to make any farther reply, neither to those who say that <hi>Po</hi> will
ascend upwards into <hi>Reno,</hi> since that these are the same persons
who would introduce a small branch of the said <hi>Po</hi> into the
Chanel of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> that so it may conveigh to the Sea, not <hi>Reno</hi>
onely, but also all the other Brooks of which we complained;
and because that withal it is impossible, that a River so capacious
as <hi>Po</hi> should be incommoded by a Torrent, that, as I may say,
hath no proportion to it.</p>
                     <p>I come now to the businesse of the Ditches and Draines; and
as to the Conveyance of <hi>Burana;</hi> it hath heretofore been deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to turn it into <hi>Main-Po,</hi> so that in this case it will receive no
harm, and though it were not removed, yet would it by a Trench
under ground pursue the course that it now holdeth, and also
would be able to dis-imbogue again into the said new Chanel of
<hi>Reno,</hi> which conforming to the superficies of the Water of <hi>Po,</hi>
would continue at a lower level than that which <hi>Panara</hi> had
when it came to <hi>Ferrara,</hi> into which <hi>Burana</hi> did neverthelesse
empty it self for some time.</p>
                     <p>The Conveyance or Drain of <hi>Santa Bianca,</hi> and the little
Chanel of <hi>Cento</hi> may also empty themselves by two subterranean
Trenches, without any prejudice where they run at present, or
without any more works of that nature, they may be turned into
the said new Chanel, although with somewhat more of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience;
and withall, the Chanel of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> left dry, would
be a sufficient receptacle for any other Sewer or Drain whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
that should remain there.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="111" facs="tcp:96976:342"/>
All which Operations might be brought to perfection with
150. thousand Crowns, well and faithfully laid out; which summ
the <hi>Bolognesi</hi> will not be unwilling to provide; besides that those
<hi>Ferraresi</hi> ought to contribute to it, who shall partake of the
benefit.</p>
                     <p>Let me be permitted in this place to propose a thing which I
have thought of, and which peradventure might occasion two
benefits at once, although it be not wholly new. It was in the
time of <hi>Pope Paul</hi> V. propounded by one <hi>Crescenzio</hi> an Ingi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer,
to cut the <hi>Main-Po,</hi> above <hi>le Papozze;</hi> and having made a
sufficient evacuation to derive the water thereof into the <hi>Po</hi> of
<hi>Adriano,</hi> and so to procure it to be Navigable, which was not at
that time effected, either by reason of the oppositions of those,
whose possessions were to be cut thorow, or by reason of the
great sum of money that was necessary for the effecting of it: But
in viewing those Rivers, we have observed, that the sedge cutting
might easily be made below <hi>le Papozze,</hi> in digging thorow the
Bank called <hi>Santa Maria,</hi> &amp; drawing a Trench of the bigness that
skilful Artists shall judge meet unto the <hi>Po</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Of <hi>Adriano.</hi>
                        </note> of <hi>Ariano,</hi> below the
<hi>Secche</hi> of the said S. <hi>Maria;</hi> which as being a work of not
above 160. Perches in length, would be finished with onely
12000. Crowns.</p>
                     <p>First; it is to be believed, that the waters running that way,
would nor fail to open that Mouth into the Sea, which at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
is almost choakt up by the Shelf of Sand, which the new
Mouth of <hi>Ponto Virro</hi> hath brought thither; and that it would
again bring into use the Port <hi>Gero,</hi> and its Navigation.</p>
                     <p>And haply experience might teach us, that the superficies of
<hi>Po</hi> might come to fall by this asswagement of Water, so that the
accession of <hi>Reno</hi> would questionless make no rising in it:
Whereupon, if it should so fall out, those Princes would have
no reason to complain; who seem to question, lest by this new
accession of water into <hi>Po,</hi> the Sluices might be endangered.
Which I thought not fit to omit to represent to your Lordship;
not, that I propose it to you as a thing absolutely certain, but that
you might, if you so pleased, lay it before persons whose judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are approved in these affairs.</p>
                     <p>I return now from where I degrest, and affirm it as indubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that <hi>Reno</hi> neither can, nor ought to continue longer where
it at this day is; and that it cannot go into any other place but
that, whither <hi>Cardinal Capponi</hi> designed to carry it, and which
at present pleaseth me better than any other; or into <hi>Volana,</hi>
whence it was taken away; the vigilance of Men being able to
obviate part of those mischiefs, which it may do there.</p>
                     <p>But from its Removal, besides the alleviation of the harm
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:96976:343"/>
which by it self is caused, there would also result the diminution
of that which is occasioned by the other Brooks, to the right hand
of the <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Argenta;</hi> forasmuch as the said <hi>Po</hi> wanting all the
water of <hi>Reno,</hi> it would of necessity come to ebb in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that the Valleys would have a greater Fall into the same,
and consequently it would take in, and swallow greater abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of water; and by this means the Ditches and Draines
of the Up-Lands would likewise more easily Fall into them; es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
if the scouring of <hi>Zenzalino</hi> were brought to perfection,
by which the waters of <hi>Marrara</hi> would fall into <hi>Marmorta:</hi> And
if also that of <hi>Bastia</hi> were enlarged, and finished, by which there
might enter as much water into the said <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Argenta,</hi> as is taken
from it by the removal of <hi>Reno;</hi> although that by that meanes
the water of the Valleys would asswage double: Nor would the
people of <hi>Argenta,</hi> the Isles of S. <hi>Giorgio,</hi> and <hi>Comacchio</hi> have any
cause to complain; for that there would not be given to them
more water than was taken away: Nay sometimes whereas they
had Muddy waters, they would have clear; nor need they to fear
any rising: And furthermore, by this means a very great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of ground would be restored to culture; For the effecting of
all which, the summ of 50. thousand Crowns would go very far,
and would serve the turn at present touching those Brooks, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
them a little farther in the mean time, to fill up the greater
cavities of the Valleys, that we might not enter upon a vaster
and harder work, that would bring with it the difficulties of other
operations, and so would hinder the benefit which these people
expect from the paternal charity of His Holiness.</p>

                     <p>In the dayes of yore, before that the admirable Art of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
was in use, there was found in <hi>Persia</hi> a vast and unvaluable
Treasure, which consisted in an huge multitude of pieces of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesin,
or Damask, I know not whether; which, as I take it,
amounted to near two thousand pieces; which were of such a
nature, that though their Breadth and Thickness were finite and
determinate, as they use to be at this day; yet nevertheless, their
Length was in a certain sense infinite, for that those two thousand
pieces, day and night without ceasing, issued out with their ends
at such a rate, that of each piece there issued 100. Ells a day, from
a deep and dark Cave, consecrated by the Superstition of those
people, to the fabulous <hi>Arachne.</hi> In those innocent and early
times (I take it to have been, in that so much applauded and
desired Golden age) it was left to the liberty of any one, to cut
off of those pieces what quantity they pleased without any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty:
But that felicity decaying and degenerating, which was
altogether ignorant of <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum;</hi> terms certainly most
pernicious, the Original of all evils, and cause of all discords;
there were by those people strong and vigilant Guards placed
upon the Cave, who resolved to make merchandize of the Stuffes;
and in this manner they began to set a price upon that inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Treasure, selling the propriety in those pieces to divers Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants;
to some they sold a right in one, to some in two, and to
some in more. But that which was the worst of all, There was
found out by the insatiable avarice of these men crafty inventions
to deceive the Merchants also; who came to buy the aforesaid
commodity, and to make themselves Masters, some of one
some of two, and some of more ends of those pieces of stuff;
and in particular, there were certain ingenuous Machines placed
in the more secret places of the Cave, with which at the pleasure
of the Guards, they did retard the velocity of those Stuffs, in
their issuing out of the Cave; insomuch, that he who ought to have

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> had 400, enjoyed the benefit of 50. onely; and so all
the rest were defrauded of their Rights, the surplusage being sold,
appropriated, and shared at the will of the corrupt Officers: So
that the business was without all order or justice, insomuch that
the Goddess <hi>Arachne</hi> being displeased at those people, deprived
every one of their benefit, and with a dreadful Earthquake for
ever closing the mouth of the Cave, in punishment of so much
impiety and malice: Nor did it avail them to excuse themselves,
by saying that they allowed the Buyer the Breadth and Thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
bargained for; and that of the Length, which was infinite,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:96976:344"/>
there could no account be kept: For the wise and prudent
Priest of the Sacred <hi>Grotto</hi> answered, That the deceit lay in the
length, which they were defrauded of, in that the velocity of the
stuffe was retarded, as it issued out of the Cave: and although
the total length of the Piece was infinite, for that it never cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
coming forth, and so was not to be computed; yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
its length considered, part by part, as it came out of the
Cave, and was bargained for, continued still finite, and might
be one while greater, and another while lesser, according as the
Piece was constituted in greater or lesser velocity; and he added
withall, that exact Justice required, that when they sold a piece
of stuff, and the propriety or dominion therein, they ought not
only to have ascertained the breadth and thicknesse of the Piece,
but also to have determined the length, determining its ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity.</p>
                     <p>The same disorder and confusion, that was represented in the
Fable, doth come to passe in the History of the Distribution of
the Waters of Conduits and Fountains, seeing that they are sold
and bought, having regard only to the two Dimensions, I mean
of Breadth and Height of the Mouth that dischargeth the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and to remedy such an inconvenience, it is necessary to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the length in the velocity; for never shall we be able to
make a guesse at the quantity of the Body of Running VVater,
with the two Dimensions only of Breadth and Height, without
Length.</p>
                     <p>And to the end, that the whole business may be reduced
to a most easie practice, by which the waters of Aqueducts
may be bought and sold justly, and with measures alwayes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
and constant.</p>
                     <p>First, the quantity of the Water ought diligently to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
which the whole principal * Pipe dischargeth in a time
certain, as for instance, in an hour, in half an hour, or in a lesse
interval of time, (for knowing which I have a most exact and
easie Rule) and finding that the whole principal pipe dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
<hi>v. g.</hi> a thousand Tuns of Water in the space of one or
more hours, in selling of this water, it ought not to be uttered by
the ordinary and false measure, but the distribution is to be
made with agreement to give and maintain to the buyer ten or
twenty, or a greater number of Tuns, as the bargain shall be
made, in the space of an hour, or of some other set and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
time. And here I adde, that if I were to undertake to
make such an adjustment, I would make use of a way to divide
and measure the time with such accuratenesse, that the space of
an hour should be divided into four, six, or eight thousand parts
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:96976:345"/>
without the least errour; which Rule was taught me by my
Master <hi>Sign. Galilaeo Galilaei,</hi> Chief Philosopher to the most Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene
<hi>Grand Duke</hi> of <hi>Tuscany.</hi> And this way will serve easily and
admirably to our purpose and occasion; so that we shall
thereby be able to know how many Quarts of Water an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queduct
will discharge in a given time of hours, moneths, or
years. And in this manner we may constitute a Cock that shall
discharge a certain and determinate quantity of water in a time
given.</p>
                     <p>And because daily experience shews us, that the Springs of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queducts
do not maintain them alwayes equally high, and full
of Water, but that sometimes they increase, and sometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
which accident might possibly procure some difficulty in
our distribution: Therefore, to the end that all manner of scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
may be removed, I conceive that it would be convenient to
provide a Cistern, according to the occasion, into which there
might alwayes fall one certain quantity of water, which should
not be greater than that which the principal pipe dischargeth in
times of drought, when the Springs are bare of water, that so in
this Cistern the water might alwayes keep at one constant height.
Then to the Cistern so prepared we are to fasten the Cocks of
particular persons, to whom the Water is sold by the Reverend
Apostolique Chamber, according to what hath been observed
before; and that quantity of Water which remaineth over and
above, is to be discharged into another Cistern, in which the
Cocks of the Waters for publick services, and of those which
people buy upon particular occasions are to be placed. And
when the businesse shall have been brought to this passe, there
will likewise a remedy be found to the so many disorders that
continually happen; of which, for brevity sake, I will instance
in but four only, which concern both publique and private bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
as being, in my judgment, the most enormous and intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
                     <p>The first inconvenience is, that in the common way of measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
dispensing, and selling the Waters of Aqueducts, it is not
understood, neither by the Buyer nor Seller, what the quantity
truly is that is bought and sold; nor could I ever meet with any
either Engineer or Architect, or Artist, or other that was able to
decypher to me, what one, or two, or ten inches of water was.
But by our above declared Rule, for dispensing the Waters of
Aqueducts we may very easily know the true quantity of Water
that is bought or sold, as that it is so many Tuns an hour, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a day, so many in a year, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The second disorder that happeneth, at present, in the distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:96976:345"/>
of Aqueducts is, that as the businesse is now governed, it
lieth in the power of a sordid Mason to take unjustly from one,
and give undeservedly to another more or lesse Water than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to them of right: And I have seen it done, of my
own experience. But in our way of measuring and distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
Waters, there can no fraud be committed; and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the case that they should be committed, its an easie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to know it, and amend it, by repairing to the Tribunal
appointed.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it happens very often, (and we have examples there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
both antient and modern) that in dispensing the Water after
the common and vulgar way; there is sometimes more Water dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
than there is in the Register, in which there will be regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred,
as they say, two hundred inches (for example) and there
will be dispensed two hundred and fifty inches, or more. Which
passage happened in the time of <hi>Nerva</hi> the Emperour, as <hi>Giulio
Frontano</hi> writes, in his 2. Book, <hi>De Aquaductibus Vrbis Romae,</hi>
where he observeth that they had <hi>in Commentariis 12755. Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries</hi>
of Water; and found that they dispensed 14018. <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries.</hi>
And the like Errour hath continued, and is in use also
modernly until our times. But if our Rule shall be observed,
we shall incur no such disorder, nay there will alwayes be given
to every one his share, according to the holy end of exact justice,
which <hi>dat unicuique quod suum est.</hi> As on the contrary, it is
manifest, that His Divine Majesty hateth and abominateth <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus
&amp; pondus, Mensura &amp; mensura,</hi> as the Holy Ghost speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
by the mouth of <hi>Solomon</hi> in the <hi>Proverbs, Chap. 20. Pondus
&amp; Pondus, Mensura &amp; Mensura, utrumque abominabile est apud
Deum.</hi> And therefore who is it that seeth not that the way of
dividing and measuring of VVaters, commonly used, is expresly
against the Law of God. Since that thereby the same measure
is made sometimes greater, and sometimes lesser; A disorder so
enormous and execrable, that I shall take the boldness to say, that
for this sole respect it ought to be condemned and prohibited like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
by human Law, which should Enact that in this business there
should be imployed either this our Rule, or some other that
is more exquisite and practicable, whereby the measure
might keep one constant and determinate tenor, as we make it,
and not, as it is now, to make <hi>Pondus &amp; Pondus, Mensura &amp;
Mensura.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this is all that I had to offer to your most Illustrious
Lordship, in obedience to your commands, reserving to my self
the giving of a more exact account of this my invention, when
the occasion shall offer, of reducing to practice so holy, just, and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:96976:346"/>
necessary a reformation of the Measure of Running Waters and
of Aqueducts in particular: which Rule may also be of great
benefit in the division of the greater Waters to over-flow
Grounds, and for other uses: I humbly bow,</p>
