         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Leah</hi> being offended with hir ſiſters importunitie, denied hir requeſt, and refuſed to beſtow the Apples vpon hir. At length the matter betweene them was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and agreed vpon, vnder this condition, that <hi>Leah</hi> the night next following ſhoulde ſleepe with <hi>Iacob,</hi> who was husband to them both, and ſlept with them by turnes: and that <hi>Rahel</hi> ſhould haue and enioy the <hi>Mandrakes,</hi> which ſhe is thought to haue gotten from hir ſiſter, to the intent thereby the ſooner to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, by eating the ſame apple, and ſleeping with the patriarch <hi>Iacob</hi> hir husband. For, ſhe greatly ſpighting hir ſiſters fruitefull wombe,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:8922:10"/>
and no leſſe deſiring to baniſh and put awaie from hir ſelfe the rebuke of barrainnes and ſterilitie: bitterlie expoſtulated with hir huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande, for that ſhe could beare no children, whereas hir ſiſter was the mother of manie. But <hi>Iacob</hi> wiſelie and grauely correcting hir error, and ſomewhat mooued with diſpleaſure againſt hir, told hir, that he was not therefore to be blamed; for that fruitfulnes and beare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of children was the gift of God, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed at his diuine will and pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Now, whether <hi>Mandrake</hi> haue any ſuch vertue to make women fruitfull, and to helpe conception, therein lieth the queſtion and doubt. For, ſeeing that it hath a ſoporiferous nature and ſleepie qualitie, and is withall alſo verie colde, it is thought to be vtterlie vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, vnfit and ſtrengthleſſe to worke anie ſuch effect. For anſwere wherevnto, this I ſay, that as I confeſſe it to be vnauaileable and vnable to worke ſuch effect, or to bring anie ſuch thing to paſſe in cold and moyſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, or in a cold and moyſt wombe: ſo again in hot, parched and aduſt places it ſtandeth with good reaſon that it may well effect ſuch a conſequence. So that I am of opinion, that in <hi>Aphrike, Spaine, Iurie, Mauritanie, Barbarie, Aegypt</hi> and ſuch like countries, where the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men be of an hot conſtitution, and haue aduſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rie, vnkindely, faint and leane wombes, this kinde of Apple may ſafely and verie conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently be eaten. For by the eating thereof, the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:8922:11"/>
bodie may expediently be brought (as I thinke) to a temperatenes: in that, the ſame (after carnall knowledge) being brought a ſleepe, the wombe is the better enabled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the ſeede, not ſuffering it to euaporate as in an hot &amp; dry matrix it vſually commeth to paſſe. Which thing I haue (by experience) in many founde to be true: who for the great and exceſſiue diſtemperance of their wombs, haue continued barraine and childleſſe, albeit their husbands haue beene as likely men to haue begotten children as any. Yea this ſame diſtemperance hath many times bred conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the generatiue partes of manie men, through the ſalſuginous, and frequent vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall humour thereof. To women of ſuch conſtitution, (who for the moſt part are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderatelie thereby giuen to vntamed luſt) theſe <hi>Mandrake</hi> apples may without any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, yea to great purpoſe and auaile be ſafelie giuen: as alſo Pompions, Cucumbers, Gourds, Melons, Purſelane, Lettice, Nightſhade, with ſuch like cooling Simples, whereby that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue heate, and immoderate diſtemperance of the matrix and wombe may be qualified, and conueniently rectified.</p>
            <p>I know right wel that in theſe our Northren parts of the world there are ſundry kindes of Plantes and Herbes, which being naturallie harmefull and pernitious, can not chooſe but empaire and damnifie health, if their dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous qualitie and offenſiue effect be not inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:8922:11"/>
and met withall. This is the reaſon, why we qualifie all thoſe Herbes that are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly colde, with pepper, ginger, &amp; graines of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe: by the which, their malice is reſtrained, &amp; their harmfull qualitie conquered. So, Muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romes &amp; ſuch other excrements of the earth, to the <hi>Italians</hi> and people beyond the <hi>Alpes</hi> are nouriſhable and harmeleſſe, whereas to vs inhabiting this countrey, they are both dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and venemous, vnleſſe their pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous qualitie by ſome hot condiments be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated and maſtered. Moreouer in hot regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, parched and burned with the full force of the Sunne, all thinges attaine the ſooner and the better to their ripenes: whereby it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, that theſe kindes of delicacies, which (as ſtirrers and prouokers of wanton luſt) are ſo highly eſteemed, and ſo inordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſired of theſe laſciuious riotours and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent ſpend-thriftes, to increaſe and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite their beaſtly luſt, do little or nothing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice the health of their bodies.</p>
            <p>But that the Hebrewes in the olde time tooke great delight and made ſingular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Mandrake</hi> for the fragrant ſmell, and ſingular comfortable ſent thereof, may well appeere by that marriage ſong or <hi>Canticle</hi> of <hi>Solomon.</hi> Which maketh me to thinke that it was greatly eſteemed, much deſired, often <note place="margin">Cant. 7, 13.</note> handled, and carried about in <hi>Iurie,</hi> for that it hath in it a verie delicate and pleaſant ſmell, inducing and prouoking ſleepe, which vnto
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:8922:12"/>

The Bridegroom Chriſt therefore (for ſo is he termed by <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, being ſingularly affected toward his Spouſe the Church, which is the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faithfull beleeuers) delighteth in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, than in the aduancement of the honor, dignitie, comelineſſe and beautie of his Bride: neither contrariwiſe, doth the Bride in any thing ſo much delite as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall of kindnes, and recompence of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſies toward hir husband and Spouſe: ſo that betweene them twaine, there is no apt, proper, and reſembling Similitude to bee conueniently gathered either out of the Heauens, Stars, Planets, Mountaines, Hils, Woods, Groues, Fields, Herbes, Flowers, Trees, Wine or Vine, out of which any ſweet, pleaſant, delectable, or wholeſome ſmell, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, or ſent proceedeth; but that the ſame be moſt pithily, and according to the hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable dignitie of either partie moſt fitly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and vpon occaſion moſt orderly and learnedly alledged.</p>
            <p>Thus is the Bridegroome there aptly

            <p>This Lambe was commanded to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with ſower Herbs, or wilde Letuce: for that, in this our wretched life, all things are bitter, troubleſome, greeuous, and full of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie, hauing in it a great deale more <hi>Aloe</hi> than Honie, that is, much greater ſtore of miſerie and miſchiefe, than of ioy and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie.</p>
            <p>Some hold opinion, that vnder the name of Letuce, there be alſo comprehended the Herbs Succorie and Endiue, bearing a white blewiſh flower and iagged: which being kept couered and buried in ſand or grauell, is vſed in winter time for ſalads at the beginning of meales. The vſing and handling of it in this ſort, cauſeth it to forgo and looſe his bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and withall to become excellentlye white, much like to the inner leaues of the great white Cabage or Colewort. And theſe Herbs be verie good and profitable againſt the obſtructions of the Liuer, for that, they haue in reſpect of their bitterneſſe, an abſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue vertue and cleanſing force, opening the

pores and paſſages, and enlarge all oppilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. They be alſo very good to cure the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Ague, and the Iaundice.

            <p>Like vnto theſe in vertue, nature, effect and operation, are the herbs Chondrilla (which we may call Gumme Succorie) the ſoft milke Thiſtle, <hi>Dent de Lion,</hi> or <hi>Rostrum Porcinum,</hi> Hawkeweede called Hieracium; all which haue in them a milke white iuice and yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh flower, very pleaſant and daintie food for Hares and Conies. For by eating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, theſe ſmall Creatures preſerue themſelues from embolning and dropſie-like ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, by reaſon that the bitterneſſe of theſe Herbes, drieth vp their moiſture and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous humor. Wherefore ſuch of them as be not too greatly bitter, are in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Spring, when their leaues be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, good to be vſed in ſalads.</p>
            <p>But that the wilde Letuce (which is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the name of Endiue) was vſed at the eating of the Paſchall Lambe onely as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment or ſauce, I cannot eaſily be perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: bicauſe (by reaſon of the notable nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping bitternes thereof, which biteth the toong) it is not fit to be eaten, neither can it ſerue for foode, nouriſhment or meate, ſauing onely when it firſt ſpringeth vp, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:8922:20"/>
is verie yoong, that is, ere it be armed on his backe ſide with ſharpe prickles. For the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Endiue which is the verie right Wilde Letuce, in bitternes paſſeth all other plants and herbs whatſoeuer that conteine in them white iuyce, ſap or liquor. And therfore Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions vſe to miniſter Endiue in medicine, while it is yoong and tender, and not when it is full growen, prickly, and olde. But the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinds thereof, namely Succory and Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ola, I am fully perſwaded may be vſed as a ſauce or ſeaſoning, to reliſh Lambe being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther roaſt or ſodden: and thereof (aſwell the leaues as the roots) haue our Country folkes learned to make right holeſome and tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Salades. The roote thereof is well neer a cubite and a halfe in length, which many do vſe to ſlit into ſmall partes, like to the red Parſenep or Carot, and ſo to eate it with Oyle, Vineger and Pepper, as they do Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbers, Sampiere, Charlocke or Raponſe, with many ſuch like, as the time and ſeaſon of the yeere doth conueniently yeelde and affoord.</p>

            <p>The leaues of this Tree be long and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, much like to the leaues of a Willow, Wythie or Pryuet, greene at the top, but whitiſh and of an hoarie colour rowarde the neather end, like the white Popler: the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers be ſmall, and many, of colour browne, pleaſantly and delightfullie ſmelling. It bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth berries in maruellous great number, in forme like to an Egge: which when they draw towarde ripenes, are endued with an Oile &amp; fatiuice.

any dolours of the bodie. It ſuppleth the Lyms, and maketh them nymble, actiue and liuely, ſpecially being outwardly applied, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than inwardly receiued.

            <p>This (no doubt) did <hi>Dauid</hi> well knowe, where he expreſſelie mentioneth the ſame, and breaketh out into moſt earneſt, hartie and vehement praiſe, and thankeſgiuing to God for the ſame, and other benefites. <hi>It is</hi>

               <hi>the Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that cauſeth graſſe to grow for the cattel, and herbe for the vſe of man, that he may bring foorth bread out of the earth, and Wyne that maketh glad the hart of man, and Oyle to make the face to ſhine, and Bread to ſtrengthen mans hart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the ſame purpoſe tendeth alſo that ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng of <hi>Plinie,</hi> affirming that, <hi>there be two Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, most holeſome to mans bodie, to wit, inwardly, Wyne, and outwardly, Oyle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That pitifull Samaritane alſo (by whom is <note place="margin">Luk. 10, 34.</note> ment Chriſt) powred Oyle and Wine into the woundes of the man that fell among Theeues, being two moſt excellent things in ſuch caſes to be miniſtred: Wine, to ſcowre, cleanſe and mundifie the wound: and Oyle to ſupple, lenifie, and aſſwage the paine, and to heale the diſtreſſed patient. Heereby is ment and ſignified, that Chriſt (contrarie to the guiſe of the careleſſe Prieſts and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:8922:22"/>
Leuites) healeth with his heauenly doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, afflicted conſciences and wounded Soules, bindeth vp the ſoares of the amazed minde, recureth and ſkinneth the agonies of the troubled conſcience, and that in ſuch ſort, that no appeerance or ſhew thereof is left to be ſeene, that is to ſay, ſo entirely and wholie, that none of all the miſdeedes which he hath afore committed, ſhall be to him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, or once laide to his charge.</p>
            <p>This Oile being inwardly taken, doth mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie and looſe the bellie, aſſwageth all paine, ſwelling and inflammation, ſlicketh and ſmootheth al roughnes and aſperities, daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and encountreth poiſon; it maketh the belly ſoluble and ſlipperie; it prouoketh vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, whereby all noiſome, hurtful and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious things may be the better expelled; it hindereth and letteth through the ſlipperie nature and gliding facultie that is in it, that poiſoned drinks and venemous potions ſhal not pearce or enter into the veines, to the endangering of the bodie with death: yea, it hath this qualitie, propertie and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie alſo further, that being taken afore hand, it withſtandeth dronkennes, and will keepe a man that he ſhall not haſtilie or quickly be ouertaken and cupſhot.</p>
            <p>Vnaduiſedly and beſide the rules of art do ſome deale, that apply and laie to ſuch members as are broken, wrentched, out of ioynt, bruſed, ſhronken, battered and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

by ſome fall, this Oyle or Butter. But the Verdiuyce, or Oyle that is made of the Oliue afore it be full ripe, hath an aſtringent power, and is very good to binde, vnite, knit and conſolidate the ſundred and diſſolued parts of the bodie. But yet, at the firſt, and in the beginning while the wound is green, (if the age of the partie will beare it) it ſhall not be amiſſe to annoint or inſtill into the place ſome Butter or Oyle, (a veine being firſt opened) to aſſwage the paine, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue the clottered and congealed bloud en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered in the ſame.</p>
            <p>For which purpoſe, my vſe and order is to miniſter vnto the partie, a potion made with the powder of Madder and Nutmigs: and afterward to apply vnto them ſome ſuch things as are by nature conſolidatiue, to wit, <note place="margin">A potion conſolida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue.</note> Milfoyle or Yarrow, red roſes before they be full blowen, Myrtle Berries, all the kinds of <hi>Symphitum</hi> or Comfrey, <hi>Sperma Coeti,</hi> right Mumia, Rhabarbe, and Nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The berries are called in euery Countrie almoſt by the name of Oliues: which being <note place="margin">Oliues.</note> gathered afore they be ripe, and while they be yet but newly greene, are vſually kept in pickle or brine, and are excellent good to prouoke appetite, and procure to a man a ſtomacke to his meate; and they be good al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, to withſtand droonkenneſſe, as like wiſe

bitter Almonds be.</p>
            <p>From the fruit and flowers of this Tree or Plant, diuine Writers deriue and fetch ſundrie Similitudes both apt and elegant. So in the booke of <hi>Iob,</hi> where ſpeedie deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is denounced to the wicked and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, it is thus ſaid: <hi>Before his day ſhall God</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iob. 15, 33.</note> 
               <hi>destroy him, and his branch ſhall not be greene: be ſhall be cast out, as the Vine doth hir ſower grape, and as the Oliue doth hir flower.</hi> That is to ſaie, he ſhall bee taken away before his day by quicke and ſudden death, and ſhal not arriue to ripe age.</p>
            <p>And the Similitude is taken from ſuch Trees and freſh Herbs, as in the Spring tide growe vp gallantly, and appeere moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, and yet their bloomes through bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, doe either come to nothing, or elſe are ſhaken downe with the ſturdie ſtormes of nipping windes and tempeſtuous weather. For, God doth not long ſuffer the wicked to enioy their proſperitie, or to haue in all things their wiſhed will and deſired ſucceſſe, but euen in the middeſt of their ſlaunting pride, and when as for age they might haue liued a great while longer, hee cutteth off their daies, and bringeth vpon them a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and ſpeedie deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Thus do we reade, how God haſtened his iudgements, &amp; brought the floud vpon the world, for that they would not be warned, nor repent and amende their wicked liues, <note place="margin">Gen. 6.</note>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:8922:23"/>
but daily grew from woorſe to woorſe. And God threatening ſudden deſtruction, and denouncing dreadfull woes vnto the Prieſts and Ringleaders of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> for their care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe contempt of Religion, whereunto tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough their pride and droonkenneſſe they were fallen, thundereth out his greeuous ire and heauie indignation againſt them for the ſame by his Prophet, where he ſaith: <hi>Woe to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſai. 28, 1.</note> 
               <hi>the Crowne of Pride, the Droonkards of Ephraim: for his glorious beautie ſhall be a fading flower, and as the haſtie fruit afore Sommer and ripening time.</hi> Whereby his meaning is, that they with all their pompe, ſtatelineſſe and arrogancy, ſhal be brought lowe, and thro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>wne downe, as Sommer fruit and ſoone ripe figs, that are by and by with greedineſſe pulled and eaten, and cannot be kept till winter.</p>
            <p>A much like argument doth the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet alſo in another place (as an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor or meſſenger ſent from God) denounce againſt the Aegyptians: <hi>Afore the Haruest when the flowre is finiſhed, and the fruite is riping in the flower, ſhall the branches</hi> (of Aegypt) <hi>be cut downe, and the boughes thereof taken away.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee ſignifieth that the Aegyptians ſhall be ſerued, euen as ſoone ripe fruites, and firſt grapes or berries, which are ripe before their time, and are readie to be eaten afore the ſeaſon that other fruites are. For ſuch kinde of fruites do quickly rot, and will not long be kept, ſo that thereby his plaine mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:8922:24"/>
is, that their felicitie and glorie ſhal not be of any continuance.</p>
            <p>By the Olyue Tree alſo and other Trees beſides, the good ſucceſſe and plentifull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of all things towarde the godlie, togither with the increaſe and continuance of the ſame, is ſignified, which the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> plainely witneſſeth, in his comparing of a godlie and vertuous man fearing God, <hi>to a Tree planted by the water ſide, that is fruitfull</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 1, 3.</note> 
               <hi>and bringeth foorth his fruit in due ſeaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ieremiah</hi> amplifieth and diſcourſeth the ſame Argument more at large, where he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth all calamitie and miſerie to the froward and ſtiffenecked people, that forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Lord God, ſought helpe, refuge and ſuccour in man, and things of vanitie. <hi>Curſed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be the man that trusteth in man, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ierem. 17, 5</note> 
               <hi>maketh fleſh his arme, and withdraweth his hart from the Lord: for he ſhall be like the Heath in the Wildernes, and ſhall not ſee when any good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, but ſhall inhabite the parched places, in a ſalt hungrie and fruitleſſe ſoyle. But bleſſed be the man that trusteth in the Lord, and putteth all his trust and confidence in him. For he ſhall be as a Tree that is planted by the ryuer, and ſhall not feele when the heate commeth, but hir leafe ſhall be greene, and ſhall not care for the time of drought, neither ſhall ceaſe from yeelding fruite.</hi> By theſe and ſuch like Metaphors is the ſtedfaſt truſt that ought to be wholie put in God, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ſet foorth: ſignifieng that our hart,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:8922:24"/>
minde, hope and cogitations, ought not to depend on any other, not to be directed to any other, than to him alone, from whom all goodneſſe floweth, and who is moſt bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, willing and ready to giue all manner of good things vnto men (truly calling vppon him) in moſt large and ample foiſon.</p>
            <p>Heerupon it was that <hi>Dauid</hi> relying vpon God, and ſtaieng himſelfe vnder his gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and protection, rather than vpon any vaine, tranſitorie, and momentanie things of the world, contrarie to the guiſe, cuſtome, and maner of the wicked, ſaith thus: <hi>I ſhal be</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 52, 8.</note> 
               <hi>like a greene Oliue tree in the houſe of God: for I trust in the mercies of God for euer.</hi> Again, where he deſcribeth and ſetteth out the bleſſednes and plentie that ſhal light vpon the man that is not idle, but feareth the Lord and walketh in his commandements: and the fruitfulnes that ſhall be giuen to his wife, he ſaith: <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 128.</note> 
               <hi>is the man that feareth the Lord and walketh in his waies, he ſhall eate the labours of his hands, &amp; all things ſhal go wel with him: His wife ſhal be as the fruitfull Vine on the ſides of his houſe: His children as the Oliue branches round about his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Lo, thus ſhal the man be bleſſed that feareth the Lord.</hi> Likewiſe in the propheſie of <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> God calleth the people: that he taketh ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular delight in, <hi>A greene Oliue tree, a faire and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ier. 11, 16.</note> 
               <hi>of goodlie fruit,</hi> which is, as though he ſhould ſay, the name of it is vnto him pleaſant, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and amiable.</p>
            <p>

            <p>Thus did <hi>Michah</hi> the prophet bewaile the want and contempt of Religion, the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw and decay of godlines, the ſubuerſion of iuſtice, the prophanation of Diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and finally the lamentable reuolt of all men in generall from vertue, honeſty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie.

            </p>
            <p>And therfore where ſuch kinde of perſons beare rule and be placed in office, his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that there the ſtate of things is ſuch by meanes of whiſpering Talecariers, and ſecret priers into euery mans life, maners &amp; trade, that no man can ſafelie truſt an other, nor reueale his ſecrets and open his counſell, no not to his familiar friende and knowne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance.</p>
            <p>For where ſuch diſorder reigneth, that mens caſes and eſtates be ſo narrowly ſifted, and their deeds and words ſo vndermining<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſearched, the harts of many doe quayle, their courages be daunted, their mindes be diſmaied, and they brought euen to their wits ende; inſomuch that they not onely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake and miſtruſt their friendes, but manie times bewray &amp; betray them: which things Chriſt himſelfe foretolde ſhoulde come to <note place="margin">Mat. 10, 35.

            <p>Therefore in this ſo dangerous, doubtful, and wauering truſt and faithfulnes, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet further warneth vs what to do, ſaieng: <hi>Trust ye not a friend, neither put ye confidence in a counſellour. Keepe the doores of thy mouth from hir
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:8922:39"/>
that lieth in thy boſome:</hi> that is, diſcloſe not thy minde, no not to thine owne wife. <hi>For the Sonne reuileth the Father, the Daughter riſeth vp against hir Mother: the Daughter in law againſt hir Mother in law: and a mans enimies are the men of his owne houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this ſo lamentable a garboyle and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered ſtate of the common wealth, he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth euery man, which way to worke, and whereunto hee may beſt and ſafeſt betake himſelfe; ſaieng: <hi>Therefore will I looke vnto the Lord, I will waite for God my Sauiour. My God will heare me.</hi> Heere he hauing his full hope and aſſured confidence grounded vppon God, reſteth vndoubtedly perſwaded, that God will deliuer and preſerue him againſt al the violent, proude and cruel rage of all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked oppreſſours.</p>
            <p>For whereas God is gentle, milde and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable, they on the other ſide be raging, fierce, cruell, ſpightfull, churliſh, vncurteous and (like thornes, brembles, and briers) ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with ſharp prickles, and poynant ends, whereby they hurt, wounde, and damnifie thoſe that be innocent, harmeleſſe, helpleſſe, and comfortleſſe.</p>
            <p>We ſee therefore how heere from Prickly plants the Prophet borroweth a Similitude, whereby aptly to expreſſe, and exactly to ſet downe the nature, propertie and condition of wilfull and wicked men. For the Furze, Bryer, Bremble, Eglentine, Berberie buſh,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:8922:39"/>
(if we onely reſpect their flowers and ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, are to the eie right pleaſant and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and in caſes of Phyſicke and medieine, haue their profitable and neceſſarie vſes) but in handling they are dangerous, and like ynough to gaſh, ſplit, and wound the hand of a man that raſhly and vnaduiſedly toucheth them.</p>
            <p>And in like ſort, there be ſome ſlie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, craftie ſhifters, ſubtill mates, &amp; double dealing diſſemblers, who at the firſt bluſh do outwardly in ſhew pretend much friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and ſpeake ſmoothly, but if they may once vpon any light occaſion, eſpie occaſion and oportunitie to vtter foorth their inward ſpight, or where to worke their diueliſh and cankred malice, they will be found (I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you) readie ynough both to prick, ſting, and wound to the vttermoſt.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Paliurus</hi> being (as hath afore been ſaid) a kinde of ſharpe prickly Furze or Brier, is deſcribed by <hi>Theophrastus, Virgil, Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, Dioſcorides, Columella</hi> and others, with ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral conſent to be ſharpe, thornie, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to the handler: howbeit they do not all agree about the deſcription of his forme and faſhion.</p>
            <p>Not much vnlike, is it to that which we commonly call Berberies, termed in Greeke <hi>Oxyacantha,</hi> where with ſome (for the gallant beautie and ſeemely ſhewe) vſe to decke and adorne their doores, and to keepe the ſlips

            <p>When the flowring and blowing time is paſt, it bringeth foorth berries being at the firſt greene, and in faſhion ſomewhat long, which when they be ripe, become red of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and haue within, a harde ſtone, enuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and encompaſſed with a ſmall ſlender and thin skin or rind.

            <p>Thus much haue I thought not amiſſe heere by the way to note; to the intent, the mind and purpoſe of the Prophet might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly and plainly be found out: whoſe onely drift is in this place to ſhew, that God doth nothing raſhly, vnaduiſedly, diſorderly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly, by chance or at randon, but in all his actions dealeth moſt wiſely, orderly, adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:8922:42"/>
deliberately, and both by law and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: one while ſending puniſhments and plagues, to repreſſe mens inordinate luſts and outragious behauiours; and another while curing their wounds, healing their ſores, ſuppling their grieues, comforting their diſtreſſed minds, and relieuing their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Conſciences. Which thing he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while haſteneth to put in execution and practiſe; ſomewhile lingereth ere hee take the matter in hand; and ſomewhile ſhewing foorth his mightie power both waies vpon the ſudden, euen as it ſeemeth good in his eies, and as he ſeeth it expedient, when occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſerueth.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the Prophet admoniſheth all thoſe, that thinke otherwiſe than reuerently and dutifully of the iudgements of God, ſpeedily to reforme their opinions, carefully to circumciſe their affections, awfully to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard his holie word, religiouſly to thinke of his ſacred Maieſtie and diuine Prouidence, highly to extoll his name, reuerently to ſpeake, and dutifully to thinke of him: and neither to murmur, repine, mutter, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him in his dealings, when as they ſee the wicked to flaunt and flouriſh in all proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie, and to enioy abundance of all things to their harts deſire: whereas in the meane while the godlie be throwen into miſeries, afflicted with cares, pinched with paines, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with wrongs, and ech way laid open
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:8922:42"/>
to calamities, vexations, and troubles of the world. For the Lord by his heauenly wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and vnſearchable counſell, doth go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne and rule the world, and al things ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, iuſtly, wiſely, and rightly.</p>
            <p>For the better beautifieng, and garniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his matter in this behalfe, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet vſeth a very fit Similitude, borowed from the induſtrious toile of husbandmen, and from the manner, order, and trade of plowing, ſowing, and thraſhing. For, the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmau at certaine ſeaſons of the yeere, fallowing and turning vp his land, caſteth his ſeede into the furrowes thereof in due proportion and meaſure, according to the nature of the ſoile, &amp; qualitie of the ground; ſowing in one place Wheate or Barlie, and in another <hi>Gith,</hi> Lupines, Spelt, Millet, or ſome ſuch kinde of Pulſe. Neither doth he raſhly and harebrainedly ſhuffle all maner of ſeedes togither, and ſo deſperately and fondly caſt the ſame on the ground, but aduiſedly and diſcreetely pondereth with himſelfe, what place and ſoile is fitteſt for each ſeuerall graine.</p>
            <p>The ſowing time being paſt, he thinketh not himſelf diſcharged of care, neither giues he himſelfe to eaſe and idlenes, but longing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, hopeth for his Harueſt, and many a time wiſheth for the time wherein he may reape his laboured crop: and in the meane while (ere the corne be ripe) he weedeth it, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:8922:43"/>
his ſeruants to worke, to plucke vp the Darnel, Thiſtels, and other noiſom baggage, that would otherwiſe choke the Corne.</p>
            <p>After he hath inned and brought it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Barnes, he ſitteth not ſtill, neither gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth he himſelfe to eaſe, but as one worke endeth, ſo beginneth he an other, and the ende of one labour is the entrance into an other.</p>
            <p>For then goeth he about to thraſh, fanne, and winnow it, and that ſo carefully, that he will not confuſedly iumble and mingle one ſeed with an other, but make cleane the ſame in order, and euery kinde by it ſelfe, as to the nature thereof appertaineth. As namelie, in one ſort dealeth hee with ſmall and ſlender ſeedes, in an other ſort with them that bee great and big: and in an other, with Wheat, Barley, Rie, Otes, Amilcorne, Lupines, Beanes, Fitches, Lentils, Cumin, Gith, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>As a painefull and carefull Husbandman therefore looketh diligently to all points of his buſines, and beſtoweth his induſtry and labour in ech reſpect, as the time and ſeaſon affoordeth, and as the nature and qualitie of ech Graine requireth, in hope thereby to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a good encreaſe and plentifull crop: Euen ſo God trieth ech way, to drawe and bring all men, of all ſorts, and condition in this Theatre of the world, to acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their duties, &amp; deſire of their ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And as an Husbandman after he hath
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:8922:43"/>
plowed vp his land, and ſowed it, doth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde harrow it, and breake the harde clods thereof: as he (I ſay) ſoweth, reapeth, thraſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, fanneth and ſearceth the chaffe from the Corne as he cutteth, pruneth and lop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth his trees, and keepeth them vnder, leaſt they ſhoulde growe rugged, or ſpread their boughes to far out of courſe and order: and finallie as he graffeth, planteth, and teacheth his yoong Siences to be naturalized in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtocke than their own: So likewiſe doth God deale with men in this world, puniſhing and afflicting ſome with loſſes, hinderances, and other tokens of his hidden iudgement, for the better trial of their patience and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie: Some (though euill and wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons) he tollerateth, ſpareth, and (as it were) winketh at, in hope of their conuerſion and amendment.</p>
            <p>Neither may any man be ſo hardie as once to mutter or murmure for the ſame againſt him, ſith by his prouidence he wiſely diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and gouerneth all things, and beſt kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth why and for what reaſon he doth this or that. Wherefore if any aduerſitie ſurprize vs, if any trouble aſſaile vs, if ſicknes attach vs, if calamities, plagues, or other encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances of this life infeſt and follow vs, let vs be perſwaded that all theſe things are ſent to vs from God, as meanes to worke in vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of our former wickednes, whereby we may flee to him for ſuccor, comfort, and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:8922:44"/>
releefe; in whom onely conſiſteth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth our whole hope, entire affiance, and perfect ſaluation.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, if all thinges go well with vs, and according to our harts deſire, if wealth encreaſe, if riches abound, if lands, liuing, and reuenewes, honors, dignities, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, goods and cattels be multiplied and heaped vpon vs; if health, ſtrength, courage, luſtines and ſoundnes of bodie be giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs; let vs meekely and humbly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, from whom all theſe do flow; and let vs be vndoubtedly perſwaded, that all things aſwell in time of proſperitie, as of aduerſitie, come vnto vs by his diuine ordinance, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, direction and appointment.</p>
            <p>And this doth he not onely moſt nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie declare and ſignifie; where he putteth <hi>Cyrus</hi> the king of <hi>Perſia</hi> in remembrance of his duty, by acknowledging how that by the power and might of God, and for the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſake his choſen people, all things went lucki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and proſperouſlie forward with him, and nations were ſubdued &amp; brought in ſubiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnder him: but alſo thereby he teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto all men in generall, that God is Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie and able to bring al things to paſſe, whenſoeuer and which way ſoeuer he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth: which might and power as in other places he ſetteth out right diuinely, ſo ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally &amp; namely in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> he moſt liuely and pithilie ſetteth the ſame downe,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:8922:44"/>
where he ſaith thus: <hi>I am the Lord, and there is</hi>

               <hi>none other: there is no God beſides me: I forme the light, and create darknes: I make peace, and create euill: I the Lord do all theſe things.</hi> Whereby he meaneth, that proſperous ſucceſſe is his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly gift: and that loſſes, hinderances, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities, ſpoile, peſtilence, hunger, war, and ſuch like, be ſent of him as puniſhments and reuengements of our wicked life and hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous tranſgreſſions. For hee it is, that ſo ſtrengtheneth ſuch as faithfully depende on him, and vnfainedly leane vnto his protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they liue a good, a quiet, &amp; a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able life. Contrarily, ſuch as wallow in the filthie puddle and ſwiniſh mire of lewd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour and careleſſe dealings, ſhall taſte of the whip of his ire, and bee plagued with greeuous puniſhments, according to their euill demerits.</p>
            <p>The Lord appointed the office and functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an husbandman vnto <hi>Ieremiah</hi> alſo, <note place="margin">Ierem. 1, 9.</note> whoſe mouth he touched with his hand, ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng: <hi>Behold, I haue put my words in thy mouth: Behold, this day haue I ſet thee ouer the nations, and ouer the kingdoms, to plucke vp and to roote out, and to destroy and throwe downe, to builde and to plant.</hi> Whereby he meaneth, that he being fortified and armed with the power of his word, ſhould haue ſtrength to pull vp Sinne by the rootes, to weede out errors, to grub out of the minds and conſciences of men, their outragious, diſſolute, and enormious
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:8922:45"/>
affections: and in ſteede thereof, to plant in them the ſeede of godlineſſe, to inſtill into their harts the wholſome doctrine of faith, and entirely to inflame them with an vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned loue toward the true and liuing God.</p>
            <p>The like Argument doth our Sauiour Chriſt handle, where he taketh a Similitude from the vine and his Branches, ſaieng: <hi>I am</hi>

               <hi>the true Vine, and my father is an Huſbandman. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie Branch that beareth not fruit in me,</hi> that is, that ſheweth not foorth his faith by the works of loue, <hi>he taketh away,</hi> and cutteth downe as vnprofitable ſpray, fit for nothing, but for the fire: but <hi>euerie Branch that bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth fruit, he purgeth,</hi> (lopping and ſhredding away all vicious, corrupt, and naughtie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections) <hi>that it may bring foorth more fruit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not vnlike vnto this, is that excellent Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude which the Apoſtle vſeth, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the graffing in of the wilde <hi>Oliue</hi> tree into the true and right Oliue, and of the breaking off, of the boughes and branches from the naturall Oliue. Whereby he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <note place="margin">Rom. 11, 17</note> none other thing, but that ſome were fallen from their happie eſtate, of glorious ſaluation; and that others were choſen and receiued into the number of the faithful, not for any deſert of theirs at al, but onely by the meere fauor, ſingular mercie, and free grace of God. Which benefit, vnleſſe they thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acknowledge, dutifully remember, and conſtantly perſiſt in faith, he pronounceth
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:8922:45"/>
that they ſhall be cut off againe, and for their ingratitude reiected from the fellowſhip of God: and that thoſe ſhall be againe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and regraffed in, if they abide not in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe; but by hartie repentance call vnto God for mercie, loath and deteſt their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſinnes and wicked life, ſeeke health, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace truth, and faithfully beleeue in God, whom afore they had forſaken.</p>

vpon ſurmiſe of incontinencie and adulterous life, through the cankered ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion and falſe accuſation of two craftie old Lechours, that burned in luſt towardes hir: <hi>Daniel</hi> (being then but a yoong childe, and raiſed vp of the Lord to examine and ſifte out the bloodie treacherie intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt hir) by his wiſe and heauenly policie, ſearched out the bottome of the matter, boulted out the truth, diſcuſſed the cauſe, and finally deliuered the innocent Ladie, both from the preſent danger of death, and alſo from all maner ſuſpition of crime and filthines. For when as ſhe was led foorth <note place="margin">Dan. 13.</note> to be put to death, being faultleſſe and guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, committing and referring both hir ſelf and hir cauſe vnto God, <hi>Daniell</hi> by the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirite of the Lorde, lifted vp his voice, and cried aloud, proteſting himſelfe to be cleere and free from the bloode of that chaſte woman, who was there and then moſt wrongfully without deſert adiudged to die, willing them to enquire further of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and more narrowly to ſearch out the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of ſuch an horrible practiſe.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the Elders and Counſailours being a new aſſembled, and the matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againe before the whole audience of the people with aduiſed deliberation, brought into queſtion, <hi>Daniel</hi> cauſed the two Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers to be put aſide, and kept a ſunder the one from the other. Which done, hee firſt
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:8922:46"/>
called foorth the one, and demaunded of him, vnder what Tree he ſawe them compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieng togither? <hi>Vnder a Lentiske tree:</hi> (quoth he.) At the hearing whereof <hi>Daniel</hi> ſharpelie reproouing him for his ſhameleſſe lie, and falſe teſtimonie, and thundring againſt him the heauie wrath and ſeuere iudgement of God, deſeruedly due vnto him for the ſame, put him aſide. Then calling the other foorth, and likewiſe asking him, vnder what tree, he tooke them companieng togither? <hi>Vnder a Prime tree,</hi> (ſaid he.) Therefore were they both according to their wicked deſerts, put to death, and ſerued with the ſame ſauce, that they had prepared for others, according to <note place="margin">Deu. 19, 19. Prou. 19, 5. Dan. 13, 62.</note> the Lawe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> for that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicted to haue borne falſe witnes, &amp; to haue wrongfully accuſed another.</p>
            <p>But now ſomwhat by the way to deſcribe the nature of this <hi>Lentiske</hi> tree: it is a tree of a reaſonable bignes and meane ſiſe, broade in compaſſe, and leaued like an Aſhe, bearing many ſmall red berries, couched cloſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither in round cluſters, which when they be full ripe, are of a blackiſh colour. This Tree yeeldeth foorth a kinde of Roſen or Gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie iuice, (like as the Terebinthin Tree doth) which is called Maſticke, which grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not togither as other Roſens doe; but remaine a ſunder in diuers ſmall graines, or partes like kernels, or little white roundels. And this Maſticke is verie ſoueraigne to dry
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:8922:47"/>
vp rheumes and catarrhes, and to ſtop all common laskes and bloodie flixes, and all other fluxes of blood whatſoeuer. A perfume made therewith, or chawing the ſame in the mouth, ſaſteneth the teeth that be looſe, and maketh a ſweete breath.</p>
            <p>Of this Tree there be made in <hi>Italie</hi> fine Toothpickers, like as they doe in the Lowe Countries, of Iuniper and Baies, verie good to clenſe, whiten and mundifie the teeth withall. Inſomuch that it is growen into a common byworde or prouerbe, when we wil note any perſons that be too curious and preciſe in trimming themſelues, or beſtowe too much diligence in poliſhing and dreſſing their teeth, to ſay that he <hi>chaweth Lentiske.</hi> We in theſe Countries make Toothpickers, ſometimes of the Bittours claw being ſet ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in golde, ſiluer or iuorie, ſometimes of the bones of the fiſh Paſtinaca or Galeus. But the beſt of all be made of this Lentiske, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do not only no hurt to the gums, but alſo do rather by meanes of their aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent nature, binde and comfort both them and the iawes. And that theſe were in vſe in the olde time, the Poet Martiall well witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth where he ſaith:</p>

            </p>
            <p>This Tree is reckoned among ſuch as bear Maſte, whoſe leaues bee at all times of the yeere, greene, without falling or withering: whereon there alſo groweth a kinde of Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelto, which Phiſicions doe vſe, as an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent remedie againſt the Epilepſie or falling ſicknes, and ſuch other diſeaſes engendred of exceſſiue and abounding humors.</p>
            <p>There is one kinde of this Prime or Ilex, that beareth the fine Graine, which Diers vſe to engraine the Cloth or ſilke into a moſt orient and gallant red colour. And there is another kinde of Graine not much vnlike vnto this, which is found in the Huluer tree, whoſe leaues are on each ſide prickly and ſharpe, but all the other parts therof ſmooth and plaine, which in <hi>Brabant</hi> groweth in hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and high waies, and ſeldome reacheth to any high ſtature. Yet haue I ſeene of them neere to <hi>Zirickzea,</hi> that haue beene as big as a Prime tree, which being diligently looked vnto, and often pruned and trimmed by the owners, haue growen to be very high and tall. About the beginning of Autumne it beareth berries round like a Peaſe, and of an excellent red colour, ſuch as doth our Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holme,

            <p>But now in the bright ſhining light of the glorious Goſpell, we muſt rather reſpect the inwarde and ſpirituall ornamentes, than any outwarde, gariſh and pompious attyre, and muſt rayſe vp our mindes to thinges that be of more behoofe and importance for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and comfort. For the outward bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie and pompous magnificence of rich &amp; ſumptuous attire, doth many times nuz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle ſuperſtition in the conſciences of the ſimpler ſort, and dazell the eies of their mindes, with an admiration of thoſe things which God either would haue to be lightlie eſteemed, or at leaſt way, to be emploied to moderate vſes. And of this ſort be theſe pals

and copes wrought with gold, pearles, and precious ſtones, clokes, garments, and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, of blew azure, purple, skarlet, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther coſtly colours, artificially and curiouſlie bedected and garniſhed.</p>
            <p>The name of this colour, is taken partlie from the gallant gem and beautifull ſtone <note place="margin">Hyacinth or Iacinct, a pretious ſtone.</note> called Iacinct, hauing a moſt radiant tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of violet colour: and partly from an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable and delightſome flower of the ſame name, of a perfect Azure or purple colour, <note place="margin">Hvacinth an Herbe.</note> ſuch as is in the precious ſtone called an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>methiſt, or in common Bugloſſe and ſundry other Herbs, whoſe flowers being of bright purple colour, be maruellous pleaſant and delightfull to the eies of the beholders.</p>
            <p>And God doth many times and in many places in his worde ſharpely reprooue the ſtately arrogance, and pompous prid of ſuch vaine perſons, as by the brauerie of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, and ſumptuous araie, aduance them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in bragging ſort and ridiculous oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, malapertly and ſcornefully contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning others of inferiour calling. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times heerehence he taketh apt Metaphors and fit Similitudes, applieng the ſame to the inward gifts, and ornaments of the minde. For by ſuch examples doth the Lord ſtir vp and admoniſh ſuch, as be lulled and rocked in the cradle of Security and ſlouthful retch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſeneſſe, to looke about them and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their dutie, which they owe vnto
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:8922:49"/>
God: to conſider what honor and worſhip they are bound to yeeld vnto him, and how (caſting aſide, deteſting, abhorring and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing all ſuperſtition and Idolatrie) they ought entirely to embrace his pure, ſincere, and ſound religion.</p>
            <p>Which thing both in other places, but namely by his Prophet <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> he plainelie <note place="margin">Ezec. 16.</note> ſetteth downe and manifeſtly diſplaieth. For, firſt he putteth them in remembrance, what great and ineſtimable benefits he had beſtowed vpon them, how bountiful and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral he had ſhewed himſelfe towards them: what grace and goodnes both ſpirituall and temporall he had extended vpon them: what holeſome lawes and profitable precepts he had deliuered vnto them, and how fatherlie he had inſtructed them with the ſoueraigne skil of his moſt bleſſed and ſincere Religion.</p>
            <p>Afterwards he expoſtulateth with them for their reuolt and ſliding back, he vpbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them with their ingratitude &amp; vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, for that they had abuſed all theſe his heauenly bleſſings, and conuerted the ſame to Idolatrous purpoſes, ſtrange worſhips and prophane ſuperſtitions: inſomuch that their minde, reaſon, vnderſtanding and wit, was not now emploied (as it ought to haue bin) in magnifieng his holie name, and ſetting forth his glorious maieſtie, nor in the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and obſeruance of his ſacred and pure Religion, but in ſetting vp and eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing

Idolatrous, ſuperſtitious, counterfaite and hypocriticall deuiſes, forged out of their owne idle braines.</p>
            <p>Thus therefore doth he ratingly and chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly direct his ſpeech vnto Ieruſalem, ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng: <hi>When as thou wast naked, poore, needie, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,</hi>

And although thou waſt in this age, yet waſt thou naked and bare, and lay open (contrary to the natural ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtnes of womanhoode) to the gazing view of all paſſengers. Yet when I paſſed by thee and looked vpon thee, perceiuing thee to be of ſuch ripe age, and mariageable yeeres, fit to be wooed and ſought vnto by ſuters and wooers, <hi>I ſpred my skirtes ouer thee and couered thy filthines,</hi> and I ſhrowded from the fight of men, thoſe things that might not with any modeſtie &amp; ſhamefaſtnes be ſeene. <hi>Yea I ſware vnto thee,</hi> and by a new couenant betrothed thee vnto my ſelfe, and made thee mine.

            <p>In all which proceſſe of words his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is none other than this: namely to ſhew, that as an adulterous woman by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of hir bodie becommeth impudent and infamous, ſo was <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> defiled with Idolatrie: in that ſhe beſtowed that honor, worſhip, and ſeruice vpon Diuels and Idols, which in right was onely due vnto God, on whom alone dependeth the whole hope, health, and ſaluation of all men.

            <p>And there be of Roſen (as there is likewiſe of pitch) two differences or ſorts; the one li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quide and currant; the other drie and cleere.

            <p>Whereby is ment the ſtate of mankinde, through Sathans malice, deſpoiled of his robes of innocencie and integritie, and left full fraught and miſerably peſtered with all ſinne and wickednes, like (euen) to ſterue and be throwne headlong into the gulph of deſperation.</p>

Touching which point, we reade a moſt comfortable and ſweete diſcourſe in the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> wherein the Lord our God complaineth him ſelfe of our to too wilfull diſobedience; and vttereth ſpeeches of great greefe, for that mankinde ſeeketh aide and helpe elſe where than at him, and that they polluting &amp; defiling themſelues with groſſe idolatrie, ſuperſtition, vaine worſhip and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous tromperies, do moſt vnkindly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake ſo liberall and ſo bountifull a Lorde, to ſerue in miſerable thraldome and ſlauerie, a cruell, craftie and bloody Tyrant.</p>
            <p>Not without cauſe therefore doth he thus reaſon the matter with his people: <hi>Am I</hi>

               <hi>become as a wildernes vnto Iſraell, or a lande that hath no light? Wherefore then ſaith my people, we are Lords, we will come no more vnto thee?</hi>

            <p>Which Similitude is taken from a barren ſoile, and fruitleſſe ground that beareth no corne, graine nor fruite for mans vſe and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation. Whereas on the other ſide, the Lorde God, the Creator and maker of all things, is moſt farre from all ſuch ſterilitie: yea with him is all plentie and aboundance that can poſſibly be conceiued, readie at all times to be had and enioyed, if we coulde thankefully receiue them, and hartily ſue for them. So that all they be vtterly and ech way inexcuſable, that ſhrinke and ſtart from ſuch a bountiful Lord, ſith there can no law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or reaſonable cauſe of ſuch peeuiſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolt

be by any colour alledged, why they ſhould ſo do. And therfore (as it were) great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mooued with the trecherous indignitie of ſuch a foul diſparagement, he laieth open the hainouſnes of their crime, by another exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſaieng: <hi>Can a maide forget hir ornaments, or a Bride hir attyre? Yet my people haue forgotten me, daies without number.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in theſe heauenly offers of ſoueraigne remedies, and cordiall medicines to afflicted mindes, the Lord (with all) inſulteth &amp; ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taunteth the people of Aegypt, bicauſe they applied and laid to their woundes ſuch medicines and emplaiſters, as were no maner of way, auaileable or profitable, but rather encreaſed, than mitigated their greefe and maladie. And therefore he ſheweth them, where and whence they ſhoulde ſeeke for helpe, and to whom to ſue for their recure: <hi>Go vp</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>vnto Gilead, and take Roſen</hi> (or Balme) <hi>O Virgin, the daughter of Aegypt: but</hi>

            <p>Now, Gilead was one of the ſixe franchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Townes, appointed to be as Cities of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge <note place="margin">Gilead, a Sanctuarie or place of refuge.

            <p>The Prophet therefore directing his ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to the afflicted, ſheweth him that all helpe muſt come from God, and that for his direction in the way of godlines, he ought to reſort vnto his godly miniſters.

            <p>
               <hi>Ieremiah</hi> prophecieng the deſtruction of Babylon, which was as a filthie ſinke of all wickednes, warneth all men to take heede and to withdrawe themſelues from hir: and <note place="margin">Ierem. 50.</note> for that ſhe had refuſed all holeſome admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, and turned the deafe care vnto all ghoſtly counſels and ſpirituall aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he warneth all men to abandon hir companie, and vtterly to reiect and forſake hir, as ſorlorne, deſperate and incurable.</p>
            <p>Whereby the Prophet ſheweth, that the Preachers and miniſters of the word of God vſed and applied all poſſible remedies for the curing of their diſeaſes, and healing of their ruſtie and feſtered woundes; and that they left no way vnattempted to purge their

harts and minds from errours: but all was in vaine.</p>

               <note place="margin">Hoſe. 14, 4.</note> 
               <hi>For mine anger is turned away from them. I will be as the dew vnto Iſrael: he ſhall grow as the Lillie; and his roote ſhall breake out as the trees of Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. His branches ſhall ſpread, and his beautie ſhall be as the Oliue tree, and his ſmell as Lebanon. They that dwell vnder his ſhadow, ſhall returne, and growe vp as the corne, and flouriſh as the Vine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which words he couertly meaneth foy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, plentie, aboundance and proſperitie in all thinges; and that the ſtate of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth ſhoulde be flouriſhing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed, not wanting any thing, appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the inwarde beautifieng and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of the minde.</p>
            <p>Whereas to them that bee vnmindefull of Gods benefits, and ſwiniſhly wallow ſtill in their puddle of pleaſures, wantonneſſe and ſenſualitie, all thinges ſhall happen and come to paſſe cleane contrarie, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> witneſſeth: namely, that their <hi>Vines</hi> ſhal be rooted vp, that there ſhall be no <note place="margin">Iſai. 24, 7.</note> Vintage, and that Wine ſhall faile to them that vſually ſolace themſelues with ſongs

and muſicall inſtruments, at their bankets and feaſtes, and to ſuch as are all vppon the hoigh in their iolitie and huffing moode. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, that ſuch ſhall be the miſerie, deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, waſte, and maſſacre among them, that the people (which be the honor, beauty, and ſtrength of their Cities) ſhould be deſtroied, and ſo brought (in a maner) to nothing, that few or none of them ſhall be left aliue. For he flatly telleth them, that euen ſuch ſhall their caſe be, <hi>as is of Oliues when they bee ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off from the Oliue tree, and as the Grapes when the Vintage is ended.</hi> For as the fruits in the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of theſe and ſuch like trees, be not ſo generally all gathered, but that ſome remain and be left on the tree: ſo of the great and wofull calamitie which they ſhoulde ſuffer, ſome ſmall number ſhoulde remaine vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied.</p>
            <p>The like Argument doth the Lord handle and proſecute by his Prophet <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing vpon the wicked not onely ruine and deſolation, but alſo penurie, dearth and famine, inſomuch that there ſhoulde <hi>be no Grapes on the Vine, nor fig on the fig tree;</hi> and that <note place="margin">and 48, 33.

Whereby he ſignifieth, that the famine ſhould be moſt extreeme and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medileſſe, and that the ſoules likewiſe ſhould be miſerably hungerſterued; and finally that euery mothers ſonne of them ſhould be
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:8922:75"/>
gleaned away and gathered, euen as figs and Grapes, ſo that few or none ſhould eſcape or be left behinde.</p>
            <p>And as ripe Grapes doe reliſh ſauourely, and with their pleaſant and tooth ſome iuyce do ſingularly refreſh the palate, &amp; delite the throate: Euen ſo ſounde doctrine, holeſome admonition, and gratious ſpeeches do cheer the ſpirites, and comfort the mindes of men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> likewiſe compareth peſtilent and noiſome doctrine, and the companie, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, familiaritie, conuerſation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, life, maners and dealings of wicked perſons, vnto venemous &amp; poyſoned grapes, which with their peſtiferous and dangerous iuyce do infect the mindes (that are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe well trained and diſpoſed) and carrie them cleane away from the true worſhip and religion of God: <hi>Their Vine</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is of the</hi>

               <hi>Vine of Sodom, and of the fieldes of Gomorrha: their Grapes are grapes of Gall: their clusters bee bitter. Their Wine is the poyſon of Dragons, and the cruell gall of Aſpes.</hi> That is, their ſpeech is ſo peſtilent and venemous, that it euen pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently infecteth, and foorthwith ſlaieth.</p>
            <p>To the ſame purpoſe is alſo that ſaieng, ſharpe reprehenſion, and nipping ſubſanna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Hoſea,</hi> againſt thoſe that followe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, and ſeeke after ſtrange gods, euen as drunkards that wholy giue themſelues to bibbing and ſwilling. <hi>They haue reſpect</hi> (ſaith <note place="margin">Hoſe. 3, 1.</note>

            <p>But foraſmuch as we are now entred into this diſcourſe of the <hi>Vine,</hi> this is by the way to be noted, that the Prophets of God, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of the <hi>Uine,</hi> Grapes and other <note place="margin">Iſa. 17, 6. 10</note> Plants, doe ſignifie and meane ſomewhile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance and fertilitie: ſomewhile dearth and ſcarcitie: ſomewhile fewneſſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the people: and ſomewhile the great ſtore and multitude; which of few, doe growe vnto a very populous increaſe and number.</p>
            <p>So in the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> we read how the Lord by an elegant Metaphor pronounceth that the <hi>Idum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:8922:76"/>
               <hi>But I</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>haue left Eſau bare, and diſcouered his ſecrets,</hi> that he ſhall not be able to hide himſelfe, or any thing that he hath.</p>
            <p>And as all pride, arrogancie and hawtines comming of aboundance and proſperitie, (wherwith thankleſſe Caitifs, droonken with wealth, do grow ſtately and inſolent) is vnto Almightie God, odious and deteſtable: ſo doth he in ſundrie places ſharpely reprooue and vehemently beate downe the ſame: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing and giuing ſeuere ſentence againſt all ſuch as are ſtained therewith: that albeit they ſeeme for a while to flouriſh, and ſtand ſcotfree, yet ſhall they be cut downe, as corne which the Mowers with full handfuls mowe and reape: ſo that euen thoſe few which ſhall be left of many, ſhall alſo be gleaned and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered vp, as the eares are gleaned in the end of harueſt. And yet ſome he promiſeth to leaue, bringing another Similitude; euen as Grapes are left on the Vines, and Oliue ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on the Oliue tree.</p>
            <p>For as in Vintage time the Grape-ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering cannot be ſo cleane, but that ſome be left behind; nor the ſhaking off of Oliues ſo preciſely done, but that ſome berries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, either among the leaues, or in the top of the tree: euen ſo in the dolefull maſſacre and lamentable deſtruction of the people, there ſhould not bee made ſuch a generall ſweepeſtake, but that ſome ſhould be left and reſerued vnder hope of mercie. <hi>In that</hi>

Yet ſhall not the gleaning be ſo, but that ſome gathering of eares ſhall be left, and ſome Grapes and Oliues remaine: as of two or three berries in the top of the vpmost boughes; and of fower or fiue in the high fruitfull branches.</hi> Whereby his meaning is, that the rich Cobs and head Rulers (ſwelling with pride and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancie) ſhould be throwen downe and rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated: but of the poore Communaltie and ſeelie inferiour people, there ſhould a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant be left, as in the Vintage ſeaſon it is ſeene to come to paſſe, that ſome cluſters and berries be left, wherwith the poore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are ſomewhat refreſhed and releeued.</p>

               <p>Of Hyſope.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>HYſope is a Garden herbe of excellent ſmell and pleaſant taſte, and therfore good to be vſed in broths; for that, being boiled with meats, it maketh the ſame not onely wholeſome, but the better alſo in reliſh and ſauour.</p>
            <p>It clenſeth the breaſt and lungs, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the head very orderly from flegme, and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:8922:77"/>
tough clammie humors: and therefore is of ſingular effect to helpe the Pleuriſie, Stitch, or any other griefe and paine in the ſide.</p>
            <p>Wherupon it pleaſed the Lord to appoint this herbe to be vſed in ſolmne ſacrifices, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when as Lepers were to be clenſed; or any other enormous offence to be expiated, <note place="margin">Leuit. 14, 4. Numb. 19, 6. 18.</note> by dipping <hi>a bundle of Hyſope in the blood of a Sparrow, or of a red Cow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dauid alſo acknowledging his greeuous ſinnes of adulterie and murther, beſeecheth God to forgiue him, and to purge him with <hi>Hyſope,</hi> that hauing the foule ſpots of his <note place="margin">Pſal. 51, 7.</note> ſoule clenſed, he may haue quiet of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and be renued in ſpirit. Wherin he had reſpect vnto the rites, and ſacrifices of the olde Teſtament, by the which it was ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that whoſoeuer was purified according to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> with blood ſprinckled <note place="margin">Exo. 24, 6.</note> on him with Hyſope and a ſcarlet lace, were clenſed.</p>
            <p>All which thinges were ſhadowes and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of Chriſt, by whoſe blood all our ſins are clenſed, and waſhed away through faith <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 14.</note> for euer.</p>
            <p>But whereas we reade of Hyſope in the Bookes of the Kings, where <hi>Solomon</hi> is ſaide <note place="margin">1. King. 4.</note> to be ſo skilfull and wiſe, that he was able to diſpute of the nature of ech plant and herbe, from the Cedar tree that is in <hi>Lebanon,</hi> euen vnto the Hyſope that ſpringeth out of the wall: my opinion is, that the ſame is not
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:8922:78"/>
there ment of our common Hyſope, which is not any ſmall and ſlender herbe, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time of a foote or more in heigth, bearing a ſpiked purple or dark blewiſh flower. I think therfore that therby is ment the herb called Maydenhaire, whoſe leaues are hackt, or ſnipt rounde about, and which groweth by wals and ſtony ſhadowie places: And bicauſe in leaues it is like to Rue, it is ſometime cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Ruta muraria,</hi> that is, Stone Rue or Wall Rue.</p>
            <p>Like alſo vnto this, is that which wee call <hi>Trichomanes,</hi> which groweth alwaies in moiſt &amp; ſhadowie places, being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly of a ſpan long; and hath the ſtalkes of his leaues ſmall, ſtreight, and leane, beſet on either ſide with many little pretie leaues, ſtanding in comely order one againſt another, and continueth alwaies greene.</p>
            <p>His effects and faculties are the ſame in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration that Maydenhaire hath: and is of great vertue to helpe olde coughes, ſhortnes of winde, and obſtructions of the lungs, and breaſt. And theſe are ſometimes called by other names, as <hi>Polytrichon,</hi> and <hi>Callitrichon,</hi> bicauſe of the effect which they worke in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening the haire, and making it to growe blacke, thicke, and curled.</p>
            <p>Therefore, this being ſuch a ſmall lowe Herbe, ſcarcely a ſpan high, and alſo grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in wals, I am perſuaded that it is in that place to be vnderſtood, for Hyſope. For the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:8922:78"/>
drift and meaning of the wordes in that ſentence is none other, but that hee had perfect skil and exact knowledge of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of thinges, euen from the talleſt and higheſt Cedar, to the loweſt and leaſt herbe that groweth out of the wall.</p>

            <p>By this Compariſon therefore is meant a weake, ſlender and wauering faith, which yet (notwithſtanding) is not quite quenched and extinct, albeit at ſome time it be verie neere thereunto.

            <p>The godleſſe and wicked are kept in awe and obedience with dread and ſeueritie of iuſtice; but the weaklings are beſt wonne by gentlenes and lenitie.

            <p>The ſame Metaphor of Chaffe, doth <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> the forerunner of Chriſt vſe, in his ſharpe reprehenſion and nipping exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Phariſies and Sadduces, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned the truth, and reſiſted the benefite of their offered ſaluation: telling them that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was come, <hi>who hauing his fanne in</hi>

            <p>So alſo the Fir tree called <hi>Abies,</hi> is not (as ſome ignorantly and erroniouſly haue affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) the white Popler, but a Tree which the Prophets for the better and plainer inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people, vſe in their propheſies, whenſoeuer they either beate downe pride and arrogancie, or raiſe vp and comfort the weake and comfortleſſe.</p>
            <p>The Firre tree is euer greene, and hath leaues growing all alongſt the ſtemme like vnto a combe, and directly ſtanding oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite one againſt another; the flower which it beareth, is of a Saffron colour, and very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and delectable to the eie.</p>

            <p>But to come againe to the Boxe tree. They that take the Boxe to be all one with the Palme tree, are greatly deceiued, ſith the one altogither and in ech reſpect differeth from the other, ſauing that they both be euer

greene, and neuer ſhed their leaues. This er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror grew (as I thinke) at the firſt, for that the common people in ſome Countries vſe to decke their Churches with the boughes and branches thereof, on the Sunday next afore Eaſter, commonly called Palmeſunday: for at that time of the yeere all other trees for the moſt part are not blowen or bloomed.</p>
            <p>Heere abouts whereſoeuer the Boxe tree groweth, we ſee it to beare a holowiſh and ſomwhat round leafe, ſmooth &amp; ſtill greene, with a tender flower, and hauing a ſtrong ſent and fulſome ſmell, which neither men nor beaſtes take delight to ſmell vnto, but loath &amp; turne from it: his wood is hard, pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous and waightie, inſomuch that being put into the water, it ſinketh to the bottom: his colour pale, inclining to ſome yellowe, whereupon we vſe to call ſuch perſons as be tawnie coloured and weaſell faced, by the name of Boxie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plexioned. Some there be that beare men in hand, that the powder and ſhauings of this tree is medicinable &amp; good to cure the french pockes, and that it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth in goodnes Eben or <hi>Guiacum,</hi> and the wood called <hi>Lignum Indicum:</hi> whoſe opinion (as falſe and erronious) I vtterly miſlike.

            <p>I once knew a fooliſh cockbrained Prieſt, which miniſtred to a certaine yoong man the aſhes of Boxe, being (forſooth) hallowed on Palmeſunday, according to the ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous order &amp; doctrine of the Romiſh church, which aſhes he mingled with their vnholie holie water, vſing to the ſame a kinde of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſticall, or rather fanaticall, doltiſh and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Exorciſme.

            <p>In all which Chapter, by fetching Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons and Similitudes from common and well knowen things, he putteth man in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of his dutie, and that he ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member God, and take care for his ſoules health, while he is yet yoong and luſtie, and not to deferre the ſmall till age and decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picie.</p>
            <p>And by a moſt elegant <hi>Periphraſis</hi> or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumlocution he ſheweth, how man, being in his beſt flouriſhing time, doth by little and little decay, and (as <hi>Iob</hi> witneſſeth) <hi>vaniſh away</hi>

            <p>For in proceſſe of yeeres, and continuance of time (for <hi>Solomon</hi> proſecuteth and goeth through all the members of the bodie) the eies waxe dimme; the eares grow to be thick of hearing; the toong fumbleth in pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation,

            <p>With theſe words therefore beginneth he his diſcourſe, in that place: <hi>Remember thy Maker in the daies of thy youth, before the daies of affliction come,</hi> that is, before ſicknes, diſeaſes, and the diſcommodities of olde age catch hold on thee: <hi>wherein thou ſhalt ſay, I haue no pleaſure in them.

be laid downe:</hi> that is, when the paſſage and way, by which the meate ſhould deſcend into the ſtomack, ſhall ſcarcely open, and be able to chaw: <hi>And when they ſhall wake and riſe vp at the voice of the bird:</hi> that is, when they ſhall ſleepe ſo little, that the crowing of a cocke, or chirping of a ſmall bird ſhall awake them: <hi>and all the daughters of muſicke be deafe:</hi> that is, when the eares be dul and dunch, &amp; not able to heare or diſcerne the tunes of harmonie. <hi>The high ones alſo ſhall be afraide and ſhake in the way:</hi> that is, when they ſtoupe downe, as though they feared leaſt ſomewhat ſhoulde hit them, and be afraide to climbe, for feare of falling. <hi>Before the Almond tree ſhould bloſſome,</hi> that is, before thou be gray headed: for by the Almonde tree is ment the head, and by the bloſſoms the gray haires: <hi>And the Graſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoppers ſticke vp:</hi> to wit, the ſhoulders: for as the legs of the Graſhoppers ſticke vp and appeere aboue the bodie, ſo do the ſhoulders in leane and aged perſons; <hi>And the Capers ſhall be waſted,</hi> that is, when luſt and concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence ſhall be ended, and appetite to meate taken away. <hi>Before the ſiluer coarde be lengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the golden caule do ſhrinke:</hi> that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſinewes, which be white like ſiluer, and which ſtretch out in length at the time of death: and before the thin skinne which encloſeth the braine, and is yellow like gold, do decay. <hi>Before the Pitcher be broken at the Well, and the wheele broken at the ceſterne:</hi> that
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:8922:123"/>
is, before the veines and arteries, (by which be conueied from the fountaine or well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hart, all the vitall ſpirits into ech part of the body) be periſhed: and before the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer waxe faint and vnable to digeſt the meat in the ſtomacke. <hi>And dust ſhall be turned to the earth, from whence it came, and the ſpirite ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to God, who gaue it,</hi> that is, the body, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of fleſh and bones ſhall die and rot in the earth: but the ſoule ſhall incontinently go either to ioy or torment.</p>
            <p>By theſe ſpeeches being partly allegorical, and partly metaphoricall, <hi>Solomon</hi> awaketh and ſtirreth vp the drowſie mindes of men, being careleſſe of their ſaluation, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their Lord and Creator: and not to defer their repentance till they arriue to old age, but to do it euen in their beſt prime and flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing youth. Hee vehemently and pithilie therefore calleth vpon them, to begin this their godly exerciſe, from their firſt and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der age, before olde age draw on, and euill daies, full of greefes, troubles and afflictions, come vpon them.</p>
            <p>For, when a man is ſtricken in great yeers, the delights of this life be loathſome and vnpleaſant vnto him, pleaſures, dauncings, ſinging, laughing, paſtime, ieſting, merrie conceites and daliance be gone: yea all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate diſhes, curious bankets, daintie iun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, and coſtly viandes be loathed; finallie, all former iollities, diſports and recreations
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:8922:123"/>
of luſtie youth, be vtterly forſaken and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. This occaſion therefore taketh <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> to ſtir them vp out of their natural ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhnes, and ordinary forgetfulnes, wiſhing all men not to forſlow and let ſlip oportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie being offered: for that, in decrepite and ſtowping age, not onely the body, but the minde alſo is empaired; and reaſon, memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, vnderſtanding, with all the inward facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ouer clowded.</p>
            <p>For then do the eies dazle, become dim ſighted, and bleared, ſo that they can ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcerne Sunne and Moone. Then bee the hands (whoſe agilitie &amp; miniſterie we neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily vſe in exploiting our buſines) become trembling, ſhaking, vnable and vnfit for any handy labors.

            <p>Then doth ſight faile, and the eies (which looke out of their holes (as it were) out at two windowes) become pooreblinde, and through weakenes of the muſcles and lids,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:8922:124"/>
do ſee verie little, and as it were through a cloude, ſcarcely able to diſcerne, who they meet in the ſtreet.

Then will the voice be ſmall, childiſh, weake, buzzing and vnperfect. Then will euery light thing ſeeme heauy, inſomuch that the ſmalleſt burthen will be enough to loade and ſurcharge him. Then will appetite to meate, (which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly is irrited and prouoked with capers)

            <p>Theſe and other diſcommodities doth <hi>Solomon</hi> reck on vp, and ſhew to be naturally incident vnto man, when he is once old and laden with yeeres.

This (backbone, whereunto are tied the ribs) is reſembled to the keele of a ſhip; whereinto are peeced the reſt of the maine timber. And as the ſtrongeſt plankes of the whole ſhip are faſtened vnto the keele, ſo doth the ſtrength of mans bodie conſiſt in the pith and marrow of his backe bone: ſo that (as <hi>Solomon</hi> aptly heere ſaith) if this ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer lace or coarde be waſted, deſpoiled, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or diſſolued, it is an euident token and certaine ſigne of death not far off.</p>

            <p>But to returne to the Almond tree. The Patriarch <hi>Iacob</hi> (who afterward, of wreſtling <note place="margin">Gen. 32, 28.</note> and preuailing with God, was called <hi>Iſrael)</hi> being vnkindly, vnconſcionably, and chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly dealt withall at the hands of his father in law <hi>Laban,</hi> vſed a maruellous policie, (not with any intent of fraude or deceit, as at the firſt ſhew, ſome may thinke, but vpon the warrant and appointment of almighty God ſo commanding it) that he might thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer his due wages and hire, which that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous carle miſerablie denied him.

And ſo in this caſe of <hi>Iacob:</hi> the ſheepe beholding the ſame ſpeckled &amp; pilled rods, brought foorth (by Gods appointment) ſpeckled and partie coloured lambes, whereby <hi>Iacob</hi> had to his ſhare, ſuch reaſonable number, as was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable and agreeable to his paines and labour ſuſtained.</p>
            <p>But there is in the holie Bible a notable and miraculous thing ſet downe, of <hi>Aarons</hi> rod, which brought foorth buds, and bare bloſſoms and Almonds. Whereby the Lord <note place="margin">Num. 17, 8.</note> gaue the ſtubborne and rebellious people plainly to vnderſtand, whom he would haue to miniſter about holie things, and to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Prieſts office.</p>
            <p>For after that <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> togither with other Captaines of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacie, conſpiring againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> and preſuming to intermeddle in caſes of diuine miniſtration, without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement or calling of God, were ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed downe quicke into the earth, that <note place="margin">Num. 16. ver. 32. &amp; 49.</note> claue aſunder and opened: and that of the common multitude 14700. were deſtroied with the plague, God commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to take twelue rods, according to the number of their princes, with euerie ones name writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vpon his rod, among the which there was <hi>Aarons</hi> rod, being of the tribe of <hi>Leui.</hi> And <hi>Moſes laid the rods before the Lord in the

Tabernacle of the Testimonie. And when Moſes on the next day went into the Tabernacle of the Testimonie, he found the rod of Aaron for the houſe of Leui, to be budded, and to beare ripe Almonds.

            <p>This hiſtorie yeeldeth a notable leſſon to all perſons in generall, namely, that no man vſurpe any office, or intrude himſelfe into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny function, vnleſſe he be thereunto called by God, or by the aſſent and appointment of ſuch, which haue authority from the ſpirit of God, to deale therein.

               <note place="margin">Heb. 5, 5.</note> 
               <hi>tooke not this honour vnto himſelfe to be made the high Prieſt, but had the ſame giuen him, by his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father, who appointed him a Priest for euer after the order of Melchiſedech.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To whomſoeuer therefore this rod, that is, the cure and charge of gouerning and teaching the flocke of Chriſt, by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell, is appointed, let him cheerfully follow his vocation, and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly execute his function.</p>

And as <hi>Aarons</hi> rod (being afore withered and drie) by diuine vertue became greene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, budded and brought forth good and wholeſome fruit: ſo likewiſe it is meete, that ſuch as be called to the office of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie in the Church of God, ſhould ſhew foorth the fruits of vertue and good works in themſelues, and by wholeſome doctrine alſo inſtruct others vnder their charge, to do the like, and to ſhew foorth their ſound and liuely faith by good and Chriſtian actions.</p>
            <p>And this did Chriſt earneſtly require, and vehemently inculke, in his thriſe asking of <hi>Peter</hi> whether he loued him, and in inioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him to diligent feeding of the flocke. Furthermore, me thinkes the <hi>Almond</hi> may very aptly and conueniently ſerue for a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole or Cognizance of a Chriſtian mans life: wherein (as afore hath beene ſaid of the Walnut) be interchangeably mingled ſower with ſweete, rough with ſmooth, hard with ſoft, affliction with welfare, and aduerſe hap with proſperous ſtate.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Plane is a forraine &amp; ſtrange tree brought out of <hi>Aſia</hi> hither into <hi>Europe,</hi> for the goodlie ſhade that it giueth; as appeereth in <hi>Pliny,</hi> who <note place="margin">Lib. 12. ca. 1.</note> writeth, that it was found growing as far as <hi>Turwaine</hi> in France, which was ſometime the furtheſt bounds and limits of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Empire. It ſpreadeth his branches and boughes very broade and wide, his rinde is thicke, and his leaues large, much like in ſhape to the Vine, or of that Plant, which (for the reſemblance that it hath to an hand ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out, &amp; ſpred open) is called <hi>Palma Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti;</hi> and of ſome <hi>Cataputia maior,</hi> the ſeede whereof hath a purging qualitie.

The flowers be ſmall, pale, and grow in ſmall tuffets. The fruit or berries be round, rough, and ſomwhat downiſh or woollie.</p>
            <p>This tree by reaſon of his great, large and broade branches ſtretching out themſelues
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:8922:128"/>
euery way moſt pleaſantly, is very fit and commodious to make coole arbours &amp; ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy boothes, to ſit vnder, in hot ſeaſons. Some are of opinion that bicauſe the <hi>Tilia</hi> or Linden tree, ſerueth for the ſame purpoſe, therefore to be the ſame that the Plane tree is. And ſome thinke no leſſe of the Beech, for that <hi>Virgil</hi> giueth commendation of it, for the like vſe and purpoſe, ſaieng:</p>

            <p>But (doubtleſſe) they be much deceiued, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence in leaues there is no maner of reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance or affinitie betweene them and the Plane. Thoſe trees (indeed) defend the Sun beames, and yeeld very braue and recreatiue arbours to ſit vnder, as the Plane tree doth: but there is not that beauty, proportion, forme, and ſiſe in their leaues, neither ſuch delightſome ſmell and comfortable ſent.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, the Plane tree hath ſuch vertue, that no venemous thing will come neere it, neither will any ſerpentes approch where it is; yea, it is ſo loath ſome and dreadfull to <note place="margin">Nature of the Plane tree.</note> Flitter Mice and Backs, that they dare nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther build their neſts vnder it, neither can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide the ſhadow of it.</p>
            <p>Holie and ſacred writers therefore vſe this ſame tree in their diuine writings and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly narrations; and take from it pithy and

            <p>And as the Plane ſpreadeth his boughes and braunches ſo wide, and giueth ſuch pleaſant ſhadowe, that <hi>Xerxes</hi> the king of <note place="margin">Xerxes king of Perſia.</note> Perſia tooke ſingular delight to ſit vnder it, whole daies togither: ſo likewiſe <hi>Wiſedome,</hi> comming out of the mouth of the moſt <hi>High,</hi> with heauenlie comfort protecteth, ſhadoweth, recreateth &amp; defendeth all thoſe that commit themſelues vnder the ſhadowe thereof from all harme and danger.</p>

            <p>God therefore by his Prophet <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a moſt excelent metaphor, in deſcribing the ſtately maieſty of <hi>Pharao,</hi> and of his proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous, floriſhing, and roiall proceedings, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that he there pronounceth no king to ſurmount, no, nor yet to match him: and yet that all his glorie, pompe, maieſtie, and royaltie ſhoulde eaſilie and with a trice be

brought downe, ouerthrowen, and turned topſie turuie, euen as the higheſt trees are hewen and cut downe with an axe.</p>
            <p>For thus doth the Prophet begin his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: that foraſmuch as that proude, hawtie and inſolent king had forgotten God, and cruelly handled his people, therefore deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſhould come vpon him, and he ſhoulde not be able to auoide it. <hi>The word of the Lord</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ezec. 31, 1.</note> (ſaith Ezechiel) <hi>came vnto me, ſaient: Sonne of man, ſpeake vnto Pharao king of Aegypt, and to his people: whom art thou like vnto, ingreatnes? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, Aſſhur was like a Cedar in Lebanon, with faire branches, and thicke ſhadowing boughes, and ſhot vp very high, ſo that his top was among the thicke boughes: the waters nouriſhed him, and the deepe exalted him on high with hir riuers, running round about his plants. His height was exalted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all the trees of the field, and his boughes were multiplied, and his branches were long, bicauſe of the multitude of the waters, which the deepe ſent out. All the foules of the heauen made their nests in his boughes, and vnder his branches did all the beasts of the forrest bring foorth their yoong, and vnder his ſhadow dwelt all mightie nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which Metaphor, he meaneth that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny nations were ſubiect and tributarie vnto <hi>Pharao;</hi> who in the largeneſſe of dominions, ſurmounted other Princes.

            <p>For ſo long as they looked no further than into his outward pouerty and baſe eſtate, it was no maruell though very few embraced his doctrine, ſith they accounted him ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly woorthy to be looked on, or to bee kept company withall.</p>
            <p>It would be to long, to repeate al that the Prophet in that Chapter at large ſetteth down, concerning the propagation and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of the kingdome of Chriſt: and therefore I refer the Reader to the words of the text it ſelfe, and to the godly expoſitions of ſuch as haue learnedly written vppon the ſame.

and zealouſly to ſearch out the ſenſe and meaning of this Prophet, who moſt liuely &amp; effectually diſplaieth both the glory and alſo the humilitie of Chriſt: and what benefits ech way we receiue by and through him.</p>

               <hi>that was in Christ Ieſus. Who being in the forme of God, thought it no robberie to be equall with God: But made himſelfe of no reputation, taking on him the forme of a ſeruant, and was made like vnto men, and was found in ſhape as a man. He humbled himſelfe &amp; became obedient vnto death, euen the death of the croſſe. Wherfore God alſo hath highly exalted him, and giuen him a Name, aboue euery name; that at the name of Ieſus ſhoulde euery knee bow, both of things in heauen, and of things in earth, and of things vnder the earth:</hi> which is as much to ſaie, as that no power, or ſtrength was ſo great, but that it ſhould ſubmit it ſelfe vnder <note place="margin">Matt. 28, 18 Iohn. 17, 2.</note> his empire and dominion.</p>
            <p>But to come againe vnto my firſt purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed argument. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> moſt plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully and largely euery where throughout his prophecie amplifieng Chriſts kingdom, and aduancing his glory, comforteth the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted and ſorowful, which think themſelues forſaken and deſtitute of all releefe and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, and encourageth them to lift vp their harts, and to ſtay themſelues in aſſured hope
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:8922:135"/>
of Gods infinite mercies, vndoubted proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and infallible deliuerance.</p>
            <p>For, (by taking a metaphor from a yoong graffe or ſlip) hee ſheweth that the ſpirituall kingdome of <hi>Dauid</hi> ſhall bee reſtored by Chriſt, and that all the godly which thinke themſelues forſaken, ſhoulde haue one that ſhould be their deliuerer and redeemer out of the thraldome and tyranny of Sathan. For <hi>There ſhall come foorth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a Spring,</hi> rod, ſhoote, or ſet, <hi>out of the ſtocke of Ieſſe, &amp; a graffe</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſai. 11, 1.</note> 
               <hi>ſhall growe out of his roote. And the ſpirite of the Lord ſhall rest vpon him: the ſpirite of wiſedome and vnderstanding: the ſpirite of counſell and ſtrength: the ſpirite of knowledge and of the feare of the Lord.</hi> Whereby he ſignifieth Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without meaſure ineſtimably furniſhed with all gifts, and wherof he giueth by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to thoſe that be his.</p>
            <p>The ſame Similitude doth he afterwarde continue and proſecute, eftſoones repeating it, and ſaieng, that in <hi>That day the roote of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Ieſſe,</hi> which ſeemed in that decaied ſtate of the Iewes, to be in a maner rotten and like a drie ſticke; <hi>Shall ſtande and be ſet vp for a ſigne vnto the people, and all nations ſhall ſeeke vnto it:</hi> that is, all people and kindreds of the earth ſhall fixe their eies vpon Chriſt, as on a token or marke, and al nations ſhall come flocking to him, and doe vnto him homage.</p>
            <p>But from the Roote of trees and Plantes, (which draineth moiſture out of the earth,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:8922:136"/>
and diffuſeth vitall ſap and iuyce proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nablie throughout all the braunches and boughes) be taken and borrowed in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Bible, ſundry very proper and apt Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, applied by the Prophets, partly to proſperitie, and floriſhing ſeaſons: partlie to aduerſitie and deſperate times, as namely when deſolation, death and deſtruction is threatened and denounced to the graceleſſe and wicked.</p>
            <p>So, the holy Patriarch <hi>Iob,</hi> mentioning what wealth, power, dignity and abundance, he had aforetime enioied, when the princes and peeres of the Countrey did vnto him honor and reuerence, ſaith; <hi>My roote was ſpred out by the water ſide: and the dew lay vpon my corn.</hi>

            <p>And as the Root is the foundation, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on trees are ſtaied, and whereby they receiue their nouriſhment: ſo doth God by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Hoſea</hi> promiſe vnto all thoſe that are penitent and ſorrowfull for their ſins, and leane onely vnto his mercy and protection, the continuance of all proſperous and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſucceſſe; <hi>I will be</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as the dew vnto</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> alſo deſcribing the vaine and tranſitorie hope of the wicked, which ſhall be diſappointed of their deſires, and miſſe their wiſhed welfare, ſaith, that <hi>The deſire of</hi>

               <hi>the vngodly,</hi> is a net <hi>of euils:</hi> that is to ſay, they imagine and deuiſe ſuch things as bring de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and breede their owne miſcheefe; <hi>But the roote of the righteous bringeth foorth fruite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So doth <hi>Wiſedome,</hi> pronounce and ſaie of hir ſelfe, that <hi>She tooke roote in an honourable</hi>

            <p>Contrariwiſe, when God denounceth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to the wicked, and proteſteth that all their power (be it neuer ſo ſtrong and mighty) ſhall not continue, he pronounceth that their <hi>Roote</hi> ſhall be plucked vp.

            <p>No leſſe terrible plagues doth the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> denounce againſt the wicked, who truſting in his worldly wealth and vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine riches, oppreſſeth the innocent; <hi>God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall destroy thee for euer; he ſhall take</hi>

Whereof the whole drift is, to ſhew, that there is in this world nothing ſteadie, permanent, durable, or of continuance: and that there is no truſt to be repoſed in anie mortall creature, or worldlie Potentate: for that the leagues, amities, and pacts of Kings and Princes, and all their ſocieties, confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies, and flouriſhing principalities be lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ruine, and ſubiect to mutabilitie.</p>

that immediately follow, no man can right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expound that is not skilled in Phiſick, and the works of nature. For he there alludeth to the naturall maner of a childe being yet within the mothers wombe: which is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with a menſtrous blood. His meaning therefore is, that his mother (from whom he ſucked crueltie) was exceeding fruitfull and abounding with bloode, as a plentifull vine, planted by the water ſide: whereby it came to paſſe that by reaſon of his ranke nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherewith he was franked and glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he became to haue great ſtrength and robuſteous might.

            <p>The Apoſtle vſeth alſo a notable meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoricall ſpeech, taken from the boughes broken off from the naturall Oliue tree, and others graffed into their place: whereby by a moſt ſtrong argument, he prooueth and ſheweth, that the Iewes are not ſo intirely cut away, and broken off, that no manner of hope is left for their recouerie; but rather, that they ſhall againe be graffed in, if they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide <note place="margin">Rom. 11, 23</note> not ſtill in vnbeleefe. <hi>For if the first fruits be holie, ſo is the whole lumpe: and if the roote bee holie, ſo are the boughes and branches.

Which crime he ſo earneſtly and vehemently there diſplaieth, that firſt he ſheweth, how ſhe is iuſtly to be ſmutted with open infamie, that <hi>ſhe ſhall be brought out into the congregation,</hi> to be a gazing ſtocke to the world, <hi>and that exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſhall be made of hir children:</hi> which ſhall not ſucceede in the inheritance of their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed father, but liue in contempt, without any honor or eſtimation: and finally, that <hi>they ſhall not take roote, nor their branches bring foorth any fruit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A like ſaieng hath he alſo in another place; <hi>The children of the vngodly ſhall not obtaine manie</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 40, 15.</note> 
               <hi>branches, and the vncleane rootes as vpon the high rocks ſhall be rooted out.</hi> Meaning (as Chriſt ſaid <note place="margin">Matt. 13, 5. Mark. 4, 5.

            <p>Much like to this, is that ſaieng of <hi>Iſaiah: Afore the haruest when the flower is finiſhed, and the fruit is riping in the flower, the Lord ſhall cut
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:8922:142"/>
downe the branches with hookes, and ſhall take away and cut off the boughes.</hi> By which Metaphor he ſheweth, that all things go proſperouſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for a while, with the wicked; their corne ripeth, and their harueſt draweth on, their fruites proſper, and are timely: but euen when all things ſeeme to be at their full ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and they themſelues hoping euen now to enioy their fruits; both corne and graine, crop and fruit, bough and branch are ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped away, and the great ſhew of former be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, with a trice defeated and fruſtrated.</p>
            <p>The Flower, is the ioy, beauty, and delite <note place="margin">Flower.</note> of the trees, in the Spring time of the yeere, feeding the beholders eie with pleaſure, and refreſhing his noſe with comfortable ſent &amp; ſmel.

            <p>And vnder the name of <hi>Flower,</hi> there is ment, as well in the Scriptures as in other writers, euery ſuch thing as is in his excellent prime, and gallant brauery. So is the luſtie time of youth and adoleſcencie, tearmed by the name of the flower of age. For then is the body in his perfecteſt comelines, beauty and proportion.

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:8922:143"/>
things of ſmall continuance, which quickly and ſodainly paſſe and fade away.</p>
            <p>So doth the Apoſtle <hi>Paule</hi> reſemble and compare doctrine that is corrupt, vnſound, dangerous, counterfaite, ſuperſtitious, and hypocritall, vnto <hi>Tymber, Haie, and Stubble.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Pſa. 103, 15</note> 
               <hi>are as graſſe: as a flowre of the fielde, ſo floriſheth he.</hi> By which words he meaneth ſuch a thing as quickly periſheth and paſſeth away, albeit for the time it ſeeme to the eie, gallant, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and amiable.</p>
            <p>And to the intent, euery man ſhould on the one ſide, haue daily before the eies of his mind his fraile eſtate &amp; brittle condition: &amp;
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:8922:143"/>
on the other ſide, the power, efficacie &amp; eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the word of God, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a loude voice to proclaime and cry out, that <hi>All fleſh is graſſe, and all the grace therof as the flower of the field. The gras withereth</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſai. 40, 7. Eccl. 14, 17.</note> 
               <hi>the flower fadeth: bicauſe the ſpirite of the Lord bloweth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it: ſurely the people is graſſe. The graſſe is withered, &amp; the flower is faded: But the word of our God endureth for euer.</hi> Notifieng thereby that all pompe, glory, dignity, magnificence, or whatſoeuer elſe in man is admirable and highly ſet by, whether they by gifts inward of the minde, or outward of the body, at the breath of God fade and vaniſh away.</p>
            <p>Let euery man therefore ſtande vppon his guard, and take heed that he repoſe not any confidence in theſe brittle, tranſitorie, and momentanie gifts, or in theſe vaine goods of the world, but that he ſtay himſelfe vpon the ſure and infallible worde of God, which is onely permanent, holeſome, ſolide and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable.</p>
            <p>To the conſideration of theſe eternal and aie during riches, the two bleſſed Apoſtles <note place="margin">1. Pet. 1, 4. Iam. 1, 21.</note> of our Lord, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> do earneſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort vs: that we ſhould leaue ſeeking after the vaine vanities of this wicked world: and ſtudie to attaine the eternall and euerlaſting ioies of heauen, whereunto Chriſt in his bleſſed word inuiteth vs.</p>
            <p>There be many mo the like metaphores and Similitudes taken from leaues and
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:8922:144"/>
flowers, which to the conſcience and minde of ech zealous Chriſtian, depainteth and ſetteth foorth the tranſitory traſh and fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle hold that by daily experience is knowen to reſt in theſe worldly things, wherwith men are vſually puft vp into ſuch inſolent pride and arrogancie.</p>
            <p>And thus doth the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the pride and loftines of <hi>Ephraim</hi> (and vnder them, all others, infected with the like vices) vnto fading flowers, &amp; falling leaues. For thus threateneth hee deſtruction vnto them; <hi>Wo be vnto the crowne of pride, euen to the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſai. 28, 1.</note> 
               <hi>Drunken people of Ephraim, whoſe great pompe is as a flower that falleth away. The crowne of the pride of the drunken Ephraemites, ſhall be troden vnder foote. For his glorious beautie ſhall be a fading flower, and as the hastie fruite afore Sommer.</hi> For as rath ripe fruits and Apples are not long laſting, nor of any great continuaunce: ſo likewiſe ſhall not their felicitie continue in any long proſperitie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nahum</hi> the Prophet likewiſe by the ſame Similitude ſheweth that there is nothing in the world ſo braue, gallant, beautifull, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable, but that God can and will deſtroy and bring it to nothing, when his wrath is kindled againſt the obſtinate and wicked: inſomuch that all the flowers and buds, that is, the pompe and glorie of huffing Royſters be with a trice diſpatched, diſperſed, defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and adnihilated: which in theſe words
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:8922:144"/>
he ſetteth downe and deſcribeth; <hi>Baſan is</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Nah. 1, 4.</note> 
               <hi>wasted, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon is wasted:</hi> that is, all the power and ſtrength is decaied, and all the brauerie brought to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>After flowers, are the Fruits and Seedes <note place="margin">Seede.</note> next to be ſpoken of: whereof, for that there be thence Similitudes vſually fetched and borrowed, wee muſt note this by the way: That <hi>Seede</hi> (as alſo the Fruit) in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is taken for the tribe, kindred, ſtocke, pedagrew and ofſpring, from whence a man is iſſued and deſcended: the which God in his word promiſeth to bleſſe with all welfare and proſperitie, in thoſe that folow his lawes and obſerue his commandements. As the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> in one of his Pſalmes witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, ſaieng; <hi>I haue beene yoong, and now am old:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 37, 25.</note> 
               <hi>and yet ſaw I neuer the righteous forſaken, nor his ſeede begging their bread. His ſeede ſhall be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: and the righteous ſhall inherite the land: as for the ſeede of the vngodlie, it ſhall periſh, and be rooted out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> one of <hi>Iob</hi> his friends that came to reaſon with him, and to comfort him, commendeth the chaſtiſement of the Lord, proouing the ſame to be very beneficial and profitable for man; for that thereby hee is taught and ſchooled to ſubmit himſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his mightie hand, and thankfully to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue his fatherlie correction: being certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſuaded that the ſame is ſent vnto him
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:8922:145"/>
for his amendement, to trie his conſtancie and patience; and thereby therefore doth man receiue ſingular bleſſing and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſee</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that thy ſeede ſhall be great, &amp; thy posteritie as the graſſe of the earth.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iob. 5, 25.</note> 
               <hi>Thou ſhalt go to thy graue in a full age, as a ricke of corne commeth in due ſeaſon into the barne:</hi> that is, thou ſhalt (as a man of noble calling and high parentage) be honorably buried, with a great aſſemblie of Nobles, ſolemnizing thy funerals.</p>
            <p>Againe, for that both herbs and trees doe beare and bring foorth ſeede, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward produceth the like plant according to his kinde, and ſo from one to another infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely: therefore the holy Prophets doe alſo vſe it, for the garniſhing and illuſtrating of their Arguments and Sermons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seede</hi> therfore ſignifieth ſucceſſe, increaſe, plentie, foiſon and abundance. As in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> we may euidently ſee, where the Lord promiſeth to al them that truſt in him, and imbrace his lawes, all felicitie, ſucceſſe and abundance. <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall giue</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſai. 30, 23.</note> 
               <hi>raine to thy Seede, when thou ſhalt ſow the ground, and bread of the increaſe of the earth, which ſhall be fat and very plentious. In that day alſo ſhall thy cattell be fed in large pastures. The Oxen alſo and the yoong Aſſes that till the ground, ſhal eate cleane prouender, which is winnowed with the ſhouell and the fanne.</hi> Signifieng that his worldly wealth and temporal goods ſhould be maruellouſly
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:8922:145"/>
increaſed, and all things ſhould proſper ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his harts deſire.</p>
            <p>The ſame reaſon is for the Fruit: for in <note place="margin">Fruit.</note> the Bible, the Fruits of herbs and trees doe betoken and ſignifie plentie, abundance, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilitie, bleſſednes, proſperitie, works good and euill, ſcarcitie, dearth, penurie, iuſtice, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie, wickednes, impietie, looſenes, diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie, and lewd maners, which are alſo ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified vnder the name of Corne or Graine. So, the Prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> exhorting men going aſtray, and forgetting themſelues, to vertue, integrity of life, and righteous dealing, ſaith thus; <hi>Sowe to your ſelues in righteouſnes and reape</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Hoſ. 10, 12.</note> 
               <hi>after the meaſure of mercie: Breake vp your fallow ground, for it is time to ſeeke the Lord.</hi> In which words he counſelleth and aduiſeth them to forſake their woonted maner of life, and to liue in ſuch ſort as may be acceptable and pleaſant to God. <hi>For hitherto</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you haue plowed wickednes, you haue reaped iniquitie, you haue eaten the fruite of lies.</hi> By the which metaphore he ſheweth how, that they practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed nothing elſe than fraud, quarrels, wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſuttletie, falſehoode, deceite, and how to entrap, circumuent, vndermine, deceiue, and oppreſſe the innocent. Now heer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he admoniſheth them to leaue their fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy practizes, and to plucke vp by the roots all the wicked weedes and noiſome tares out of their harts; and in lieu thereof to ſow in the furrowes of a pure conſcience, honeſt
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:8922:146"/>
and Chriſtian dealing, mildenes, lenitie, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, righteouſneſſe, and true neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
            <p>The ſelfe ſame thing doth the Lorde like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by his Prophet <hi>Ieremie,</hi> earneſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <note place="margin">Ierem. 4, 4.</note> and ſtrictly enioine, ſaieng; <hi>Breake vp your fallow ground, and ſow not among the thornes:</hi> that is, ſee that your harts be manured and garniſhed with the godly ſeedes of integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, righteouſnes, innocencie and goodnes, hauing the thornes and briers of wickednes quite plucked vp by the rootes.</p>
            <p>And this is further manifeſtly witneſſed by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> where as the Lorde by a moſt notable kind of conſolation, aſſureth the minde and conſcience of the godly, that he ſhall not miſſe to obtaine ſaluation. For thus proclaimeth he ſafegard and health vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, in their great afflictions and almoſt deſperate troubles; <hi>Say to the righteous that it</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſai. 3, 10.</note> 
               <hi>ſhall go well with them, for they ſhall eate the fruite of their workes and ſtudies.</hi> Aſſuring him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by of aſſiſtance, and willing him to bee of good comfort and cheere: bicauſe in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie of famine or war, (when others ſhall be ſurprized in calamities and afflictions) he ſhall quietly and ſafely enioy the thinges which he hath receiued from the Lord God, by the worke and trauell of his owne hands. <hi>But wo be vnto the wicked</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for it ſhall be euill with him: and the reward of his owne handes ſhall be giuen vnto him.</hi>

But Fruite is alſo ſometimes taken in the Scriptures for children, iſſue and poſteritie: which the princely Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> teſtiſieth to be an eſpeciall bleſſing of God, as by his words it plainly appeereth; <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>children and the fruite of the wombe, are an heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Againe, where God, vnder the name of <hi>Dauid,</hi> pronounceth that the kingdome of Chriſt ſhall be euerlaſting. <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath ſworne in truth vnto Dauid, and he will not</hi>
