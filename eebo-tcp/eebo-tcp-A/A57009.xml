            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Make bold to Dedicate to you a Book, whose Worth has fix'd on its learned Author the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the greatest Genius that <hi>France</hi> ever produc'd: Superstition, Tyranny and all the numerous Train
<pb facs="tcp:46180:4"/>
of Vices and Extravagancies being ridicul'd in it with as much Wit as Judgment; a Lover of <hi>Britain,</hi> envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>France</hi> such a Treasure, has made it a Prize; and now it sets out with <hi>English</hi> Colours, fearless of its Enemies, under your powerful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage.</p>
            <p>Pardon, <hi>Sir,</hi> the Necessity of this Address: It was not easie to find a Name worthy to be prefix'd to such a Work, which disobliging the blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Inclinations of almost all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, had left me but little Room for the Choice of a Patron. I knew none in whom I could be safer than in you, who, by the consent even of Envy, are not only granted to be free from those Defects, which render the generality of the World obnoxious to Satyr; but would have turn'd our satyrical Author into a Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist; had he lived now, and, like us, seen every Vertue and heroic Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment happily centred in your Person.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:46180:4"/>These Qualifications endearing you to Mankind made me eagerly embrace this Opportunity, to express in a public Manner my share of the Joy which fills every honest Breast in this Nation; pleas'd, to see you resume the mighty Task, which you have discharg'd so much to its Glory and your own. Not to partake of the Sence of Gratitude, which they would all express, for what you have so bravely perform'd and still under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for its Prosperity, would be to resemble those who do not think themselves oblig'd to the Sun, because he dispenses his Light and Heat to all; as, on the other side, to pretend to impart to you a greater Lustre, would be like striving to add Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to that glorious Planet, that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly withdraws a while to shine the more, and obscure the Train of Stars that supplied its Absence.</p>
            <p>I can hardly hope, that this Book will deserve your Attention at this
<pb facs="tcp:46180:5"/>
Juncture, when the most weighty Affairs in the World wholly employ your Thoughts: Yet, <hi>Sir,</hi> if your Care for the Welfare of your Country will admit no breathing Intervals, at least, when on your watry Charge you seek an Enemy, who has too deeply felt the Effects of your Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, not to dread it as much as we love and admire it; this ingenious Satyr may then not be unfit to lessen a while your Impatience in those tedious Moments. Thus when the Heroes of <hi>Argos</hi> embark'd in search of a Conquest, which the distance of the Prize only delay'd, they had their <hi>Orpheus</hi> to soften the Tedious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Toyls of the Expedition.</p>
            <p>May your next be no less Success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than theirs and your last; and secure to these Kingdoms Peace and Plenty, that golden Fleece, which we, as well as the Heroes, who are Proud to follow while you lead, may now reasonably expect. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, <hi>Sir,</hi> to new Triumphs that wait for you: The Enemy who is
<pb facs="tcp:46180:5"/>
to be Conquer'd, is but the same whom you have already Vanquish'd, and seems to have had time to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit the mighty Losses, which by your Valour and Conduct he su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain'd, only that he might be the more Worthy of giving those Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues an Opportunity to exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in a more glorious Manner.</p>
            <p>They are so Conspicuous in you, <hi>Sir,</hi> as well as that Zeal for your Country's Happiness, the hereditary Attribute of your Noble Family, that it would be an impardonable Vanity in me to pretend to make them more known to this Age, by any thing of the Nature of this Address; and it will be the proper Task of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story to transmit them not only to <hi>the next,</hi> but to the latest Posterity. I will not therefore, <hi>Sir,</hi> tire you with Praises far below those which you so highly deserve and shun: And, since the Best and Ablest Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots have, by public Acknowledgments of your great Merits, as it were, made themselves your Panegyrists, what
<pb facs="tcp:46180:6"/>
can be left for a Person of my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Circumstances to do, but at a Distance to Admire you, and be Ambitious of no greater Name than that of,</p>

            <head>THE LIFE OF Dr. <hi>Francis Rabelais.</hi>

            <p>HAD Dr. <hi>Rabelais,</hi> like <hi>Cardan, Scaliger, Thuanus</hi> and other learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, given us the History of his Life; employed, as it was, wholly in Mirth, and penn'd by so uncommon a Hand, it must needs have pleased not only more than the most diverting Works of others, but even more then his own unparalell'd Chronicle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>But by a cruel Fatality, most of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>se whose Works perpetuate the Lives of others, neglect to eternise their own by such a method; and, instead of painting themselves and their most memorable Actions, only strive to be known by the Pictures of Strangers which they have drawn: Some of them, perhaps, slatter themselves with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of a small number of happy Men the Pictures of whose Lives and Persons have been
<pb n="ij" facs="tcp:46180:7"/>
consecrated to Posterity by Pencils equal to those with which they had redeemed others from Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion; but, as few prove kinder to us than our selves, those who expect to be excepted out of that Rule after their Deaths may be assur'd, That if by chance some of their able Survivers bestow one short minute to give, <hi>en passant,</hi> an imperfect Idea of their Resemblance, Ten ill hands rudely attempting to do the same, while they faintly hit one Lineament, will miscarry on the rest, and thus ignorantly or maliciously ridicule what they pretend to represent.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the ancient Philosophers have had their <hi>Laertius</hi> and the Heros, their Contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries, their <hi>Plutarch:</hi> But now that History seems almost lost in disorderly Memoirs, its primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chaos, great Warriors are as unlikely to find good Historians as famous Authors.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Rabelais,</hi> that greater <hi>Lucian</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> has been even worse us'd than that of <hi>Greece;</hi> for though we know the Old only by his Writings, yet few fabulous Stories wrong his Memory, while that of <hi>Rabelais</hi> is so much abused by unkind Fame, that, to know him, it were perhaps better only to seek that Modern <hi>Lucian,</hi> as we do the Old, in the Pictures which he has drawn of others, than in those which his careless or malicious Painters have given us of him.</p>
            <p>However, you have here the best Account I could get of him: Neither was it without much
<pb n="iij" facs="tcp:46180:7"/>
difficulty, that, out of the Ruins of Time, in a Kingdom where 'tis not easie to find many Books and Persons that can inform us of that Author, I could get together what follows; principally if we consider how little is to be found in the French late Editions of his Works.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>FRANCIS RABELAIS</hi> was born about the Year <hi>1483,</hi> at <hi>Chinon,</hi> a very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient little Town, scituate near the Place where the River <hi>Vienne</hi> loses it self into the <hi>Loire,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Touraine</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> His Father <hi>Thomas Rabelais</hi> was an Apothecary of that Town, and possessed an Estate called <hi>la Douï<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niere;</hi> near which Place,<note place="margin">

               </note> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving first sent his Son <hi>Francis</hi> to be Educated by the Monks of the Abbey of <hi>Sevillé,</hi> and finding that he did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, he removed him to the Vniversity of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> where he studied sometime at a Convent called <hi>la Baumette,</hi> but without any considerable Success. There he became acquainted with <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieurs Du Bellay,</hi> one of whom was afterwards Cardinal: And 'tis said, that <hi>Rabelais</hi> having committed some Misdemeanor, was there very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely used.</p>
            <p>A Famous Author writes,<note place="margin">

               </note> in the said Province, where he proved a great Proficient in Learning; in so much, that of the Friars, some envied him, some, through Ignorance, thought him a Conjurer; and in short, all hated and misused him because he studied <hi>Greek;</hi> the Beauties of which Tongue they could not relish; its Novelty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> making them esteem it not only Barbarous, but Antichristian.

            <p>'Tis likely our Doctor had then a Prospect of the Benefices, with which he soon afterwards was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by that Cardinal; and for that Reason was glad to be eased of the Censures, under which he lay, which made him uncapable of enjoying any thing.

            <p>So being come as far as <hi>Lyons</hi> in his way to <hi>Paris,</hi> very indifferently Accoutred, and no Mony<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to proceed, whether he had been Robbed, or had spent all his Stock; he, who had a peculiar love for Ease and good Eating, and no less Zeal for good Drinking, found himself in dismal Circumstances.

            </p>
            <p>Being Lodg'd at the <hi>Tower</hi> and <hi>Angel,</hi> a Famous Inn in that City, he took some of the Ashes in the Chimney, and having wrap'd them up in several little papers, on one of them be writ <hi>Poyson to kill the King,</hi> in another,
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:46180:13"/>
               <hi>Poyson to kill the Queen,</hi> in a third, <hi>Poyson to kill the Duke of</hi> Orleans, and having on the Change met a young Merchant, told him, That being skill'd in Physiognomy he plainly saw that he had a great desire to get an Estate easily; therefore, if he would come to his Inn, he would put him in a way to gain a Hundred Thousand Crowns; the greedy Merchant was very ready. So when he had Treated our Doctor, he came to the main point, that is, how to get the Hundred Thousand Crowns; Then <hi>Rabelais,</hi> after t'other Bottle or two, pretending a great deal of Caution, at last shewed him the papers of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and proposed to him, to make use of them according to their Superscriptions, which the other promised, and they appointed to meet the next day, to take Measures about it; but the too Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, though honest, Trader, immediately ran to a Iudge, who having heard the Information, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately sent to secure <hi>Rabelais,</hi> the <hi>Dauphin</hi> having been Poysoned some time before; so the Doctor with his Powder was seiz'd, and being examined by the Iudge, gave no answer to the Accusation, safe that, he told the young Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, that he had never thought him fit to keep a Secret, and only desired them to secure what was in the Papers, and send him to the King, for he had strange things to say to him.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, he is carefully sent to <hi>Paris,</hi> and handsomly treated by the way on free Cost, as are all the King<hi>'s</hi> Prisoners, and being come to <hi>Paris,</hi> was immediately brought before the King,
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:46180:13"/>
who knowing him, asked him, what he had done to be brought in that Condition, and where he had left the Cardinal <hi>Du Bellay.</hi> Vpon this the <hi>Judge</hi> made his Report, shew'd the Bills with the Powder, and the Informations which he had drawn, <hi>Rabelais</hi> on his side told his Case, took some of all the Powders before the King; which being found to be only harmless Wood Ashes, plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for <hi>Rabelais</hi> so effectually, that the business ended in Mirth, and the poor Iudge was only laugh'd at for his Pains.</p>
            <p>Though this Story be Printed before many Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Rabelais,</hi> somewhat otherwise than I here give it, I would not any more be answerable for its Truth, than for that of many more which Tradition ascribes to him.

in Behalf of the Vniversity of <hi>Montpellier.</hi> So <hi>Rabelais</hi> having vainly tried to be admitted, at last put on his Red Gown and Doctor's Cap; and thus Accoutred, came to the Chancellor's Palace, on St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s Key; but the Porter and some other Servants mistook him for a Mad-man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So <hi>Rabelais</hi> having, in a peremptory Tone, been ask'd there, who he was, let his impertinent Querist know, that he was the Gentleman who usually had the Honour to flea He-Calves; and that, if he had a mind to be first flead, he had best make haste and strip immediately. Then being ask'd some other Questions, he answer'd in <hi>Latin,</hi> which the other understanding not, one of the Chancellor's Officers that could speak that Tongue was brought, who addressing himself to our Doctor in <hi>Latin,</hi> was answered by him in <hi>Greek,</hi> which the other understanding as little as the first did <hi>Latin,</hi> a third was fetch'd who could speak <hi>Greek;</hi> but he no sooner spoke in that Language to <hi>Rabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais,</hi> but that he was answered in <hi>Hebrew;</hi> and one who understood <hi>Hebrew</hi> being with much Difficulty procur'd, <hi>Rabelais</hi> spoke to him in <hi>Syriac</hi>: Thus having exhausted all the Learning of the Family, the Chancellor, who was told, that there was a merry Fool at his Gate who had out-done every-one, not only in Languages, but in smartness of Repartees, desired that he might be brought in. 'Twas a little before Dinner. Then <hi>Rabelais</hi> shifting the Farcical Scene into one more serious, addrest himself to the Chancellor with much Respect, and having first made his
<pb n="xviij" facs="tcp:46180:15"/>
Excuse for his forc'd Buffoonry, in a most Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and Learned Speech, so effectually pleaded the Cause of his Vniversity, that the Chancellor, at once ravish'd and perswaded, not only promised the Restitution of the Abolish'd Privileges, but made the Doctor sit down at Table with him as a particular Mark of his Esteem.</p>
            <p>Much about that time, hearing with what Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility, for the sake of a small Sum of Money, the Faculty of <hi>Orange</hi> (some say <hi>Orleans</hi>) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Ignorant Pretenders, as Doctors of Physic not only without examining, but even without seeing them; <hi>Rabelais</hi> sent the usual Fees, and had one received Doctor there unseen, by the Name of <hi>Doctor Johannes Caballus,</hi> and let the wise Professors and the World know after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, what a worthy Member they had admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into their Body, since that very <hi>Doctor</hi> was his Horse <hi>Jack;</hi> or, as some say, his <hi>Mule</hi>: For if there are various Lections, there may well be also various Traditions of the same Passage.</p>
            <p>Though I know that it as little becomes a Chast Historian to launch into large Digressions, as to advance Things without good Authorities, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear mentioning something very particular concerning that very Numerical Doctor, I mean, <hi>Joannes Caballus</hi>: And that I may not be thought to relate Stories without Authorities, I will make bold to quote that of a Book written <hi>Stylo maximè Rabelaesano, viz. Le Moyen de Parvenir;</hi> I remember to have read the Story in a less Apocriphal Author, but Time hath
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:46180:15"/>
blotted his Name out of my Memory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rabelais</hi> being at <hi>Paris,</hi> and more careful of himself than of his <hi>Mule,</hi> had trusted it to the Care of a Printer's Men, desiring them at least not to let it want Water. But having perhaps forgot to make them drink, they also easily, though uncharitably forgot the Brute. At three days end the Creature having drank as little Water as its Master, a young unlucky Boy took a Fancy to get on its back, even like the Miller's Daughter, without a Saddle; another Truand Scholar begg'd to get behind him, so did a third and eke a fourth. Thus these Four being mounted like <hi>Aymond</hi>'s Four Sons a Horse back on a Mule, without Bridle or Halter, the real and living Emblem of Folly, the Grave Animal walk'd leasurely down St. <hi>James's street,</hi> till it came near a Church, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards which it moved, drawn by the magnetic Vertue of the Water, which it smelt at a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Distance, in the Holy Water Pot, which is always near the Porch. And in vain our Four Riders kick'd and call'd, in spight of them the Headstrong thirsty Beast made up to the Holy Element; and though the Church was almost full of People, it being <hi>Sunday</hi> and Sermon time, notwithstanding all Opposition, the bold Monster dipped its saucy Snout in the Sanctified Cistern. The People that were near it, were not a little amaz'd at the Impudence of that Sacrilegious Animal, deservedly curst with Sterility, though it were but for this one Crime; Many took him for a <hi>Spectrum</hi> that bore some Souls, formerly Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:46180:16"/>
but now Penitent, that came to seek the sweet Refrigeratory of the Saints, out of the more than Hellish Flames of <hi>Purgatory.</hi> So the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'd Mule took a swinging Draught of Holy Liquor, yet did not like it so well, there being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Salt in it, as to take a second Dose; but, having somewhat allayed its raging Thirst, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly withdrew, with her two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>race of Youngsters. However the thing did not end thus; for the Brute was seized, and <hi>Rabelais</hi> being thought none of the greatest Admirers of the <hi>Romish</hi> Fopperies, was shrewdly suspected of having laid the Design of that Scandalous Adventure. Nor was the rude Four-legg'd <hi>Joannes Caballus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased out of the Pound, till its Master had dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paid for its Drink.</p>
            <p>As he Ridicul'd the Superstition of Priests, he also was extreamly free in his Reflections on the <hi>Monks,</hi> and truly he knew them too well to Love and Esteem them; he is said not to have been able to refrain his Satyrical Temper, even while he was reading public Service; and instead of <hi>Qui maechantur cum illâ,</hi> as the Vulgate has it, to have said aloud, <hi>Qui monachantur cum illâ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis also said, That as he was kneeling once at Church, before the Statue of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth, a <hi>Monk</hi> came and said to him, That doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>less he mistook that King's Statue for that of some Saint; but <hi>Rabelais</hi> immediately replied, <hi>I am not so much a</hi> Monk <hi>(Blockhead I mean) as thou thinkest me; nor yet so blind,
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:46180:16"/>
as not to know, that I kneel before the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of King</hi> Charles <hi>the VIII. for whose Soul I Prayed, because he brought the</hi> Pox <hi>out of</hi> Naples <hi>into this Kingdom, by which means, I, and other Physicians have been considerable Gainers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Several of these being once Assembled to consult about an Hypocondriac humour, which confined Cardinal <hi>Du Bellay</hi> to his Bed; they at last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, that an Aperitive Decoction should be prepared, to be frequently taken with some Syrup, by the Patient. Now <hi>Rabelais</hi> who was his Physician, perhaps not being of their Opinion, while the rest of our Learned Doctors were still discoursing in their Scientific Iargon, to deserve the large Fee, caused a Fire to be made in the Yard, and on it to be set a Kettle-ful of Water, into which he had put as many Keys as he could get: And while he was very busie in stirring them about with a Stick, the Doctors coming down, saw him, and asked what he was doing? <hi>Following your Directions,</hi> replied he. <hi>How, in the Name of</hi> Gulen? cry'd one of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>you are for something that may be very aperitive,</hi> returned <hi>Rabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais, and, by</hi> Hippocrates, <hi>I think you will own that nothing can be more Aperitive than Keys, unless you would have me send to the Arcenal for some peices of Cannon.</hi> This odd Fancy being immediately related to the sick Cardinal, set him into such a fit of Laughing, that it helped more to cure him than the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription; and what made the Iest the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:46180:17"/>
was, that Keys are made of Iron and Steel, which with Water are the cheif Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents in Chalibeat Medicines.</p>
            <p>Hearing that the grave <hi>John Calvin,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what prejudic'd against him, for his biting Iokes, had play'd on his Name by the way of Anagram; saying <hi>Rabelaesius, Rabie laeus;</hi> he with an admirable presence of mind, immediately returned the Complement in the same kind, saying, <hi>Calvin Jan cul,</hi> adding, that there was Anagram for Anagram, and that a Studied trifle only deserved to be paid back with one worse, <hi>ex tempore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, while like <hi>Democritus,</hi> he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ry with the Impertinences of Mankind; nothing was able to allay his Mirth, unless it were the thought of a Reckoning, at the time that he paid it; then indeed, he was thought somewhat serious, though probably 'twas partly that those who were to receive it, might not impose on him and the Company, and because he generally found his Purse not over full. However, the time of paying the Shot in a Tavern among good Fellows, or <hi>Pantagruelists,</hi> is still called in <hi>France, le quart d' heure de Rabelais;</hi> that is, <hi>Rabelais</hi>'s quarter of an hour.</p>
            <p>Yet his Enemies, the <hi>Monks</hi> and some others tell us, that he seemed much less Concerned when he payed the grand Shot of Life, than when he discharged a small Tavern Reckoning: For they say, that he faced Death with an unconcern'd and careless Countenance; and in short, that he Died just as he Lived. They relate the thing thus.</p>

            <head>PREFACE·</head>
            <head type="sub">Wherein is given an Account of the Design and Nature of this Work, and a Key to some of its most difficult Passages.</head>
            <p>THE History of <hi>Gargantua</hi> and <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel,</hi> has always been esteem'd a Masterpiece of Wit and Learning, by the best Judges of both. Even the most grave and reserv'd among the Learned in many Countries, but particularly in <hi>France,</hi> have thought it worthy to hold a place in their Closets, and have past many hours in private with that diverting and instructive Companion. And as for those whose Age and Profession did not incline them to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd, all <hi>France</hi> can witness that there has been but few of them who could not be said to have their <hi>Rabelais</hi> almost by heart: Since Mirth could hardly be compleat among those that love it, unless their good Cheer were season'd with some of <hi>Rabelais</hi>'s Wit.</p>
            <p>Fifty large Editions of that Book have not suffic'd the World, and though the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
<pb n="xlij" facs="tcp:46180:27"/>
in which it is writ, be not easily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood now by those who only converse with modern <hi>French</hi> Books, yet it has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed several Times lately in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> even in its antiquated Style.</p>
            <p>Indeed some are of Opinion, That the odd and quaint Terms used in that Book, add not a little to the Satisfaction which is found in its perusal; but yet this can only be said of such of them, as are understood; and when a Reader meets with many words that are unintelligible (I mean to him that makes it not his business to know the meaning of dark and obsolete Expressions) the Pleasure which what he understands yields him, is in a greater measure allay'd by his disappo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntment; of which we have Instances when we read <hi>Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi> and other Books, which we do not throughly understand.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Vrwhart</hi> has avoided that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity in this following Translation of <hi>Rabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais,</hi> so that most <hi>English</hi> Readers may now understand that Author in our Tongue, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then many of the <hi>French</hi> can do in theirs. To do him justice it was necessary, that a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son not only Master of the <hi>French,</hi> but also of much Leasure and Fancy should under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Task. The Translator was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy in their things, but also in being a learned Physitian, and having, besides, some <hi>French</hi> Men near him, who understood <hi>Rabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais</hi> very well, and could explain to him the
<pb n="xliii" facs="tcp:46180:27"/>
most difficult words; and I think that, before the first and second Books of <hi>Rabelais,</hi> which are all that was formerly printed of that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in <hi>English,</hi> there were some Verses by Men of that Nation in praise of his Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>It was too kindly received, not to have encouraged him to <hi>English</hi> the remaining three Books, or at least the Third (the fourth and fifth being in a manner distinct, as being <hi>Pantagruel</hi>'s Voyage.) Accordingly he translated the third Book, and probably would have finished the whole, had not Death pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him. So the said third Book being found long after in Manuscript among his Papers somewhat incorrect, a Gentleman who is not only a very great Linguist, but also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly famous for his ingenious and learned Composures, was lately pleased to revise it, as well as the two first which had been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd about thirty years ago, and are extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly scarce. He thought it necessary to make considerable Alterations, that the Translation might have the smartness, genuin Sence, and the very Style and Air of the Original; but yet to preserve the latter, he has not thought fit to alter the Style of the Translation, which suits as exactly with that of the Author as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, neither affecting the politeness of the most nice and refin'd of our Modern <hi>English</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, nor yet the roughness of our antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Authors, but such a Medium as might
<pb n="xliv" facs="tcp:46180:28"/>
neither shock the Ears of the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st, nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please those who would have an exact imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the style of <hi>Rabelais.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since the first Edition of those two Books of <hi>Rabelais</hi> was so favourably entertain'd, without the third, without any account of the Author, or any Observations to discover that mysterious History; 'Tis hop'd that they will not meet with a worse usage, now they appear again so much improv'd, with the addition of a third, never printed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in English, and a large account of the Author's Life; but principally since we have here an Explication of the Enigmatic Sence of part of that admirable Mythologist's Works, both which have been so long wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, though never till now publish'd in any Language.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> ingenious of our Age, as well as those who liv'd when <hi>Rabelais</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd his <hi>Gargantua</hi> and <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> have been extreamly desirous of discovering the Truths which are hid under the dark veil of Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in that incomparable work. The great <hi>Thuanus</hi> found it worthy of being mention'd in his excellent History, as a most ingenious Satyr on Persons who were the most distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd in the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> by their Quality and Employments, and without doubt he, who was the best of all our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Historians, and liv'd soon after it was
<pb n="xlv" facs="tcp:46180:28"/>
writ, had trac'd the private Design of <hi>Rabelais,</hi> and found out the true Names of the Persons whom he has introduc'd on his Scene, with Names not only imaginary, but generally ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, and whose Actions he represents as ridiculous as those Names. But as it would have been dangerous, having unmask'd those Persons, to have expos'd them to public view, in a Kingdom where they were so pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful; and as most of the Adventures which are mystically represented by <hi>Rabelais,</hi> relate to the affairs of Religion, so those few who have understood the true sence of that Satyr, have not dar'd to reveal it.</p>
            <p>In the late Editions, some learned Men have given us a Vocabulary, wherein they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Names and Terms in it which are originally, Greek, Latin, Hebrew, or of other Tongues, that the Text might thus be made more intelligible, and their work may be useful to those who do not understand those Tongues. But they have not bad the same success in their pretended Explications of the Names which <hi>Rabelais</hi> has given to the real Actors in this Farce; and thus they have indeed fram'd a Key, but, if I may use the Allegory, 'twas without having known the Wards and Springs of the Lock. What I advance, will doubtless be owned to be true by those who may have observed that by that Key, none can discover in those <hi>Pythagorical</hi> Symbols (as they are call'd in the Author's
<pb n="xlvi" facs="tcp:46180:29"/>
Prologue to the first Book) any Event that has a Relation to the History of those to whom the Names mention'd by <hi>Rabelais,</hi> have been applyed by those that made that preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Key. They tell us in it, that King <hi>Grangousier</hi> is the same as King <hi>Lewis</hi> the 12th. of <hi>France,</hi> that <hi>Gargantua</hi> is <hi>Francis</hi> the first, and that <hi>Henry</hi> the second, is the true Name of <hi>Pantagruel</hi>; but we discover none of <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth's Features in King <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gousier,</hi> who does none of the Actions which History ascribes to that Prince, so that the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> or the <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartary,</hi> might as reasonably be imagined to be <hi>Grangousier,</hi> as <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth; as much may be said of <hi>Gargantua,</hi> and of <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> who do none of the things that have been remark'd by Historians, as done by the Kings, <hi>Francis</hi> the first, and <hi>Henry</hi> the second of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Reason which of its self is very strong, will much more appear to be such, if we reflect on the Author's Words in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue to the first Book. <hi>In the perusal of this Treatise</hi>; says he, <hi>you shall find another kind of Taste, and a Doctrine of a more profound and abstruse Consideration, which will disclose to you the most glorious Doctrine and dreadful Mysteries, as well in what concerneth your Religion, as matters of the public State and Life Oeconomical</hi>; My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, which as he tells us, are the Juice and <hi>Substantial Marrow</hi> of his Work. To this Reason I add another as strong and evident.
<pb n="xlvii" facs="tcp:46180:29"/>
It is, that we find in <hi>Grangousier, Gargantua</hi> and <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> Characters that visibly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish them from the three Kings of <hi>France,</hi> which I have nam'd, and from all the other Kings their Predecessors.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>first</hi> Place, <hi>Grangousier</hi>'s Kingdom is not <hi>France</hi> but a <hi>State</hi> particularly distinct from it, which <hi>Gargantua</hi> and <hi>Pantagruel</hi> call <hi>Vto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Gargantua</hi> is not born in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>France,</hi> but in that of <hi>Vtopia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He leaves <hi>Paris,</hi> call'd back by his Father, that he might come to the Relief of his Country, which was attack'd by <hi>Picrochole</hi>'s Army.</p>
            <p>And <hi>finally, Francis</hi> the <hi>First</hi> is distinguished from <hi>Gargantua</hi> in the 39<hi>th.</hi> Chap. of the <hi>first</hi> Book, when Fryar <hi>Ihon des Entoumeures,</hi> says in the Presence of <hi>Gargantua,</hi> and eating at his Table, <hi>had I been in the time of Iesus Christ, I would have kept him from being taken by the Iews in the Garden of Olivet, and the Devil fail me, if I should have fail'd to cut off the Hams of these Gentlemen Apostles, who ran away so basely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had well supp'd, and left their good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster in the Lurch; I hate that Man worse than Poyson that offers to run away, when he should fight and lay stoutly about him. Oh if I were but King of France for fourscore or an hundred Years, by G— I should whip like cut tail Dogs these Run aways of Pavia, a Plague take them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But if Francis</hi> the <hi>First</hi> is not <hi>Gargantua,</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="xlviij" facs="tcp:46180:30"/>
               <hi>Pantagruel</hi> is not <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Second</hi>; and if it were needful I would easily shew, That the Authors of that pretended Key have not only been mistaken in those Names, but in all the others, which they undertook to decypher, and that they only spoke at random without the least Grounds or Authorities from History.</p>
            <p>All things are right so far; but the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty lyeth not there, we ought to show<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who are the Princes that are hid under the Names of <hi>Grangousier, Gargantua</hi> and <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel,</hi> if yet we may suppose them to be Princes. But such a Discovery cannot be very easily made, because most of their Actions are only described in Allegories, and in so confus'd and enigmatic a Manner, that we do not know where to fix. This must be granted; yet 'tis not an impossible thing; and if we can but once unmark <hi>Panurge,</hi> who is the ridiculous Hero of the Peece, we may soon guess by the Servant, and the Air and Figure of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, who <hi>Pantagruel</hi> is,</p>
            <p>We find these four Characters in <hi>Panurge,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. He is well skill'd in the <hi>Greek Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Tongues, he speakes <hi>High</hi> and <hi>Low Dutch, Polish, Spanish, Portuguese, English, Italian,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He is learned, understanding, politic, sharp, cunning, and deceitful in the highest Degree.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He publicly professes the <hi>Popish</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, tho he in reality laughs at it, and is nothing less than a <hi>Papist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="xlix" facs="tcp:46180:30"/>4. His chief Concern next to that of Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a Marriage, which he has a desire, yet is affraid to contract, least he should meet with his Match; that is, a Wife even as bad as himself.</p>
            <p>I do not know if those who, by the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Key, have been induc'd to believe that <hi>Panurge</hi> was the Cardinal of <hi>Amboise</hi> in a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise, have been pleased to observe these four qualities; but I am sure that nothing of all this can be applyed to that Prelate, unless it be, that in general he was an able Minister of State. But all four were found in <hi>Iohn de Montluc</hi> Bishop of <hi>Valence</hi> and <hi>Die,</hi> who was the eldest Brother of the Marschal <hi>de Montluc</hi> the most violent Enemy which the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots</hi> had in those Days.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Historians assure us, that he understood the Eastern Tongues, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the Greek and the Latin,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Brantosme. Ec-Beza Hist. cles.</hi>
               </note> the best of any Man in his time; and in sixteen Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, to many Princes of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> to whom he was sent in <hi>Germany, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland, Poland, Constantinople,</hi> he doubtless learn'd the living Tongues which he did not know before.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He gain'd a great Reputation in all those Embassies, and his Wit, his Skill, his Penetration and his Prudence, in observing a Conduct that contented all Persons, were u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversally admired. But he even out did
<pb n="l" facs="tcp:46180:31"/>
himself in the most difficult of all those Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassies, which was that of <hi>Poland,</hi> to the Throne of which Kingdom he caus'd <hi>Henry de Valois</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> to be rais'd in spight of the difficulties, which the Massacre of <hi>Paris</hi> that was wholly laid to his Charge in <hi>Poland</hi> (he having been one of the chief Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of it) created concerning his Election. His Toils and his happy Success in those im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Negotiations, caus'd him to take this Latin Verse for his Motto,
<q>Quae Regio in terris nostri non plena laboris?</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The whole Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> and particularly the Court, knew that he was a Calvinist, and he himself did not make a Mystery of it, as appears by his preaching their Doctrin once before the Queen,<note place="margin">

               </note> in a Hat and Cloak, after the manner of the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinists, which caus'd the Constable of <hi>Mon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>morency</hi> to say aloud, <hi>Why do not they pull that Minister out of the Pulpit?</hi> Nay he was even condemn'd by <hi>Pius</hi> IV. as an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, but that Pope having not assigned him Judges <hi>in partibus</hi> according to the Laws of the Kingdom, he kept his Bishoprick, and the Dean of <hi>Valence,</hi> who had accused him of being a Calvinist, not being well able to make good his Charge, <hi>Montluc,</hi> who had mighty
<pb n="li" facs="tcp:46180:31"/>
Friends, caus'd him to be punish'd for it; also after his Death, his Contract of Marriage with a Gentlewoman call'd <hi>Anne Martin</hi> was found, yet he still kept in the Roman Church, and still enjoy'd the Revenues of his Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, as if he had been the most bigotted Papist in that Kingdom. The Considerations that kept him from abjuring solemnly the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were, that <hi>Calvin</hi> let him know, that according to his Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, there could be no Bishops; he own'd that this Obstacle would not perhaps have hinder'd him from leaving that Communion, could his Kitchin have follow'd him in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; excepting that, he was altogether for a Reformation, and in all things favour'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Professors, and 'tis what <hi>Rabelais</hi> has observ'd when he makes him conclude all his Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in many Languages, with saying, that <hi>Venter famelicus auriculis carere dicitur; at this time,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Book</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9</note> 
               <hi>I am in a very urgent necessity to feed, my Teeth are sharp, my Belly empty, my Throat dry, and my Stomach fierce and burning; all is ready, if you will but set me to work, it will be as good as a</hi> Balsamum <hi>for sore Eyes, to see me guleh and raven it; for God's sake give order for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. His chief Concern, next to that of living plentifully, was that of his Marriage, and as we have observed, he Married, and had a Son whom he own'd, and who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="lij" facs="tcp:46180:32"/>
legitimated by the Parliament; 'tis the same who is famous in History by the name of <hi>Balagny,</hi> and who was afterwards Prince of <hi>Cambray</hi>: his Father caus'd him to be sent into <hi>Poland,</hi> concerning the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi>'s Election, of which we have spoke, and he was very serviceable to that Duke in it. Now, 'tis that Marriage of the Bishop of <hi>Valence,</hi> that so much perplexes him by the name of <hi>Panurge,</hi> in <hi>Rabelais</hi>'s third Book, and which is the occasion of <hi>Pantagruel</hi>'s Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to the Holy Bottle in the fourth and fifth.</p>
            <p>'Tis much to be admired how a Bishop, that openly sided with the <hi>Calvinists,</hi> who was also a Monk, yet marryed, and living with his Wife whom he had regularly wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, could enjoy one of the best Bishopricks in <hi>France,</hi> and some of the chief Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at Court. He must doubtless have been extreamly cunning, and have had a very particular Talent to keep those envied posts in the Church and State, in spight of all those disavantages, in the midst of so many storms rais'd against him and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, by Enemies that had all the Forces of the Kingdom in their Power, and could do whatever they pleased.</p>
            <p>This Prudence and Craftiness is described to the Life by our Author, when he makes <hi>Panurge</hi> relate, how he had been broach'd upon a Spit by the <hi>Turks,</hi> all larded like a Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet,
<pb n="liij" facs="tcp:46180:32"/>
and in that manner was roasting alive; <hi>when calling on God, that he might deliver him out of the pains wherein they detained him for his sincerity in the maintenance of his Law,</hi> the Turn-spit fell asleep by <hi>the Divine Will</hi>; and <hi>Panurge</hi> having taken in his Teeth a Fire-brand by the end where it was not burn'd, cast it into the Lap of his <hi>Roaster</hi>; with another set the House on Fire, broach'd on the Spit the <hi>Turkish</hi> Lord who design'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour him, and at last got away, though pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued by a great number of Dogs, <hi>who smelt his leacherous half roasted Flesh</hi>; and he threw the Beacon, with which he had been larded, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them.</p>
            <p>'Tis observable, that there he exclaims a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Turks</hi> about their abstaining from Wine, which perhaps may refer to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s denying the Cup in the Eucharist to the Laity, at which particularly <hi>Montluc</hi> was offended. To lard a Man is a Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor often us'd by the <hi>French,</hi> to signifie, to accuse and reproach, and so he was even before he had his Bishoprick; throwing a Fire-brand with his Mouth on the Turn-spit's Lap, may be the hot words which he used to clear himself, and with which he charged his Adversaries; and his spitting and burning the <hi>Turkish</hi> Lord, may perhaps mean the advantage which he had over them.<note place="margin">

His forbearing to wear any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger his <hi>Magnificent Codpiece,</hi> and clothing himself in four, <hi>French</hi> Ells of a course brown Russet Cloth, shows that as he was a <hi>Monk,</hi> he could not weare a <hi>Codpiece</hi> as was the fashon in those Days, for the Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; or perhaps it denotes his affecting to imitate the simplicity of Garb, which was observable in <hi>Calvinist</hi> Preachers.</p>
            <p>This Subaltern Hero of the Farce, now found to be the Bishop of <hi>Valence</hi> by the Circumstances and Qualifications already dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, that cannot properly belong to any other, may help us to know not only <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> to whom he had devoted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but also <hi>Gargantua</hi> and <hi>Grangousier</hi> the Father and grand-Father of <hi>Pantagruel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>History assures us, that <hi>Montluc</hi> Bishop of <hi>Valence</hi> ow'd his advancement to <hi>Margue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite Devalois,</hi> Queen of <hi>Navarre</hi> and Sister to King <hi>Francis</hi> the I. She took him out of a <hi>Monastery</hi> where he was no more than a <hi>Iacobin Fryar,</hi> and sent him to <hi>Rome,</hi> whereby he was raised to the Rank of an Embassador, which was the first step to his Advancement.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Pantagruel</hi> should be <hi>Anthony</hi> de <hi>Bourbon</hi> Duke of <hi>Vendosme,</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> the
<pb n="lv" facs="tcp:46180:33"/>
IV.'s Father, and <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIV's great grand-Father. He was married to <hi>Ieanne de Albret</hi> the only Daughter of the said Queen <hi>Margaret,</hi> and of <hi>Henry d' Albret</hi> King of <hi>Navarre.</hi> Thus he became their Son, and King of <hi>Navarre</hi> after the Death of the said <hi>Henry d' Albret</hi> whom I take to be <hi>Gargan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi>: consequently his Father <hi>Iohn d' Albret</hi> King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> excommunicated by Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the III. and depriv'd of the best part of his Kingdom by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of of <hi>Arragon,</hi> should be <hi>Grangousier.</hi>

Nothing can better demonstrate the great Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius and Prudence of our Author who could submit to get together so many odd Names, of trifling things, to keep himself out of Danger, and grace the Counterpart which is so judicious and so grave; he had told us first, that <hi>Gargantua</hi> under his former Peda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, after a good Breakfast went to Church, a huge greasie Breviary being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed before him in a great Basket; that there he heard 26 or 30 Masses; that this while came his Martin Mumbler (Chaplain) muffled about the Chin (that is with his Cow) round as a Hoop, and his Breath pretty well antidoted with the Vine-Tree-Syrop, that with him he mumbled all his

Kyriels, and as he went from the Church, santring along through the Cloysters, ridled more of St. <hi>Claude</hi>'s Patinotres, then sixteen Hermits could have done. So that there we find him a Papist, and in the following Chapter, as I have said a Protestant.</p>
            <p>Without doubt, the Sophisters under whom <hi>Gargantua</hi> did not improve were some noted Men in his Age,<note place="margin">

            <p>Many who take him to be <hi>Francis</hi> the First, think that his huge <hi>great Mare</hi> is Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>d'Estampes,</hi> that King's Mistress, and explain that Mare's skirmishing with her Tail, whereby she overthrew all the Wood in the Country of <hi>Beauce,</hi> by a Gift which they say, he made her of some of its Forests.
<pb n="lxxiij" facs="tcp:46180:42"/>
They say also, That the King was desirous to buy her a Necklace of Pearls; and that partly on that account he would have got some Money of the Citizens of <hi>Paris</hi>; but they being unwilling to comply with his demand, the King and his Mistress threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to sell the Bells of <hi>our Lady</hi>'s Church (the Cathedral) to buy <hi>his Lady</hi> a Necklace: And that this has given occasion to say,<note place="margin">

            <p>Though, as I have said, <hi>Gargantua</hi> be not <hi>Francis</hi> the First, I might believe that <hi>Rabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais</hi> had a mind to make us merry with the recital of such an Adventure, were it not certain that the said King has read his Book, and would hardly have liked such a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, had he been himself an Actor there; but, besides, History relates nothing of this Nature of him; nor has the Story of the Bells the resemblance of Truth.</p>
            <p>As for the blow with the Mare's Tail, it might as well belong to <hi>Henry d' Albret,</hi> who has not been without a Mistress. Had I been able to get some certain Books, and had the Bookseller not been impatient, by reason of the Term, I would have done my Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to unriddle that Enigma; but having hardly a Fortnights time, to make my Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, and finish the Author's Life and this Preface, I must put off that Inquiry till some

other Opportunity, and then what further Discoveries I may make, may be published with those on the fourth and fifth Books, which contain <hi>Pantagruel</hi>'s Voyage to the holy Bottle, as beautiful at least as these three.</p>
            <p>I will however, offer here a Conjecture on that story of the Bells; we find in the 17, 18 and 19th. Chapters of the first Book, that Master <hi>Ianotus de Bragmardo</hi> a Sophister is sent to <hi>Gargantua</hi> to recover the Bells, and makes a wretched Speech to him about it; I am sensible that 'twas partly his Design to ridicule the Universities, which at that time deserv'd no better in <hi>France.</hi> But in particular, I believe that he aim'd at <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis,</hi> a Doctor of <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> and afterwards Bishop of <hi>Auranches,</hi> for I find that this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late had writ a Treatise won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully pleasant,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hist. de Iean Crespin.</hi>
               </note> concerning the Signs, whereby the true Church may be distinguish'd from the false; in it he waves the preaching of the Gospel, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of the Sacraments, and pretends to prove that Bells are the signs which essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially distinguish the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from the Reform'd, who at that time had none, and us'd to assemble privately at the letting off of a Musquet in the High Street, which was a sign by which they knew that it was time to meet to perform Divine Service. <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis</hi> on this, triumphs, as if he had gain'd his Point, and runs on in a long Antithesis,
<pb n="lxxv" facs="tcp:46180:43"/>
to prove that Bells are the signs of the true Church, and Guns the mark of the bad; all Bells, says he, sound; but all Guns thunder, all Bells have a melodious Sound, all Guns make a dreadful Noise; Bells open Heaven, Guns open Hell; Bells drive away Clouds and Thunder, Guns raise Clouds, and mock the Thunder. He has a great deal more such Stuff, to prove that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the true Church, because forsooth, it has Bells, which the other had not.</p>
            <p>The taking away the Bells of a Place, implys its Conquest, and even Towns that have Articled are oblig'd to redeem their Bells; perhaps the taking away the great Bells at <hi>Paris,</hi> was the taking away the Privileges of its University, or some other; for <hi>Paris</hi> may only be nam'd for a Blind. Thus the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Beggar of the Fryars of <hi>St. Anthony,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for some Hog's Purtenance (<hi>St. Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>'s Hog is always pictur'd with a Bell at its Neck) who to be heard afar off, and to make the Beacon shake in the very Chimneys, had a mind to filch and carry those Bells away privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but was hindered by their weight; that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Beggar, I say, must be the head of some Monks, perhaps of that Order in the <hi>Faux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg St. Antoine,</hi> who would have been sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted to those that had been deprived, and the Petition of Master <hi>Ianotus</hi> is the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don which the University begs, perhaps for some affront resented by the Prince; for those

               <hi>and those of</hi> Gargantua<hi>'s Country; whereupon were wag'd great Wars.</hi> We may easily apply many things concerning these Wars to those of <hi>Navarre,</hi> between the House of <hi>d'Albret,</hi> and King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth. Thus <hi>Les Truans,</hi> or as this Translation renders it, the Inhabitants of <hi>Lerné,</hi> who, by the command of <hi>Picrochole</hi> their King, invaded and plunder'd <hi>Vtopia, Gargantua</hi>'s Country, are the <hi>Spanish</hi> Soldiers, and <hi>Lerné</hi> is <hi>Spain.</hi> The word <hi>Truand</hi> in old <hi>French,</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies an idle lazy Fellow, which hits pretty well the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Character, the Author having made choice of that name of a place near

            <p>Those that will narrowly examin Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, will find that many particulars of the Wars in the first Book of <hi>Rabelais,</hi> may be reconcil'd to those of <hi>Navarre</hi>; but I believe that he means something more than a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the Fights among the Soldiers, by the debate rais'd betwixt the <hi>Cake-sellers</hi> or <hi>Fouassiers</hi> of <hi>Lerné,</hi> and the <hi>Shepherds</hi> of <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantua.</hi> Those <hi>Shepherds</hi> or <hi>Pastors,</hi> should be the <hi>Lutheran</hi> and <hi>Calvinist Ministers,</hi> whom <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Henry d' Albert</hi> favour'd, being the more dispos'd to adhere to the reviving Gospel which they preach'd, by the provoking Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the Pope's and King of <hi>Spain's</hi> injurious usage; and for that Reason, Queen <hi>Margarite</hi> did not only profess the Protestant Religion, but after the Death of <hi>Henry d' Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> Queen <hi>Iane</hi> their Daughter, Married to <hi>Anthony de Bourbon,</hi> was a Zealous Defender of it till she dy'd, and her Son <hi>Henry,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="lxxix" facs="tcp:46180:45"/>
rais'd to the Throne of <hi>France,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly own'd himself a Protestant, till his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient desire of being peaceably seated on it, made him leave the better Party to pacifie the worse.</p>
            <p>The Cake sellers of <hi>Lerné</hi> are the Priests, and other Ecclesiastics of <hi>Spain</hi>; as also all the <hi>Missificators</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belais</hi> calls them Cake-mongers, or <hi>Fouassiers,</hi> by reason of the Host, or Sacramental Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, which is made of Dough, between a pair of Irons, like the Cakes or <hi>Fouasses</hi> in <hi>Poitou,</hi> where <hi>Rabelais</hi> liv'd, and is said to be transubstantiated into the <hi>Corpus-Christi,</hi> when consecrated by the Priest.</p>
            <p>The Subject of the Debate, as <hi>Rabelais</hi> terms it, between those Cake-sellers and the Shepherds is the first's refusal to supply the latter with Cakes, to eat with the Grapes which they watch'd. For as <hi>Rabelais</hi> observes, <hi>'Tis a Celestial Food, to eat for Break-fast, fresh Cakes with Grapes,</hi> by which he alludes to the way of receiving the Communion among the Protestants, who generally take that <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Food</hi> fasting, and always with the juice of the <hi>Grape,</hi> that is, with Wine, according to the Evangelical Institution. Now the Cake-mongers or Popish Priests would not consent to give Cakes, that is to say, <hi>Bread,</hi> but would only give the accidents of the <hi>Cakes,</hi> or to speak in their own Phrase, the <hi>accidents of the Bread,</hi> and it is well known that this was
<pb n="lxxx" facs="tcp:46180:46"/>
the chief occasion of our separation from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the reasonable request of the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, the Cake-sellers, instead of granting it, presently fall to railing and reviling, adding, after a whole Litany of comical, though defamatory Epithetes, that course unraung'd Bread, or some of the great brown Houshold Loaf was good enough for such Shepherds, meaning that the gross Notions of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation ought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o satisfie the Vulgar. The Shepherds reply modestly enough, and say that the others us'd formerly to let them have Cakes, by which must be understood, the times that preceded the Doctrin of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantion. Then <hi>Marquet</hi> one of the Cake-Merchants treacherously invites <hi>Forgier</hi> to come to him for Cakes, but instead of them, only gives him a swindging Lash with his Whip, over-thwart the Legs, whereupon he is rewarded by the other with a broken Pate, and falls down from his Mare, more like a dead then like a living Man, wholly unfit to strike another blow.</p>
            <p>These two Combatants are the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verstists of both parties; the Papist immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately begins to rail and abuse his Adversary. The <hi>Lutheran</hi> confounds him in his replys, and for a blow with a Whip treacherously given, very fairly disables his Enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="lxxxi" facs="tcp:46180:46"/>This is the Judgment that <hi>Rabelais,</hi> a Man of Wit and Learning impartially passes on the Writers of both Parties. If any would seek a greater Mystery in that <hi>Grand Debate</hi> as <hi>Rabelais</hi> calls it, which term I believe he would hardly have used for a real Fight, let them imagin that he there describes the Conference at <hi>Reinburgh,</hi> where <hi>Melancthon, Bucer</hi> and <hi>Pistorius</hi> debated of Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Eccius, Iulius Pflug</hi> and <hi>Iohn Gropper,</hi> and handled them much as <hi>Forgier</hi> did <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Exploit of <hi>Forgier</hi> being incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, if compared to those of Fryar <hi>Ihon des Entomeures,</hi> or <hi>of the Funnels,</hi> as some cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly call him, we should endeavour to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover who is that brave <hi>Monk</hi> that makes such rare Work with those that took away the <hi>Grapes</hi> of the Vineyard. By the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Key which I think fit to give you after this, since it will hardly make up a Page; we are told, that our Fryar <hi>Ihon</hi> is the Cardinal of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> Brother to the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>; but that Conjecture is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly groundless; for though the Princes of his House were generally very brave, yet that Cardinal never affected to show his Courage in martial Atchievements, and was never seen to girt himself for War, or to fight for the Cause which he most espoused; besides, had he been to have fought, it would have been for <hi>Picrochole.</hi> It would
<pb n="lxxxij" facs="tcp:46180:47"/>
be more reasonable to believe that Fryar <hi>Ihon</hi> is <hi>Odet de Coligny</hi> Cardinal <hi>de Chastillon,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Tholouse,</hi> Bishop and Earl of <hi>Beauuais,</hi> Abbot of St. <hi>Benign,</hi> of <hi>Dijon,</hi> of <hi>Fleury,</hi> of <hi>Ferrieres</hi> and of <hi>Vaux de Cernay:</hi> For, that Prelate was a Man of Courage, no ways infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to his Younger Brothers, the Admiral and the Lord <hi>d' Andelot.</hi> Besides, he was an Enemy to <hi>Spain</hi> and a Friend to <hi>Navarre</hi>;<note place="margin">

<pb n="lxxxv" facs="tcp:46180:48"/>
               <hi>Rabelais</hi> drew his <hi>Friar Ihon</hi> by this Man, but 'tis not unlikely that he had a mind to bring him in, by giving some of his Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications to his <hi>Monk</hi>; for there is no doubt that our Author made his Characters double as much as he could, as it were, stowing three, and perhaps<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> five, in the place of one for want of Room; not altogether like an Actor who plays three different Parts in the same Piece, nor like <hi>Scaramouch,</hi> who acts various Parts in the same Clothes, but like that <hi>Pantomime</hi> in <hi>Lucian,</hi> who represented several Things at once; and was said to have five different Souls in one Body. Thus, if <hi>Picrochole,</hi> besides the Characters of King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, includes that of Dr. <hi>de St. Marthe</hi> of <hi>Fronte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaut,</hi> as his Grand Sons said to <hi>Menagius,</hi> Brother <hi>Ihon</hi> may also be some <hi>Monk</hi> of the Abbey where <hi>Rabelais</hi> had lived.</p>
            <p>I presume to say more, though, as all that I have said already, I humbly offer it as bare and uncertain Conjectures; why may we not suppose that our Author has a mind to give us, after his manner, a Sketch of the great <hi>Luther?</hi> He was also a <hi>Monk,</hi> and a jolly one too; being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as <hi>Rabelais</hi> says, <hi>A Clerk even to the Teeth in matter of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viary.</hi> The Vineyard, and consequently the Wine which is saved, is the Cup in the Communion, which, through his means, when taken away by the Popish Priests, was
<pb n="lxxxvi" facs="tcp:46180:49"/>
in spight of <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperor, also King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and his Soldiers, restored to the Protestants in <hi>Germany.</hi> The <hi>Prior,</hi> who calls <hi>Friar Ihon drunken Fellow,</hi> for troubling the <hi>divine Service,</hi> may be the <hi>Pope</hi> and the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Clergy.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Friar Ihon</hi> throwing off his great <hi>Monk's</hi> Habit, and laying hold on the Staff of the Cross, is <hi>Luther</hi>'s leaving his Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, to rely on Christian Weapons, the Merit of his Redeemer. The Victory ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained against those that disorderly ravag'd the Vineyard and took away the Grapes, is his baffling the Arguments of his Opposers; and their being out of Order, means the Ignorance of the Papists. The little Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kitos that profer their help to <hi>Friar Ihon,</hi> and who leaving their outer-Habits and Costs upon the Rails, made an end of those whom he had already crushed, are those <hi>Monks</hi> and other of the Clergy, much inferior to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> who followed his Reformation, and wrote against those whom he had in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wholly confuted.</p>
            <p>'Tis known, That at the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> the <hi>Germans</hi> thirsted very much after the Wine in the Eucharist, and that they were as eager for the abolishing of the Cannons that enjoyn'd Celibacy to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, as for the Restitution of the Cup to the Laity.

            <p>Indeed, what is said of <hi>Friar Ihon, Chap.</hi> 41, 42 and 43. may induce us to believe, that the Man who has the greatest share in the Character of the <hi>Monk</hi> did not absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cast off his Frock, but far from it, we see that the <hi>Friar</hi> kept it on to preserve himself from his Enemies, and desired no other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour for Back and Breast, and after <hi>Gargan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi>'s Followers had armed him <hi>Cap-a-pié</hi> against his Will, his Armour was the cause of an unlucky Accident, which made him call for help, and swear that he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, while he remain'd hang'd by the Ears on a Tree. So he afterwards threw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Armour, and took to him the Staft of the Cross; holding himself invulnerable with his <hi>Monkish</hi> Habit. Accordingly when Captain <hi>Drawforth</hi> is sent by <hi>Picrochole</hi> with 1600 Horsemen thoroughly besprinkled
<pb n="lxxxviij" facs="tcp:46180:50"/>
with holy water, and who to be distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their Enemies, wore a <hi>Stole</hi> instead of a Scarf (for so it should have been in the 43. Chapter, and not <hi>Star</hi> as it is there printed) we find that <hi>Fryar Ihon</hi> having frighted them all away, Draw-forth only excepted, that bold Enemy, with his utmost strength could not make his Lance pierce our Monk's Frock, and was soon knock'd down by him with the staff of the Cross; and found out to be a Priest by his Stole.</p>
            <p>This confirms what has been said, that, all this War is chiefly a dispute of <hi>Religion</hi>; and this part of it seems to relate to Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Chastillon,</hi> because he was secure within his Ecclesiastical habit; the Authour some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, as I have said, joyning several Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters together. Thus the Monk's discourse at Table is not only applicable to that Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal but also to <hi>Montluc</hi> Bishop of <hi>Valence,</hi> who makes his first appearance on our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's stage, in the second act by the name of <hi>Panurge</hi>; for <hi>Fryar Ihon</hi> being desired to pull off his Frock; <hi>Let me alone with it,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes he, <hi>I'l drink the better while it is on, It makes all my Body Iocund, did I lay it aside, I should lose my appetite</hi>: So, Many in those days, as well as in these, lov'd the Benefice more then they hated the <hi>Religion.</hi> Some will say that the request made then to <hi>Fryar Ihon</hi> was only, that he should ease himself of his monastic Frock while he was at Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="lxxxix" facs="tcp:46180:50"/>
but <hi>Rabelais</hi> would not have made his Monk refuse such a request; he knew that some of the Princes of the Clergy had in his time, at the <hi>French Court,</hi> and in the King's Presence taken a greater liberty; for there had been a Ball in <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII's Reign, where two Cardinals danc'd before him, among the rest; and in another given him by <hi>Ioanne-Iacomo Trivulse,</hi> several Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and great Lords had danc'd in Fryar's habit. The Monk talks with a great deal of Freedom at <hi>Gargantua</hi>'s Table, and swears that he kept open house at <hi>Paris</hi> for six Months; then he talks of a Fryar that is become a hard Students then says that for his part he studies not at all, justifying himself for this conduct in false Latin; after this he abruptly starts a new matter, and lets his Fancy run after hares, hawks and hounds, and thus he goes on by sallies, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably humours the way of talking of the young <hi>Courts Abbots</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> Now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the Cardinal who did not set up for a Man of Learning, being of great Quality, allowed himself Liberty accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, making hunting one of his Recreations;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>B.</hi> 1. <hi>Ch.</hi> 40.</note> and indeed what <hi>Gargantua</hi> says concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Fryar-Ihon,</hi> in the next Chapter, hits Cardinal <hi>Chastillon's</hi> Character exactly: There having taxed most Monks with mumbling out great store of Legends and Psalms, which
<pb n="xc" facs="tcp:46180:51"/>
they understand not at all, and interlarding many <hi>Paternotres,</hi> with ten times as many <hi>Ave-maries</hi> without thinking upon or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the meaning of what they say, which he calls mocking of God and not Prayers; he says, that <hi>all true Christians in all places, and at all times send up their Prayers to God, and the Spirit prayeth and intercedes for them and God is gracious to them: Now such a one, adds he, is our</hi> Fryar-Jhon, <hi>he is no Bigot</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>What <hi>Grangousier</hi> says to the <hi>French</hi> Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims, shows that he also was no Biggot, and was not King of <hi>France</hi>; when speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of some superstitious Preachers, one of whom had called him <hi>Heretic,</hi> he adds, <hi>I wonder that your King should suffer them in their Sermons to publish such Scandalous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin in his Dominions. Then Fryar-Ihon,</hi> says to the Pilgrims, that <hi>while they thus are upon their Pilgrimage, the Monks will have a Fling at their Wives.</hi> After that, <hi>Grangousier</hi> bids them <hi>not be so ready to undertake those idle and unprofitable journyes, but go home and live as St. Paul directs them, and then God will guard them from Evils</hi> which they think to avoid by Pilgrimages.</p>
            <p>What has been observed, puts it beyond all doubt, that our jesting Author was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in Earnest when he said, that he mystical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treated of <hi>the most high Sacraments,</hi> and dreadful secrets, in what concerns our <hi>Religion,</hi>
               <pb n="xci" facs="tcp:46180:51"/>
I know, that immediately after this, he passes off with a Banter what he had assur'd very seriously; but this was an admirable peice of Prudence; and who ever will narrowly examin his writings will find, that this Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is inseparably joyned with his wit, so that his Enemies never could have any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage over him.</p>
            <p>But not to comment upon several other Places in his first Book, that the ingenious may have the pleasure of unriddling the rest of it themselves, I will only add, that his manner of ending it is a Master peice surpassing, the artful evasion, which as I have now observed, is in its Introduction.</p>
            <p>It is an <hi>Enigma,</hi> as indeed is the whole Work, I could only have wished that it had been proper to have put it into a more modish Dress (for then doubtless it would have more generally have pleased) But I suppose that the Gentleman who revised this Translation thought it not fit to give the Graces of our Modern <hi>Enigmas</hi> to the Translation of a prophetical Riddle <hi>in the style of Merlin. Gargantua</hi> piously fetches a very deep sigh, when he has heard it read, and says, that he perceives by it, that it is not now only, that People called to the Faith of the Gospel, are persecuted; but happy is the Man that shall not be scandalized, but shall always continue to the end, in aiming at the Mark, which
<pb n="xcij" facs="tcp:46180:52"/>
God by his dear Son has set before us <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Upon this the Monk asks him, what he thought was signified by the Riddle? What? says <hi>Gargantua,</hi> the Decrease and Propagation of the Divine Truth; That is not my Expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, says the Monk, it is the style of the Prophet <hi>Merlin</hi>; make as many grave Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories, and Tropes as you will; I can conceive no other meaning in it, but a des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription of a Set at <hi>Tennis</hi> in dark and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure Terms. By this Riddle which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds he cunningly seems to insinuate that all the rest of his Book, which he has not explained, wholly consists of trifles; and what is most remarkable, is that he illustrates the Truths which he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed by the very Passage where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he pretends to make them pass for Fables, and thus blinds with too much light, those Enemies of Truth, who would not have failed to have burned him alive, in that persecuting Age, had he had less Wit and Prudence than they shewed Ignorance and Malice.</p>
            <p>I need not enlarge much on the other Books by reason of the Discoveries made in the first that relate to them. The first Chapter of the second, gives us <hi>Pantagruel's</hi> Pedigree from the Giants: It has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by a Learned Man some Years ago, that the word Giant, which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters of the Scripture have set in
<pb n="xciij" facs="tcp:46180:52"/>
their Versions, stands there for another that means no more then <hi>Prince</hi> in the Hebrew; so perhaps our Author was the more ready to make his Princes Giants; tho as I have said, his chief design was tacitly to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in this <hi>Iohn d' Albret,</hi> and such others as (like one in <hi>Britany,</hi> that took for his <hi>Motto, Antequam Abraham esset sum</hi>) were too proud of an uncertain empty Name. His description of the Original of Giants, and the story of <hi>Hurtali's</hi> bestriding the <hi>Ark,</hi> is to mock those in the <hi>Thalmud</hi> and other Legends of the <hi>Rabbins</hi>; for he tells us, that when this happened the <hi>Calends</hi> were found in the <hi>Greek</hi> Almanacs, and all know that <hi>ad Graecas Calendas,</hi> is as much as to say, <hi>Never</hi>; for the <hi>Greeks</hi> never reckoned by <hi>Calends.</hi> Yet, what he tells us of the <hi>Earth</hi>'s Fertility in <hi>Medlars,</hi> after it had been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brued with the Blood of the Just, may be Allegorical: And those who, by feeding on that fair large delicious Fruit, became Monstrous, may be the converts of that Age, who by the Popish World were looked upon as Monsters. The Blood of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> which was profusedly spilt in that Age, has always been thought Prolific even to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, and the word <hi>Mesles</hi> in French and <hi>Medlars</hi> in English, equally import Medling; thus in French, <hi>Il se Mesle de nos affaires,</hi> he medles with our Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; so the <hi>Medlars</hi> may be those who
<pb n="xciv" facs="tcp:46180:53"/>
busied themselves most about the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Great Drought</hi> at the Birth of <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel,</hi> is that almost universal cry of the Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for the Restitution of the Cup in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, at the time that <hi>Anthony de Bourbon</hi> Duke of <hi>Vandosme,</hi> was married to the Heiress of <hi>Navarre,</hi> which was in <hi>Octob.</hi> 1548, the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> then sitting. For, thence we must date his Birth, since by that match he afterwards gain'd the Title of King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides <hi>Bearn, Bigorre, Albret,</hi> and several other Territories; and we are told, <hi>Book</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 48. that <hi>Pantagruel</hi> at the very first Minute of his Birth, was no less tall than the Herb <hi>Pantagruelion</hi> (which unquestionably is Hemp) and a little before that, 'tis said that its height is commonly of five or six foot. The Death of Queen <hi>Margarite</hi> his Mother in Law, that soon follow'd, made our Author say, that when <hi>Pantagruel</hi> was born, <hi>Gargantua</hi> was much perplexed, seeing his Wife Dead, at which he made many Lamentations. Perhaps this also alludes to the Birth of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, which caus'd the Death of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Queen <hi>Iane Seymour.</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth is said to have comforted himself, with saying that he could get another Wife, but was not sure to get another Son: Thus, here we find <hi>Gargantua</hi> much griev'd, and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful by fits, like <hi>Talboy</hi> in the Play, but at last comforting himself with the thoughts of his
<pb n="xcv" facs="tcp:46180:53"/>
Wife's Happiness, and his own, in having a Son, and saying that he must now cast about how to get another Wife, and will stay at home and rock his Son.</p>
            <p>In the sixth Chapter, we find <hi>Pantagruel</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing with a Limosin, <hi>who affected to speak in learned Phrase. Rabelais</hi> had in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chapter, satiris'd many Persons, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a hint of some abuses in the Universities of <hi>France</hi>; in this he mocks some of the Writers of that Age, who to appear learned, wholly fill'd their Works with Latin Words, to which they gave a <hi>French</hi> Inflection. But this <hi>Pedantic Iargon</hi> was more particularly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by one <hi>Helisaine</hi> of <hi>Limoges,</hi> who as <hi>Boileau,</hi> says of <hi>Ronsard, en Francois parlant, Greek et Latin</hi> (speaking Greek and Latin in <hi>French</hi>) thought to have refin'd his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tongue: So <hi>Rabelais,</hi> to prevent the spreading of that Contagion, has not only brought that <hi>Limousin</hi> Author on his <hi>Pantagru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elian</hi> Stage, but wrote a Letter in Verse, all in that Style, in the name of the <hi>Limousin</hi> Scholar, printed at the end of the <hi>Pantagrue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Prognostication. <hi>Pasquier,</hi> who liv'd at that time, has made the like Observation on that Chapter, when in his second Book of Letters, p. 53. he says,—<hi>pour l'ornement de nostre langue, et nous aider mesmes du Grec et du Latin, non pour les escorcher ineptement comme fit sur nostre jeune age,</hi> Helisaine, <hi>dont nostre gentil</hi> Rabelais <hi>s'est mocqué fort a propos en la

            <p>The 7th. Chapter wherein he gives a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of the Books in <hi>St. Victor</hi>'s Library is admirable, and would require a large Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it being a Satyr against many Writers and great Affairs in that Age, as well as against those who either make Collections of bad Books, or seek no others in Libraries; but I have not leasure to read over a great number of Books, that ought to be consulted for such a Task.</p>
            <p>The Cause which was pleaded before <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel</hi> by the Lords <hi>Suck-fizle</hi> and <hi>Kiss-Breech,</hi>

The first has said, <hi>Occult. Philos. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 6. That he knew how to communicate his Thoughts by the species of Sight in a magical Way, as <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was said to do, by writing any thing in the Body of the Moon, so as it should be legible to another at a vast distance; and he pretends to tell us the method of it in his Book, <hi>De vanitate Scientiarum.

And the Venerable <hi>Bede</hi> has made a Book only of
<pb n="xcix" facs="tcp:46180:55"/>
that, commonly stiled <hi>Arthrologia,</hi> or <hi>Dacty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lologia</hi>; which he calls, <hi>Lib. de loquelâ per gestum digitorum, sive de indigitatione:</hi> So that perhaps our Author made his <hi>Thaumast</hi> an <hi>English</hi> Man, not to reflect on <hi>Beda,</hi> but because that Learned Father is the most An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Famous Author that has written a Book on that Subject.</p>
            <p>I have Read of a public Debate much like that of <hi>Thaumast</hi> and <hi>Panurge,</hi> and as probable, said to have been held at <hi>Geneva.</hi> The Agressor lifted up his Arm and closed three of his Fingers and his Thumb, and pointed with the remaining Finger at his Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; who immediately pointed at him again with two. Then the other shewed him two Fingers and one Thumb; whereupon his Antagonist shook his closed Fist at him. Upon this the Aggressor showed him an Apple; and the other looking into his Pocket found a bit of Bread, and in a scornful way let him see it; which made him that began the Dispute yield himself vanquished. Now when the Conqueror was desired to relate what their Signs signified; He with whom I disputed, said he, threatned first to put out one of my Eyes, and I gave him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that I would put out both his: Then he threatned to tear both mine, and take off my Nose; upon which I shewed him my Fist, to let him know, that I would knock him down: And as he perceived that
<pb n="c" facs="tcp:46180:56"/>
I was angry, he offered me an Apple to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie me as they do Children; but I showed him, that I scorn'd his Present, and that I had Bread, which was fitter for a Man.</p>
            <p>After all, <hi>Montluc,</hi> who is our <hi>Panurge,</hi> may have had some Dispute about the Signs of the true Religion, or the two Sacraments of the Protestants, and the seven of the Romans, they being properly called Signs, and such a thing not being recorded by Historians, like many others that relate to this Work, it may not be possible to discover it.</p>

And a Trophy was raised, <hi>Chap.</hi> 27. for a Memorial of those Gentlemens Victory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="cij" facs="tcp:46180:57"/>The next Exploit is that in the 29th. Chapter, where we find how <hi>Pantagruel</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited the Three hundred Giants armed with Free-stone, and <hi>Loupgarou</hi> their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. The Death of <hi>Loupgarou</hi> in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of his Giants, may relate to the taking of <hi>Liliers,</hi> a Town between <hi>Bapaume</hi> and <hi>Aire</hi>: It molested very much the Country that belonged to the <hi>French,</hi> and was seated near a Marsh; yet notwithstanding the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Season, and its resolute Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison, the Duke of <hi>Vendosme</hi> having caused a large Breach to be made, and being ready to storm the Place, the Besieged desired to Capitulate, and after many Parlies surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the Town on dishonourable Terms.</p>
            <p>By Accident the Ammunitions of the Besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers had taken Fire, and even some of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of the Artillery were burn'd; which may perhaps have made our Author say in the foregoing Chapter, that <hi>Carpalin</hi> having set on Fire the Enemy's Ammunition, the flame having reached the Place where was their Artillery, he was in great danger of being burn'd; or perhaps, this alludes to the Duke of <hi>Vendosme</hi>'s setting <hi>Liliers</hi> on fire and destroying it quite, after he had taken it. For our Author writes not like an Historian but like a Poet, who ought not to be blam'd for Anachronisms; nor have the best Critics censur'd <hi>Virgil</hi> for that about <hi>Dido</hi> and <hi>Ene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="ciij" facs="tcp:46180:57"/>
Ages are reckoned by Chronologists. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever 'tis certain, that the Relief of <hi>Terouenne,</hi> and then the Surrender of <hi>Liliers</hi> were <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony de Bourbon</hi>'s two first Exploits; the one soon after the other; then the Three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Giants arm'd with Free-stone, which <hi>Pantagruel</hi> struck down like a Mason, by breaking their stony Armour, mowing them down with the dead Body of <hi>Loupgarou,</hi> are a great number of Castles about <hi>Liliers, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouenne, Saint Omer, Aire</hi> and <hi>Bethune,</hi> which <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Bourbon</hi> demolish'd immediately after he had taken <hi>Liliers,</hi> and then passed through <hi>Terouenne,</hi> which is the City of the <hi>Amaurots</hi> which he went to relieve; by whose Inhabitants <hi>Pantagruel</hi> is so nobly received in the 31th. we may also suppose, that by King <hi>Anarchus, Rabelais</hi> means the plundering lawless Boors that shelter'd themselves in those Castles, who were afterwards reduced to sell Herbs. This is, <hi>Anarchus</hi>'s <hi>being reduc'd to cry green Sawce in a Canvas Iacket.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Vendosme</hi> marched next, without any resistance, through the Upper <hi>Artois,</hi> took <hi>Bapaume</hi> in his Way, which is doubtless the <hi>Almyrods,</hi> called so from <gap reason="foreign">

               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>her to Stop at <hi>Bapaume</hi> or any where else, sent him angrily fresh Orders, wherein he charged him of his Allegiance, to join him that Day at <hi>Chasteau</hi> in <hi>Cambrezis</hi> on pain of incurring his Displeasure. So the Duke, to the great Joy of the Besieged and his greater Sorrow, raised his Camp, and came to the King. Neither does our Author speak of the Surrender of the <hi>Almyrods</hi>; but makes <hi>Pantagruel</hi>'s Forces be overtaken with a great shower of Rain, and then tells us how <hi>Pantagruel</hi> covered a whole Army with his Tongue: For they began, says he, to shiver and tremble, to croud, press and thrust close to one another; which when he saw, he bid his Captains tell them, that it was nothing; however, that they should put themselves into Order, and he would cover them; and he drew out his Tongue
<pb n="cv" facs="tcp:46180:58"/>
only half way, and covered them all. I find that the Duke, before he took <hi>Liliers</hi> and besieged the Castle of <hi>Bapaume,</hi> sent to the King to desire him to send a Months Pay to his Forces, and then he could take some Frontier Towns, and even <hi>Bapaume</hi>; but the King sent him no Money, and, on the contrary, ordered him to march on to meet him; but before he had that Answer, he had taken <hi>Liliers.</hi> So his Soldiers, who wanted their Pay and Clothes, being also vex'd for having, by the King's Fault, missed taking the Booty in the Castle of <hi>Bapaume,</hi> were displeased and in bad Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances; but upon this the Duke spoke to the King, and got them their Arrears and Clothes: And this is what <hi>Rabelais</hi> calls covering an Army with his Tongue. As for what follows, it seems an imitation of <hi>Lucian</hi>'s Whale in his true History, as the News which <hi>Epistemon</hi> brings from Hell in the 30th Chapter is also a Copy of that Author; and what ours says he saw in <hi>Pantagruel</hi>'s Mouth, is only to blind the rest; which seems to me so plain, like most of the Discoveries I here publish, that I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that none ever gave an Account of any of them in the space of above One hundred and Forty Years.</p>
            <p>The Sickness of <hi>Pantagruel</hi> Chapter 33. is his disgust upon this disappointment at
<pb n="cvi" facs="tcp:46180:59"/>
               <hi>Bapaume</hi>; or some real sickness that seiz'd him.</p>
            <p>There the Author concludes his second Book, that was published sometime after the First, which we may perceive by what he tells us of the Monks, and their bigotted Cullies, who had already try'd to find something in it that might render him ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the Law; which caused him to be somewhat more reserved in matters of <hi>Religion</hi> in that and the following, than he was afterwards in the fourth and fifth. Yet we find a Prayer in the twenty ninth Chapter which shews that his <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel, Anthony de Bourbon,</hi> was for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant <hi>Religion,</hi> but did not openly profess it. Accordingly, Historians grant that he was a <hi>Calvinist,</hi> even long before <hi>Rabelais</hi> dyed: And tho for his Interest (as he thought,) he afterwards sided with the <hi>French-Court</hi> against the Protestant Party, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had been mortally wounded at the Siege of <hi>Roan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               </note> he complained of being deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and ordered one of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants who was a Protestant to bring a Minister to him, but the other not being able to do it in those persecuting Times, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to pray by him after the manner of the Reformed <hi>Church,</hi> which the other did to that unfortunate King's
<pb n="cvij" facs="tcp:46180:59"/>
satisfaction; Cardinal <hi>de Bourbon</hi> his Brother being then present.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Panurge</hi> is the chief actor in the third act of our <hi>Pantagruelian</hi> Play; we find him there much perplexed with uncertainties; his mind fluctuating between the desire of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into a matrimonial Engagement and the fear of having occasion to repent it. To be eased of his doubt, he consults several Persons, all famous for some particular skill in removing Anxieties of mind; and there our Learned and Ingenious Satyrist displays his knowledge and his fancy to admiration, as has been observed by the Learned <hi>Van Dale</hi> in the passage which I have given you out of his Book <hi>de Oraculis,</hi> after the Account of our Author's Life.</p>
            <p>But before that, we find <hi>Pantagruel</hi> in the first Chapter transporting a Colony of <hi>Vto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians</hi> into <hi>Dipsodie</hi>; for which <hi>Rabelais</hi> gives a very good Reason and proves himself a Master at Politics as well as at other Things. To explain that passage, we must know, that the Duke of <hi>Vendosme</hi> garrison'd out of <hi>Picrady</hi> some of the Places that had been taken in <hi>Artois,</hi> fixing also there some of his Vassals and Tenants, who were very numerous there abouts; and as he was born among them <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>La Fere</hi> in 1518<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he had a particular love for them.</p>
            <p>In the second Chapter <hi>Panurge</hi> is made <hi>Laird of salmygondin in Dipsodie,</hi> and wasteth
<pb n="cviij" facs="tcp:46180:60"/>
his Revenue before it comes in: I can apply this to nothing but the gift of some Benefice to <hi>Montluc</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Vendosme</hi> or the Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> afterwards his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Law; which Benefice not being sufficient to supply him in his Extravagances, something more considerable was bestowed on him; which having set him at Ease gave him occasion to reflect on his former ill conduct and grow more thrifty: So that afterwards he entertained some thoughts of Marriage and probably was married, when <hi>Rabelais</hi> wrote.</p>
            <p>Among those whom <hi>Panurge</hi> consults, the <hi>Sybil</hi> of <hi>Panzoust</hi> is the first whose right name is difficult to be discovered. The pretended <hi>Key</hi> in the <hi>French</hi> makes her a <hi>Court</hi> Lady; but its Author seems never to have read <hi>Rabelais,</hi> or at least not to have understood him, if we may judge of it by the Names which he, in spight of Reason, has set against some of those in our Author. Among four or five short Explanations of as many Passages in <hi>Rabelais,</hi> also printed in the <hi>French,</hi> one of them tells us, that by the <hi>Sybil</hi> of <hi>Panzoust,</hi> our Author means a Gentlewoman of that Place, near <hi>Chinon,</hi> who dy'd very old, and always lived single tho importuned by her Friends to marry when she was young. But <hi>Rabelais</hi> having in this Book very artfully made his <hi>Panurge</hi> consult Men of different Professions famous
<pb n="cix" facs="tcp:46180:60"/>
in his Time, to be eased of his doubt, I do not beleive that he would have begun by a Woman altogether unknown to the learned World: Yet not, but that he may have made choice of the Name of <hi>Panzoust</hi> to double the Character, if he knew that such an Antiquated She-thing, liv'd there. I have indeavoured to discover who might be that <hi>Sybill,</hi> but dare not positively fix that Character on any. <hi>St. Therese,</hi> a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> Nun, who liv'd in that Age, might come in for a share, she has writ several Books, and was already famous when <hi>Rabelais</hi> liv'd, she had very odd notions, and discover'd perhaps as much madness as sanctity. I find another noted crack'd-brain <hi>Bigotte,</hi> who was old at that Time and liv'd at <hi>Venice:</hi> Tis one whom several great Men have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by the name of <hi>Virgo Venetas. Guillaume Postel,</hi> amongst the rest, a very learned Jesuit and very famous in that Age for <hi>Philosophy,</hi> calls her Mother <hi>Ioane,</hi> and had such a veneration for her, that he thought the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the <hi>Female</hi> Sex, not yet perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that such a glorious Work was reserved for her; but <hi>Florimond de Raymond</hi> excuses him in this, and says, that he only designed to praise her, for the great services which she had done him in his Travels. There is another, for whom I would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe the <hi>Sybil's</hi> Character made, were
<pb n="cx" facs="tcp:46180:61"/>
I sure that our Author and she were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries: Her name is <hi>Magdelen de la Croix</hi> she was a Nun, and had so well gained the reputation of being a Saint, that she was consulted as a <hi>Sybil</hi> by the greatest Kings and Princes in <hi>Europe</hi>; but at last she proved a Sorceress and was burn'd. If I am not mistaken Dr. <hi>Henry More</hi> has made mention of her; and I have read her History among several others in a Book called <hi>Histoires Tragiques.</hi> But as I am forc'd to quote those Books by memory, like many others which I cannot conveniently procure, I must refer the Reader to them for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther satisfaction.</p>
            <p>In the one and twentieth Chapter <hi>Panurge</hi> consulteth with <hi>Raminagrobis</hi> an old <hi>French</hi> Poet, who was almost upon the very last mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Life. This Poet was <hi>William Cret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi> Treasurer of the King's <hi>Chappel,</hi> who had liv'd under <hi>Charles</hi> the VIII. <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII. and <hi>Francis</hi> the I. as may be seen by his Works. Never was Man more celebrated by the Writers of his Age. <hi>Iohn le Maire</hi> dedicated to him his three Books of the <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrations of France,</hi> and speaks of him as of the Man to whom he owed all things <hi>Geoffroy Toré</hi> in his <hi>Champ fleury</hi> says, that <hi>Cretin</hi> in his <hi>Chronicles of France</hi> had out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil.</hi> And even <hi>Maro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

inscribed to him his <hi>Epigrams.</hi> Here are the four first verses of <hi>Marot</hi> to him.</p>

               </l>
            </q>
            <p>All their Beauty (if they can be said to have any) consists in their <hi>Rich</hi> or rather <hi>punning</hi> Rhimes; and truly that <hi>Epigram</hi> is unworthy of <hi>Marot</hi>: Tis probable that as <hi>Cretin</hi> was then old he was respected by the young <hi>Fry,</hi> who yet outliv'd their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; for never did Man sooner lose after his Death, the Fame which he had gained during his Life: And the Reason which caused <hi>Marot</hi> to write to him in such equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal Rhimes, was doubtless, because <hi>Cretin</hi> affected much that way of Writing. Here are four of <hi>Cretin</hi>'s Lines which in his Book are follow'd by 122 more such.</p>

            <p>I never saw more Rhime with so little sence. For this Reason, <hi>Rabelais who</hi> (as <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quier</hi> says) <hi>had more Iudgment and Learning than all those that wrote</hi> French <hi>in his time,</hi>
               <pb n="cxij" facs="tcp:46180:62"/>
has exposed that riming old Man: And to leave us no room to doubt of it, the <hi>Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deau</hi> which <hi>Raminagrobis</hi> gives to <hi>Panurge</hi> upon his irresolution as to his marriage, <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nez la ne la prenez pas</hi> &amp;c. that is, <hi>Take, or not take her, off or on,</hi> &amp;c. is taken out of <hi>Cretin,</hi> who had addrest it to <hi>Guillau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me de Refuge</hi> who had ask'd his advice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the same perplexity. However <hi>Rabelais</hi> makes him dye like a good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant, and afterwards turns off cunningly what the other had said against the Popish Clergy, who would not let him dye in Peace; and to shew more plainly that this is said of <hi>Cretin, Rabelais</hi> says at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the four and twentieth Chapter <hi>Lais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sans là Villaumere,</hi> that is, having left <hi>Villaumere,</hi> which relates to <hi>William,</hi> that Poet's name.</p>
            <p>I ought not to omit a Remark printed in the last <hi>Dutch</hi> Edition of this Book concerning what <hi>Panurge</hi> says of <hi>Cretin. He is by the Vertue of an Ox, an arrant Heretic; a thorough-pac'd rivitted Heretick, I say, a rooted Combustible Heretick, one as fit to burn, as the little wooden</hi> Clock <hi>at</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel, <hi>his Soul goeth to thirty thousand Cart-full of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. Rabelais</hi> there reflects on the Sentence of Death passed on one of the First that owned himself a Protestant at <hi>Rochell.</hi> He was a <hi>Watch-maker,</hi> and had made a <hi>Clock</hi> all of Wood, which was esteemed an admirable Piece; but because it was the Work of one condemn'd for Heresy, the Judges order'd by the said sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="cxiii" facs="tcp:46180:62"/>
that the <hi>Clock</hi> should be burned by the common hangman, and it was burned accordingly; we must also observe that the adjective <hi>Clavelé</hi> that is, <hi>full of Nails</hi> or <hi>Rivitted,</hi> is brought in because that <hi>Watch-maker</hi> who was very famous for his Zeal, was named <hi>Clavelé.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the 24th. Chapter <hi>Panurge</hi> consults <hi>Epistemon,</hi> who perhaps may be <hi>Guillaume Ruffy,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Oleron,</hi> one of Queen <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garite's</hi> Ministers, who had been sometime in Prison for preaching the Reformation, and was afterwards made Bishop in the King of <hi>Navarre</hi>'s Territories, having without doubt dissembled like many others. Thus his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent into Hell, in the second Book, may be his Prison: I own, that he is with <hi>Pantagruel</hi> in the Wars, but so is <hi>Panurge,</hi> and this is done to disguise the Characters; I am the more apt to believe him a Clergy Man, because he understands Hebrew very well, which few a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Layty do, and none else, in our Author, besides <hi>Panurge,</hi> who calls him his dear <hi>Gossip</hi>; then his Name denotes him to be a thinking, considering Man, and as he was <hi>Pantagruel</hi>'s Pedagogue, so probably <hi>Ruffy</hi> initiated or instructed the Duke, in the Doctrine of the new Preachers.</p>

            <p>In the following Chapters, a <hi>Theologian Physitian, Lawyer</hi> and <hi>Philosopher</hi> are consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hippothadeus,</hi> the <hi>Theologian,</hi> may perhaps be <hi>Philip Shwartzerd, alias Melancthon</hi>; for he speaks too much like a Protestant to be the King's Confessor, neither could <hi>Montluc</hi> be supposed to desire his Advice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rondibilis</hi> the Physitian is doubtless <hi>Guliel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Rondeletius. Thuanus</hi> remarks, in the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eighth Book of his History, that <hi>Will. Rondelet</hi> of <hi>Montpellier,</hi> died 1566, and that though he was a learned Physitian, <hi>Rabelais</hi> had satiris'd him; he adds, that indeed the Works of <hi>Rondelet,</hi> do not answer the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, which the World had of him, nor the Reputation which he had gain'd; and his Treatise of Fishes, which is the best that bears his Name, was chiefly the Work of <hi>Will. Pelissier,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Montpelier,</hi> who was cast into Prison for being a Protestant. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <hi>Rabelais</hi> makes him display much Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in his Discourse to <hi>Panurge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am not so certain of the Man whom <hi>Trouil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logan</hi> personates, he calls him an <hi>Ephectic</hi> and <hi>Pyrrhonian Philosopher.</hi> I find that <hi>Petrus Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> or <hi>De la Ramée,</hi> afterwards Massacred
<pb n="cxvi" facs="tcp:46180:64"/>
at <hi>Paris,</hi> had written a Book against <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and we have also his Logic; but as he is mentioned by <hi>Iupiter</hi> in the Prologue to the fourth Book, by the name of <hi>Rameau,</hi> where his dispute with <hi>Petrus Galandius,</hi> and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nam'd <hi>Peter</hi> are also mentioned, I am in doubt about it. <hi>Moliere</hi> has imitated the Scene between <hi>Trouillogan</hi> and <hi>Panurge,</hi> in one of his Plays, and Mr. <hi>Dela Fontaine,</hi> the story of <hi>Hans Carvell,</hi> and that of the Devil of <hi>Pope-feague-land,</hi> in his inimitable <hi>Contes</hi> and <hi>Nouvelles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a <hi>Iack-pudding</hi> in <hi>France</hi> in that Age, call'd <hi>Triboulet,</hi> but I believe that the Fool, whom our Author describes in the 38. Chapter, is one more considerable, though less famous. I cannot guess why he has heap'd up so many Adjectives on that Fool, unless it be to show the excess of his Folly, and to mock some of the Authors of that Age, who often bestow'd a large train of such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary Attendants, on a single Noun Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marotte</hi> is a word very much us'd by the <hi>French,</hi> signifying a Fools Bauble or Club, and the word <hi>

<pb n="cxvi" facs="tcp:46180:64"/>
notable <hi>Iester,</hi> and is said to have played many merry Tricks that relished somewhat of Extravagance: Besides, many among the Vulgar, mistaking the Enthusiasm of Poets for Madness, have but a small Opinion of the Wisdom of most of them. But these Considerations do not seem to me strong enough to make me believe that <hi>Rabelais</hi> would have passed so severe a Censure on that Poet, who was then but lately dead, an Exile for his Religion, and had made ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable mention of him in his Works, they being undoubtedly intimate Friends.</p>
            <p>Judge <hi>Bridlegoose,</hi> who decided Causes by the Chance of Dice; and was Arraigned for Prevarication at the Bar of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Mirelingois,</hi> resembles much a Judge of <hi>Montmartre,</hi> who they say could neither Write nor Read, yet had been a Judge many Years, and being once called into Question in a superior Court, owned his Ignorance as to the Point of Writing and Reading, but affirmed that he knew the Law; and desiring that the Cause of which an Appeal had been made from his Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction might be examined, he was found to have done Justice, and his Sentence and Authority were confirmed. <hi>Rabelais</hi> takes Notice of such a Story, as is that of his <hi>Bridlegoose,</hi> vulgarly reported of the Provost of <hi>Montlehery</hi>: But though he may allude to it, and to that of the <hi>Bayliff</hi> of <hi>Montmartre,</hi>
               <pb n="cxviij" facs="tcp:46180:65"/>
which perhaps may be the same, I believe that his <hi>Bridlegoose</hi> is a Man of greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence. Considering the strong Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion made for him by <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> and the others whom he shows on his Stage, he may be <hi>Guillaume Poyet,</hi> who by the favour of <hi>Loyse de Savoye,</hi> the King's Mother, his Client, had been made Lord Chancellor of <hi>France,</hi> and in 1545, being convinced of several Abuses and Prevarications, was deprived of his Office.</p>
            <p>I have said before, that the Herb <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruelion</hi> is <hi>Hemp; Rabelais</hi> makes <hi>Pantagruel</hi> load a great quantity of it on Board his Ships, and indeed it is one of the most useful things in the World, not only at Sea, but also at Land. The curious and pleasing Description of that Plant, makes up the rest of this Third Book.</p>
            <p>HAD not the following Translation of the three first Books of <hi>Rabelais</hi> been ready to be publish'd, before I was desired to give an Account of them and of his Life, I might have printed my Observations at the End of each Chapter, and have given a more exact Commentary. However I hope that I have said enough to shew, that what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears trivial and foolish in that Work, is generally Grave and of Moment, when se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously examin'd. Yet as I dare not offer my Conjectures as certainties, principally
<pb n="cxix" facs="tcp:46180:65"/>
on a Book which has been so universally read and admired, and never till now at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to be explained, I humbly submit all I have said to the Judgment of the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; to whom I will esteem my self much obliged, if they will be pleased either to let me know wherein I have erred, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to me their Remarks on this Work, which may be printed with the two remaining Books, with their Names, if they please, and a thankful Acknowledgment of the Favour.</p>
            <p>Having first done my Endeavour to satisfie the Reader concerning the Meaning of that mysterious History, I hope to be now the more patiently suffered to give some Account of the Nature of the Fable, the Style and the Design of it.</p>
            <p>MANKIND is naturally addicted to the Love of Fables. Long before Learning had been brought into <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Egyptians, Persians, Arabians</hi> and other <hi>Eastern</hi> Nations, to Enhance the value of Truths, which they did not think fit to be prostituted to the Vulgar, hid them under the Veils of Allegories and Apologues;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Quia sciunt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imicam esse na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae apertam nudamque expositionem sui; quae, sicut vulgaribus hominum sensibus intellectum sui vario rerum teg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine operimento<expan>

               <pb n="cxx" facs="tcp:46180:66"/>
they also used sometimes to lay aside the Study and Speculation of high mysteries to divert themselves with framing Stories which had nothing of Truth in them, and no other design than most of our Romances. Also in the Decay of Learning, which followed that of the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> for want of true <hi>History</hi> and solid Knowledg, Men fed their Minds with gross Fictions, such as are the Legends of Monks, and the old sorts of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances. Thus two opposite ways, barren Ignorance and Luxuriant Learning leading Men often the same End, that is the study of Fables, their Number is as great as their Original is Ancient.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herodotus</hi> says, That the <hi>Greeks</hi> had from <hi>Aegypt</hi> their <hi>Mythologic Theology. Homer</hi> brought from thence that Inclination to Fables, which made him invent many things about the Original and Employments of his Gods; and <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> learned also there to disguise their <hi>Philosophy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus our Author calls his Writings <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical Symbols</hi> in the Prologue to his first Book; and not without Reason, since as I have made it appear, the chief part of them is mysteriously writ. But what those Ancient Philosophers did thro a Reverence of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ours did thro Necessity; being forc'd
<pb n="cxxi" facs="tcp:46180:66"/>
to keep such a <hi>Medium</hi> as that he might be understood by all Readers in most parts of his Book, yet by few Persons in others, and might secure himself from the attacks of his Enemies by the Ambiguity of his Sence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lucian</hi> tells us, that Fables were so much in vogue in <hi>Assyria</hi> and <hi>Arabia</hi> that there were persons whose only Profession i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> was to explain them to the People; and <hi>Erpenius</hi> assures that all the World together never produc'd so many Poets as the Latter. As for <hi>Persia, Strabo</hi> says that Teachers there us'd to give to their <hi>Disciples</hi> Precepts of Morality wrapt up in Fictions. The <hi>Gymno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophists</hi> of <hi>India</hi> are said, by <hi>Diogenes Lae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

liv'd doubtless before <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Syllas</hi>'s Wars; for <hi>Sisenna,</hi> a Roman Historian, had Latiniz'd his Fables, which were very obscene, yet long the delight of the Romans. <hi>Photius</hi> in his <hi>Bibliotheque,</hi> has given an extract of a fabulous Story composed by <hi>Antonius Diogenes,</hi> whom he thinks to have liv'd sometime af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Alexander</hi>: It treats in Prose of the Loves of <hi>Dinias</hi> and <hi>Dercyllis,</hi> in imitation of <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Odysseis,</hi> and relates many incredible Adventures; its Author also makes mention of one <hi>Antiphanes</hi> who before had written in that Nature, and who perhaps, may be a Comic Poet, whom the Geographer <hi>Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> says to have writ some such Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>These are thought to have been the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dells of what <hi>Lucius, Lucian, Iamblichus, Achilles, Tatius</hi> and <hi>Damascius</hi> have written in that kind, not to speak of <hi>Heliodorus,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Tricca,</hi> who under <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius,</hi> wrote the Adventures of <hi>Theagenes</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riclea,</hi> some passages of which have been copied by <hi>Guarini,</hi> and the Author of <hi>Astrea.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Germans,</hi> as <hi>Tacitus</hi> relates, us'd to sing the Heroic Deeds of <hi>Hercules,</hi> when they went to fight.

The most usual diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion at their Feasts was to sing in rhiming Verse the brave Deeds of their ancient Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants. These Stories us'd to draw Tears from the Eyes of the Company, and after that, being well warm'd with good Cheer, to their Tears succeeded Crys and Howlings, till all at last fell in confusion under the Table. The Kings and Princes of <hi>Denmark, Norway,</hi> and the neighbouring Countries had always their <hi>Scaldri,</hi> thus were call'd their Poets, who us'd <hi>extempore</hi> to make Verses in Rhime, embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd with Fictions and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories,<note place="margin">

            <p>The <hi>Indians, Iapanese</hi> and <hi>Chinese</hi> have an infinite Number of Poets and Fables, and the latter esteem almost <hi>Rustic</hi> any other way than that of Apologues in their Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="cxxv" facs="tcp:46180:68"/>Even the <hi>Turks,</hi> to fit themselves for Love or War, have not only the <hi>Persian</hi> Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but Fables of their own devising, and will tell you that <hi>Roland</hi> was a <hi>Turk,</hi> whose Sword they still preserve at <hi>Bursa</hi> with Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, relating the particulars of his Life, and the great things he did in the <hi>Levant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Americans</hi> are great Lovers of Fables, and near <hi>Canada</hi> the most wild among them, after their Feasts, generally desire the oldest or <hi>the greatest Wit</hi> of the Company to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and relate to them some strange Story. <hi>Beavers, Foxes, Racoons,</hi> and other Animals generally come in for a share in the Fiction, and the hearers are very attentive to their Adventures, the Relation of which they never interrupt but by their Applause, and thus Days and Nights are past with equal satisfaction to the Speaker and the Hearers. The People of <hi>Florida, Cumana</hi> and <hi>Perou</hi> excite themselves to work, and to martial exploits by Songs and fabulous Narrations of the great Atchievements of their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors. Whatever they relate of their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin is full of Fictions; but in this those of <hi>Perou</hi> far out-lye the rest, and have their Poets to whom they give a Name that answers to that of <hi>Inventors.</hi> Also those of <hi>Madagascar</hi> have Men who stroul from House to House to recite their Composures; and those of <hi>Guinea</hi> have their tellers of Fables, like those of the Northern Parts of <hi>America.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="cxxvi" facs="tcp:46180:69"/>Thus, as observes <hi>Huetius,</hi> from whom I have borrowed part of these Historical Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations on Fables, no Nation can well at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to it self the Original of them. Since all equally have been addicted to invent some in the most ancient Times; there is only this Difference, that what was the Fruit of the Ignorance of some Nations, even in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> has been that of the Politeness of the <hi>Persians,</hi> the <hi>Ionians</hi> and the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Rabelais</hi> lived all the foolish Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances that had been made in the barbarous Ages that preceded his were very much read; therefore, as he had a design to give a very great latitude to his Satyr, he thought he could not do better than to give it the form of those lying Stories, the better to secure himself from Danger, and at once show their Absurdities; also to cause his Book to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the more read, having perceived that nothing pleased the People better than such Writings; the Wise and Learned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delighted by the Morality under the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories, and the rest by their odness. This was a good Design, and it proved as Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to make those who had any sence throw away those gross Fables stuffed with wretched Tales of Giants, Magicians and Adventurous Knights, as <hi>Miguel de Cervantes</hi>'s <hi>Don Quixot</hi> proved in his Country to root out Knight-Errantry.</p>

               <hi>Lucian</hi> before him, in his Story of
<pb n="cxxvii" facs="tcp:46180:69"/>
the Ass, enlarged afterwards by the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher <hi>Apuleius,</hi> had ridicul'd <hi>Lucius</hi> of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tras,</hi> and, to make it the more obvious, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Fable by the name of that Mytho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logist, who had writ a Book of strange Metamorphoses, which he foolishly believed to be true. <hi>Rabelais</hi> seems also to have imitated <hi>Lucian</hi>'s true History, called so by its Author, by <hi>Antiphrasis</hi>; though some have thought that he had joyned it to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise in which he gives Precepts to write History well, as an Example of his Rules: But he declares at the beginning of that incredible History, That his only design was to expose many Poets, Historians and Philosophers, who, with inpunity, related false Things as Truth, and used, upon unfaithful Relations, to treat of foreign Countries, as <hi>Ctesias</hi> and <hi>Iambulus</hi> had done.</p>
            <p>But our History is not altogether an Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of that of <hi>Lucian,</hi> though it partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates of its Nature.

            <p>I could wish that among the other sorts of Writing which, in something, have been imitated by our Author, I might not rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon <hi>Petronius Arbiter</hi>; Yet I only say this as to his immodesty; for, otherwise, as that Consul under some Amorous Fictions has concealed a close and Ingenious Satyr on the vices that reign'd in <hi>Nero's Court,</hi> and was as nice and good a Judge of polite Learning as of dissolute Pleasures, without doubt he is to be follow'd and admir'd: And indeed his Fable was esteem'd to be like the <hi>Greek</hi> Satyric Poems which <hi>Plato</hi> says consisted of Fictions whose hidden sence differ'd very much from the superficial signification of the Words; since <hi>Macrobius,</hi> while he distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes Fables, made barely to please from those that at once divert and instruct, has placed that of <hi>Petronius</hi> among the latter.</p>
            <p>Our Author<hi>'s</hi> Works are also an Imitation of <hi>Democritus</hi> and of <hi>Socrates,</hi> if we may compare Writings with Actions; for those two <hi>Philosophers</hi> used to be still merry, and freely ridicul'd what ever was a fit Subject of <hi>Rallery</hi>: For this reason <hi>Quintilian</hi> says of the latter, <hi>Etiam vita unversa Ironiam habere
<pb n="cxxxi" facs="tcp:46180:71"/>
videtur, qualis est vita Socratis</hi>; and that great <hi>Philosopher,</hi> who had deserved the Name of <hi>the Wisest of Men,</hi> was called <hi>Scurra</hi> by <hi>Zeno,</hi> as <hi>Tully</hi> renders it: Yet <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi> his Scholars have not only transmitted to us some of his admirable expressions but also imitated them;<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>In this, his Work somewhat differs from the greatest part of the Satires of the <hi>Roman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Accordingly the Authors of the <hi>Roman Satires</hi> generally keep the Character of Censors. <hi>Horace</hi> has given the gayest Air of them all to his <hi>Satires,</hi> and in that of <hi>Nasidienus,</hi> the

Description of the fight between <hi>Sarmentus</hi> and <hi>Messius,</hi> as also in some others, has af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected a comic Style; he also tells us that Satyr ought to be sometimes treated gayly, and at others sullenly or gravely; <hi>Et sermone o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus est modo tristi saepe jocoso.</hi> Yet in other places he speaks of the Sharpness of his Satyrs, and owns that they were an ill-natur'd or malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous kind of Writing.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="cxxxiij" facs="tcp:46180:72"/>This causes another Satyrist speaking of <hi>Lucilius,</hi> whose Imitator he was as well as <hi>Horace,</hi> to say,

            </p>
            <p>The same in another place, reflecting on the deprav'd manners of his Age, crys, <hi>Difficile est Satyram non scribere.</hi> By which he sufficiently shows what was the Object and Design of those sorts of Poems.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Rabelais</hi> chiefly pursues his Subject by jesting and exposing, ridiculing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising what he thinks deserves such an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage; and 'tis but seldom that he makes use of railing, or sullen biting Reproofs.

            <p>In short, 'tis a mixture, or if I may use the Expression, an <hi>Ollio</hi> of all the Merry, Serious, Satyrical and diverting ways of Writing, that have hitherto been us'd. But still Mirth is predominant in the Composition, and like a pleasing Tartness, gives the whole such a relish,<note place="margin">

<pb n="cxxxiv" facs="tcp:46180:73"/>
concerning that way of Writing, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciously observes of some of <hi>Ben Iohnson's,</hi> but such Farce, as bequeaths that Blessing (pronounc'd by <hi>Horace</hi>) on him that shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the like.</p>

            <p>For, as 'tis there observ'd, the Business of Farce extends beyond Nature and Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.

Extravagant and monstruous Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are but sick Dreams that rather torment than divert the Mind, but when Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy and Improbability happen to please at all, they do it to purpose, because they strike our Thought with greatest Surprize.</p>

            </p>
            <p>That is; <hi>All know to what degree the learned Rabelais gain'd the Esteem of the Nation by his wise Drolling on his</hi> Gargantua and Pantagruel; <hi>soon after started up a couple of Apes who conceived that</hi> they could do as much; <hi>viz.

            <p>This Work of <hi>Rabelais</hi> is doubtless an Original by imitating and joyning in one so many others. To imitate it, is not only <hi>periculosae plenu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I might say that it is partly Dramatic: For there appears in it a great deal of Action: The Dialogues, of which it is full, are as many lively Scenes: Europe is the

               </hi> and the <hi>Satyri</hi> did in the <hi>Greek Satyric</hi> Plays. Or, if you had rather have it so, he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys the place of the <hi>Chorus</hi> in some of the Old <hi>Comedies:</hi> The five Books answer exactly the five Acts; and it might perhaps as easily be made appear by a <hi>D' acier</hi> that he has manag'd his <hi>Drama</hi> regularly, as by a <hi>Bossu</hi> that the Father of <hi>Epic</hi> Poetry has observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Just Conduct in his Iliads.</p>
            <p>It has the Form of an History, or rather of Romances, which it tacitly ridicules, I mean such of them as those Ages produced which preceded the Restoration of Learning, that chiefly happened when our Author lived; your <hi>Amadis de Gaule, Lancelot du Lac, Tristan, Kyrie Eleison</hi> of Montauban, &amp;c. For then <hi>Kyrie Eleison</hi> and <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> were taken for the names of Saints; somewhat like the <hi>Epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mizers</hi> of <hi>Gesner's Bibliotheque,</hi> who have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed <hi>Amadis</hi> to one <hi>Acuerdo Olvido,</hi> not knowing that these two Words, which they found on the Title page of the <hi>French</hi> version of that Book, were the Translators <hi>Spanish Motto,</hi> that signifies <hi>Remembrance, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion.</hi> Our Author seems to have mimick'd those Books, even in their Titles, in their Division into Chapters, and in the odd Accounts of their Contents. I am much mistaken if in many places he has not also affected

their <hi>Style</hi>; tho in others he displays all the Purity and Elegancy which the <hi>French-Tongue,</hi> which he has much improved, had at that Time.</p>
            <p>As for the mixture of odd, Burlesque, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, Latin, Greek and obsolete Words which is seen in his Book, 'tis justifiable, as it serves to add to the Diversion of the Reader, pleased generally the more, the greater is the Variety, principally in so odd a Work.</p>

            <p>This mixture of Languages, and of odd and fantastic Terms, has been censured by <hi>Vavassor,</hi> chiefly, because he pretends that the Ancients never us'd it, though none will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that they mixt Words and Verses of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kinds that has read of their <hi>Satura Lanx,</hi> or the <gap reason="foreign">

But to show that odd words, such as are found in our Author's <hi>Burlesque</hi> Writings, have been us'd by the Ancients, we need but consult <hi>Diogenes Laertius,</hi> and we shall find that <hi>Democritus</hi> allowed himself as great a Liberty in using odd Expressions, as in laughing at Mankind. For he had so many particular Words, that a Greek Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor made a Dictionary of them; his <hi>Bio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher</hi> relates some of them, and <hi>Hesychius,</hi> has preserv'd also one or two, which he had

was not so happy in linking Words together, as <hi>Quintilian</hi> observes. Yet we have many in <hi>Plautus</hi> that are downright <hi>Burlesque</hi> of the the same kind, as <hi>Ferritribaces, Servilicolae, Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipatide, Cluninstaridysarchides,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>What shall we think of the <hi>Parodiae</hi> of which <hi>Aristophanes</hi> and <hi>Lucian</hi> are full, and which <hi>Iulian</hi> has us'd in his <hi>Caesars,</hi> as many more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Greeks have done; those Witti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisms being a part of the Salt, which they so much desir'd in all Jocose and Satyrical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posures.</p>
            <p>As for the Puns, Clenches, Conundrums, Quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and all such other Dregs or Bastard sorts of Wit, that here and there have crept in among the infinite number of our Auhor's ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and just Conceptions, I will not Apologize in their Behalf, otherwise then by showing that <hi>Aristophanes</hi> and <hi>Plautus</hi> have strewed them more lavishly through their Works, which are partly of the Nature of this.

The Restauration of Learning had made the most knowing among the Clergy, and the Layety desire that Primitive Christianity might also be restor'd.

refused to grant a Council, but that he would repent it, for the Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would take away what they had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Church. The universal Cry was for the Restitution of the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>p to the Layety, and of Marriage, to the Clergy; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Indulgences, Pardons <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This caused <hi>Rabelais</hi> to put out these <hi>Pithagorical Symhols</hi> as he calls them: That while some of the great ones privately and the Protestants publickly, were indeavouring a thorough-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, he might insinuate a Contempt of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Fopperies ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>efly in the Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> and those that were at the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> as also in such of the Layety as had wit enough to find out his meaning. And this is what he means, in the Prologue to his 3. Book, by the comical Account which he gives of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> who seeing the Inhabitants of <hi>Corinth</hi> all very busy in their preparations for the War, and himself not invited to help them, roul'd and tossed about his Tub, that he might not be said to be Idle. <hi>For,</hi> says <hi>Rabelais, I held it not a little disgraceful to be only an Idle Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator of so many valorous eloquent and warlike Persons who in the View and Sight of all Europe, act this Notable Interlude or Tragicomedy.</hi> By the word, <hi>Eloquent,</hi> we may easily Judge that this <hi>notable Interlude</hi> is the Council then sitting.

the <hi>Bigots</hi> about him cunningly perswaded that King not to read that excellent Work nor its incomparable Preface; tho he was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise not very religious, having made a League with the <hi>Turks,</hi> and joyned his <hi>Fleet</hi> to that of <hi>Barbarossa,</hi> as also charg'd his Children in 1535 on pain of incurring his Curse to revenge his wrongs on <hi>Charles</hi> the V. whom he used to call <hi>Satan's eldest Son.</hi> So,<note place="margin">

               </note> partly that his Book might not have the same fate, he made it myst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erious; and indeed that King had it read to him inspight of those who told him it was heretical. But he was so imbroyl'd in Wars that perhaps he dar'd not favour the Reform'd, for fear of being served by the Pope like the King of <hi>Navarre.</hi> However even his Mother <hi>Loyse de Savoye,</hi> what Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion soever she shew'd to Popish Fopperies, seems to have had but little Respect for them. For, in her Journal writ with her own hand and kept still in the <hi>Chambredes Comptes</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> are found these words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning St. <hi>Francis de Paule; Frere Francois de Paule fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Chapter,
<pb n="cxlvi" facs="tcp:46180:79"/>
of his first Book, show that he treated of <hi>Religion,</hi> as he had said in the Prologue before it. The first <hi>Stanza</hi> may perhaps be only designed to make the rest pass for a Banter; but the second mentions the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> plainly; the first, <hi>whose Slipper 'tis more meritorious to kiss than to gain Pardons</hi>; and the other, <hi>from the depth issued were they fish for Roaches,</hi> that is, the Lake at <hi>Geneva, who said, Sirs, for God's sake let us forbear doing this</hi>; in the <hi>French, Qui dit Messieurs pour Dieu nous en gardons.</hi> I have not the leasure to examin now the other Stanzaes, though I can explain some of them. But to show that <hi>Rabelais</hi> was understood when he writ, we need but read the Verses printed in the <hi>French</hi> before his second Book; they are by <hi>Hugues Salel,</hi> a Man of great Wit and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who, as I have said, had translated <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Iliads</hi>: In them he encourages the Author to write on, and tells him, that under a pleasing Foundation he had so well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd useful Matters, that if he was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded here below, he should be rewarded in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Gross Superstition proceeds from Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; so next to the First he exposes the Latter; but I need not come to particulars: I may say that he has satirised all sorts of Vice, and consequently all sorts of Men; we find them all promiscuously on his Scene, as in <hi>Bay</hi>'s grand Dance in the Rehearsal,
<pb n="cxlvii" facs="tcp:46180:79"/>
Kings, Cardinals, Ladies, Aldermen, Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He saw that Vice was not to be conquer'd in a Declamatory War, and that the angry railing Lectures of some well-meaning Men, were seldom as effectual to make it give Ground, as the gay yet pointed Ralleries of those who seem unconcern'd; the latter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing us effectually, while the others with their passionate Invectives perswade <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of nothing but that they are too angry to direct others.</p>
            <p>This gay way of moralizing has also nothing of the dry mortifying method of those <hi>Philosophers</hi> who, striving to demonstrate their Principles by Causes and a long Series of Arguments, only rack the mind; but its Art and delicacy is not perceived by every Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: Consequently many People will not easily find out the inward Beauties of the Works of <hi>Rabelais</hi>; But he did not intend that every one should perceive them; tho every one may be extreamly diverted by the outward and obvious Wit and Humour. We may say of those hidden graces, what a Learned Man says of those in <hi>Horace's Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires.</hi>

Painting has its Grotesque and bold Touches which seem irregular to the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, only pleased with their odness; while Masters, thro the antic Features and rough Strokes, discover an exact Proportion, a Soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and a Boldness together, which charm them to an unspeakable degree.

Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's first Prologue has lead me to this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, by that which he makes concerning <hi>Socrates.

Thus it teaches us to bear Adversities gallantly, and to make them our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version rather than attack them directly, and
<pb n="cxlix" facs="tcp:46180:80"/>
with a Concern which they are not worthy to cause. <hi>Ridiculum acri plenius ac melius magnas plerumque secat res,</hi> says <hi>Horace.</hi>

            <p>'Tis true, that those whose Temper en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines them to a Stoical Severity, will not have the same taste; and indeed, rallying seldom or never become them; but those who would benefit themselves by the perusal of <hi>Rabelais,</hi> need not imitate his Buffoonry, and it is enough if it inwardly move us, and spread there such Seeds of Joy as will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce on all sorts of Subjects an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of pleasant Reflections.

'Tis even better to drink some too strong Wines, tempering them with Water, which makes them but the more Pleasant, then to confine our selves to flat and insipid Liquors, which neither affect the Palate, nor cheer us within.

            <p>The Age in which our Author wrote, was not so reserv'd in Words as this, and perhaps he has not so much followed his own Genius in making use of gross, or loose expressions as he has endeavoured to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate his way of Writing to the Humour of the People, not excepting a part of the Clergy of those Times. Now we ought
<pb n="cli" facs="tcp:46180:81"/>
not to blame those Authors who wrote in former Ages, for differing from us in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Things; since they follow'd Customs and Manners which were then generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, though now they seem to us impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or unjust. To discover all the Beauties in their Works, we must a while lay aside the Thoughts of our Practice, if it contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts theirs; otherwise, all Books will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry short-liv'd; and the best Writers, being disheartned with the Thoughts of the speedy Oblivion or contempt of their Works, will no longer strive to deserve an immortal Fame, which fantastic Posterity would deny them.</p>

            <p>After all, as I could wish that some Expressions, which I will not only call too bold and too free, but even immodest and Prophane; had not been in this Book, I would not have those Persons to read it, whose Lives are so well regulated, that they would not employ a moment, of which they might not give an account without Blushing; nor those whose Minds not being ripened by Years and Study, are most susceptible of dangerous Impressions. Doubtless, they may do much better, than to read this Book.</p>
            <p>Some therefore will think that either it was not to be Translated, or ought to have been translated otherwise; and that as, in the most handsom Faces, there is always some Line which we could wish were not there; so if those things which here may shock
<pb n="cliv" facs="tcp:46180:83"/>
some persons had been omitted or soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it would more justly, and more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally have pleased; I suppose that the Translator would have done so, had he not been affraid to have taken out some Material Thing hid under the Veil of some unhappy Expression, instead of taking away a bare Trifle.</p>
            <p>But as what may be blameable in this Book, bears no proportion with the almost infinite number of admirable and useful Things, which are to be found in it, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious ought not to be deprived of it. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>'s works, notwithstanding a Thousand Passages in them, against Modesty and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, have been handed down to us by the Primitive Christians; which they would not have done, had they not been sensible that they could do much more good than harm.</p>
            <p>The Art of Writing has caused much Mischief, which made the Ancients say, that its Inventor had sown Serpent's Teeth; yet who would be without the use of Letters? We may as well cut out our Tongue, that <hi>World of Wickedness,</hi> as it is called in Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Weak Minds may turn good things to the worst use; and even sacred Writings have produced ill Effects: Readers are often more blameable than Authors, and should like Bees gather Honey out of Poetical Flowers,
<pb n="clv" facs="tcp:46180:83"/>
instead of sucking the Poison like Spiders. The cause of the ill Actions of most Men is not in Books, but in the wicked Disposition of their Hearts: And the soft Melancholy with which the most chaste Romances often cloud the Mind, thus making way for violent Passions, is much more to be feared than a work of this Nature.</p>
            <p>As long as those and some of our Plays are in the Hands of <hi>the weaker Sex</hi>; that <hi>Catullus, Ovid, Iuvenal</hi> and <hi>Martial</hi> are learned by Heart in Schools by <hi>Men-Children,</hi> and a thousand other Books more dangerous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted to <hi>the ignorant Vulgar; Rabelais</hi>'s Works, in which there is more Morality as well as more Wit and Learning, than in most that are read, may be allowed a place among the Best. <hi>Verbis offendi morbi aut im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillitatis argumentum est,</hi> saith <hi>Cicero:</hi> And we may say for our Author, like <hi>Ausonius, Cui hic Ludus noster non placet ne legerit; aut cum legerit obliviscatur: Aut non oblitus ignoscat.</hi> A learned and pious <hi>English</hi> Man, who was a Bishop in <hi>France</hi> in the old Times,<note place="margin">

            <head>ON The most diverting WORKS OF THE LEARNED D<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> RABELAIS·</head>
            <lg>
               <l>WHile some in wise Mens Garbs are mad,</l>
               <l>Or gravely dull, that's near as bad;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Rabelais,</hi> a Foe to melancholy,</l>
               <l>Is Wisdom in the Garb of Folly.</l>
               <l>Tho' your grave Brutes can never find</l>
               <l>The Fruit within the prickly Rind.</l>
               <l>But if none else for Wise must pass,</l>
               <l>Sure, nothing's wiser than an Ass.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>As dull by Nature or Disaster,</l>
               <l>When Rhimers laugh, 'tis like their Master,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:46180:95"/>And that's not often! For, we hear,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Apollo</hi> laughs but once a Year:</l>
               <l>Scarce can he have so oft occasion,</l>
               <l>So woful is each Wight's Oblation:</l>
               <l>Whence, sympathising with their Rhimes,</l>
               <l>They make us duller than the Times.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But who e'er reads our Doctor's Chronicle</l>
               <l>Must laugh, though not in sence Ironical.</l>
               <l>Who always reads it, will appear</l>
               <l>To laugh indeed but once a year;</l>
               <l>But that's as <hi>once a day</hi> feeds Glutton,</l>
               <l>From Morn to Night, till out-flies Button.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>As in kind House, by Mob call'd Bawdy,</l>
               <l>Old Sinner crawls to Punk that's gawdy,</l>
               <l>Whom charitable fat old Woman</l>
               <l>Has taught to be unkind to no Man;</l>
               <l>He'd play, but cannot, till, by Flogging;</l>
               <l>Rous'd Limberham keeps briskly jogging.</l>
               <l>Jirk'd by his Hackney beyond Reason,</l>
               <l>Yet pleas'd the more, the more she lays on:</l>
               <l>So I who, ply'd with Rhime each hour,</l>
               <l>Have Will to laugh, but scarce have Power,</l>
               <l>Ev'n I, must laugh when I read <hi>Rabelais,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>More pleas'd than Cull, on whom his Drab lays.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:46180:95"/>Pleas'd ev'n to pain, as well as he,</l>
               <l>Yet fear lest others laugh at me.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This Simile, you'll cry, 's not good,</l>
               <l>Nor goes on all Four as it should.</l>
               <l>But why on all Four should it go,</l>
               <l>While I its Dad must plod on two?</l>
               <l>What though i'th' midst of Deed of Pravity,</l>
               <l>Like new sworn May'r Cull keeps his Gravity?</l>
               <l>If he laughs not at Face that's upper,</l>
               <l>Yet Mirth's at t'other down the Crupper;</l>
               <l>And to please either with a jirk,</l>
               <l>A dose of <hi>Rabelais</hi> does the work.</l>

               <l>And indeed rids Men of all Evil,</l>
               <l>If 'tis not one to go to th' Devil,</l>

               <l>Well may the Wretches be called Patients,</l>
               <l>Who must endure their Operations!</l>
               <l>But <hi>Rabelais,</hi> learn'd in Kitchin Physic,</l>

                  <p>MOST Noble and Illustrious Drinkers, and you thrice pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Pockified blades; (for to you, and none else do I dedicate my Writings) <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> in that Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of <hi>Plato</hi>'s, which is intituled, <hi>The Banquet,</hi> whilst he was se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ting forth the Praises of his Schoolmaster <hi>Socrates</hi> (without all question the Prince of Philosophers) amongst other Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses to that purpose said, that he resembled the <hi>Silenes. Silenes</hi> of old were little Boxes, like those we now may see in the Shops of Apothecaries,
<pb facs="tcp:46180:99"/>
painted on the outside with wanton toy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Figures, as <hi>Harpies, Satyrs, bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled Geese, horned Hares, sadled Ducks, flying Goats, Thiller Harts,</hi> and other such like counterfeited Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures at pleasure, to excite People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Laughter, as <hi>Silenus</hi> himself, who was the Foster-father of good <hi>Bacchus,</hi> was wont to do, but within those ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious Caskets were carefully preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and kept many rich and fine Drugs, such as <hi>Balm, Ambergreece, Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Musk, Civet,</hi> with several kinds of <hi>Precious Stones</hi> and other things of great price. Iust such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing was <hi>Socrates,</hi> for to have eyed his outside, and esteemed of him by his exterior appearance, you would not have given the peel of an Onion for him, so deformed he was in Body, and ridiculous in his Gesture: He had a sharp pointed Nose, with the look of a Bull, and Countenance of a Fool: He was in his Carriage simple, boarish in his Apparel, in Fortune poor, unhappy in his Wives, unfit for all Offices in the Commonwealth, always laughing, tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and merry carousing to every one,
<pb facs="tcp:46180:99"/>
with continual gibes and jeers, the better by those means to conceal his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Knowledge. Now opening this Box you would have found within it a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and inestimable Drug, a more then human Understanding, an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Vertue, matchless Learning, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Courage, unimitable Sobriety, certain Contentment of Mind, perfect Assurance and an incredible Misregard of all that for which Men commonly do so much watch, run, fail, fight, travel, toyl and turmoil themselves.</p>
                  <p>Whereunto (in your Opinion) doth this little flourish of a Preamble tend? For so much as you, my good Disciples, and some other jolly Fools of Ease and Leasure, reading the pleasant Titles of some Books of our Invention, as <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantua, Pantagruel, Whippot, the Dignity of Cod-peeces, Of Pease and Bacon, with a Commentary,</hi> &amp;c. are too ready to judge, that there is nothing in them but Iests, Mockeries, lascivious Discourse and recreative Lyes; because the outside (which is the Title) is usually (without any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enquiry) entertain'd with Scoffing
<pb facs="tcp:46180:100"/>
and Derision. But truly it is very unbeseeming to make so slight account of the works of Men, seeing your selves avouch that it is not the <hi>Habit</hi> makes the <hi>Monk;</hi> many being <hi>Monasterially</hi> accoutred, who inwardly are nothing less than <hi>Monachal;</hi> and that there are of those that wear <hi>Spanish</hi> Caps, who have but little of the Valour of <hi>Spaniards</hi> in them. Therefore is it, that you must open the Book, and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously consider of the matter treated in it, then shall you find that it contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Things of far higher value then the Box did promise; that is to say, that the Subject thereof is not so foolish, as by the Title at the first sight it would appear to be.</p>
                  <p>And put the case that in the literal Sense you meet with Matters that are light and ludicrous, and suitable enough to their Inscriptions; yet must not you stop there, as at the Melody of the charming <hi>Syrens;</hi> but endeavour to interpret that in a sublimer Sense, which possibly you might think was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the Iollity of Heart. Did you ever pick the Lock of a Cupboard to
<pb facs="tcp:46180:100"/>
steal a Bottle of Wine out of it? Tell me truly, and if you did call to mind the Countenance which then you had? Or did you ever see a Dog with a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-bone in his Mouth (the Beast of all other, says <hi>Plato, lib. 2. de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publica,</hi> the most Philosophical) if you have seen him, you might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked with what Caution and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspectness he wards and watcheth it; with what care he keeps it; how fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently he holds it; how prudently he gobbets it; with what affection he breaks it; and with what diligence he sucks it. To what end all this? What moveth him to take all these pains? What are the hopes of his Labour? What doth he expect to reap thereby? Nothing but a little Marrow. True it is, that this little is more savoury and delicious then the great quantities of other Sorts of Meat, because the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row (<hi>as</hi> Galen <hi>testifieth, 5. facult. nat. &amp; 11. de usu partium</hi>) is a nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment most perfectly elaboured by Nature.</p>
                  <p>In imitation of this Dog, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes you to be wise, to smell, feel and
<pb facs="tcp:46180:101"/>
have in estimation these fair goodly Books, stuffed with high Conceptions, that seem easie and superficial, but are not so readily fathom'd; and then like him you must, by a sedulous Lecture, and frequent Meditation, break the Bone, and suck out the substantial Marrow; that is, my allegorical Sense, or the things I to my self propose to be signified by these <hi>Pythagorical</hi> Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols; with assured hope, that in so doing, you will at last attain to be both very wise and very brave; for in the perusal of this Treatise, you shall find another kind of Taste, and a Dictrin of a more profound and abstruse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, which will disclose unto you the most glorious Doctrin, and dreadful <hi>Mysteries,</hi> as well in what concerneth your <hi>Religion,</hi> as Matters of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic State and <hi>Life oeconomical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Do you believe upon your Conscience, that <hi>Homer</hi> whilst he was a couching his <hi>Iliads</hi> and <hi>Odysses,</hi> had any thought upon those Allegories, which <hi>Plutarch, Heraclides, Ponticus, Fristatius, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutus</hi> squeezed out of him, and which <hi>Politian</hi> filched again from them. If
<pb facs="tcp:46180:101"/>
that is your Faith, you shall never be of my Church; who hold that those <hi>Mysteries</hi> were as little dream'd of by <hi>Homer,</hi> as the Gospel-Sacraments were by <hi>Ovid</hi> in his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphosis</hi>;<note place="margin">

high Matters and deep Sciences, as <hi>Homer</hi> knew very well, the Paragon of all Philologues, and <hi>Ennius,</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Latin Poets (as <hi>Horace</hi> calls him) although a certain sneaking Iobernol objected, that his Verses sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd more of the Wine than of the Oil.</p>

And I will glory as much when it is said of me, that I have spent more on Wine than Oil, as did <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> when it was told him, That his Expence on Oil was greater than on Wine.</p>
                  <p>I truly held it for an honour to be called and reputed a good Fellow, a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Companion, or <hi>Merry Andrew;</hi> for under this name am I welcom in all choice Companies of <hi>Pantagruelists.</hi> It was upbraided to <hi>Demosthenes</hi> by an envious surly Knave, that his Orations did <hi>smell like the Sarpler, or Clout

that had stopped a musty Oil Vessel.</hi> Therefore I pray interpret you all my Deeds and Sayings in the perfectest Sense; reverence the Cheese-like brain that feeds you with all these jolly Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots, and do what lies in you to keep me alwaies merry. Be frolic now my Lads, chear up your Hearts, and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully read the rest, with all the Ease of your Body and Comfort to your Reins.

                     <p>I Must refer you to the great Chronicle of <hi>Pantagruel</hi> for the knowledge of that <hi>Genealogy</hi> and Antiquity of Race by which <hi>Gargantua</hi> is descended unto us: In it you may understand more at large how the Giants were born in this World, and how from them by a direct Line issued <hi>Gargantua</hi> the Father of <hi>Pantagruel.</hi> And do not take it ill, if for this time I pass by it, although the Subject be such, that the oftner it were remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b'red, the more it would please your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships: According to the Authority of <hi>Plato</hi> in <hi>Philebo</hi> and <hi>Gorgias</hi>; and of <hi>Flaccus,</hi> who says, That there is some kind of Matters (such as these are without doubt) which the <hi>frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> they be <hi>repeated,</hi> still prove the more <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable.</hi>

                     <p>And to give you some hints concerning my self, who speak unto you; I cannot think but I am come of the Race of some rich King or Prince in former Times; for never yet saw you any Man that had a greater desire to be a <hi>King,</hi> and to be rich, than I have; and to the end only, that I may make <hi>good Chear, do nothing,</hi> nor <hi>care for any thing,</hi> and plentifully <hi>enrich</hi> my <hi>Friends,</hi> and all <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>learned</hi> Men: But herein do I comfort my self, that in the other World I shall be all this; yea, and greater too than at this present I dare wish: As for you, with the same or a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit enjoy your selves in your distresses; and drink fresh if you can come by it.</p>
                     <p>But returning to our Subject, I say, that by the especial care of Heaven, the Antiquity and Genealogy of a <hi>Gargantua</hi> hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for our use, more full and perfect than any other except that of the <hi>Messias,</hi> whereof I mean not to speak; for it belongs not unto my Province; and the <hi>Devils</hi> (that is to say)
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46180:104"/>
the <hi>false Accusers</hi> and <hi>Church-vermin</hi> will be upon my Jacket. This <hi>Genealogy</hi> was found by <hi>Iohn Andrew</hi> in a Meadow, which he had near the <hi>Pole-arch,</hi> under the Olive-tree, as you go to <hi>Marsay.</hi> Where, as they were casting up some Ditches, the diggers with their Mattocks struck against a great brazen Tomb, unmeasurably along, for they could never find the end thereof, by reason that it entred too far within the Sluces of <hi>Vienne.</hi> Opening this Tomb, in a certain place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, sealed on the top with the mark of a Gob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, about which was written in <hi>Hetrurian</hi> Letters <hi>HIC BIBITVR,</hi> they found nine Flaggons set in such order as they use to rank their <hi>Kyles</hi> in <hi>Gascony</hi>; of which that which was placed in the middle, had under it a big, greasie, great, grey, jolly, small, moudy little Pamphlet, smelling stronger, but no better then Roses.</p>
                     <p>In that Book the said <hi>Genealogy</hi> was found written all at length, in a Chancery hand, not in Paper, not in Parchment nor in wax, but in the Bark of an <hi>Elm-tree</hi>; yet so worn with the long tract of time, that hardly could three Letters together be there perfectly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
                     <p>I (though unworthy) was sent for thither, and with much help of those Spectacles, whereby the art of reading dim Writings, and Letters that do not clearly appear to the sight, is practised, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> teacheth it;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46180:105"/>
did translate the Book as you may see in your <hi>Pantagruelising,</hi> that is to say, in drinking stifly to your own hearts desire; and reading the dreadful and horrific Acts of <hi>Pantagruel.</hi> At the end of the Book there was a little Treatise entituled the <hi>Antidoted Conundrums.</hi> The Rats and Moths, or (that I may not lye) other wicked Vermin, had nimbed off the beginning, the rest I have hereto sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, for the Reverence I bear to <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. III. How <hi>Gargantua</hi> was carried eleven Months in his Mothers Belly.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>GRangousier</hi> was a Good Fellow in his time, and notable Jester; he loved to drink neat, as much as any man that then was in the world, and would willingly eat Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat: to this intent he was ordinarily well furnished with Gammons of Bacon, both of <hi>Westphalia, Mayence</hi> and <hi>Bayone</hi>; with store of dried Neats Tongues, plenty of Links, Chitterlings and Puddings in their Season; together with Salt Beef and Mustard, a good deal of <hi>Botargos,</hi> great provision of Sauciges, not of <hi>Bolonia</hi> (for he feared the <hi>Lombard Boc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cone</hi>) but of <hi>Bigorre, Longaulnay, Brene,</hi> and <hi>Rouargue.</hi> In the vigor of his age he marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Gargamelle,</hi> Daughter to the King of the <hi>Parpaillons,</hi> a Jolly Pug, and well mouthed Wench. These two did often times do the two backed Beast together, joyfully rubbing and frotting their Bacon 'gainst one another, insofar, that at last she became great with Child of a fair Son, and went with him unto the eleventh month, for so long, yea longer may a Woman carry her great Belly; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when it is some <hi>Master-piece</hi> of nature, and a person predestinated to the performance, in his due time, of great Exploits, as <hi>Homer</hi>
                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:46180:108"/>
says, that the Child which <hi>Neptune</hi> begot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Nymph,</hi> was born a whole year after the conception; that is, in the twelfth month; for as <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> saith, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. this long time was suitable to the majesty of <hi>Neptune</hi>; that in it the child might receive his form in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. For the like reason <hi>Iupiter</hi> made the Night, wherein he lay with <hi>Alcmena,</hi> last forty eight hours; a shorter time not being sufficient for the forging of <hi>Hercules,</hi> who was to rid the world of the <hi>Monsters,</hi> and the <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants. My Masters,</hi> the ancient <hi>Pantagruelists</hi> have confirmed that which I say, and withal declared it to be not only possible, but also maintained the Legitimacy of the Infant, born of a woman in the eleventh month after the decease of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.<note place="margin">

the decease of their husbands. I pray you, my good lusty springal lads, if you find any of these females, that are worth the pains of untying the Cod-piece-point, get up, and bring them to me; for if they happen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the third month to conceive, the child shall be heir to the deceased, <hi>and the mother shall pass for an honest woman.</hi>

                     <p>THE occasion and manner how <hi>Garga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melle</hi> was brought to bed, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of her child, was thus: and if you do not believe it, I wish your bum-gut fall out. Her bum-gut indeed, or fundament escaped her in an afternoon, on the third day of <hi>February,</hi> with having eaten at dinner to many <hi>Godebilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os, Godebillios</hi> are the fat tripes of <hi>coiros; coiros</hi> are Beeves fatned in the Ox-stalls, and <hi>Guimo meadows; Guimo meadows</hi> are those that may be moved twice a year; of those fat Beeves they had killed three hundred sixty seven thousand and fourteen, to be salted at Shrove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide; that in the entring of the Spring they might have plenty of powdred Beef, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to season their mouths at the beginning of their meals, and to taste their Wine the better.</p>
                     <p>They had abundance of Tripes as you have heard, and they were so delicious, that every one licked his fingers. But as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil wou'd have it, there was no possibility to keep them long sweet, and to let them stink was not so commendable or handsom, it was
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46180:109"/>
herefore concluded, that they should be all of them gulched up, without any waste. To this effect they invited all the Burghers of <hi>Sainais,</hi> of <hi>Suille,</hi> of the <hi>Roche Clermand,</hi> of <hi>Vaugaudry,</hi> without omitting the <hi>Boudray, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensier,</hi> the <hi>Guedevede,</hi> and other their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; all stiff drinkers, brave fellows, and good players at the kyles. The Goodman <hi>Grangousier</hi> took great pleasure in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and commanded there should be no want nor pinching for any thing: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he bade his wife eat sparingly, because she was near her time, and that these Tripes were no very commendable meat; they would fain (said he) be at the chewing of ordure, who eat the bag that contain'd it. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing these admonitions, she did eat sixteen quarters, two bushels, three pecks and a pip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin full. What a filthy deal of Lob lolly was here, to swell and wamble in her Guts?</p>
                     <p>After Dinner they all went tag-rag toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the willow-grove, where, on the green grass, to the sound of the merry Flutes, and pleasant Bag-pipes, they danced so gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly, that it was a sweet and heavenly sport to see them so frolic.</p>

                     <p>THEN did they fall upon the chat of Belly-timber and drinking; and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with began Flaggons to go, Gammons to trot, goblets to fly, great bowles to ting, Glasses to ring, draw, reach, fill, mix, give it me without water, so my friend, so, whip me off this Glass neatly, bring me hither some Claret, a full weeping Glass till it run over, a cessation and truce with thirst. Ha thou false Fever, wilt thou not be gone? By my <hi>Figgins,</hi> Godmother, I cannot as yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the humour of being merry, nor drink so currently as I would; you have catcht a cold, <hi>Gammer</hi>; yea forsooth, Sir; by the belly of Sanct <hi>Buff</hi> let us talk of our drink, I never drink but at my <hi>hours,</hi> like the Popes Mule; and I never drink but in my <hi>Breviary,</hi> like good father <hi>Gardien.</hi> Which was first, <hi>thirst</hi> or <hi>drinking?

Let us sing, let us drink, now for a Catch, dust it away, where is my Nogging? what, it seems I do not drink by Proxy. Do you wet your selves to dry, or do you dry to wet you?

                     <p>THE good Man <hi>Grangousier</hi> drinking and making merry with the rest, heard the horrible noise which his Son had made as he entered into the Light of this World, when he cried out, Some drink, some drink, some drink; whereupon he said in <hi>French, Que grand tuas &amp; souple le gousier,</hi> that is to say, <hi>How great and nimble a throat thou hast</hi>; which the Company hearing, said, that verily the Child ought to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Gargantua</hi>; because it was the first word that after his birth his Father had spoke in imitation, and at the Example of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Hebrews</hi>; whereunto he condescended, and his Mother was very well pleased there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; in the mean while, to quiet the Child, they gave him to drink a <hi>tirelarigot,</hi> that is, till his throat was like to crack with it; then was he carried to the Font, and there bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, according to the manner of good <hi>Christians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Immediately thereafter were appointed for him Seventeen thousand nine hundred and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46180:115"/>
thirteen Cows of the Towns of <hi>Pautille</hi> and <hi>Breemond</hi> to furnish him with milk in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; for it was impossible to find a Nurse sufficient for him in all the Country, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the great quantity of milk that was requisite for his nourishment: although there were not wanting some Doctors of the Opinion of <hi>Scotus</hi>; who affirmed that his own Mother gave him suck, and that she could draw out of her Breasts one Thousand four hundred two Pipes and nine Pails of milk at every time.</p>
                     <p>Which indeed is not probable, and this point hath been found <hi>duggishly</hi> scandalous and offensive to tender Ears, for that it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured a little of <hi>Heresie</hi>: Thus was he hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for one Year and ten Months, after which time, by the Advice of Physicians, they began to carry him Abroad, and then was made for him a fine little Cart drawn with Oxen, of the Invention of <hi>Ian Denio</hi>; wherein they led him hither and thither with great joy, and he was worth the seeing; for he was a fine Boy, had a burly Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ognomy, and almost ten Chins; he cried very little, but beshit himself every hour: For to speak truly of him, he was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully flegmatic in his Posteriors, both by reason of his natural Complexion, and the accidental disposition which had befallen him by his too much quaffing of the <hi>Septembral</hi>

Juice. Yet without a cause did not he sip one drop; for if he happened to be vexed, angry, displeased or sorry; if he did fret, if he did weep, if he did cry, and what grievous quarter soever he kept, bring him some drink, he would be instantly pacified, come to his own Temper, be in a good humour again, and as still and quiet as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. One of his Governesses told me (swearing by her Fig) how he was so accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to this kind of way, that, at the sound of Pints and Flaggons, he would on a sudden fall into an Ecstacy, as if he had then tasted of the Joys of Paradise; so that they upon consideration of this his divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, would every Morning to chear him up, play with a Knife upon the Glasses, on the Bottles with their stopples, and on the Pottle-pots with their lids and covers, at the sound whereof he became gay, did leap for joy, would loll and rock himself in the Cradle, then nod with his head, <hi>mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordising</hi> his Fingers, and <hi>barytonising</hi> with his Tail.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>BEing of this Age, his Father ordained to have Clothes made to him in his own Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, which was White and Blew. To work then went the Taylors, and with great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition were those Clothes made, cut and sewed, according to the Fashion that was then in vogue. I find by the ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, to be seen in the Chamber of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts at <hi>Montforeo,</hi> that he was accounted in manner as followeth. To make him every Shirt of his, were taken up Nine hundred Ells of <hi>Chetelero</hi> Linnen, and Two hundred for the Guissets, in manner of Cushions, which they put under his Arm-pits; his Shirt was not gathered nor plaited, for the plaiting of Shirts was not found out, till the Seamstresses (when the point of their Needles was broken) began to work and occupy with the tail. There were taken up for his Doublet, Eight hundred and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Ells of white Sattin, and for his Points Fifteen hundred and nine Dogs Skins and a half. Then was it that Men began to tie their Breeches to their Doublets, and not their Doublets to their Breeches; for it is against Nature, as hath most amply been
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:46180:116"/>
shewed by <hi>Ocham</hi> upon the <hi>Explonibles</hi> of Master <hi>Hautechaussade.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For his Breeches were taken up Eleven hundred and five Ells, and a third of white broad Cloath. They were cut in form of Pillars, chamfred, channel'd, and pinked behind, that they might not overheat his Reins: And were within the panes, puffed out with the lining of as much blew Damask as was needful; and remark, that he had very good Knee-rowlers, proportionable to the rest of his stature.</p>
                     <p>For his Cod-piece were used Sixteen Ells and a quarter of the same Cloath, and it was fashioned on the top like unto a trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Arch, most gallantly fastened with two enamell'd Clasps, in each of which was set a great Emerauld, as big as an Orange; for, as says <hi>Orpheus lib. de lapidibus,</hi> and <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius lib. ultimo,</hi> it hath an erective Vertue and comfortative of the natural Member.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:46180:117"/>
to a fair <hi>Cornucopia,</hi> or Horn of abundance, such as you see in Antics, or as <hi>Rhea</hi> gave to the two Nymphs, <hi>Amalthea</hi> and <hi>Ida,</hi> the Nurses of <hi>Iupiter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And like to that <hi>Horn of Abundance,</hi> it was still gallant, succulent, droppy, sappy, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, lively, always flourishing, always fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying, full of Juice, full of Flower, full of Fruit, and all manner of delight. Blessed Lady! 'Twould have done one good to have seen it: But I will tell you more of it in the Book which I have made of the <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Codpieces.</hi> One thing I will tell you, that as it was both long and large, so was it well furnished and provided within, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like unto the <hi>Hypocritical</hi> Codpieces, of some fond Wooers and Wench-courters, which are stuffed only with wind, to the great prejudice of the female Sex.</p>
                     <p>For his Shooes, were taken up four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and six Ells of blew Crimson-velvet, and were very neatly cut by parallel Lines, joyned in <hi>uniform Cylinders</hi>: For the soling of them were made use of Eleven hundred Hides of brown Cows, shapen like the tail of a Keeling.</p>
                     <p>For his Coat were taken up Eighteen hundred Ells of blew Velvet, died in grain, embroidered in its Borders with fair Gilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowers, in the middle decked with silver Purle, intermixed with plates of Gold, and store of Pearls, hereby shewing, that in his
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46180:117"/>
time he would prove an especial good Fellow, and singular Whip can.</p>
                     <p>His Girdle was made of Three hundred Ells and a half of silken Serge, half white and half blew, if I mistake it not. His Sword was not of <hi>Valentia,</hi> nor his Dagger of <hi>Saragosa,</hi> for his Father could not endure these <hi>Hidalgos borrachos maranisados como dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blos</hi>; but he had a fair Sword made of Wood, and the Dagger of boiled Leather, as well painted and gilded as any Man could wish.</p>
                     <p>His Purse was made of the Cod of an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, which was given him by <hi>Herre Praecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi> Proconsul of <hi>Lybia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For his Gown were employed Nine thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand six hundred Ells, wanting two thirds, of blew Velvet, as before, all so <hi>diagonally</hi> purled, that by true perspective issued thence an unnamed Colour, like that you see in the Necks of Turtle-doves or Turkey-cocks, which wonderfully rejoyceth the Eyes of the Beholders. For his Bonnet or Cap were taken up Three hundred two Ells, and a Quarter of white Velvet, and the form thereof was wide and round, of the bigness of his Head; for his Father said, that the Caps of the <hi>Mirabaise</hi> fashion, made like the Cover of a Pasty, would one time or other bring a mischief on those that wore them. For his Plume, he wore a fair great blew Feather, plucked from an <hi>Onocrotal</hi> of the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:46180:118"/>
Country of <hi>Hircania</hi> the wild, very prettily hanging down over his right Ear: For the Jewel or broach which in his Cap he carried, he had in a Cake of Gold, weighing three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score and eight Marks, a fair piece of Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell'd, wherein was portrayed a Man's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with two Heads, looking towards one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, four Arms, four Feet, two Arses, such as <hi>Plato in Symposio</hi> says, was the mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal beginning of Man's Nature; and about it was written in Ionic Letters, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p>To wear about his Neck, he had a golden Chain, weighing Twenty five thousand and sixty three Marks of Gold, the link thereof being made after the manner of great Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, amongst which were set in work green Jaspers ingraven, and cut Dragon like, all invironed with Beams and Sparks, as King <hi>Nicepsos</hi> of old was wont to wear them, and it reached down to the very bust of the rising of his Belly, whereby he reaped great benefit all his life long, as the <hi>Greek</hi> Physicians knew well enough. For his Gloves were put in work sixteen Otters Skins, and three of <hi>Laugarous</hi> or Men-eating Wolves, for the bordering of them: And of this stuff were they made, by the appointment of the Cabalists of <hi>Sanlono.</hi> As for the Rings which his Father would have him to wear to renew the ancient mark of Nobility: He had on the fore-finger of his left hand a Carbuncle
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:46180:118"/>
as big as an Ostrige's Egg, inchased very daintily in Gold of the fineness of a <hi>Turkie Seraph.</hi> Upon the middle finger of the same hand, he had a Ring made of four Metals together, of the strongest fashion that ever was seen; so that the steel did not crash a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Gold, nor the Silver crush the Copper. All this was made by Captain <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pins,</hi> and <hi>Alcofribas</hi> his Operator. On the <hi>Medical</hi> Finger of his Right-hand, he had a Ring made Spire-ways, wherein was set a perfect baleu Ruby, a pointed Diamond, and a Poison Emerauld of an inestimable Value; for <hi>Hans-carvel</hi> the King of <hi>Milinda</hi>'s Jeweller, esteemed them at the rate of Threescore nine Millions eight hundred ninety four thousand and eighteen <hi>French</hi> Crowns of <hi>Berrie,</hi> and at so much did the <hi>Iews</hi> of <hi>Auspurg</hi> prize them.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, That supposing two things, contrary in their kind, as Good and Evil, Vertue and Vice, Heat and Cold, White and Black, Pleasure and Pain, Joy and Grief: And so of others, if you couple them in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the contrary of one kind may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in reason with the contrary of the other; it must follow by consequence, that the other contrary must answer to the remanent opposite to that wherewith it is conferred; as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, Vertue and Vice are contrary in one kind, so are Good and Evil; if one of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:46180:121"/>
of the first kind, be consonant to one of those of the second, as Vertue and Goodness, for it is clear that Vertue is good, so shall the other two contraries (which are Evil and Vice) have the same connexion, for Vice is evil.</p>
                     <p>This Logical Rule being understood, take these two contraries, Joy and Sadness; then these other two, White and Black, for they are Physically contrary: If so be then that Black do signifie Grief, by good reason then should White import Joy. Nor is this signification in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted by human Imposition, but by the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal consent of the World received, which Philosophers call <hi>Ius Gentium,</hi> the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or an uncontroulable right, of force in all Countreys whatsoever; for you know well enough, that all People and all Languages and Nations (except the ancient <hi>Syracusans,</hi> and certain <hi>Argives,</hi> who had cross and thwarting Souls) when they mean outwardly to give e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of their sorrow, go in Black; and all mourning is done with Black, which general consent is not without some Argument and Reason in Nature, the which every Man may by himself very suddenly comprehend, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Instruction of any; and this we call the Law of Nature; By vertue of the same natural Instinct, we know that by White all the World hath understood Joy, Gladness, Mirth, Pleasure and Delight.</p>

                        <pb n="37" facs="tcp:46180:121"/>In former times, the <hi>Thracians</hi> and <hi>Grecians</hi> did mark their good, propitious and fortunate days with white stones; and their sad, dismal and unfortunate ones with black; is not the night mournful, sad and melancholic? it is black and dark by the privation of light; doth not the light comfort all the World? and it is more white than any thing else, which to prove, I could direct you to the book of <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentius Valla</hi> against <hi>Bartolus,</hi> but an Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Testimony I hope will content you, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. it is said, that at the transfiguration of our Lord, <hi>Vestimenta ejus facta sunt alba sicut lux,</hi> his apparel was made white like the light; by which lightsom whiteness he gave his three A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles to understand the <hi>Idea</hi> and figure of the eternal Joys<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for by the light are all Men comforted, according to the Word of the old Woman, who although she had never a tooth in her head, was wont to say, <hi>Bona lux</hi>: and <hi>Tobit, chap.</hi> 5. after he had lost his sight, when <hi>Raphael</hi> saluted him, answered, <hi>What Ioy can I have, that do not see the Light of Heaven</hi>? In that colour did the Angels testifie the Joy of the whole World, at the Resurrection of our Saviour, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. and at his Ascension, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. with the like colour of Vesture did St. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Evangelist, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 4.7. see the faithful Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in the Heavenly and Blessed <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi>

                     <p>Read the Ancient both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Histories, and you shall find that the Town of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:46180:122"/>
                        <hi>Alba</hi> (the first Patron of <hi>Rome</hi>) was founded, and so Named by Reason of a <hi>White Sow,</hi> that was seen there. You shall likewise find in those stories, that when any Man, after he had Vanquished his Enemies, was by decree of the Senate, to enter into <hi>Rome,</hi> triumphantly, he usually rode in a Chariot, drawn by <hi>White-Horses:</hi> Which in the Ovation, Triumph, was also the custom; for by no sign or colour would they so significantly express the Joy of their coming, as by the White: You shall there also find, how <hi>Paricles,</hi> the Generals of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> would needs have that part of his Army, unto whose Lot befel the <hi>White Beans,</hi> to spend the whole Day in Mirth, Pleasure and Ease, whilst the rest were a Fighting. A thousand other Examples and Places could I alledge to this Purpose, but that it is not here, where, I should do it.</p>
                     <p>By understanding hereof, you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve one Problem, which <hi>Alexander Aphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diseus</hi> hath accounted unanswerable, why the Lion who with his only Cry and Roaring, affrights all Beasts, dreads and feareth only a <hi>White Cock</hi>? for (as <hi>Proclus</hi> saith, <hi>libro de Sacrificio &amp; Magia,</hi>) it is because the Presence, of the Vertue, of the Sun; which is the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan and Promptuarie, of all terrestrial and <hi>Syderial</hi> light doth more Symbolize, and agree with a <hi>White Cock,</hi> as well in regard of that colour, as of his Property and Specifical qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, then with a Lion. He saith further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:46180:122"/>
that Devils have been often seen in the shape of Lions, which at the sight of a <hi>White</hi> Cock have presently vanished. This is the cause why the <hi>Gauli, Gauls</hi> or <hi>Galathians</hi> (so are the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> called, because they are naturally <hi>white</hi> as <hi>Milk,</hi> which the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <hi>Gala</hi>) do willingly wear in their Caps <hi>white</hi> Feathers; for by Nature they are of a candid disposition, merry, kind, gracious and well-beloved, and for their <hi>Cognizance</hi> and Arms have the whitest Flower of any, the <hi>Flower de Luce</hi> or <hi>Lilie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If you demand, how by White, Nature would have us understand Joy and Gladness? I answer, that the Analogy and Uniformity is thus, for as the White doth outwardly disperse and scatter the rays of the Sight, whereby the <hi>Optic</hi> Spirits are manifestly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, according to the Opinion of <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his Problems and perspective Treatises; as you may likewise perceive by Experience, when you pass over Mountains covered with Snow, how you will complain that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see well! as <hi>Xenophon</hi> writes to have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to his Men, and as <hi>Galen</hi> very largely declareth, <hi>lib.</hi> 10. <hi>de usu partium</hi>: Just so the Heart with excessive Joy is inwardly dilated, and suffereth a manifest dissolution of the vital Spirits; which may go so far on, that it may thereby be deprived of its Nourishment, and by consequence of Life it self. By this <hi>Pericharie</hi> or extremity of Gladness, as <hi>Galen</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>GArgantua,</hi> from three Years upwards unto five, was brought up and Instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in all Convenient Discipline, by the Commandment of his Father; and spent that time like the other little Child<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>en of the Countrey; that is, <hi>in Drinking, Eating and Sleeping, in Eating, Sleeping and Drinking, and in Sleeping, Drinking and Eating:</hi> Still he wallowed and rowled up and down him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the mire, and dirt; he blurred and sullied his nose with Filth, he blotted and smutch't his Face with any kind of nasty stuffe, he trode down his Shooes in the Heel, lay with his Mouth open to Catch Gnats, and ran a hawking after the Butterflies; the Empire whereof belonged to his Father. He pissed in his Shoes, shit in his Shirt, and wiped his nose on his sleeve: He did let his Snot and Snivel fall in his Pottage, and dabled, padled and slabbered every where. He would drink in his Slipper, and ordinarily rub his Belly against a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier: He wou'd pick his Teeth, with a wooden Shoe; wipe his breech with his Finger, washed his Hands in his Broth, and combed his Head with a broken Ladle.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:46180:124"/>
He would sit down betwixt two stools and his Arse to the ground; would cover himself with a wet sack, drink in his Potage, gnaw the bone he cou'd not swallow, eat his Cake without bread, bite laughing, and laugh biteing, spit in the dish, fart in his fist, piss against the wind; and hide himself in the Water for fear of Rain: He would strike before the Iron was hot, would blow in the dust till it fill'd his Eyes: Be often in the dumps, and frig and wriggle it. He would flay the Fox, say the Apes <hi>Paternoster,</hi> would Run at Mutton, and turn the Hogs to the Hay. He would beat the Dogs before the Lion; put the Plough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Oxen; and claw where it did not itch. He would leap before he looked, <hi>at Midsummer-Moon,</hi> spend his <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Rent: And take misreckoning for good payment. By griping, all would hold fast nothing, and always eat his white bread first. He shoo'd the Geese, tickled himself to make himself laugh, was Cook-Ruffing in the Kitching, would sing <hi>Magnificat</hi> at <hi>Matines,</hi> and found it was an Enemy of God, would turn to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. He would eat Cabbage, and shite Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-flowers; catch Fish in a Dish of Milk, and make them all Cripples: He would tear the Paper: Race the Records, then trust his heels for his security: He would pull at the Kids-leather, or vomit up his Dinner, then reckon without his Host: He would beat the Bushes
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:46180:124"/>
without catching the Birds, thought the Moon was made of green Cheese, and that every thing was Gold that glisters. He would soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er go to the Mill than to Mass; took a Bit in the Morning to be better than nothing all day; would eat his Cake and have his Cake; and was better fed than taught; he always look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a given Horse in the Mouth; would tell a Tale of a Tub; throw the Helm after the Hatchet; when the Steed was stoln, would shut the Stable-door, and bring his Hogs to a Fair Market: By robbing <hi>Peter</hi> he payed <hi>Paul,</hi> he kept the Moon from Wolves, and was ready to catch Larks, if ever the Heavens should fall: He did make of Necessity Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, of such Bread such Pottage, and cared as little for the peeled as for the shaven: Every Morning he did cast up his gorge, his Fathers little Dogs eat out of the Dish with him, and he with them: He would bite their Ears, and they would scratch his Nose: He would blow in their Arses, and they would lick his chaps.</p>
                     <p>But hearken good Fellows, may ye be sick of the Mulligrubs, with eating chopt Hay, if now ye do not listen: This little Lecher was always groping his Nurses and Governesses, upside down, arswise, topsiturvy, <hi>harribourr quet,</hi> with a <hi>Yacco haic, hyck-gio,</hi> hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them very rudely in jumbling and tumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them to keep them going; for he had already begun to exercise the Tools, and put
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:46180:125"/>
the Codpiece in practice; which Codpiece his Governesses did every day deck up and adorn with fair Nosegays, curious Ribbans, sweet Flowers, and fine silken Tufts, and very pleasantly would pass their time, in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, you know what, between their Fingers, and dandling it like a little Baby; then did they burst out in laughing, when they saw it lift up its ears, as if the sport had liked them. One of them would call it her Pilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock, her Fiddle-diddle, her Staff of Love, her Tickle-gizzard, her Gentle-tilter. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, her Sugar-plum, her Kingo, her old Rowley, her Touch-tripe, her Flap-dowdle. Another again, her Branch of Coral, her Placket-racket, her Cyprian Scepter, her Tit bit, her Bob Lady. And some of the other Women would give these Names, My Roger, my Cockatoo, my Nimble-wimble, Bush-beater, Claw-buttock, Eves-dropper, Pick-lock, Pioneer, Bully-ruffin, Smell-smock, Trouble-gusset, my lusty Live Saucage, my Crimson Chitterlin, Rump-splitter, Shove-devel, downright to't, stiff and stout, in and to, at-her-agen, my Cony-borow-ferret, Wily-beguiley, my pretty Rogue; It belongs to me, said one: It is mine, said the other: What, quoth a third, shall I have no share in it? by my faith I will cut it off then, Ha, to cut it off, (said the other,) would be a scurvy business: Madam, is it your way to cut off little Childrens things; were his cut off, he

would be then Master bob, that he might play and sport himself, after the manner of the other little Children of the Country, they made him a goodly whirle-gig of the wings of the windmil of <hi>Myrebalais.</hi>

                     <p>AFterwards, that he might be all his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time a good Rider, they made for him a fair great Horse of wood, which he did make leap, curvet, yerk out behind, and skip forwards, all at a time, to pace, trot, rack, gallop, amble, to play the hobbie, the hackney-guelding, go the gate of the Camel, and of the wild Asss: He made him also change his colour of Hair, as the Monks of <hi>Coultibo</hi> (according to the variety of their holy-days) use to do their Clothes, from Bay, Brown, to Sorrel, Daple-gray, Mouse-dun, Deer-colour, Roan, cow-colour, gingioline, skued-colour, pybal'd, and the colour of the savage Elk.</p>
                     <p>Himself of an huge big post, made a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Nag; and another for daily service, of the beam of a Vine-press; and of a great Oak, made up a Mule, with housson for his Chamber. Besides this, he had ten or twelve spare
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:46180:126"/>
Horses and seven Horses for post; and all these were lodged in his own Chamber, close by his bed-side. One day the Lord of <hi>Breadinbag,</hi> came to visit <hi>Gargantua's</hi> Father; in great bravery, and with a gallant train; and at the same time, to see him, came likewise the Duke of <hi>Frie meale,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gullet.</hi> The House, truly for so many guests at once was somewhat narrow, but especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Stables. Whereupon the Stewards and Gentlemen of Horse to the Lord <hi>Breadinbag</hi> (to know if there were any other empty stables in the house;) came to <hi>Gargantua,</hi> a little young lad, and secretly asked him where the Stables of the great Horses were, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Children would be ready to tell all. And then he led them up along the stairs of the Castle, passing by the second Hall unto a broad great Gallery, by which they entered into a large Tower, and as they were going up at another pair of stairs, said the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Horse to the Steward, this Child de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives us, for the Stables are never on the top of the House. You may be mistaken (said the Steward,) for I know some places at <hi>Lyons,</hi> at the <hi>Basmette,</hi> at <hi>Chaunon,</hi> and elsewhere, which have their Stables at the very tops of the Houses; so it may be, that behind the Houses there is a way to come to this ascent; but I will question him further: Then said he to <hi>Gargantua,</hi> my pretty little boy, whither do you lead us? to the stable (said he) of my great Horss,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:46180:126"/>
we are almost come to it, we have but these stairs to go up at; then leading them along another great Hall, he brought them into his chamber, and opening the door said unto them, this is the stable that you ask for, this is my gennet, this is my gelding, this is my courser, and this my pad; and laid on them with a great Cudgel, I will bestow upon you (said he) this <hi>Frizeland</hi> horse: I had him from <hi>Francfort,</hi> yet will I give him you; for he is a pretty little Nag, and will go very well, with a Cast of Gosehawk, half a dozen Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels, and a Brace of Grey-hounds; thus are you King of the Hares and Patridges for all this Winter. By St. <hi>Iohn</hi> (said they) what a couple of Puts has he made us? what Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keys? Hold, hold, Gentlemen, said he, you must show your Tails 'ere ye pass for Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keys. Judge you now, whether they had most cause, either to hide their heads for shame, or to laugh for company; as they were going down again thus amazed, he asked them, Will you have a <hi>whimwham</hi>? What is that, said they? It is (said he) five turds to make you a muzzel: To day (said the Steward) though we happen to be rosted, we shall not be burnt, for we are pretty well basted and larded in my opinion. O my jolly daper boy, thou hast given us a Gudgeon, I hope to see thee <hi>Pope</hi> before I die: I think so (said he) my self; and then shall you be a <hi>Puppy,</hi> and this gentle <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinjeay pop</hi> into some Office under me. Well,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:46180:127"/>
well (said the Gentleman of the Horse.) But (said <hi>Gargantua</hi>) guess how many stitches there are in my Mothers Smock: Sixteen (quoth the Gentleman) You do not speak Gospel (said <hi>Gargantua</hi>) for there is <hi>sent</hi> before, and <hi>sent</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and you did reckon them ill, considering the <hi>two under holes:</hi> When (said the Gentleman) Even then (said <hi>Gargantua</hi>) when they made a shovel of your Nose to take up a quarter of dirt, and of your Throat a Funnel, wherewith to put it into another Vessel, because the bottom of the old one was out. <hi>Cocksbod</hi> (said the ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) we have met with a Prater. Farewel (Master tatler) God keep you from harm, now your mouth is so mellow.</p>
                     <p>Thus going down in great haste, under the Arch of the Stairs, they let fall the great Leaver, vvhich he had put upon their backs; vvhereupon <hi>Gargantua</hi> said, vvhat a Divel, you are (it seems) but bad horsemen, that suffer your bilder to fail you, vvhen you need him most. If you vvere to go from hence to <hi>Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sas,</hi> vvhether had you rather ride on a Goose, or lead a Sow in a Leash?

                     <p>ABout the end of the Fifth Year, <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gousier</hi> returning from the Conquest of the <hi>Canarians,</hi> went by the way to see his Son <hi>Gargantua</hi>; there was he filled with Joy, as such a Father might be at the sight of such a Child of his. And whilst he kist him and embrac'd him, he asked many childish Questions of him about divers mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and drank very freely with him and with his Governesses, of whom in great ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, he asked among other things, whether they had been careful to keep him clean and sweet? To this <hi>Gargantua</hi> answered, that he had taken such a course for that himself, that in all the Country there was not to be found a cleanlier Boy then he. How is that (said <hi>Grangousier</hi>) I have (answer'd <hi>Gargantua</hi>) by a long and curious Experience found out a means to wipe my Bum, the most Lordly, the most Excellent, and the most Convenient that ever was seen: What is it? (said <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gousier</hi>) how is it? I will tell you by and by (said <hi>Gargantua</hi>) once I did wipe me with a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:46180:128"/>
Gentlewomans Velvet Mask, and found it to be good; for the softness of the Silk was very voluptuous and pleasant to my Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Another time with one of their Hoods, and in like manner that was comfortable: At another time with a Ladies Neck-kerchief, and after that I wiped me with some ear-pieces of hers made of crimson Sattin, but there was such a number of golden Spangles in them (turdy round things, a Pox take them) that they fetched away all the Skin off my Tail with a vengeance. Now I wish St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>'s Fire burn the Bumgut of the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smith that made them, and of her that wore them. This hurt I cured by wiping my self with a Pages Cap, garnished with a Feather after the <hi>Switzers</hi> fashion.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards, in dunging behind a bush, I found a March-Cat, and with it wiped my Breech, but her Claws were so sharp that they scratched and exulcerated all my <hi>Perinee</hi>; of this I recovered the next Morning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, by wiping my self with my Mother's Gloves, of a most excellent Perfume and Scent of the <hi>Arabian Benin.</hi> After that I wiped me with Sage, with Fennil, with Anet, with Marjoram, with Roses, with Gourd-Leaves, with Beets, with Colewort, with Leaves of the Vine-tree, with Mallows, Wool-blade (which is a Tail-scarlet) with Lettice and with Spinage Leaves. All this did very great good to my Leg. Then
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:46180:128"/>
with Mercury, with Pursly, with Nettles, with Comfrey; but that gave me the Bloody Flux of <hi>Lumbardy,</hi> which I healed by wiping me with my <hi>Braguette.</hi> Then I wiped my Tail in the Sheets, in the Coverlet, in the Curtains, with a Cushion, with Arras Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, with a green Carpet, with a Table-cloath, with a Napkin, with a Handkerchief, with a Combing-cloath, in all which I found more Pleasure than do the Mangy Dogs when you rub them. Yea, but (said <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gousier</hi>) which <hi>Torchecul</hi> didst thou find to be the best? I was coming to it (said <hi>Gargantua</hi>) and by and by shall you hear the <hi>tu autem,</hi> and know the whole Mystery and Knot of the Matter. I wiped my self with Hay, with Straw, with Thatch-rushes, with Flax, with Wooll, with Paper; but,

                     <p>Let us return to our Business, said <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gousier</hi>: What (said <hi>Gargantua</hi>) to skite? No (said <hi>Grangousier</hi>) but to wipe our Tail: But (said <hi>Gargantua</hi>) will not you be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to pay a Punchion of <hi>Britton</hi>-Wine, if I do not blank and gravel you in this matter, and put you to a <hi>non-plus</hi>? Yes truely, said <hi>Grangousier.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is no need of wiping ones Tail (said <hi>Gargantua</hi>) but when it is foul; foul it cannot be unless one have been a skiting; skite then we must before we wipe our Tails. O my pretty little waggish Boy (said <hi>Grangousier</hi>) what an excellent Wit thou hast? I will make thee very shortly proceed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor in the <hi>Belles Lettres,</hi> and by G—, for thou hast more Wit than Age.</p>
                     <p>Now, I prethee, go on in this Bumfodder Discourse; and, by my Beard, I swear, for one Puncheon thou shall have threescore Pipes,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:46180:130"/>
I mean of the good <hi>Breton</hi> Wine, not that which grows in <hi>Britain,</hi> but in the good Country of <hi>Verron.</hi> Afterwards I wiped my Bum (said <hi>Gargantua</hi>) with a <hi>Kerchief,</hi> with a <hi>Pillow,</hi> with a <hi>Pantoufle,</hi> with a <hi>Pouch,</hi> with a <hi>Panier,</hi> but that was a wicked and unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant wipe-Breech; then with a Hat; of Hats, note that some are shorn, and others shaggy, some velveted, others cover'd with taffities and others with sattin, the best of all these is the shaggy Hat, for it makes a very neat abstersion of the <hi>fecal</hi> matter.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards I wiped my Tail with a Hen, with a Cock, with a Pullet, with a Calves Skin, with a Hare, with a Pigeon, with a Cormorant, with an Attorney's Bag, with a Montero, with a Coif, with a Faulconer's Lure; but to conclude, I say and maintain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that of all Torcheculs, Arsewisps, Bumfodders, Tail-napkins, Bunghole-cleansers and wipe-breeches, there is none in the World com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to the <hi>Neck of a Goose,</hi> that is well douned, if you hold her head betwixt your Legs: And believe me therein <hi>upon mine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>; for you will thereby feel in your Nockhole a most wonderful pleasure, both in regard of the softness of the said Doun, and of the temperate heat of the Goose; which is easily communicated to the Bumgut, and the rest of the Intestines, insofar as to come even to the Regions of the Heart and Brains.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XIV. How <hi>Gargantua</hi> was taught <hi>Latin</hi> by a Sophister.</head>
                     <p>THE good Man <hi>Grangousier,</hi> having heard this discourse, was ravish'd with Admiration, considering the high reach, and marvellous understanding of his Son <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantua,</hi> and said to his Governesses. <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon</hi> knew the great Wit of his Son <hi>Alexander,</hi> by his skilful managing of a Horse; for his Horse <hi>Bucephalus</hi> was so fierce and unruly, that none durst adventure to ride him; after that he had given to his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders such devillish falls, breaking the Neck of this Man, the other Man's Leg, braining one, and cracking another's Jaw-bone. This by <hi>Alexander</hi> being considered, one day in the <hi>Hippodrome</hi> (which was a place appointed for
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:46180:131"/>
the breaking and managing of great Horses) he perceived that the fury of the Horse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded meerly from the fear he had of his own shadow; whereupon getting on his back, he run him against the Sun, so that the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow fell behind, and by that means tamed the Horse, and brought him to his hand. Whereby his Father perceiving his marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Capacity and <hi>divine</hi> Insight, caused him most carefully to be instructed by <hi>Aristotle</hi>; who at that time was highly renowned above all the Philosophers of <hi>Greece.</hi> After the same manner, I tell you, that by this only dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, which now I have here had before you with my Son <hi>Gargantua</hi>; I know that his Understanding doth participate of some <hi>Divinity</hi>; and that if he be well taught, and have that Education which is fitting, he will attain to a supream degree of Wisdom. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will I commit him to some learned Man, to have him indoctrinated according to his Capacity, and will spare no cost.</p>
                     <p>Presently they appointed him a great So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phister-Doctor, called Master <hi>Tubal Holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phernes,</hi> who taught him his ABC, so well, that he could say it by heart backwards; and about this he was Five Years and three Months.</p>
                     <p>Then read he to him, <hi>Donat, facet, theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolet,</hi> and <hi>Alanus in parabolis:</hi> About this he was Thirteen Years six Months and two Weeks. But you must remark, that in the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:46180:131"/>
mean time he did learn to write in <hi>Gottish</hi> Characters, and that he wrote all his Books; for the Art of Printing was not then in use.</p>
                     <p>And did ordinarily carry a great Pen and Inkhorn, weighing above Seven thousand Quintals, the Pen-case vvhereof vvas as big and as long as the great Pillar of <hi>Enay</hi>; and the Horn vvas hanged to it in great Iron Chains, it being of the vvideness to hold a Tun of Merchand Ware.</p>
                     <p>After that vvas read unto him the Book <hi>de modis significandi,</hi> with the Commentaries of <hi>Hurtbise,</hi> of <hi>Fasquin,</hi> of <hi>Tropifeu,</hi> of <hi>Gaulhaut,</hi> of <hi>Iohn Calf,</hi> of <hi>Billonio,</hi> of <hi>Berlinguandus,</hi> and a rabble of others; and herein he spent more then Eighteen Years and eleven Months, and was so well versed therein, that to try Masteries in School-disputes with his Condis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, he would recite it by heart backwards: And did sometimes prove on his Fingers ends to his Mother, <hi>Quod de modis significandi non erat scientia.</hi> Then was read to him the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>post,</hi> on which he spent Sixteen Years and two Months. And at that very time, which was in the Year 1420, his said <hi>Praeceptor</hi> died of the Pox.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards he got an old coughing Fellow to teach him, named Master <hi>Iobelin Bridé,</hi> vvho read unto him <hi>Hugotio, Flebard, Grecism,</hi> the <hi>Doctrinal,</hi> the <hi>Pars,</hi> the <hi>Quid est,</hi> the <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementum, Marmoretus de moribus in mensa ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vandis, Seneca de quatuor virtutibus cardinalibus,

                     <p>AT the last his Father perceived, that indeed he studied hard, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he spent all his time therein, yet for all that did he profit nothing; but vvhich is worse, grew thereby a Fool, a Sot, a Doult and Block-head; whereof making a heavy complaint to <hi>Don Philip</hi> of <hi>Marays,</hi> Viceroy of <hi>Papeligosse,</hi> he found that it were better for his Son to learn nothing at all, then to be taught such like Books, under such School-masters, because their Knowledge was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but all Trifle, and their Wisdom Fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, serving only to basterdize good and noble Spirits, and to corrupt the Flower of Youth. That it is so, take (said he) any Young Boy of this time, who hath only stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died two Years; if he have not a better Judgment, a better Discourse, and that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in better Terms then your Son, with a compleater Carriage and Civility to all

manner of persons, account me for ever hereafter a very clounch, and baconslicer of <hi>Brene.</hi> This pleased <hi>Grangousier</hi> very well and he commanded that it should be done.</p>
                     <p>At night at supper, the said <hi>Don Philip</hi> brought in a young Page of his, of <hi>Ville-gouges,</hi> called <hi>Eudemon,</hi> so neat, so trim, so handsom in his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, so spruce, with his Hair in so good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and so sweet and comely in his behaviour, that he had the resemblance of a little Angel more than of a human Creature. Then he said to <hi>Grangousier,</hi> Do you see this young Boy? He is not as yet full twelve years old; let us try (if it like you) what difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the knowledge of the Dunces <hi>Mateologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> of old time, and the young Lads that are now. The Tryal pleased <hi>Grangousier,</hi> and he commanded the Page to begin. Then <hi>Eude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> asking leave of the Vice-Roy his Master, so to do, vvith his Cap in his hand, a clear and open countenance, beautiful and ruddy Lips, his Eyes steady, and his Looks fixed upon <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantua,</hi> with a youthful modesty; standing up strait on his feet, began to commend him; first for his Vertue and good Manners; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly for his knowledg; thirdly, for his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; fourthly, for his bodily accomplishments; and in the fifth place, most sweetly exhorted him to reverence his Father with all due ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servancy, vvho was so careful to have him well brought up; in the end he prayed him, that he vvould vouchsafe to admit of him amongst
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:46180:133"/>
the least of his Servants; for other Favour at that time desired he none of Heaven, but that he might do him some grateful and acceptable Service; all this was by him delivered vvith such proper gestures, such distinct Pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so pleasant a Delivery, in such exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site fine Terms, and so good <hi>Latin,</hi> that he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med rather a <hi>Gracchus,</hi> a <hi>Cicero,</hi> an <hi>Aemilius</hi> of the time past, then a youth of this Age. But all the countenance that <hi>Gargantua</hi> kept was, that he fell to crying like a Cow, and cast down his Face, hiding it with his Cap, nor could they possibly draw one word from him, no more than a Fart from a dead Ass.</p>
                     <p>Whereat his Father vvas so grievously ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed, that he vvould have killed Master <hi>Iobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> but the said <hi>Don Philip</hi> vvith-held him from it by fair persuasions, so that at length he pacifyed his Wrath. Then <hi>Grangousier</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded he should be payed his Wages, that they should wittle him up soundly, Sophister-like, and then give him to all the Devils in Hell: At least (said he) to day, shall it not cost him much to his Host, if by chance he should dye as drunk as an <hi>Englishman.</hi> Master <hi>Iobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> being gone out of the house, <hi>Grangousier</hi> consulted vvith the <hi>Viceroy</hi> vvhat Schoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

She was as big as six Elephants, and had her feet cloven, into toes, like <hi>Iulius Caesars</hi> horse, with slouch-hanging ears, like the goats in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and a little horn on her buttock, she was of a burnt sorel hue, with a little mixture of daple gray spots, but above all she had a horrible tail; for it was little more or less, then every whit, as great as the Steeple of St. <hi>Mark</hi> besides <hi>Langes</hi>; and squared as that is, with tuffs and hair plaits, wrought within one another, no otherwise then as the beards are upon the ears of corn.</p>

                     <p>SOme few days after that they had refresht themselves, he went to see the City, and was beheld of every Body there with great Admiration. For the People of <hi>Paris</hi> are such Fools, such Puppies and Naturals, that a Jugler, a Carrier of Indulgences, a Sumpter-horse, a Mule with his Bells, a <hi>Blind Fidler</hi> in the middle of a cross Lane, shall draw a greater confluence of People to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, than an <hi>Evangelical Preacher.</hi> And they prest so hard upon him, that he vvas constrained to rest himself upon the Steeple of our <hi>Lady</hi>'s Church; at which place, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so many about him, he said with a loud Voice, <hi>I believe that these Buzzards will have me to pay them here my</hi> Welcom <hi>hither, and my</hi> Beverage: <hi>It is but good reason, I will now give them their Wine, but it shall be only a</hi> Par ris, that is, <hi>in Sport.</hi> Then smiling, he untied his goodly Codpiece, and lugging out his Roger into the open Air, he so bitterly all to bepist them, that he drowned Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and sixty thousand, four hundred and

                     <p>Some nevertheless of the Company esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped this Piss-flood by meer speed of Foot, who when they were at the higher end of the University, sweating, coughing, spitting and out of breath, they began to swear and curse, some in good hot earnest, and others <hi>Par ris, Carimari, Carimara; Golynoly, Golynolo</hi>; Ods-Bodikins, we are washed <hi>Par ris,</hi> from whence that City hath been ever since called <hi>Paris</hi>; whose name formerly was <hi>Leucotia</hi> (as <hi>Strabo</hi> testifieth, <hi>lib. quarto</hi>) which in <hi>Greek</hi> is <hi>Whiteness,</hi> because of the white Thighs of the Ladies of that place. And forasmuch as at this imposition of a new name, all the People that were there, swore every one by the Sancts of his Parish, the <hi>Parisians,</hi> which are patch'd up of all Nations, and all manner of Men, are by Nature good at <hi>Swearing,</hi> and not a little domineering; whereupon <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anninus de Barrauco libro de copiositate reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>This done, he considered the great Bells, which were in the said Steeple, and made them ring very harmoniously; which whilst he was doing, it came into his Mind, that they would serve very well for <hi>tingling Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> to hang about his Mares Neck, when she should be sent back to his Father (as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended)
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:46180:136"/>
loaded with <hi>Brie</hi> Cheese and fresh Herring; and indeed he forthwith carried them to his Lodging. In the mean while there came a Master beggar of the Friars of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> for some Hogs Purtenance; who that he might be heard afar-off, and to make the Bacon shake in the very Chimneys, had a mind to these Bells, and made account to filch them away privily. Nevertheless, he left them behind very honestly, not for that they were too hot, but that they were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too heavy for his carriage. This was not he of <hi>Bourg,</hi> for he was too good a Friend of mine.</p>
                     <p>All the City was in an Uproar, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as you know) upon any slight occasion, so ready to Uproars and Insurrections, that foreign Nations wonder at the Patience of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> who do not by good Justice restrain them from such tumultuous Courses, seeing the manifold inconveniences which thence arise from day to day. Would to God I knew the Shop, wherein are forged these Divisions, and factious Combinations, that I might bring them to light in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraternities of my Parish.

                     <p>MAster <hi>Ianotus,</hi> with his Hair cut round as a Dish, his <hi>Liripoop</hi> on his Head, after the old fashion; and having sufficiently <hi>antidoted</hi> his Stomach with Kitchen-Cordials, and holy Water of the Cellar, convoy'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the Lodging of <hi>Gargantua,</hi> driving before him three red muzled <hi>Beadles,</hi> and draging after him five or six <hi>Artless Masters,</hi> all throughly bedagled with the Mire of the Streets.

of their Wits; which moved him to enquire of one of the said <hi>Artless Masters</hi> of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, what this Mummery meant? It was answer'd him, that they desired to have their <hi>Bells</hi> restored to them.

They were all of Opinion, that they should bring them unto the Can-office, and there make them drink like Roysters, and line their Jackets soundly. And that this <hi>Cougher</hi> might not be puft up with Vain-glory, by thinking the Bells were restored at his Request, they sent (whilst he was plying the Pot) for the Major of the Town, the Rector of the Faculty, and the Vicar of the Church, unto whom they resolved to deliver the Bells, before the <hi>Sophister</hi> had delivered his Commission.

                     <p>THE Sophister had no sooner ended, but <hi>Ponocrates</hi> and <hi>Eudemon</hi> burst out in a laughing so heartily, that they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most split with it, and given up the Ghost, even just as <hi>Crassus</hi> did, seeing a lubberly Ass eat Thistles; and as <hi>Philemon,</hi> who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Ass eat those Figs which were provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for his own dinner, died with force of Laughing.

                     <p>When they had done laughing, <hi>Gargantua</hi> consulted with the prime of his Retinue, what should be done.

Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> did so, by the advice of a <hi>Iew</hi> his Physician, and <hi>lived till his dying day in despite of his Enemies.</hi> My <hi>first Masters</hi> have used me to it, saying, That <hi>to eat Break-fast made a good memory</hi>; and therefore they drank first. I am very well after it, and dine but the better. And Master <hi>Tubal</hi> (who was the first Licentiat at <hi>Paris</hi>) told me, That <hi>it was not enough to run apace, but to set forth betimes.</hi>

So the total Welfare of our humidity doth not depend upon drinking, switter, swatter like Ducks, but in being at it early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Vnde versus,</hi>

                     <p>After a good Breakfast he went to Church, and they carried to him in a great Basket, a huge <hi>Breviary,</hi> weighing what in Grease, Clasps, Parchment and Cover, little more or less than Eleven hundred and six Pounds. There he heard six and twenty or thirty <hi>Masses</hi>: This while, to the same place came his Mattin-mumbler, muffled up about the Chin, round as an Hoop, and his breath pretty well antidoted with the Vine-tree-sirrup. With him he mumbled all his <hi>Kiriels,</hi> which he so curiously thumbed and finger'd, that there fell not so much as one Bead of them to the Ground. As he went from the Church they brought him upon a Dray drawn with Oxen, a confused heap of <hi>Patinotres</hi> of <hi>Sante Claude,</hi> every one of the bigness of a Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>block; and sauntring along through the Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, Galleries or Garden, he riddled over more of them than sixteen Hermites would have done. Then did he study some paltry half-hour with his Eyes fix'd upon his Book;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:46180:142"/>
but (as the <hi>Comedy</hi> has it) <hi>His mind was in the Kitchen.</hi> Pissing then a whole pot full, he sate down at Table; and because he was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally flegmatic, he began his Meal with some dozens of Gammons, dried Neats Tongues, <hi>Botargos,</hi> Sauciges and such other fore-runners of Wine; in the mean while, four of his Folks did cast into his mouth one after another continually mustard by whole shovels full. Immediately after that, he drank a horrible draught of White-Wine for the comfort of his Kidneys. When that was done, he eat according to the Season, Meat agreeable to his Appetite; and then left off eating when his Belly was like to crack for fulness. As for his drinking, he had in that neither end nor rule; for he was wont to say, <hi>That the limits and bounds of drinking were, that a Man might drink till the Cork of his Shooes swells up half a foot high.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. XXIII. How <hi>Gargantua</hi> was instructed by <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocrates</hi> and in such sort disciplina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that he lost not one hour of the Day.</head>
                     <p>WHen <hi>Ponocrates</hi> knew <hi>Gargantua</hi>'s vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner of living, he resolved to bring him up in another-gats way; but for a while bore with him, considering, <hi>That nature cannot endure a sudden change, without great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</hi> Therefore to begin his work the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he requested a learned Physitian of that time, called Master <hi>Theodorus,</hi> seriously to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend (if it were possible) how to bring <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantua</hi> unto a better course; the said Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian purged him canonically with <hi>Anticyrian Hellebore,</hi> by which Medicine he cleansed all that Foulness and perverse Habit of his Brain. By this means also <hi>Ponocrates</hi> made him forget all that he had learned under his ancient <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptors,</hi> as <hi>Timotheus,</hi> did to his Scholars, who had been instructed under other Musicians: To do this the better, they brought him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the company of learned Men, which stirr'd in him an Emulation and Desire to whet his wit and improve his parts and to bend his study another way; so as that the World might have a value from him. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he put himself into such a road that he
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:46180:146"/>
lost not any one hour in the day, but em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed all his time in Learning and honest Knowledg. <hi>Gargantua</hi> awaked about four a clock in the Morning; whilst they were in rubbing of him, there was read unto him some Chapter of the <hi>holy Scripture</hi> aloud and clearly with a Pronunciation fit for the matter, and hereunto was appointed a young Page born in <hi>Basche,</hi> named <hi>Anagnostes,</hi> according to the purpose and argument of that Lesson, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times gave himself to worship, adore, pray and send up his Supplications to that good God, whose Word did show his Majesty and marvellous Judgment. Then went he unto the secret places to make excretion of his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral digestions; there his Master repeated what had been read, expounding unto him the most obscure and difficult points: In returning, they considered the face of the sky, if it was such as they had observed it the night before, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what Signs the Sun was entering, as also the Moon for that day. This done, he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled, combed, curled, trimmed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed, during which time they repeated to him the Lessons of the day before; he himself said them by heart, and upon them would ground some practical Cases concerning the Estate of Man, which he would prosecute sometimes two or three hours, but ordinarily they ceased as soon as he was fully clothed. Then for three good hours he had a Lecture read unto him: This done, they went forth
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:46180:147"/>
still conferring of the substance of the Lecture either unto a Field near the university call'd the <hi>Brack,</hi> or unto the meadows where they play'd at the ball, tennis and at the <hi>Pelitrigone,</hi> most gallantly exercising their Bodies, as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they had done their minds: All their play was but in liberty, for they left off when they pleas'd and that was commonly when they did sweat over all their Body, or were otherways weary. Then were they very well wip'd and rubbed, shifted their shirts and walking soberly, went to see if dinner were ready: Whilst they stayed for that, they did clearly and eloquetnly pronounce some sentences that they have retain'd of the Lecture, in the mean time <hi>Master</hi> Appetite, came, and then very orderly sat they down at Table. At the beginning of the meal, there was read some pleasant History of the warlike actions of former times, until he had taken a glass of Wine. Then (if they thought good,) they continu'd reading, or began to discourse merrily together; speaking first of the vertue, propriety, efficacy and nature of all that was serv'd in at the table: of Bread, of Wine, of Water, of Salt, of Fleshes, Fishes, Fruits, Herbs, Roots, and of their dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing; by means whereof, he learned in a little time all the passages competent for this that were to be found in <hi>Plinie, Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus, Dioscorides, Iulius Pollux, Galen, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phirie, Oppian, Polybius, Heliodore, Aristotle,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:46180:147"/>
Elian</hi> and others. Whilst they talked of these things, many times to be more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, they caused the very books to be brought to the Table and so well and perfectly did he in his memory retain the things above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, that in those Days there was not a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician, that knew half so much as he did. Afterwards they conferr'd of the lessons read, in the Morning, and ending their repast with some conserve or marmelade of quinces: he pick't his teeth with mastic tooth-pickers; wash't his hands and eyes with fair fresh water, and gave thanks unto God in some neat Hymn, made in the praise of the divine bounty and munificence. This done, they brought in cards, not to play, but to learn a thousand pretty tricks, and new inventions, which were all grounded upon <hi>Arithmetic.</hi> By this means he fell in love with that nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical science and every day after dinner and supper he past his time in it as pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as he was wont to do at cards and dice: So that at last he understood so well both the Theory and Practical part thereof; that <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stal</hi> the <hi>Englishman,</hi> who had written very largely of that purpose, confessed that verily in comparison of him he understood no more high Dutch.</p>
                     <p>And not only in that, but in the other <hi>Mathematical</hi> Seiences, as <hi>Geometrie, Astronomie, Music, &amp;c.</hi> For in waiting on the concoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and attending the digestion of his food,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:46180:148"/>
they made a thousand pretty instruments and <hi>Geometrical</hi> figures, and did in some measure practise the <hi>Astronomical</hi> Canons.</p>
                     <p>After this, they recreated themselves with singing <hi>musically,</hi> in four or five parts, or upon a set theme or ground at random, as it best pleased them; in matter of <hi>musical</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, he learned to play upon the Lute, the Virginals, the Harp, the Allman Flute with nine holes, the Viol and the Sackbut. This hour thus spent, and digestion finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he did purg his body of natural excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then betook himself to his principal study for three hours together, or more, as well to repeat his morning Lectures, as to proceed in the book he had in Hand, as also to write handsomly, to draw and form the <hi>Antic</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Letters. This being done, they went abroad, and with them a young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of <hi>Tourain,</hi> named the Esquire <hi>Gym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nast,</hi> who taught him the Art of riding, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging then his clothes, he rode a <hi>Naples</hi> courser, a <hi>Dutch</hi> roussin, a <hi>Spanish</hi> gennet, a barded or trapped steed, then a light fleet Horse, unto whom he gave a hundred carieres, made him go the high faults, bounding in the air, free the ditch with a skip, leap over a stile or pale, turn short in a ring both to the right and left hand. There he broke not his lance; for it is the greatest foolery in the world, to say <hi>I have broken ten lances at tile,</hi> or in fight, a Carpenter can do even as much; but it is a glorious and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:46180:148"/>
praise-worthy Action, <hi>with one lance to break and overthrow ten Enemies</hi>: Therefore with a sharp, stiff, strong and well steeled lance, would he usually force up a door, pierce a harness, beat down a tree, carry away the ring, lift up a cui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasier saddle, with the male coat and gantlet; all this he did in compleat arms from head to foot. As for the prancing flourishes, and smack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing popisms, for the better cherishing of the horse, commonly used in riding, none did them better then he. The great Vaulter of <hi>Ferrara</hi> was but as an Ape compared to him. He was singularly skilful in leaping nimbly from one horse to another, without putting foot to ground, and these horses were called <hi>desultori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s</hi>; he could likewise from either side, with a lance in his hand, leap on horseback without stirrups, and rule the horse at his pleasure without a Bridle, for such things are useful in military Engagements. Another day he exercised the battel-ax, which he so dextrously wielded, both in the nimble, strong and smooth Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of that weapon, and that in all the Feats practiseable by it, that he past Knight of Arms in the field, and at all Essays.</p>
                     <p>Then tost he the pike, played with the two handed Sword, with the Backsword, with the <hi>Spanish</hi> tuck, the dagger, poiniard, armed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, with a buckler, with a cloak, with a targuet.</p>
                     <p>Then would he hunt the Hart, the Roe-buck, the Bear, the fallow Deer, the wilde Boar,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:46180:149"/>
the Hare, the Phesant, the Partridg and the Bustard. He played at the Baloon and made it bound in the air, both with fist and foot.</p>
                     <p>He wrestled, ran, jumped, not at three steps and a leap, nor at <hi>the Hears leap,</hi> nor yet at the <hi>Almenes</hi>; for (said <hi>Gymnast,</hi>) these jumps are for the wars altogether unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and of no use; but at one leap he would skip over a Ditch, spring over a Hedge, mount six paces upon a Wall, ramp and grapple after this fashon up against a window, of the full height of a lance. He did swim in deep Waters on his belly, on his back, sidewise, with all his body, with his feet only, with one Hand in the Air, wherein he held a book, crossing thus the breadth of the River of <hi>Seina,</hi> without wetting it and dragged along his cloak with his Teeth, as did <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>; then with the help of one Hand, he entred forcibly into a boat, from whence he cast himself again headlong into the Water, sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the depths, hollowed the rocks, and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the pits and gulphs. Then turned he the boat about, governed it, led it swiftly or slowly with the stream, and against the stream, stopped it in its course, guided it with one Hand, and with the other laid hard about him with a huge great Oar, hoised the sail, hied up along the mast by the shrouds, ran upon the edge of the decks, set the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass in order, tackled the boulins, and steerr'd the helm. Coming out of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:46180:149"/>
he ran furiously up against a Hill, and with the same alacrity and swiftness ran down again; he climed up at trees like a cat, and leaped from the one to the other like a squirrel; he did pull down the great boughs and branches like another <hi>Milo</hi>; then with two sharp well-steeled Daggers, and two tried Bodkins, would he run up by the wall to the very top of a House like a cat; then suddenly came down from the top to the bottom, with such an even composition of members, that by the fall he would catch no harm.</p>
                     <p>He did cast the dart, through the barr, put the stone, practise the javelin, the boar-spear or partisan and the halbard; he broke the strongest bows in drawing, bended against his breast, the greatest cross-bows of steele, took his aim by the eye with the hand-gun, and shot well, traversed and planted the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, shot at but-marks, at the papgay from below upwards, from above downwards, then before him, sideways and behind him, like the <hi>Parthians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They tyed a cable-rope to the top of a high Tower, by one end whereof hanging near the ground, he wrought himself with his hands to the very top: Then upon the same tract came down so sturdily and firm that you could not on a plain meadow have run with more assurance. They set up a great pole fixed upon two trees, there would
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:46180:150"/>
he hang by his Hands, and with them alone, his Feet touching at nothing, would go back and fore along the foresaid rope with so great swiftness, that hardly could one overtake him with running and then to exercise his breast and lungs, he would shout like all the Devils in hell: I heard him once call <hi>Eudemon,</hi> from St. <hi>Victors,</hi> gate to <hi>Monmertre: Stentor</hi> had never such a Voice at the siege of <hi>Troy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then for the strengthening of his nerves or sinewes, they made him two great sows of lead, each of them weighing eight thousand and seven hundred kint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ls, which they call'd <hi>Alteres</hi>; those he took up from the ground in each Hand one, then lifted them up over his head, and held them so without stirring three quarters of an Hour and more, which was an inimitable force.</p>
                     <p>He fought at Barriers with the stoutest and most vigorous Champions: And when it came to the cope he stood so sturdily on his Feet, that he abandoned himself unto the strongest, in case they could remove him from his place, as <hi>Milo,</hi> was wont to do of old. In whose imitation likewise he held a Pomgranat in his hand, to give it unto him that could take it from him. The time being thus bestowed, and himself rubbed, cleansed, wiped and refresht with other clothes, he returned fair and softly and passing through certain Meadows, or other grassy places,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:46180:150"/>
beheld the trees and plants, comparing them with what is written of them in the books of the Ancients, such as <hi>Theophrast, Dioscorides, Marinus, Plinie, Nicander, Macer</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> and carried home to the house great handfuls of them, whereof a young Page called <hi>Rizo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomos</hi> had charge; together with little Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks, Pickaxes, Grubbing hooks, Cabbies, Pruning knives, and other Instruments requisit for gardning. Being come to their lodging, whilst supper was making ready, they repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted certain passages of that which had been read, and set down at table. Here remark that his dinner was sober and thrifty, for he did then eat only to prevent the gnawings of his stomack, but his supper was copious and large; for he took then as much as was fit to maintain and nourish him; which indeed is the true diet prescribed by the Art of good and sound <hi>Physic.</hi> Although a rabble of loggerheaded Physicians, nuzzeled in the brabling shop of <hi>Sophisters,</hi> counsel the contrary. During that repast was continued the lesson read at dinner as long as they thought good; the rest was spent in good discourse, learned and profitable: After that they had given thanks he set himself to sing vocally, and play upon harmonious instruments, or otherways passed his time at some pretty sports, made with cards or dice; or in practising the feats of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerdemain,</hi> with cups and balls. There they stayed some nights in frolicking thus
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:46180:151"/>
and making themselves merriy till it was time to go to bed and on other nights they would go make visits unto learned men, or to such as had been travellers in strange and remote Countreys. When it was full night before they retired themselves, they went unto the most open place of the House to see the face of the sky, and there beheld the <hi>Comets,</hi> if any were, as likewise the <hi>Figures, Situations, As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, Oppositions,</hi> and <hi>Conjunctions</hi> of the both fixed Stars and Planets.</p>
                     <p>Then with his Master did he briefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capitulate after the manner of the <hi>Pythagore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that which he had read, seen, learned, done and understood in the whole course of that day.</p>
                     <p>Then prayed they unto <hi>God</hi> the Creator, in falling down before him and strengthening their faith towards him, and glorifying him for his boundless bounty and giving thanks unto him for the time that was past, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended themselves to his divine Clemency for the future, which being done, they went to bed, and betook themselves to their repose.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXIV. How <hi>Gargantua</hi> spent his time in rainy Weather.</head>
                     <p>IF it happened that the Weather were any Thing cloudy, foul and rainy, all the Forenoon was employed, as before specified, according to Custom, with this difference only, that they had a good clear fire lighted, to correct the Distempers of the Air: But after dinner, in stead of their wonted Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations they did abide within, and by way of <hi>Apotherapié,</hi> did recreate themselves in bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleing up of Hay, in cleaving and sawing of Wood, and in threshing sheaves of Corn at the Barn. Then they studied the Art of Painting or Carving, or brought into use the antic <hi>play of Tables,</hi> as <hi>Leonicus</hi> hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of it; and as our good Friend <hi>Lascaris</hi> playeth at it. In playing they examined the passages of ancient Authors, wherein the said Play is mentioned, or any metaphor drawn from it. They went likewise to see the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Metals, or the casting of great Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; how the Lapidaries did work, as also the Goldsmiths and Cutters of precious Stones: Nor did they omit to visit the Alchymists, Money-coiners, Upholsters, Weavers, Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet-workers, Watchmakers, Looking-glass-framers,

Printers, Organists, and other such kind of Artificers, and every where giving them somewhat to drink, did learn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the Industry and Invention of the Trades.</p>
                     <p>They went also to hear the public <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,</hi> the solemn <hi>Commencements,</hi> the <hi>Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>He went through the Halls and Places ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for fencing, and there played against the Masters themselves at all Weapons, and shewed them by Experience, that he knew as much in it as (yea more then) they. And instead of Simpling, they visited the Shops of Druggists, Herbalists and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries, and diligently consider'd the Fruits, Roots, Leaves, Gums, Seeds, the Grease and Ointments of some foreign Parts, as also how they did adulterate them. He went to see the Juglers, Tumblers, Mountebanks and Quacksalvers; and consider'd their cunning, their shifts, their summer saults and smooth tongue, especially of those of <hi>Chauny</hi> in <hi>Picar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> who are naturally great Praters, and will Banter and Lye as fast as a Dog can trot.</p>

                     <p>AT that time, which was the Season of Vintage, in the beginning of Harvest, when the Country-Shepherds were set to keep the Vines, and hinder the Starlings from eating up the Grapes: As some Cake-bakers of <hi>Lerne</hi> happened<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to pass along in the broad high way, driving unto the City Ten or Twelve Horses loaded with Cakes, the said Shepherds courteously intreated them
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:46180:153"/>
to give them some for their Money, as the price then ruled in the Market. For here it is to be remarked, <hi>That it is a Celestial Food to eat for Breakfast hot fresh Cakes with Grapes,</hi> especially the frail Clusters, the great red Grapes, Muscadine, the Verjuice Grape, and the Luskard, for those that are costive in their Belly; because it will make them gush out, and squirt the length of a Hunter's staff, like the very tap of a Barrel; and often-times <hi>thinking</hi> to let a squib, they did all-to-besquatter and conskite themselves, whereupon they are commonly called the <hi>Vintage-thinkers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Cake-bakers were in nothing inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their Request; but (which was worse) did injure them most outragiously, calling them <hi>pratling Gablers, lickorous Gluttons, freck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Bittors, mangy Rascals, shite-abed Scoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drels, drunken Roysters, sly Knaves, drowsie Loi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, slapsauce Fellows, slabberdegullion Drug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, lubbardly Louts, cousining Foxes, ruffian Rogues, paultry Customers, sycophant Varlets, drawlatch Hoydons, flouting Milk sops, jeering Companions, staring Clowns, forlorn Snakes, ninny Lobcocks, scurvy Sneaksbies, fondling Fops, base Loons, saucy Coxcombs, idle Lusks, scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing Braggards, noddy Meacocks, blockish Grut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nols, Doddipol Iolt heads, jobernol Goosecaps, foolish Loggerheads, slutch Calf lollies, grout-head Gnatsnapper, Lob dotterels, gaping Change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, codshead Loobies, woodcock Slangams,

ninny-hammer Flycatchers, noddipeak Simpletons, turgy Gut, shitten Shepherds,</hi> and other such defamatory Epithetes, saying further, that it was not for them to eat of these dainty Cakes, but might very well content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the course unraunged Bread, or to eat of the great brown Houshold Loaf. To which provoking words, one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, called <hi>Forgier</hi> (an honest Fellow of his person, and a notable Springal) made answer very calmly thus; How long is it since you have got Horns, that you are become so proud? Indeed formerly you were wont to give us some freely, and will you not now let us have some for our Money? This is not the part of good Neighbours, neither do we serve you thus when you come hither to buy our good Corn, whereof you make your Cakes and Buns: Besides that, we would have given you to the bargain some of our Grapes, but <hi>by his Zounds,</hi> you may chance to repent it, and possibly have need of us at another time, when we shall use you after the like manner, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore remember it.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Marquet,</hi> a prime Man in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraternity of the Cake-bakers, said unto him, Yea, Sir, thou art pretty well crest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

harm, in all simplicity went towards him, and drew a Six Pence out of his Leather Sachel, thinking that <hi>Marquet</hi> would have sold him some of his Cakes; but instead of Cakes, he gave him with his Whip such a rude lash overthwart the Legs, that the marks remain'd; then would have fled away, but <hi>Forgier</hi> cried out as loud as he could, O Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Murther, help, help, help, and in the mean time threw a great Cudgel after him, which he carried under his arm, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he hit him in the <hi>Coronal</hi> Joint of his head, upon the <hi>Crotaphic</hi> Artery of the right side thereof, so forcibly, that <hi>Marquet</hi> fell down from his Mare, more like a dead then living Man.</p>
                     <p>Mean while the Farmers and Country Swains that were watching their Walnuts near to that place, came running with their great Poles and long Staves, and laid such load on these Cake-bakers, as if they had been to thresh upon green Rye. The other Shepherds and Shepherddesses hearing the lamentable shout of <hi>Forgier,</hi> came with their slings and slackies following them, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great stones at them, as thick as Hail. At last these overtook them, and took from them about four or five dozen of their Cakes: Nevertheless they payed for them the ordinary price, and gave them over and above one hundred Eggs, and three Baskets
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:46180:155"/>
full of Mulberries. Then did the Cake-bakers help to get <hi>Marquet</hi> mounted upon his Mare again, who was most shrewdly wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and forthwith they returned to <hi>Lerne,</hi> changing the resolution they had to go to <hi>Pareille,</hi> threatning very sharp and boistrously the Cowherds, Shepherds and Farmers of <hi>Sevile</hi> and <hi>Sinays,</hi> This done, the Shepherds and Shepherddesses made merry with these Cakes and fine Grapes, and sported them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves together at the sound of the pretty small Pipe, scoffing and laughing at those vain-glorious Cake-bakers, who had <hi>that day met with a Mischief for want of crossing themselves with a good hand in the Morning.</hi> Nor did they forget to apply to <hi>Forgier</hi>'s Leg some fair great red and medicinal Grapes, and so handsomly drest it and bound it up, that he was quickly cured.</p>

                     <p>THE Cake-bakers being returned to <hi>Lerne,</hi> went presently, before they did either eat or drink, to the <hi>Capitol,</hi> and there before their King called <hi>Pichrochole,</hi> the third of that name, made their complaint, shewing their <hi>Paniers broken,</hi> their <hi>Caps all crumpled,</hi> their <hi>Coats torn,</hi> their <hi>Cakes taken away,</hi> but above all, <hi>Marquet</hi> most enormously <hi>wounded,</hi> saying, that all that mischief was done by the Shepherds and Herdsmen of <hi>Grangousier,</hi> near the broad high way beyond <hi>Sevile.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Picrochole</hi> incontinent grew angry and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; and, without asking any further, what, how, why or wherefore? commanded the <hi>Ban</hi> and <hi>Arrier Ban</hi> to be sounded through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all his Country, that all his Vassals of what condition soever, should upon pain of the halter come in the best arms they could, unto the <hi>great place</hi> before the Castle, at the hour of Noon, and the better to expedite his design, he caused the Drum to be beat about the Town. Whilst his dinner was
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:46180:156"/>
making ready, he went himself to see his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery mounted upon the Carriage, to display his Colours, and set up the great royal Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, and loaded Wains with store of Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition both for the Field and for the Belly, Arms and Victuals. At dinner he dispatch'd his Commissions, and by his express Edict my Lord <hi>Shagrag</hi> was appointed to command the Vanguard, wherein were numbred Sixteen thousand and fourteen Harquebusiers, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Thirty thousand eleven Volunteers. The great <hi>Tonquedillion,</hi> Master of the Horse, had the charge of the Ordnance, wherein were reckon'd Nine hundred and fourteen of Brass, in <hi>Cannons, Double-cannons, Basilisks, Serpentines, Culverins, Bombards, Falcons, Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volans, Spiroles,</hi> and other sort of great Guns. The Reerguard was committed to the <hi>Duke of Scrapegood:</hi> In the main Battle was the King, and the Princes of his Kingdom. Thus being hastily equipp'd, before they would set forward, they sent Three hundred light Horsemen under the Conduct of Captain <hi>Swill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind,</hi> to discover the Country, clear the Avenues, and see whether there was any am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bush laid for them. But after they had made diligent search, they found all the Land round about in Peace and Quiet, without any meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or convention at all; which <hi>Picrochole</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, commanded that every one should march speedily under his Colours. Then in all disorder, without keeping either
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:46180:156"/>
rank or file, they took the Fields, one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst another, wasting, spoiling, destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and making havock of all where ever they went, not sparing poor nor rich, privileged nor unprivileged Places, Church or Laity, drove away Oxen and Cows, Bulls, Calves, Heifers, Wethers, Ewes, Lambs, Goats, Kids, Hens, Capons, Chickens, Geese, Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Goslings, Hogs, Swine, Pigs and such like. Beating down the Walnuts, plucking the Grapes, tearing the Hedges, shaking the Fruit-trees, and committing such incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble abuses, that the like abomination was never heard of. Nevertheless, they met with none to resist them; for every one submitted to their mercy; beseeching them, that they might be dealt with courteously; in regard that they had always carried themselves, as became good and loving Neighbours; and that they had never been guilty of any wrong or outrage done upon them, to be thus sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly surprized, troubled and disquieted, and that if they would not desist, God would pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them very shortly.

                     <p>SO much they did, and so far they went pillaging and stealing, that at last they came to <hi>Sevile</hi> where they robbing both Men and Women, and took all they could catch: Nothing was either too hot or too heavy for them. Although the Plague was there in the most part of all the Houses, they neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less entred every where; then plundered and carried away all that was within; and yet for all this not one of them took any hurt, which is a most wonderful case. For the Curates, Vicars, Preachers, Physicians, Chirurgions and Apothecaries, who went to visit, to dress, to cure, to heal, to preach unto, and admonish those that were sick were <hi>all dead of the Infection</hi>; and <hi>these devillish Robbers and Murtherers caught never any harm at all.</hi> Whence comes this to pass (my Masters) I beseech you think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it?</p>
                     <p>The Town being thus pillaged, they went unto the Abbey with a horrible noise and tumult, but they found it shut and made fast against them. Whereupon the Body of the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:46180:157"/>
Army marched forward towards a Ford call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Sue de vede,</hi> except seven Companies of Foot, and Two hundred Lanciers, who staying there, broke down the Walls of the <hi>Closs,</hi> to waste, spoil and make havock of all the Vines and Vintage within that place. The Monks (poor Devils) knew not in that extremity to which of all their Sancts they should vow themselves; nevertheless, at all adventures they rang the Bells <hi>ad capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulum capitulantes.</hi> There it was decreed, that they should make a fair Procession, stuffed with good Lectures, Prayers and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanies, <hi>contra hostium insidias,</hi> and jolly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponses <hi>pro pace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There was then in the Abbey a claustral Monk, called <hi>Freer Iohn de Entoumeures,</hi> young, gallant, frisk, lusty, nimble, quick, active, bold, adventurous, resolute, tall, lean, wide-mouthed, long nosed, a rare mumbler of <hi>Mattins,</hi> unbridler of <hi>Masses,</hi> and runner over of <hi>Vigils</hi>: And to conclude summarily in a word, a <hi>right Monk,</hi> if ever there were any, since the <hi>Monking</hi> World <hi>monked</hi> a <hi>Monkery.</hi> For the rest a Clerk, even to the Teeth, in matter of <hi>Breviary.</hi> This <hi>Monk</hi> hearing the noise that the Enemy made within the inclosure of the Vineyard, went out to see what they were doing; and perceiving that they were cutting and gathering the Grapes, whereon was grounded the foundation of all their next Years Wine, returned unto the Quire
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:46180:158"/>
of the Church where the other Monks were, all amazed and astonished like so many Bell-melters, whom when he heard sing, <hi>im, nim, pe, ne, ne, ne, ne, nede, tum, ne, num, num, ini, i, mi, co, o, no, o, o, neno, ne, no, no, no, rum, nenum, num.</hi> This is (said he) <hi>Bien chié chanté, Well shit, well sung,</hi> by the Vertue of God, why do not you sing <hi>Paniers farewel, Vintage is done</hi>; the Devil snatch me if they be not already within the middle of our <hi>Closs,</hi> and cut so well both Vines and Grapes, that, <hi>by cods body,</hi> there will not be found for these four Years to come so much as a gleaning in it. <hi>By the Belly of Sanct Iames,</hi> what shall we (<hi>poor Devils</hi>) drink the while? Lord God! <hi>da mihi potum.</hi> Then said the Prior of the Convent, What should this drunken Fellow do here, let him be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Prison for troubling the <hi>Divine Service</hi>: Nay, said the Monk, the <hi>Wine Service,</hi> let us behave our selves so, that it be not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; for you your self, <hi>my Lord Prior,</hi> love to drink of the best, and <hi>so doth every honest Man. Never yet did a Man of worth dislike good Wine,</hi> it is a monastical Apophthegm. But these <hi>Responses</hi> that you chant here by G— are not in Season. Wherefore is it that our <hi>Devotions</hi> were instituted to be short in the time of <hi>Harvest</hi> and <hi>Vintage,</hi> and long in the <hi>Advent</hi> and all the <hi>Winter.</hi>

Ha, no, no: What the Devil would have <hi>Sanct Thomas</hi> of <hi>England</hi> died for them; if I die, shall not I be a <hi>Sanct</hi> likewise? Yet will not I die for all this, but send others a-packing.</p>
                     <p>As he spake this, he threw off his great Monks habit, and laid hold upon the staff of the Cross, which was made of the Heart of a Sorbaple-tree, it being of the length of a Lance, round, of a full gripe, and a little powder'd with <hi>Flower de luce,</hi> almost all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd and worn out. Thus went he out in a fair long-skirted Jacket, putting his Frock scarfways athwart his Breast, and with his staff of the Cross, laid on so lustily, upon his Enemies, who without any Order, or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, or Trumpet, or Drum, were busied in gathering the Grapes of the Vineyard; for the Cornets, Guidons and Ensign-bearers, had laid down their Standards, Banners and Colours by the Wall-sides: The Drummers
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:46180:159"/>
had knock'd out the Heads of their Drums on one end, to fill them with Grapes: The Trumpeters were loaded with great Bundles of Bunches, and huge knots of Clusters: In summ, every one of them was out of array, and all in disorder. He hurried therefore upon them so rudely, without crying <hi>gare</hi> or beware, that he overthrew them like Hogs, tumbled them over like Swine, striking athwart and alongst, and by one means or other, laid so about him, after the old fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Fencing, that to some he beat out their Brains, to others he crushed their Arms, batter'd their Legs, and bethwack'd their sides till their Ribs crack'd with it; to others again he unjointed the <hi>Spondyles</hi> of the Neck, disfigured their Chaps, gash'd their Faces, made their Cheeks hang flapping over their Chin, and so swing'd and belammed them, that they fell down before him like Hay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Mower: To some others he spoiled the frame of their Kidneys, marr'd their Backs, broke their Thigh bones, pash'd in their Noses, poach'd out their Eyes, cleft their <hi>Mandibules,</hi> tore their Jaws, dung in their Teeth into their Throat, shook a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder their <hi>Omoplates</hi> or Shoulder-blade<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>spha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celated</hi> their Shins, mortified their Shanks, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed their Ankles, heaved off of the Hinges, their Ishies, their <hi>Sciatica</hi> or Hip-gout, dislo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the Joints of their Knees, squatter'd into pieces the boughts or pestles of their
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:46180:159"/>
Thighs, and so thump'd, mawl'd and be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd them every where, that never was corn so thick and threefold thresh'd upon by Plowmens Flails, as were the pitifully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jointed Members of their mangled Bodies, under the merciless baton of the cross.</p>
                     <p>If any offer'd to hide himself amongst the thickest of the Vines, he laid him squat as a Flounder, bruised the Ridge of his Back, and dash'd his Reins like a Dog. If any thought by flight to escape, he made his Head to fly in pieces by the <hi>Lambdoidal commissure.</hi> If any one did scramble up into a Tree, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there to be safe, he rent up his Perinee, and impaled him in at the Fundament. If any one of his old acquaintance happened to cry out, Ha, <hi>Friar Iohn</hi> my Friend, <hi>Friar Iohn,</hi> quarter, quarter, I yield my self to you; to you I render my self: So thou shalt (said he) <hi>per</hi> force, and thy Soul to all the Devils in Hell, then suddenly gave them <hi>Dronos.</hi> If any was so rash and full of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity as to resist him to his Face, then was it he did shew the strength of his Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scles; for without more ado he did tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spierce him, by running him in at the Breast, through the <hi>mediastine</hi> and the Heart. Others again he so quash'd and be bump'd, that with a sound bounce under the hollow of their short Ribs, he overturn'd their Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs, so that they died immediately. To some with a smart souse on the <hi>Epigaster,</hi> he
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:46180:160"/>
would make their Midrif swag, then redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the blow, gave them such a home push on the Navel, that he made their Pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings to gush out. To others through their Ballocks he pierced their Bum-gut, and left not Bowel, Tripe nor Intral in their Body, that had not felt the impetuosity, fierceness and fury of his Violence. Believe that it was the most horrible Spectacle that ever one saw: Some cried unto <hi>Sanct Barbe,</hi> others to <hi>St. George</hi>; O the holy <hi>Lady Nytouch,</hi> said one, the good Sanctess; <hi>O our Lady of Succors,</hi> said another, help, help: Others cried, Our Lady of <hi>Cunaut,</hi> of <hi>Loretta,</hi> of <hi>good Tidings,</hi> on the other side of the Water St. <hi>Mary over</hi>: some vowed a Pilgrimage to St. <hi>Iames,</hi> and others to the holy <hi>Handkerchief</hi> at <hi>Chamberry,</hi> which three Month; after that burnt so well in the fire, that they could not get one thread of it saved: Others sent up their Vows to St. <hi>Cadouin,</hi> others to St. <hi>Iohn d' Angelie,</hi> and to St. <hi>Eutropius</hi> of <hi>Xantes:</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers again invoked St. <hi>Mesmes</hi> of <hi>Chinon,</hi> St. <hi>Martin</hi> of <hi>Candes,</hi> St. <hi>Clouod</hi> of <hi>Sinays,</hi> the holy Relics of <hi>Laurezay,</hi> with a Thousand other jolly little Sancts and Santrels. Some died without speaking, others spoke without dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; some died in speaking, others spoke in dying. Others shouted aloud, <hi>Confession, Confession, Confiteor, miserere, in manus.</hi> So great was the cry of the wounded, that the <hi>Prior</hi> of the Abbey with all his <hi>Monks</hi> came
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:46180:160"/>
forth; who when they saw these poor Wretches so slain amongst the Vines, and wounded to death, confessed some of them. But whilst the Priests were busied in confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them, the little <hi>Monkeys</hi> ran all to the place where <hi>Friar Iohn</hi> was, and asked him, wherein he would be pleased to require their assistance?</p>
                     <p>To which he answer'd, that they should cut the Throats of those he had thrown down upon the ground. They presently leaving their outer Habits and Cowls upon the Rails, began to throttle and make an end of those whom he had already crushed.

                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Friar Iohn</hi> with his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable baton of the Cross, got to the breach which the Enemies had made, and there stood to snatch up those that endeavoured to escape. Some of the <hi>Monkitos</hi> carried the Standards, Banners, Ensigns, Guidons and Colours into their Cells and Chambers, to make Garters of them. But when those that had been shriven, would have gone out at the gap of the said Breach, the sturdy <hi>Monk</hi> quash'd and fell'd them down with blows, saying, These Men have had Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and are peni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Thus by his Prowess and Valour were discomfited all those of the Army that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the <hi>Closs</hi> of the Abbey, unto the number of Thirteen thousand six hundred twenty and two, besides the Women and little Children, which is always to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.

                     <p>WHilst the Monk did thus skirmish, as we have said, against those which were entred within the <hi>Closs; Picrochole</hi> in great haste passed the Ford <hi>Vede,</hi> with all his
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:46180:161"/>
Souldiery, and set upon the Rock <hi>Clermond,</hi> where there was made him no resistance at all: And because it was already Night, he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to quarter himself and his Army in that Town, and to refresh himself of his <hi>pugna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Choler.</hi> In the Morning he stormed and took the Bulwarks and Castle, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he fortified with Rampiers, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd with all Ammunition requisite, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to make his retreat there, if he should happen to be otherwise worsted; for it was a strong place, both by Art and Nature, in regard of the stance and scituation of it. But let us leave them there, and to return to our good <hi>Gargantua,</hi> who is at <hi>Paris</hi> very assiduous and earnest at the study of good Letters, and athletical Exercitations, and to the good old Man <hi>Grangousier</hi> his Father, who after Supper warmeth his Ballocks by a good, clear, great fire, and whilst his Chesnut a are a-rosting, is very serious in drawing scratches on the Hearth, with a stick burnt at the one end, wherewith they did stir up the fire, telling to his Wife and the rest of the Family pleasant old Stories and Tales of of former times.</p>
                     <p>Whilst he was thus employ'd, one of the Shepherds which did keep the Vines (named <hi>Pillot</hi>) came towards him, and to the full related the enormous abuses which were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and the excessive spoil that was made by <hi>Picrochole</hi> King of <hi>Lerne,</hi> upon his Lands
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:46180:162"/>
and Territories, and how he had pillaged, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted and ravaged all the Country, except the inclosure at <hi>Sevile,</hi> which Friar <hi>Iohn des En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toumeures</hi> to his great honour had preserved: And that at the same present time the said King was in the Rock <hi>Clermond:</hi> And there with great Industry and Circumspection, was strengthening himself and his whole Army. <hi>Halas, halas, alas</hi> (said <hi>Grangousier</hi>) what is this good People? Do I dream, or is it true that they tell me? <hi>Picrochole</hi> my ancient Friend of old time, of my own Kindred and Alliance, comes he to invade me? What moves him? What provokes him? What sets him on? What drives him to it? Who hath given him this Counsel? <hi>Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho,</hi> my God, my Saviour, help me, inspire me, and advise me what I shall do. I protest, I swear before thee, so be thou favourable to me, if ever I did him or his Subjects any damage or displeasure, or committed any the least Robbery in his Country; but on the contrary I have succoured and supplied him with Men, Money, Friendship and Counsel upon any occasion, wherein I could be stead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for his good; that he hath therefore at this nick of time so outraged and wronged me, it cannot be but by the malevolent and wicked Spirit. Good God, thou knowest my Courage, for nothing can be hidden from thee; if perhaps he be grown mad, and that thou hast sent him hither to me for the better
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:46180:162"/>
recovery and re-establishment of his brain: Grant me power and wisdom to bring him to the yoke of thy holy will by good disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. <hi>Ho, ho, ho, ho,</hi> my good People, my Friends and my faithful Servants, must I hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you from helping me? Alas, my old age required henceforward nothing else but rest, and all the days of my Life I have laboured for nothing so much as Peace: But now I must (I see it well) load with Arms my poor, weary and feeble shoulders; and take in my trembling hand the Lance and Horseman's Mace, to succour and protect my honest Subjects: Reason will have it so; for by their labour am I maintain'd, and with their sweat am I nourish'd, I, my Children and my Family. This notwithstanding, I will not undertake War, until I have first tried all the ways and means of Peace; that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve upon.</p>
                     <p>Then assembled he his Counsel, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the matter, as it was indeed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it was concluded, that they should send some discreet Man unto <hi>Picrochole,</hi> to know wherefore he had thus suddenly broken the Peace, and invaded those Lands unto which he had no Right nor Title. Furthermore, that they should send for <hi>Gargantua,</hi> and those under his command, for the Preservation of of the Country, and Defence thereof now at need. All this pleased <hi>Grangousier</hi> very well, and he commanded that so it should be done.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:46180:163"/>
Presently therefore he sent <hi>Basque,</hi> his Lackey, to fetch <hi>Gargantua</hi> with all diligence, and wrote to him as followeth.</p>

                     <p>THe fervency of thy studies did require, that I should not in along time recall thee from that Philosophical rest thou now enjoyest: If the confidence reposed in our Friends and <hi>ancient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates,</hi> had not at this present Disappointed the assurances of my old age. But seeing such is my fatal Destiny, that I should be now disquieted by those in whom I trusted most: I am forced to call thee back to defend the <hi>People</hi> and <hi>Goods,</hi> which by the right of Nature belong unto thee; <hi>for even as Arms are weak abroad if there be not Counsel at home;</hi> so is <hi>that Study vain,</hi> and <hi>Counsel unprofitable, which in a due and convenient time is not by Vertue executed and put in effect.</hi> My Intention is not to Provoke, but Appease: Not to Assault, but to Defend: Not to Conquer, but to preserve my faithful Subjects and hereditary Dominions; into which <hi>Picrochole</hi> is entred in a hostile manner without any Ground or Cause, and from day to

day pursueth his furious Enterprise with great height of Insolence, that is intolerable to free-born Spirits.</p>
                     <p>I have endeavoured to moderate his <hi>tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Choler,</hi> offering him all that which I thought might give him Satisfaction: And often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have I sent lovingly unto him, to understand wherein, by whom, and how he found himself to be wronged; But of him could I obtain no other answer, but a meer defiance; and that in my Lands he did pretend only to the right of a civil Correspondency and good Behaviour. Whereby I knew that the Eternal God hath given him over to the disposure of his own <hi>free Will and sensual Appetite; which cannot chuse but be wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if by divine Grace it be not continually guided</hi>: And to contain him within his Duty, and bring him to know himself, hath sent him hither to me by a grievous Token. Therefore, <hi>my Beloved Son,</hi> as soon as thou, canst, upon sight of these Letters, repair hither with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, to succour not me so much (which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless by natural Piety thou oughtest to do) as <hi>thine own People,</hi> which by reason thou oughtest to save and preserve.

At the same hour departed the good Man <hi>Gallet,</hi> and having past the <hi>Ford,</hi> asked the Miller, in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition <hi>Picrochole</hi> was? who answer'd, That <hi>his Souldiers had left neither Cock nor Hen</hi>; that they were retir'd and shut up into the Rock <hi>Clermond,</hi> and that he would not advise him to go any further for fear of the Scouts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were enormously furious; which he easily believed, and therefore lodged that night with the Miller.</p>
                     <p>The next morning he went with a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter to the Gate of the Castle, and requir'd
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:46180:164"/>
the Guards he might be admitted to speak with the King, of somewhat that concern'd him. These words being told unto the King, he would by no means consent that they should open the Gate; but getting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the top of the Bulwark, said unto the Ambassador, <hi>What is the news? what have you to say</hi>?

incomparable Abuses and Injuries perpetrated by thee and thine upon those of his Country, towards whom there hath been no Example of Inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity omitted. Which in it self is to him so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous for the cordial Affection, wherewith he hath always cherish'd his Subjects, that more it cannot be to any mortal Man; yet in this (above human Apprehension) is it to him the more grievous, that these Wrongs and sad Offences have been committed by <hi>thee and thine,</hi> who time out of mind, from all antiquity, <hi>thou and thy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors</hi> have been in a continual <hi>League</hi> and <hi>Amity</hi> with <hi>him,</hi> and all his <hi>Ancestors;</hi> which, even until this time, you have as sacred together inviolably preserved, kept and maintained so well, that not he and his only, but the very barbarous Nations of the <hi>Poictevins, Bretons, Manceaux,</hi> and those that dwell beyond the Isles of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,</hi> and that of <hi>Isabella,</hi> have thought it as easie to pull down the Firmament, and to set up depths above the Clouds, as to make a breach in your <hi>Alliance;</hi> and have been so afraid of it in their Enterprises, that they have never dared to provoke, incense or indamage the one for fear of the other.

from the memory of Man, there hath not been either <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>League</hi> so wild and proud, that durst have offered to invade, I say not your <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> but not so much as those of your <hi>Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates.</hi> And if by rash and heady Counsel they have attempted any new design against them, as soon as they heard the Name and Title of your <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance,</hi> they have suddenly desisted from their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises.

Then sent he to learn concerning that busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and found by true information, that some of his Men had taken violently some <hi>Cakes</hi> from <hi>Picrochole</hi>'s People, and that <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet</hi> had his Head broken: That neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less all was well paid, and that the said <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet</hi> had first hurt <hi>Forgior</hi> with a stroke of his Whip athwart the Legs; and it seemed good to his whole Counsel, that he should defend himself with all his Might. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all this (said <hi>Grangousier</hi>) see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the question is but about a few <hi>Cakes,</hi> I will labour to content him; for I am very unwilling to wage War against him. He enquired then what quantity of <hi>Cakes</hi> they
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:46180:167"/>
had taken away, and understanding that it was but some four or <hi>five dozen,</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>five cart-Loads</hi> of them to be baked that same night, and, that there should be one full of <hi>Cakes,</hi> made with fine butter, fine yolks of eggs, fine saffron and fine spice, to be bestowed upon <hi>Marquet</hi>; unto whom likewise he directed to be given seven hundred thousand and three <hi>Philips,</hi> for reparation of his losses, and for satisfaction of the Chirurgeon that had dressed his wound; and furthermore setled upon <hi>him</hi> and <hi>his</hi> for ever in <hi>Free-hold</hi> the Apple-Orchard called <hi>La Pomardiore</hi>; for the conveyance and passing of all which was sent <hi>Gallet,</hi> who by the way as they went made them gather near the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low trees great store of boughs, canes and reeds, wherewith all the Cariers were injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to garnish and deck their Carts, and each of them to carry one in his hand, as himself likewise did, thereby to give all Men to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, <hi>that they demanded but Peace, and that they came to buy it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Being come to the gate, they required to speak with <hi>Picrochole</hi> from <hi>Grangousier. Picro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chole</hi> would not so much as let them in, nor go to speak with them, but sent them word that he was busie, and that they should deliver their mind to Captain <hi>Tonquedillon,</hi> who was then planting a piece of Ordnance upon the Wall. Then said the good Man unto him, <hi>My Lord,</hi> to ease you of all this labour, and to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:46180:168"/>
all excuses why you may not return unto our former <hi>Alliance,</hi> we do here presently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store unto you the <hi>Cakes</hi> upon which the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel arose; five dozen did our People take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, they were well paid for; we love Peace so well, that we restore unto you five Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loads, of which this Cart shall be for <hi>Marquet,</hi> who doth most complain; besides to content him entirely, here are seven hundred thousand and three <hi>Philips,</hi> which I deliver to him; and for the Losses he may pretend to have sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I resign for ever the Farm of the <hi>Pomar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere,</hi> to be possess'd in Fee-simple by him and his for ever, without the payment of any du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or acknowledgment of homage, fealty, fine or service whatsoever; and here is the Deed of Conveyance, and for God's sake let us live henceforward in Peace; and go you home merrily into your own Country from this place, unto which you have no right at all, as your selves must needs confess, and let us be good Friends as before. <hi>Tonquedillon</hi> related all this to <hi>Picrochole,</hi> and more and more exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated his courage, saying to him, These Clowns are afraid to some purpose, by cocks <hi>Grangou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier</hi> conskites himself for fear; the poor <hi>drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> he is not skilled in warfare, nor hath he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny stomach for it, he knows better how to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty the <hi>Flaggons,</hi> that is his Art. I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that it is fit we send back the Carts and the Money; and for the rest, that very spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily we fortifie our selves here, then prosecute
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:46180:168"/>
our fortune. But what do they think to have to do wlth a <hi>ninnie-whoop,</hi> to feed you thus with <hi>cakes?</hi> You may see what it is, the good Usage and great Familiarity which you have had with them heretofore, hath made you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible in their Eyes; <hi>ungenton purget purgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom rustius unget.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sa, sa, sa, (said <hi>Picrochole,</hi>) by St. <hi>Iames</hi> you have given a true character of them. One thing I will advise you (said <hi>Tonquedillon,</hi>) we are here but badly victualled and very slenderly provided which stores for the Mouth: If <hi>Grangousier</hi> should come to besiege us, I would go presently and pluck out of all your souldiers heads and mine own all the teeth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept three to each of us, and with them alone we should make an end of our provision, but too soon.</p>
                     <p>We shall have (said <hi>Picrochole</hi>) but too much sustenance and feeding-stuff; came we hither to eat or to fight? To fight indeed (said <hi>Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quedillon</hi>) yet <hi>from the panch comes the dance,</hi> and <hi>where famine rules force is exil'd.</hi> Leave off your prating (said <hi>Picrochole</hi>) and forthwith seize upon what they have brought. Then took the Money and Cakes, Oxen and Carts, and sent away the Messengers, without speaking a word, only that they would come no more so near, for a reason that would be told them the morrow after. Thus without doing any thing, returned they to <hi>Grangousier,</hi> and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the whole matter unto him, subjoyning
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:46180:169"/>
that there was <hi>no hope left to draw them to Peace, but by sharp and fierce Wars.</hi>

                     <p>IN this same very hour, <hi>Gargantua</hi> (who was gone out of <hi>Paris,</hi> as soon as he had read his Father's Letters) coming upon his great mare had already past the Nunnery-bridge himself; <hi>Ponocrates, Gymnast</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demon,</hi> to go along with him took Post-horses: The rest of his Train came after him by even journeys, bringing with them all his Books and Philosophical Instruments.

But <hi>Pono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> counselled him to go unto the Lord of <hi>Vauguyon,</hi> who at all times had been their Friend and <hi>Confederate</hi>; and that by him they should be better advised in their Business: Which they did incontinently, and found him very willing to assist them; and he was of opinion that they should send some one of his Company, to scout along and discover the Country, to learn in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and posture the Enemy was, that they might take Counsel, and proceed according to the present occasion. <hi>Gymnast</hi> offering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to go; whereupon it was concluded, that for his safety, and the better expedition, he should have with him some one that knew the Ways, Avenues, Turnings, Windings and Rivers thereabout.

out of order, Plundering, Stealing, Robbing and Pillaging all they could lay their Hands on: And as far off as they could perceive him, they ran thronging upon the back of one another in all haste towards him, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>load him of his Money, and untruss his Portmantles.

Yet he went not away; which words being heard by all the Souldiers that were there, divers of them being a little inwardly terrified, departed from the place: All this did <hi>Gymnast</hi> very
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:46180:174"/>
well remark and consider, and therefore ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king as if he would have alighted from off his Horse, as he was poising himself on the mounting side, he most nimbly (with his short Sword by his Thigh) shifting his feet in the stirrup, performed the stirrup-leather feat, whereby after the inclining of his Body downwards, he forthwith launch'd himself aloft in the Air, and placed both his Feet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the Saddle, standing upright with his back turned towards the Horse's head; <hi>Now</hi> (said he) <hi>my case goes backward.</hi> Then suddenly in the same very posture wherein he was, he fetched a gambole upon one foot, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the left hand, failed not to carry his Body perfectly round, just into its former stance, without missing one jot. Ha (said <hi>Tripet</hi>) I will not do that at this time, and not without cause. Well (said <hi>Gymnast</hi>) I have failed, I will undo this leap: Then with a marvellous strength and agility, turning towards the right hand he fetch'd another frisking gambole, as before, which done, he set his right hand thumb upon the hind bow of the Saddle, raised him up, and sprung in the Air, poising and upholding his whole Body, upon the Muscle and Nerve of the said Thumb; and so turned and whirled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self about three times. At the fourth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing his Body, and overturning it upside down, and foreside back, without touching any thing he brought himself betwixt the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:46180:174"/>
Horse's two Ears, springing with al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> his Body into the Air, upon the Thumb of his left Hand, and in that posture turning like a Wind-mill, did most actively do that trick which is called the <hi>Mill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>r's Pass.</hi> After this, clapping his right Hand flat upon the middle of the Saddle, he gave himself such a jerking swing, that he thereby seated himself upon the Crupper, after the manner of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women.</p>
                     <p>This done, he easily past his right Leg over the Saddle, and placed himself like one that rides in <hi>Croup</hi>: But (said he) it were better for me to get into the Saddle; then putting the Thumbs of both Hands upon the Crupper before him, and thereupon lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself, as upon the only Supporters of his Body, he incontinently turned heels over Head in the Air, and streight found himself betwixt the bow of the Saddle in a good seat. Then with a <hi>Summer-sault</hi> springing into the Air again, he fell to stand with both his Feet close together upon the Saddle, and there made above a hundred frisks, turns and demi-pommads, with his Arms held out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cross, and in so doing cried out aloud, <hi>I rage, I rage, Devils, I am stark mad; Devils, I am mad, hold me, Devils, hold me; hold, Devils, hold, hold.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whilst he was thus vaulting, the Rogues in great astonishment said to one another, By Cocks death, he is a <hi>Goblin</hi> or a <hi>Devil</hi> thus
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:46180:175"/>
disguised; <hi>Ab hoste maligno libera nos, Domine,</hi> and ran away as in a total rout, looking now and then behind them like a Dog that had stoln a Pudding.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Gymnast</hi> spying his advantage, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted from his Horse, drew his Sword, and laid on great Blows upon the thickest, and highest crested amongst them, and overthrew them in great heaps, hurt, wounded and bruised, being resisted by no body, they thinking he had been a <hi>starved Devil,</hi> as well in regard of his wonderful feats in vaulting, which they had seen, as for the Talk <hi>Tripet</hi> had with him, calling him <hi>poor Devil.</hi> Only <hi>Tripet</hi> would have traiterously cleft his head with his Fauchion; but he was well armed, and felt nothing of the Blow, but the weight of the stroke; whereupon turning suddenly about, he gave <hi>Tripet</hi> a home thrust, and upon the back of that, whilst he was about to ward his Head from a slash, he ran him in at the Breast with a hit, which at once cut his <hi>Stomach,</hi> the <hi>Colon,</hi> and the half of his <hi>Liver,</hi> wherewith he fell to the ground; and in falling gushed forth above four Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of Pottage, and his Soul mingled with the Pottage.</p>
                     <p>This done, <hi>Gymnast</hi> withdrew himself, very wisely considering, that a case of great adventure and hazard, should not be pursued unto its utmost period, and that it <hi>becomes all Cavaliers modestly to use their good Fortune,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:46180:175"/>
without troubling or stretching it too far.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore getting to Horse, he gave him the Spur, taking the right way unto <hi>Vauguyon</hi>; and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingot</hi> with him.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXXVI. How <hi>Gargantua</hi> demolished the Castle at the Ford of <hi>Vede,</hi> and how they past the Ford.</head>
                     <p>AS soon as he came thither, he related the Estate and Condition wherein they had found the Enemy, and the Stratagem which he alone had used against all their multitude; affirming that they were but rascally Rogues, Plunderers, Thieves and Robbers, ignorant of all military Discipline, and that they might boldly set forward unto the Field; it being an easie matter to fell and strike them down like Beasts, then <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantua</hi> mounted his great Mare, accompanied as we have said before, and finding in his way a high and great Tree (which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly was called St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s Tree, because heretofore St. <hi>Martin</hi> planted a Pilgrim's staff there; which grew to that height and greatness) said, <hi>This is that which I lacked; this Tree shall serve me both for a Staff and Lance:</hi> With that he pulled it up easily, pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:46180:176"/>
it off the Boughs, and trimed it at his pleasure. In the mean time his Mare pissed to ease her Belly, but it was in such abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, that it did overflow the Country Seven Leagues, and all the flood ran glib away towards the Ford of <hi>Vede,</hi> wherewith the Water was so swollen, that all the Forces the Enemy had there, were with great hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror drowned, except some who had taken the way on the left hand towards the Hills. <hi>Gargantua</hi> being come to the <hi>Wood</hi> of <hi>Vede,</hi> was informed by <hi>Eudemon,</hi> that there was some remainder of the Enemy within the Castle, which to know, <hi>Gargantua</hi> cried out as loud as he was able, <hi>Are you there, or are you not there? If you be there, be there no more; and if you be not there, I have no more to say.</hi> But a Ruffian Gunner at the Portcullis, let fly a Cannot-ball at him, and hit him with that shot most furiously on the right Temple of his head, yet did him no more hurt, then if he had but cast a Grape-stone at him: What is this? (said <hi>Gargantua</hi>) do yo throw at us Grape-stones here? The Vintage shall cost you dear, thinking indeed that the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let had been the stone of a Grape.</p>
                     <p>Those who were within the Castle, being till then busie at the pillage, when they heard this noise, ran to the Towers and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses, from whence they shot at him above Nine thousand and five and twenty Falcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot and Harcabusades, aiming all at his
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:46180:176"/>
Head; and so thick did they shoot at him, that he cried out, <hi>Ponocrates</hi> my Friend, <hi>These Flies are like to put out mine Eyes</hi>; give me a Branch of those Willow-trees to drive them away, thinking that the Bullets and Stones shot out of the great Ordnance had been but <hi>Dun-flies. Ponocrates</hi> looked and saw there were no other <hi>Flies,</hi> but great shot which they had shot from the Castle. Then was it that he rusht with his great Tree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Castle, and with mighty blows overthrew both Towers and Fortresses, and laid all level with the Ground, by which means all that were within were slain and broken in pieces.</p>
                     <p>Going from thence, they came to the Bridge at the <hi>Mill,</hi> where they found all the <hi>Ford</hi> covered with dead Bodies, so thick, that they had choaked up the <hi>Mill,</hi> and stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the current of its Water; and these were those that were destroyed in the Urinal Deluge of the Mare. There they were at a stand, consulting how they might pass with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hindrance by these dead Carcasses. But <hi>Gymnast</hi> said, If the <hi>Devils</hi> have past there, I will pass well enough. The <hi>Devils</hi> have past there (said <hi>Eudemon</hi>) to carry away the damned Souls. By St. <hi>Rhenian</hi> (said <hi>Pono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>) then by necessary consequence he shall pass there. Yes, yes (said <hi>Gymnastes</hi>) or I shall stick in the way. Then setting Spurs to his Horse, he past through freely,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:46180:177"/>
his Horse not fearing, nor being any ways affrighted at the sight of the dead Bodies. For he had accustomed him (according to the Doctrin of <hi>Aelian</hi>) not to fear Armour, nor the Carcasses of dead Men; and that not by killing Men as <hi>Diomedes</hi> did the <hi>Thracians,</hi> or as <hi>Vlysses</hi> did in throwing the Corpses of his Enemies at his Horses feet, as <hi>Homer</hi> saith; but by putting a <hi>Iack a-lent</hi> amongst his hay, and making him go over it ordinarily, when he gave him his Oats.</p>
                     <p>The other three followed him very close, except <hi>Eudemon</hi> only, whose Horses far fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot sank up to the Knee in the Paunch of a great fat Chuff, who lay there upon his back drowned, and could not get it out. There was he pester'd, until <hi>Gargantua</hi> with the end of his Staff thrust down the rest of the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain's Tripes into the Water, whilst the Horse pulled out his Foot; and (which is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful thing in <hi>Hippiatry</hi>) the said Horse was throughly cured of a <hi>Ringbone</hi> which he had in that Foot, by this touch of the burst guts of that great <hi>Looby.</hi>

                     <p>HAving got over the River of <hi>Vede,</hi> they came very shortly after to <hi>Grangousier</hi>'s Castle, who waited for them with great long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; at their coming there was such Hug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and Embracing, never was seen a more joyful Company; for <hi>Supplementum supplementi Chronicorum,</hi> saith, that <hi>Gargamelle</hi> died there with joy. For my part, truly I cannot tell, neither do I care very much for her, nor for any body else. The truth was, that <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantua</hi> in shifting his Clothes, and combing his Head with a Comb Nine hundred Foot long, and the teeth all Tusks of Elephants, whole and entire, he made fall at every rake above seven Balls that stuck in his Hair, at the razing of the Castle at the Wood of <hi>Vede.</hi> Which his Father <hi>Grangousier</hi> seeing, thought they had been Lice, and said unto him, What, my dear Son, hast thou brought us thus far some short-winged Hawks of the College of <hi>Montague</hi>? I did not mean that thou shouldst reside there. Then answered <hi>Ponocrates,</hi> My Sovereign Lord, think not that I have placed him in that lowsie Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:46180:178"/>
which they call <hi>Montague</hi>; I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have put him amongst the Grave-diggers of <hi>Sanct Innocent,</hi> so enormous is the Cruelty and Villainy that I have known there; for the Gally-slaves are far better used amongst the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> the Murtherers in the criminal Dungeons, yea the very Dogs in your House, then are poor wretched Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in the aforesaid College. And, were I King of <hi>Paris,</hi> the Devil take me if I would not set it on fire, and burn both <hi>Principal</hi> and <hi>Regents,</hi> for suffering this Inhumanity to be exercised before their Eyes. Then taking up one of these Bullets, he said, these are Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-shot, which your Son <hi>Gargantua</hi> hath lately received by the Treachery of your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, as he was passing before the Wood of <hi>Vede.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But they have been so rewarded, that they are all destroyed in the Ruin of the Castle, as were the <hi>Philistines</hi> by the Policy of <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> and those whom the Tower of <hi>Silohim</hi> slew, as it is written <hi>Luc.</hi> 13.

                     <p>THE Story requireth, that we relate which happened unto six Pilgrims, who came from <hi>Sebastian</hi> near to <hi>Nantes</hi>: and who for shelter that night, being afraid of the Enemy, had hid themselves in the Garden upon the chichling Pease, among the Cabbages and Lettices. <hi>Gargantua</hi> finding himself somewhat dry, asked whether they could get any Lettice to make him a Sallet; and hearing that there were the greatest and fairest in the Country (for they were as great as Plum-trees, or as Walnut-trees) he would go thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Washing them therefore first at the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the Pilgrims said one to another softly, <hi>What shall we do? we are almost drowned here amongst these Lettice, shall we speak? But if we speak, he will kill us for Spies.</hi> And as they
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:46180:179"/>
were thus deliberating what to do, <hi>Gargan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi> put them with the Lettice into a platter of the House, as large as the huge Tun of the <hi>Cister<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

Which <hi>Grangousier</hi> seeing, said to <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantua,</hi> I think that is the Horn of a Shell-snail, do not eat it. Why not (said <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantua</hi>) they are good all this Month, which he no sooner said, but drawing up the Staff, and therewith taking up the Pilgrim, he eat him very well, then drank a terrible draught of excellent White-wine, and expected Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be brought up.</p>
                     <p>The Pilgrims thus devoured, made shift to save themselves as well as they could, by withdrawing their bodies out of the reach of the Grinders of his Teeth, but could not es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape from thinking they had been put in the lowest Dungeon of a Prison. And when <hi>Gargantua</hi> whiffed the great draught, they thought to have been drowned in his mouth, and the flood of Wine had almost carried them away into the Gulf of his Stomach. Nevertheless skipping with their Staves, as St. <hi>Michael</hi>'s Palmers use to do, they shelter'd themselves from the danger of that Inundation, under the Banks of his Teeth. But one of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:46180:180"/>
them by chance, groping or sounding the Country with his staff, to try whether they were in safety or no, struck hard against the cleft of a hollow tooth, and hit the <hi>mandibu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary</hi> Sinew, or nerve of the Jaw, which put <hi>Gargantua</hi> to very great pain, so that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to cry for the rage that he felt. To ease himself therefore of his smarting ach, he called for his Tooth-picker, and rubbing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a young Walnut-tree, unnestled you my Gentlemen Pilgrims.</p>
                     <p>For he caught one by the Legs, another by the scrip, another by the Pocket, another by the Scarf, another by the band of the Breeches, and the poor Fellow that had hurt him with the staff, him he hooked to him by the Codpiece, which snatch nevertheless did him a great deal of good, for it broke upon him a pocky botch he had in the Groin, which grievously tormented him ever since they were past <hi>Ancenis.</hi> The Pilgrims thus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodged ran away athwart the plain a pretty fast pace, and the pain ceased, even just at the time when by <hi>Eudemon</hi> he was called to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, for all was ready. I will go then (said he) and piss away my misfortune, which he did do in such a copious measure, that the Urin taking away the Feet from the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims, they were carried along with the stream unto the bank of a tuft of Trees: Upon which, as soon as they had taken foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that for their self-preservation they
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:46180:180"/>
had run a little out of the road, they on a sudden fell all six, except <hi>Fourniller,</hi> into a trap that had been made to take Wolves by a train; out of which they escaped neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less by the industry of the said <hi>Fourniller,</hi> who broke all the snares and ropes. Being gone from thence, they lay all the rest of that night in a Lodge near unto <hi>Coudry,</hi> where they were comforted in their Miseries, by the gracious words of one of their Company, called <hi>Sweer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togo,</hi> who shewed them that this adventure had been foretold by the Prophet <hi>David, Psalm.

                     <p>SUpper being ended, they consulted of the business in hand, and concluded that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout midnight they should fall unawares up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the enemy, to know what manner of watch and ward they kept; and in the mean while take a little rest, the better to refresh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. But <hi>Gargantua</hi> could not sleep by <hi>any means, on which side soever he turned himself.</hi> Whereupon the <hi>Monk</hi> said to him, I never sleep soundly, but when I am at <hi>Sermon</hi> or <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi> Let us therefore begin, you and I, the seven penitential <hi>Psalms,</hi> to try whether you shall not quickly fall asleep. The conceit pleased <hi>Gargantua</hi> very well, and beginning the first of these <hi>Psalms,</hi> as soon as they came to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ati quorum,</hi> they fell asleep both the one and the other. But the <hi>Monk</hi> for his being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly accustomed to the hour of <hi>Claustral ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> failed not to awake a little before mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, and being up himself awaked all the rest, in singing aloud, and with a full clear voice, the song,

What? (said <hi>Gargantua</hi>) to drink so soon after sleep, this is not to live by the rule of <hi>Physicians</hi>; for you ought first to scour and cleanse your stomac of all its superfluities: O rot your <hi>Physicians,</hi> said the <hi>Monk,</hi> a hundred devils leap into my body, if there be not <hi>more old Drunkards, then old Physicians.</hi> I have made this paction and covenant with my <hi>Appetite,</hi> that it always lieth down, and goes to Bed with me (for of that I take very good care) and then it also riseth with me the next Morning, tend your <hi>cures</hi> as much as you will, I will get me to my <hi>tiring.</hi> What <hi>tiring</hi> do you mean (said <hi>Gargan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi>?)

Be quiet (said <hi>Gymnast</hi>) and stir not, my Minion; I am now coming to unhang thee, for thou art a pretty little gentle <hi>Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, Monachus, in claustro non valet ova duo, sed quando est extra bene valet triginta.</hi> I have seen above five hundred hanged, but I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver saw any hang with so good a <hi>Grace</hi>; truly if I had so good a one, I would willingly hang thus all my life-time. What (said the <hi>Monk</hi>) have you almost done preaching? help me in the name of God, seeing you will not in the name of the other spirit, or by the habit which I wear, you shall repent it, <hi>tempore &amp; loco praelibatis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Gymnast</hi> alighted from his horse, and climbing up the walnut-Tree, lifted up the <hi>Monk</hi> with one hand, by the gushets of his Armour under the Arm-pits, and with the other undid his Vizor from the stump of the broken Branch, which done, he let him fall to the Ground, and himself after. As soon as the <hi>Monk</hi> was down, he put off all his Armor, and threw away one piece
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:46180:188"/>
after another about the Field, and taking to him again his <hi>Staff</hi> of the <hi>Cross,</hi> remounted up to his Horse, which <hi>Eudemon</hi> had caught in his running away. Then went they on merrily, riding on the high way.</p>

This <hi>Picrochole</hi> did not fully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, though he doubted not much of it. Therefore sent he under the command and conduct of the Count <hi>Drawforth,</hi> for discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Country, the number of sixteen
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:46180:189"/>
hundred Horsemen, all well-mounted upon light Horses for skirmish, and throughly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sprinkled with <hi>Holy Water</hi>; and every one for their cognizance had a <hi>Star</hi> in his Scarf, to serve at all adventures, in case they should happen to encounter with <hi>Devils</hi>; that by the Vertue, as well of that <hi>Gregorian</hi> Water, as of the <hi>Stars,</hi> they might make the <hi>Devils</hi> disappear and vanish.</p>
                     <p>In this Equipage, they made an excursion upon the Country, till they came near to <hi>Vauguyon,</hi> and to the <hi>Hospital,</hi> but could never find any body to speak unto; whereupon they returned a little back, and by chance in a Shepherds Cottage near to <hi>Coudray,</hi> they found five <hi>Pilgrims</hi>; these they carried away bound and manacled, as if they had been Spies, for all the Exclamations, Adjurations and Requests that they could make. Being come down from thence towards <hi>Seville,</hi> they were heard by <hi>Gargantua,</hi> who said then unto those that were with him; <hi>Camerades</hi> and <hi>Fellow Souldiers,</hi> we have here met with an Encounter, and they are ten times in number more than we: Shall we charge them or no? What a Devil (said the <hi>Monk</hi>) shall we do else? Do you esteem Men by their number, rather than by their valour and prowess? With this he cried out, Charge, <hi>Devils,</hi> charge. Which when the Enemies heard, they thought certainly that they had been very <hi>Devils,</hi> and therefore even then began
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:46180:189"/>
all of them to run away as hard as they could drive, <hi>Draw-forth</hi> only excepted, who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately settled his Lance on its rest, and therewith hit the <hi>Monk</hi> with all his force on the very middle of his Breast, but coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his horrific <hi>Frock,</hi> the point of the Iron, being with the blow either broke off or blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it was in matter of Execution, as if you had struck against an Anvil with a little Wax-candle. Then did the <hi>Monk</hi> with his <hi>Staff</hi> of the <hi>Cross</hi> give him such a sturdy thump and whirret betwixt his Neck and Shoulders, upon the <hi>Acromion</hi> bone, that he made him lose both sense and motion, and fall down stone dead at his Horses feet. And seeing the <hi>Star</hi> which he wore on his Scarf, he said unto <hi>Gargantua,</hi> these Men are but <hi>Priests,</hi> which is but the beginning of a <hi>Monk,</hi> by St. <hi>Ihon,</hi> I am a perfect <hi>Monk,</hi> I will kill them like <hi>flies.</hi> Then ran he after them at a swift and full Gallop, till he overtook the Reer, and felled them down like Tree-leaves, striking athwart and alongst and every way. <hi>Gymnast</hi> presently asked <hi>Gargantua</hi> if they should pursue them. To whom <hi>Gargantua</hi> answered, by no means; for, according to right military Discipline, <hi>you must never drive your Enemy unto Despair.</hi> For that such a strait doth multiply his Force, and encrease his Courage, which was before broken and cast down. Neither is there any better help for Men that are out of heart, toiled and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:46180:190"/>
spent, then to <hi>hope for no Favour at all.</hi> How many Victories have been taken out of the Hands of the Victors by the vanquish'd, when they would not rest satisfied with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but attempt to put all to the Sword, and totally to destroy all their Enemies, without leaving so much as one to carry home News of the defeat of his Fellows. Open there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unto your Enemies all the Gates and Ways, and make to them a bridge of Silver rather then fail, that you may be rid of them. Yea, but (said <hi>Gymnast</hi>) they have the <hi>Monk</hi>: Have they the <hi>Monk?</hi> (said <hi>Gargantua</hi>) Upon mine honour then it will prove to their cost: But to prevent all dangers, let us not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, but halt here quietly; for I think I do already understand the <hi>Policy</hi> of our Enemies, they are truly more directed by Chance and meer Fortune, then by good Advice and Counsel. In the mean while, whilst these made a stop under the <hi>Walnut-trees,</hi> the <hi>Monk</hi> pursued on the Chase, charging all he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, and giving quarter to none, until he met with a Trooper, who carried behind him one of the poor <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> and there would have rifled him. The <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> in hope of relief at the sight of the <hi>Monk,</hi> cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, Ha, my Lord <hi>Prior,</hi> my good Friend, my Lord <hi>Prior,</hi> save me, I beseech you, save me. Which words being heard by those that rode in the Van, they instantly fac'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and seeing there was no body but the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:46180:190"/>
                        <hi>Monk</hi> that made this great havock and slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter among them, they lodged him with blows as thick as they use to do an Ass with Wood: But of all this he felt nothing, especially when they struck upon his <hi>Frock,</hi> his Skin was so hard. Then they committed him to two of the <hi>Marshal</hi>'s Men to keep, and looking about, saw no body coming against them, whereupon they thought that <hi>Gargantua</hi> and his Party were fled. Then was it that they rode as hard as they could towards the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut-Trees</hi> to meet with them, and left the <hi>Monk</hi> there all alone, with his two foresaid Men to guard him. <hi>Gargantua</hi> heard the noise and neighing of the Horses, and said to his Men, <hi>Camerades,</hi> I hear the track and beating of the Enemies Horse-feet, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al perceive that some of them come in a Troop and full Body against us; let us rally and close here, then set forward in order, and by this means we shall be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Charge, to their loss and our honour.</p>

                     <p>THE Monk seeing them break off thus without Order, conjectured that they were to set upon <hi>Gargantua</hi> and those that were with him, and was wonderfully grieved that he could not succour them. Then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered he the countenance of the two <hi>Keepers</hi> in whose custody he was, who would have willingly run after the Troops to get some Booty and Plunder, and were always looking towards the Valley unto which they were going. Farther, he <hi>Syllogised,</hi> saying, These Men are but badly skilled in matters of War, for they have not required my <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rol</hi>; neither have they taken my Sword from me. Suddenly hereafter he drew his long Sword, wherewith he gave the <hi>Keeper</hi> which held him, on the right side such a sound slash, that he cut clean through the <hi>jugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larie</hi> veins, and the <hi>sphagitid</hi> arteries of the neck with the <hi>gargareon,</hi> even unto the two <hi>Adenes,</hi> and redoubling the blow, he opened the <hi>spinal</hi> marrow betwixt the second and the third <hi>vertebrae</hi>; there fell down that <hi>Keeper</hi> stark dead to the ground. Then the <hi>Monk</hi> reining
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:46180:191"/>
his Horse to the left, ran upon the other, who seeing his fellow dead, and the <hi>Monk</hi> to have the advantage of him, cried with a loud Voice, Ha, my Lord <hi>Prior,</hi> quarter; I yield, my Lord <hi>Prior,</hi> quarter, quarter; my good Friend, my Lord <hi>Prior:</hi> And the <hi>Monk</hi> cried likewise, My Lord <hi>Posterior,</hi> my Friend, my Lord <hi>Posterior,</hi> you shall have it upon your <hi>Posteriorums.</hi> Ha, said the <hi>Keeper,</hi> my Lord <hi>Prior,</hi> my dear Lord <hi>Prior,</hi> I pray God make you an <hi>Abbot.</hi> By the Habit (said the <hi>Monk</hi>) which I wear, I will here make you a <hi>Cardinal.</hi> What do you use to pay Ransoms to <hi>Religious</hi> Men? You shall have by and by, a <hi>red Hat</hi> of my giving: And the fellow cryed, Ha, my Lord <hi>Prior,</hi> my Lord <hi>Prior,</hi> my Lord <hi>Abbot</hi> that shall be my Lord <hi>Cardinal,</hi> my Lord <hi>All. Ha, ha, hes,</hi> no my Lord <hi>Prior,</hi> my good little Lord the <hi>Prior,</hi> I yield, render and deliever my self up to you. And I deliver thee (said the <hi>Monk</hi>) to all the Devils in Hell; then at one stroak he struck off his Head; cutting his <hi>Scalp</hi> upon the <hi>Temple</hi>-bones, and lifting up the two bones <hi>Bregmatis,</hi> together with the <hi>sagittal Commissure,</hi> as also a great part of the <hi>Coronal</hi> Bone; by which terrible blow like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he cut the two <hi>Meninges,</hi> and made a deep wound in the two posterior <hi>Ventricles</hi> of the Brain; so that the <hi>Cranium</hi> abode hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his Shoulders, by the Skin of the <hi>Pericranium</hi> behind, in form of a <hi>Doctor's
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:46180:192"/>
Bonnet,</hi> black without and red within. Thus fell he down also to the ground stark dead.</p>
                     <p>And presently the <hi>Monk</hi> gave his Horse the Spur, and kept the way that the Enemy held, who had met with <hi>Gargantua</hi> and his Companions in the broad High-way, and were so diminished of their number, for the enormous slaughter that <hi>Gargantua</hi> had made with his great Tree amongst them, as also <hi>Gymnast, Ponocrates, Eudemon</hi> and the rest, that they began to retreat disorderly and in great haste, as Men altogether affrighted and troubled in both Sense and Understanding; and as if they had seen the very proper <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> and Form of Death before their Eyes. Or rather as when you see an Ass with a <hi>brizze</hi> under his Tail, or Fly that stings him, run hither and thither without keeping any path or way, throwing down his load to the ground, breaking his Bridle and Reins, and taking no breath nor rest, and no Man can tell what ails him, for they see not any thing touch him. So fled these People, destitute of Wit, without knowing any cause of flying, only pursued by a <hi>panic</hi> terror, which in their minds they had conceived. The <hi>Monk</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that their whole intent was to betake themselves to their Heels, alighted from his Horse, and got upon a big large Rock, which was in the way, and with his great <hi>Brackmard</hi> Sword laid such load upon those runaways, and with main strength fetching a
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:46180:192"/>
compass with his Arm without feigning or sparing, slew and overthrew so many, that his Sword broke in two pieces. Then thought he within himself that he had slain and killed sufficiently, and that the rest should escape to carry News. Therefore he took up a battle-ax of those that lay there dead, and got upon the Rock again, passing his time to see the Enemy thus flying, and to tumble himself amongst the dead Bodies, only that he suffered none to carry Pike, Sword, Lance nor Gun with him, and those who carried the <hi>Pilgrims</hi> bound, he made to alight, and gave their Horses unto the said <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> keeping them there with him under the Hedge, and also <hi>Touchefaucet,</hi> who was then his Prisoner.</p>

                     <p>THIS Skirmish being ended, <hi>Gargantua</hi> retreated with his Men, excepting the <hi>Monk,</hi> and about the dawning of the day they came unto <hi>Grangousier,</hi> who in his Bed was praying unto God for their Safety and Victory. And seeing them all safe and sound,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:46180:193"/>
he embraced them lovingly, and asked what was become of the <hi>Monk? Gargantua</hi> answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, that without doubt the Enemies had the <hi>Monk</hi>? Then have they mischief and ill luck, said <hi>Grangousier,</hi> which was very true. Therefore is it a common Proverb to this day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>To give a Man the Monk.</hi> Then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded he a good Breakfast to be provided for their refreshment. When all was ready, they called <hi>Gargantua,</hi> but he was so aggrieved that the <hi>Monk</hi> was not to be heard of, that he would neither eat nor drink. In the mean while the <hi>Monk</hi> comes, and from the Gate of the outer Court cries out aloud, <hi>Fresh Wine, fresh Wine, Gymnast,</hi> my Friend. <hi>Gymnast</hi> went out and saw that it was Frier <hi>Ihon,</hi> who brought along with him five <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> and <hi>Touchefaucet</hi> Prisoners. Whereupon <hi>Gargantua</hi> likewise went forth to meet him, and all of them made him the best welcom that possibly they could, and brought him before <hi>Grangou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier,</hi> who asked him of all his adventures. The <hi>Monk</hi> told him all, both how he was taken, how he rid himself of his Keepers, of the slaughter he had made by the way, and how he had rescued the <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> and brought along with him Captain <hi>Touchefaucet.</hi> Then did they altogether fall to banqueting most merrily. In the mean time <hi>Grangousier</hi> asked the <hi>Pilgrims</hi> what Countrymen they were, whence they came, and whither they went? <hi>Sweertogo</hi> in the name of the rest answered,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:46180:193"/>
My Sovereign Lord, I am of Saint <hi>Genou</hi> in <hi>Berry,</hi> this Man is of <hi>Patvau,</hi> this other is of <hi>Onzay,</hi> this of <hi>Argy,</hi> and this Man of <hi>Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brenin.</hi> We came from Saint <hi>Sebastian</hi> near <hi>Nantes,</hi> and are now returning, as we best may, by easie Journeys. Yea, but said <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gousier,</hi> what went you to do at St. <hi>Sebastian</hi>? We went (said <hi>Sweertogo</hi>) to offer up unto that <hi>Sanct</hi> our Vows against the <hi>Plague.</hi> Ah poor Men (said <hi>Grangousier</hi>) do you think that the <hi>Plague</hi> comes from St. <hi>Sebastian</hi>? Yes truly (answered <hi>Sweertogo</hi>) our Preachers tell us so indeed. But is it so? said <hi>Grangousier.</hi> Do the false Prophets teach you such abuses? Do they thus blaspheme the <hi>Sancts</hi> and <hi>Holy</hi> Men of God, as to make them like unto the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, who do nothing but hurt unto Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind? as <hi>Homer</hi> writeth, that the <hi>Plague</hi> was sent into the Camp of the <hi>Greeks</hi> by <hi>Apollo</hi>; and as the Poets feign a great rabble of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joves</hi> and mischievous Gods. So did a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain old Hypocrite Preach at <hi>Sinay,</hi> that Saint <hi>Antony</hi> sent the <hi>fire</hi> into Mens Legs; that Saint <hi>Eutropius</hi> made Men <hi>hydropic</hi>; St. <hi>Clida<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>, Fools</hi>; and that St. <hi>Genou</hi> made them <hi>goutish.</hi> But I punished him so exemplarily, though he called me <hi>Heretic</hi> for it, that since that time no such Hypocritical Rogue durst set his Foot within my Territories. And truly I wonder that your King should suffer them in their Sermons to publish such scandalous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin in his Dominions. For they deserve to
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:46180:194"/>
be chastised with greater severity then those who by <hi>Magical</hi> Art, or any other Device, have brought the <hi>Pestilence</hi> into a Country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Pest</hi> killeth but the Bodies, but such abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable <hi>Impostors</hi> empoison our very Souls. As he spake these words, in came the <hi>Monk</hi> very resolute; and asked them, whence are you, you poor Wretches? of St. <hi>Genou</hi> (said they.) And how (said the <hi>Monk</hi>) doth the Abbot <hi>Gullicut,</hi> that true toaper, and the <hi>Monks,</hi> what cheer make they? <hi>Morbleau,</hi> they'll have a fling at your Wives, whilst you are upon your gadding Pilgrimage. <hi>Hin, hen</hi> (said <hi>Sweertogo</hi>) I am not afraid of mine; for he that shall see her by day, will never break his Neck to come to her in the night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time. Yea marry (said the <hi>Monk</hi>) now you have hit it; let her be as ugly as ever was <hi>Proserpina,</hi> she will not keep her Arse dry, if there dwell any <hi>Monks</hi> near her. For a <hi>good Carpenter will make use of any kind of Timber.</hi> Let me be pepper'd with the Pox, if you find not all your Wives with Child at your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn: For the very shadow of an <hi>Abbey</hi>-steeple is prolific.</p>
                     <p>It is (said <hi>Gargantua</hi>) like the Water of <hi>Nilus</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> if you believe <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Pliny, lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap</hi> 3. What Vertue will there be then in their Bullets of Concupiscence, their Habits and their Bodies?</p>
                     <p>Then (said <hi>Grangousier</hi>) go your ways, poor Men in the Name of God the Creator,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:46180:194"/>
to whom I pray to guide you perpetually<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and henceforward be not so ready to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take these idle and unprofitable Journeys. Look to your Families, labour every Man in his vocation, instruct your Children, and live as the good Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> directeth you. In doing whereof, God, his Angels and Sancts will guard and protect you, and no Evil or <hi>Plague</hi> at any time shall befal you.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Gargantua</hi> led them into the Hall to take their Refection; but the <hi>Pilgrims</hi> did nothing but sigh, and said to <hi>Gargantua; O how happy is that Land which hath such a Man for their Lord!</hi> We have been more edified and instructed by the talk which he hath had with us, then by all the Sermons that ever were preached in our Town. This is (said <hi>Gargantua</hi>) that which <hi>Plato</hi> saith, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de Republ.</hi> That <hi>those Commonwealths are happy, whose</hi> Rulers <hi>Philosophize, and whose</hi> Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers <hi>Rule.</hi> Then caused he their Wallets to to be filled with Victuals, and their Bottles with Wine, and gave unto each of them a Horse to ease them upon the way, together with some Pence to live upon.</p>

It would have been more commendable in him to have contained himself within the bounds of his own territories, royally geverning them

then to insult and domineer in mine, pillaging and plundering every where, for <hi>by ruling his own with discretion, he might have increast his greatness, but by robbing me he cannot escape des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction.</hi> Go your ways in the name of God, do what is righteous; shew your King what is amiss, and never counsel him with regard unto your own particular profit for with the public will also be swallowed up the private. As for your ransom, I do freely remit it to you and will that your Armes and Horse be restored to you; so should good neighbours do and ancient friends, seeing this our difference is not properly <hi>War,</hi> as <hi>Plato, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de repub.</hi> would not have it called <hi>War</hi> but <hi>Sedition</hi> not when the <hi>Greeks</hi> took up Arms against one another, and therefore when such combustions should arise, his advice was to behave themselves with all discretion and modesty. Although you call it <hi>War,</hi> it is but superficial; it entereth not into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most cabinet of our hearts; for neither of us hath been wronged in his honour, nor is there any question betwixt us in the main; but only how to redress, by the by, some pretty faults committed by our Men; I mean, both yours and ours, which although you knew, you ought to let pass; for these quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relsom persons deserve rather to be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned then mention'd, especially seing I offered them satisfaction according to the wrong.</p>

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:46180:196"/>
whom I beseech by death, rather to take me out of this Life, and to permit my goods to perish and be destroyed before mine Eyes, then that by me or mine he should in any sort be wronged. These words uttered, he called the <hi>Monk,</hi> and before them all spoke thus unto him: <hi>Friar Ihon,</hi> my good friend, is it you that took Prisoner the Captain <hi>Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faucet</hi> here present? Sir, said the <hi>Monk,</hi> seing himself is here and that he is of the Years of discretion, I had rather you should know it by his confession then by any words of mine. Then said <hi>Touchfaucet,</hi> my Sovereign Lord it is he indeed that took me, and I do therefore most freely yield my self his Prisoner. Have you put him to any ransom, said <hi>Grangousier</hi> to the <hi>Monk?</hi> No (said the <hi>Monk,</hi>) of that I take no care: How much would you have, for having taken him? nothing, nothing said the <hi>Monk</hi>? I am not swayed by that, nor do I regard it. Then <hi>Grangousier</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that in presence of <hi>Touchfaucet,</hi> should be delivered to the <hi>Monk</hi> for taking him, the some of threescore and two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <hi>saluts,</hi> which was done, whilst they made a colation to the said <hi>Touchfaucet</hi>; of whom <hi>Grangousier</hi> asked, if he would stay with him, or if he loved rather to return to his King. <hi>Touchfaucet</hi> answered, that he was content to take whatever course he would advise him to: Then said <hi>Grangousier</hi>) return unto your King, and, God be with you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="187" facs="tcp:46180:196"/>Then gave him an excellent Sword a <hi>Vienna</hi> blade, with a golden scabbard wrought with Vine-branch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like flourishes, of fine Goldsmiths work, and a Coller of gold, weighing seven hundred and two thousand marks garnished, with precious stones of the finest sort, esteemed at a hundred and sixty thousand Ducats, and ten thousand Crowns more, as an honourable present.</p>
                     <p>After this talk, <hi>Touchfaucet</hi> got to his Horse, and <hi>Gargantua</hi> for his safety allowed him the guard of thirty Men at Arms, and six score Archers to attend him, under the conduct of <hi>Gymnast,</hi> to bring him even unto the gate of the rock <hi>Clermond,</hi> if there were need. Assoon as he was gone, the <hi>Monk</hi> restored unto <hi>Grangousier</hi> the threescore and two thousand <hi>Saluts,</hi> which he had receiv'd, saying, Sir it is not as yet the time for you to give such gifts, stay till this War be at an end, for none can tell what accidents may occur, and War begun without good provision of Mony before-hand is but a as blast that will quickly pass away: <hi>Coin is the sinews of War.</hi> Well then (said <hi>Grangousier</hi>) at the end I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent you by some honest recompence; as also all those who shall do me good service.</p>

                     <p>The news of these Excessive Violences were quickly spread through all the Army; whereupon many began to murmur against <hi>Picrochole,</hi> Insofar, that <hi>Pinchpennie</hi> said to him, My sovereign Lord, I know not what the Issue of this enterprise will be; I see your

                     <p>
                        <hi>GArgantua</hi> had the Charge of the whole Army, and his Father <hi>Grangousier</hi> stayed in his Castle; who encouraging them with good Words, promised great rewards unto those that should do any notable service. Assoon as they had gained the <hi>Ford</hi> of <hi>Vede,</hi> Boats and Bridges speedily made, they past over in a trice; then considering the scituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Town, which was on a high and advantageous place, <hi>Gargantua</hi> thought fit to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:46180:199"/>
call his Counsel, and pass that night in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration upon what was to be done: But <hi>Gymnast</hi> said unto him, My sovereign Lord, such is the Nature and Complexion of the <hi>French,</hi> that <hi>they are worth nothing, but at the first push.</hi> Then are they more fierce then De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; but if they be wearied with delays, they prove more faint then Women; my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is therefore, that now presently after your Men have taken breath, and some small re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, you give Order for a resolute Assault. The advice was found very good, and for effectuating thereof, he brought forth his Army into the plain Field, and placed the reserves on the Skirt or Rising of a little Hill. The <hi>Monk</hi> took along with him six Companies of Foot and two hundred Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men well armed and with great dilligence crossed the Marish, and valiantly got up to the top of the green Hillock, even to the High-way which leads to <hi>Loudin.</hi> Whilst the assault was thus begun, <hi>Picrochole</hi>'s Men could not tell well which was best to Issue out, and receive the Assailants, or keep within the Town and not to stir: Himself in the mean time without deliberation, sallied forth in a rage with the Cavalry of his Guard, who were forthwith received and royally entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great Cannon-shot, that fell upon them like hail from the high grounds, on which the Artillery was planted; whereupon the <hi>Gargantuists</hi> betook themselves unto the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:46180:200"/>
Valleys, to give the Ordnance leave to play and range with the larger scope.</p>
                     <p>Those of the Town defended themselves as well as they could, but their shot past o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, without doing any hurt at all. Some of <hi>Picrocholes</hi> Men that had escaped our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, set most fiercely upon our Souldiers, but prevailed little; for they were all let in betwixt the Files, and there knock'd down to the Ground. Which their Fellow Souldiers seeing, they would have retreated, but the <hi>Monk</hi> having seized upon the Pass, by the which they were to return, they run away and fled in all the Disorder and Confusion that could be imagined.</p>
                     <p>Some would have pursued after them, and followed the Chase, but the <hi>Monk</hi> withheld-them, apprehending that in their pursuit the Pursuers might lose their ranks, and so give occasion to the Besieged to sally out of the Town upon them. Then staying there some space, and none coming against him, he sent the Duke <hi>Phrontist,</hi> to advise <hi>Gargantua</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance towards the Hill upon the left hand, to hinder <hi>Picrochole</hi>'s retreat at that Gate; which <hi>Gargantua</hi> did with all Expedition, and sent thither four Brigades under the conduct of <hi>Sebast,</hi> which had no sooner reach'd the top of the Hill, but they met <hi>Picrochole</hi> in the Teeth, and those that were with him scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
                     <p>Then charged they upon them stoutly,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:46180:200"/>
yet were they much indamaged by those that were upon the Walls, who galled them with all manner of Shot, both from the great Ordnance, small Guns and Bows. Which <hi>Gargantua</hi> perceiving, he went with a strong Party to their relief, and with his Artillery began to thunder so terribly upon that Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton of the Wall, and so long, that all the strength within the Town, to maintain and fill up the Breach, was drawn thither. The <hi>Monk</hi> seeing that quarter which he kept be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged, void of Men and competent Guards, and in a manner altogether naked and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, did most magnanimously on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den lead up his Men towards the Fort, and never left it till he had got up upon it, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>that such as come to the reserve in</hi> a conflict, bring with them always more fear and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, then those that deal about them with their hands in the fight.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheless he gave no <hi>Alarm</hi> till all his Souldiers had got within the Wall, except the two hundred Horsemen, whom he left without to secure his Entry. Then did he give a most horrible shout, so did all these who were with him, and immediately there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after without resistance, putting to the edge of the Sword the guard that was at that Gate, they opened it to the Horsemen, with whom most furiously they altogether ran towards the <hi>East-gate,</hi> where all the hurly burly was, and coming close upon them in the Reer, overthrew all their Forces.</p>

Then shutting them up within Churches, gave order to seize upon all the <hi>Staves</hi> of the <hi>Crosses,</hi> and placed Men at the Doors to keep them from coming forth. Then opening the <hi>East-gate,</hi> he issued out to succour and assist <hi>Gargantua.</hi> But <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crochole</hi> thinking it had been some Relief co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to him from the Town, adventured more forwardly than before, and was upon the giving of a most desperate Home charge, when <hi>Gargantua</hi> cried out, Ha, Friar <hi>Ihon,</hi> my Friend Friar <hi>Ihon,</hi> you are come in a good hour; which unexpected accident so affrighted <hi>Picrochole</hi> and his Men, that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all for lost, they betook themselves to their Heels, and fled on all Hands. <hi>Gargantua</hi> chased them till they came near to <hi>Vaugaudry,</hi> killing and slaying all the way, and then sounded the retreat.</p>

                        <hi>PIcrochole,</hi> thus in despair, fled towards the <hi>Bouchard</hi> Island, and in the way to <hi>Rivere</hi> his Horse stumbled and fell down, whereat he was on a sudden so incensed, that he with his Sword, without more ado, killed him in his Choler. Then not finding any other whereon to remount, he was about to have taken an Ass at the Mill that was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; but the Millers Men did so baste his Bones, and so soundly bethwack'd him, that they made him both black and blew with strokes; then striping him of all his Clothes, gave him a scurvy old Canvas Jacket where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to cover his Nakedness. Thus went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long this poor choleric Wretch, who passing the Water at <hi>Porthuaux,</hi> and relating his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventurous Disasters, was foretold by an old <hi>Lourpidon</hi> Hag, that his Kingdom should be restored to him at the coming of the <hi>Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licranes.</hi> What is become of him since we cannot certainly tell; yet was I told that he is now a Porter at <hi>Lyons,</hi> as testy and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relic as ever, and always with great Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation enquiring at all strangers of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

of the <hi>Cocklicranes,</hi> expecting assuredly (according to the old Woman's Prophesie) that at their coming he shall be re-establish'd in his Kingdom. The first thing <hi>Gargantua</hi> did after his return into the Town was to call the Muster-roll of his Men, which when he had done, he found that there were very few either kill'd or wounded, only some few Foot of Captain <hi>Tolmeres</hi> Company, and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocrates,</hi> who was shot with a Musket Ball, through the Doublet. Then he caused them all at, and in their several, Posts and Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to take a little Refreshment, which was very plenteously provided for them in the best Drink and Victuals that could be had for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; And gave order to the Treasurers and Commissaries of the Army, to pay for, and defray that Repast, and that there should be no Outrage at all, nor Abuse committed in the Town, seeing it was his own.

                     <p>OVR Fore fathers and Ancestors, of all times, have been of this Nature and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, that upon the winning of a Battel, they have chosen rather for a sign and memorial of their Triumphs and Victories, to erect Trophies and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents in the <hi>Hearts</hi> of the Vanquish'd by <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency,</hi> then by <hi>Architecture</hi> in the <hi>Lands</hi> which they had conquer'd. For they did hold in greater estimation, the lively remembrance of Men purchased by liberality, than the dumb Inscription of <hi>Arches, Pillars</hi> and <hi>Pyramids,</hi> subject to the Injury of Storms and Tempests, and to the Envy of every one. You may very well remember of the Courtesie, which by them was used towards the <hi>Bretons,</hi> in the Battle of St. <hi>Aubin</hi> of <hi>Comier,</hi> and at the demolishing of <hi>Partenay.</hi> You have heard, and hearing admire their gentle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment towards those at the Barriers of <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ola,</hi> when they had plundered, wasted and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sack'd the maritime Borders of <hi>Olone</hi> and <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondois.</hi> All this Hemisphere of the World was filled with the Praises and Congratulations, which your selves and your Fathers made, when <hi>Alpharbal</hi> King of <hi>Canarre,</hi> not satisfied with his own Fortunes, did most furiously invade the

Land of <hi>Onyx,</hi> and with cruel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Piracies molest all the <hi>Armoric</hi> Islands, and confine Regions of <hi>Britany.</hi> Yet was he in a set naval Fight justly taken and vanquished by my Father, <hi>whom God preserve and protect.</hi> But what?

Being returned into his Country, he called <hi>a Parliament,</hi> where all the Princes and States of his Kingdom being assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, he shewed them the Humanity which he had found in us, and therefore wished them to take such course by way of Compensation therein, as that the whole World might be edified by the Example, as well of their honest Graciousness to us, as of our gracious Honesty towards them. The result hereof was, that it was voted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed by an unanimous Consent, that they should offer up entirely their Lands, Dominions and Kingdoms, to be disposed of by us according to our Pleasure.</p>

of all the Country beside. For he imbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himself, to set Sail with a <hi>West-North-East</hi> Wind, every one in heaps did cast into the Ship Gold, Silver, Rings, Iewels, Spices, Drugs and Aromatical Perfumes, Parrets, Pelicans, Monkies, Civet-cats, black-spotted Weesils, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He was accounted <hi>no good Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Son,</hi> that did not cast in all the rare and precious things he had.</p>
                     <p>Being safely arrived, he came to my said Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and would have kist his Feet: That Action was found too submissively low, and therefore was not permitted, but in exchange, he was most cordially embraced: He offered his Presents, they were not received, because they were too excessive: He yielded himself voluntarily a Servant and Vassal, and was content his whole Posterity should be liable to the same Bondage; this was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of, because it seemed not equitable. He surrendered by Vertue of the Decree of his great <hi>Parliamentary Council,</hi> his whole Countries and Kingdoms to him, offering the Deed and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, signed, sealed and ratified by all those that were concerned in it. This was altogether refused, and the Parchments cast into the Fire: In the end, this free-good Will and simple Meaning of the <hi>Canarriens,</hi> wrought such tenderness in my Father's Heart, that he could not abstain from shedding Tears, and wept most profusely; then by choice words very congruously adapted, strove in what he could to diminish the esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the good offices, which he had done
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:46180:204"/>
them, saying, That any Courtesie he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon them, was not worth a rush, and what favour so ever he had shew'd them, he was bound to do it. But so much the more did <hi>Alpharbal</hi> augment the repeat thereof: What was the Issue? whereas for his ransom in the greatest extremity of rigour and most tyrannical dealing, could not have been exacted above <hi>twenty times a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand Crowns,</hi> and his eldest Sons detain'd as hostages, till that Sum had been pay'd, they made themselves perpetual tributaries, and obliged to give us every Year two millions of Gold at four and twenty Carats fine: The first Year we received the whole sum of two Millions; the second Year of their own accord, they pay'd freely to us three and twenty hundred thousand Crowns; the third Year six and twenty hundred thousand; the fourth Year three millions, and do so increase it always out of their own good will, that we shall be constrained to forbid them to bring us any more. This is the Nature of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and true thankfulness: For time which gnaws and diminisheth all things else, augments and increaseth benefits; because a noble action of liberality done to a Man of reason doth grow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually by his generous thinking of it, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring it.</p>
                     <p>But unwilling therefore any way to degenerate from the hereditary mildness and clemency of my Parents; I do now forgive you, set you at liberty and every way make you as frank and free as ever you were before. Moreover, at your going
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:46180:204"/>
out of the Gate, you shall have every one of you three Months Pay to bring you home into your Houses and Families and shall have a safe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy of six hundred Cuirasiers and eight thousand Foot under the conduct of <hi>Alexander,</hi> Esquire of my body, that the Clubmen of the Country may not do you any Injury. <hi>God be with you;</hi> I am sorry from my Heart that <hi>Picrochole</hi> is not here; for I would have given him to understand, that this War was undertaken against my Will, and without any hope to increase either goods or renown; but seeing he is lost and that no Man can tell where, nor how he went away, <hi>It is my will</hi> that this Kingdom remain entire to his Son, who because he is too young (he not being yet full five Years old) shall be brought up and instructed by the ancient Princes and learned Men of the Kingdom. And because a Realm, thus desolate, may easily come to Ruin; if the covetousness and avarice of those, who by their places are obliged to administer justice in it; but not curbed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained: I ordain and will have it so, that <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocrates</hi> be overseer and superintendent above all his governours, with whatever power and authority is requisite thereto and that he be continually with the Child, until he find him able and capable to rule and govern by himself.</p>

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:46180:205"/>
that <hi>Moses,</hi> the meekest Man that was in his time upon the Earth, did severely punish the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous and seditious People of <hi>Israel.</hi> I consider likewise, that <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> who was so gracious an Emperor, that <hi>Cicero</hi> said of him, That <hi>his Fortune had nothing more excellent than that he could,</hi> and <hi>his Vertue nothing better than that he would always save and pardon every Man.</hi> He notwithstanding all this, did in certain places, most rigorously punish the Authors of Rebellion. After the Example of these good Men, it is my Will and Pleasure, that you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver over unto me before you depart hence, first, that fine Fellow <hi>Marquet,</hi> who was the prime, origin and ground-work of this War, by his vain Presumption and Overweening. Secondly, his <hi>fellow Cakebakers,</hi> who were neglective in checking and reprehending his idle hair-brain'd Humour in the instant time. And lastly, all the Counsellors, Captains, Officers and Domestics of <hi>Picrochole,</hi> who had been Incendiaries or Fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the War, by provoking, praising or counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him to come out of his Limits thus to trouble us.</p>

                     <p>WHen <hi>Gargantua</hi> had finished his Speech, the seditious Men whom he requir'd,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:46180:205"/>
were delivered up unto him, except <hi>Swash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buckler, Durtaille</hi> and <hi>Smaltrash,</hi> who ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way six hours before the Battle; one of them as far as to <hi>Lanielneck</hi> at one course, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Valley of <hi>Vire,</hi> and the third even unto <hi>Logroine,</hi> without looking back, or taking breath by the way. And two of the <hi>Cake-bakers,</hi> who were slain in the Fight. <hi>Gargantua</hi> did them no other hurt, but that he appointed them to pull at the Presses of his Printing-House, which he had newly set up. Then those who died there he caused to be honourably buried in <hi>Black-soile</hi>-Vailey, and <hi>Burn-hag-Field,</hi> and gave order that the wounded should be drest and had care of in his great Hospital or <hi>Nosocome.</hi> After this, considering the great prejudice done to the Town and its Inhabitants, he re-imbursed their Charges, and repair'd all the losses, that, by their Confession upon Oath, could appear they had sustained. And for their better De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and Security in times coming, against all sudden Uproars and Invasions, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a strong Cittadel to be built there with a competent Garrison to maintain it. At his departure he did very graciously thank all the Souldiers of the Brigades, that had been at this overthrow, and sent them back to their Winter-quarters in their several Stations and Garisons. The <hi>Decumane Legion</hi> only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whom in the Field on that day he saw do some great Exploit, and their Captains
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:46180:206"/>
also, whom he brought along with himself unto <hi>Grangousier.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At the sight and coming of them, the good Man was so joyful, that it is not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fully to describe it, He made them a Feast the most magnificent, plentiful and delicious that ever was seen since the time of the King <hi>Assuerus.</hi> At the taking up of the Table, he distributed amongst them his whole Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board of Plate, which weighed Eight hundred thousand and fourteen <hi>Besants</hi> of Gold, in great antic Vessels, huge Pots, large Basins, big Tasses, Cups, Goblets, Candlesticks, comfit Boxes and other such Plate, all of pure massy Gold, besides the precious Stones, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meling and workmanship, which by all Mens estimation was more worth than the matter of the Gold. Then unto every one of them out of his Coffers caused he to be given the summ of Twelve hundred thousand Crowns ready Money.

                        </gap> would have given him the Abbey of <hi>Bourgueil,</hi> or of Sanct <hi>Florent</hi> which was better, or both, if it pleased him. But the Monk gave him a very peremptory answer, that he would never take upon him the Charge nor Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Monks. For how shall I be able</hi> (said he) <hi>to rule over others, that have not full power and command of my self.</hi> If you think I have done you, or may hereafter do you, any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Service, give me leave to found an <hi>Abbey</hi> after my own Mind and Fancy. The motion pleased <hi>Gargantua</hi> very well, who thereupon offered him all the Country of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leme</hi> by the River of <hi>Loire,</hi> till within two Leagues of the great Forest of <hi>Port huaut.</hi> The <hi>Monk</hi> then requested <hi>Gargantua</hi> to insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute his religious Order <hi>contrary</hi> to all others. First then (said <hi>Gargantua) you must not build a Wall</hi> about your Convent, for all other Abbies are strongly walled and <hi>mured</hi> about. See (said the <hi>Monk</hi>) and without cause, where there is <hi>Mur</hi> before, and <hi>Mur</hi> behind,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:46180:207" rendition="simple:additions"/>
there is store of <hi>Murmur,</hi> Envy and mutual Conspiracy.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, seeing there are certain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents in the World, whereof the Custom is, if any Woman come (I mean chaste and honest Women) they immediately sweep the ground which they have trod upon. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was it ordained, that if any <hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Woman entered into religious Orders,</hi> should by chance come within this new <hi>Abbey,</hi> all the <hi>Rooms</hi> should be throughly <hi>washed</hi> and cleansed through which they had passed. And because in all other Monasteries and Nunneries all is compassed, limited and regulated by <hi>Hours,</hi> it was decreed that in this new Structure there should be neither Clock nor Dial, but that according to the opportunities and incident occasions, all <hi>their Hours</hi> should be disposed of. For (said <hi>Gargantua</hi>) the greatest loss of time that I know, is, to count the <hi>Hours.</hi> What good comes of it? nor can there be any <hi>greater dotage</hi> in the World, then for one to <hi>guide and direct his Courses by the sound of a Bell,</hi> and not by his own Judgment and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> Because at that time they put no <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> into Nunneries, but <hi>such as</hi> were either purblind, blinkards, lame, crooked, ill-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd, mis-shapen, fools, senceless, spoiled or corrupt; nor encloister'd <hi>any Men,</hi> but those that were <hi>either sickly,</hi> subject to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxions, ill-bred louts, simple sots, or peevish
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:46180:207"/>
trouble-houses. But to the purpose (said the <hi>Monk) A Woman that is neither fair nor good, to what use serves she</hi>? To make a <hi>Nun</hi> of, said <hi>Gargantua.</hi> Yea (said the <hi>Monk</hi>) and to make shirts and smocks. Therefore was it ordained that <hi>into this Religious</hi> Order should be admitted <hi>no Women</hi> that were not fair, well featur'd, and of a sweet disposition: Nor <hi>Men</hi> that were not comely, personable and well condition'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> Because in the Convents of Women, Men come not but underhand, privily and by stealth; it was therefore enacted, that in this House there shall be no Women in case there be not Men, nor Men in case there be not Women.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> Because both Men and Women that are received into religious Orders after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring of their <hi>noviciat</hi> or probation-year, were constrained and forced perpetually to stay there all the days of their life; it was therefore ordered, that all whatever, Men or Women, admitted within this Abbey, shoul have full leave to depart with peace and contentment, whensoever it should seem good to them so to do.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> For that the religious men and women did ordinarily make three Vows, to wit, those of <hi>Chastity, Poverty</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi>; it was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore constituted and appointed, that in this Convent they might be honourably <hi>Married,</hi> that they might be <hi>Rich,</hi> and live at <hi>Liberty.</hi>
                        <pb n="210" facs="tcp:46180:208"/>
In regard of the legitimate time of the persons to be initiated, and years under and above, which they were not capable of reception, the Women were to be admitted from <hi>ten till fifteen,</hi> and the Men from <hi>twelve to eighteen.</hi>

                     <p>FOR the Fabric and Furniture of the Abbey, <hi>Gargantua</hi> caused to be deliver'd out in ready Money Seven and twenty hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand, eight hundred and one and thirty of those golden Rams of <hi>Berrie,</hi> which have a Sheep stamped on the one side, and a flower'd Cross on the other.

                        </gap>tents pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a very good Grant. The Architecture
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:46180:208"/>
was in a figure <hi>Hexagonal,</hi> and in such a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion, that in every one of the six Corners there was built a great round Tower of Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score foot in diameter; and were all of a like form and bigness. Upon the Northside ran along the River of <hi>Loire,</hi> on the bank where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was scituated the Tower called <hi>Arctick.</hi> Going towards the <hi>East,</hi> there was another called <hi>Calaer</hi>; the next following <hi>Anatole</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the next <hi>Mesembrine</hi>; the next <hi>Hesperia,</hi> and the last <hi>Criere.</hi> Every Tower was distant from other the space of Three hundred and twelve paces. The whole Aedifice was every where six stories high, reckoning the Cellars under Ground for one. The second was arch'd after the fashion of a basket-handle. The rest were seeled with pure Wainscot, flourish'd with <hi>Flanders</hi> fret-work, in the form of the foot of a Lamp; and cover'd above with fine slates, with an indorsement of Lead, carrying the antic figures of little Puppets, and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals of all sorts, notably well suited to one another, and guilt, together with the gutters, which jetting without the Walls, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the cross Bars in a diagonal figure, painted with Gold and Azure, reach'd to the very ground, where they ended into great Conduit-pipes, which carried all away unto the River from under the House.</p>
                     <p>This same building was a hundred times more sumptuous and magnificent than ever was <hi>Bonnivet, Chambourg</hi> or <hi>Chantillie.</hi> For
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:46180:209"/>
there was in it Nine thousand three hundred and two and thirty Chambers; every one whereof had a withdrawing Room, a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som Closet, a Wardrobe, an Oratory and neat passage, leading into a great and spacious Hall. Between every Tower, in the midst of the said body of Building, there was a pair of winding Stairs, whereof the Steps were part of Porphyry, part of <hi>Numidian</hi> stone, and part of <hi>Serpentine</hi> marble; each of those steps being two and twenty foot in length, and three fingers thick, and the just number of twelve betwixt every rest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or landing place. In every resting place were two fair antic Arches where the light came in; and by those they went into a Cabinet, made even with, and of the breadth of, the said winding, and the re-ascending above the roofs of the House, ending <hi>conically</hi> in a Pavillion. By that <hi>vize</hi> or winding, they entred on every side into a great Hall, and from the Halls into the Chambers. From the <hi>Arctic</hi> Tower unto the <hi>Criere,</hi> were the fair great Libraries in <hi>Greek, Latin, Hebrew, French, Italian</hi> and <hi>Spanish,</hi> respectively distributed in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cantons, according to the diversity of these Languages. In the midst there was a wonderful winding-stair, the entry whereof was without the House, in a Vault or Arch six fathom broad. It was made in such sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry and largeness, that six Men at Arms with their Lances in their Rests, might toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

in a breast ride all up to the very top of all the Palace. From the Tower <hi>Anatole</hi> to the <hi>Mesembrine</hi> were fair spacious Galleries, all coloured over and painted with the ancient Prowesses, Histories and Descriptions of the World. In the midst thereof there was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise such another Ascent and Gate, as we said there was on the river-side.

                     <head>CHAP. LV. What manner of Dwelling the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemites</hi> had.</head>
                     <p>IN the middle of the lower Court there was a stately Fountain of fair Alabaster. Upon the top thereof stood the three <hi>Graces,</hi> with their <hi>Cornucopias,</hi> and did jett out the Water at their Breasts, Mouth, Ears, Eyes and other open Passages of the Body. The inside of the Buildings in this lower Court stood upon great Pillars of <hi>Cassydonie</hi> Stone, and <hi>Porphyry</hi> Marble, made Arch-ways after a goodly antic fashion. Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hin those were spacious Galleries, long and large, adorned with curious Pictures, the Horns of Bucks and Unicorns; with <hi>Rhinosceroses, Water-horses</hi> called <hi>Hippopotames,</hi> the teeth and tusks of Elephants, and other things well worth the holding. The Lodging of the Ladies took up all from the Tower <hi>Arctic</hi> unto the Gate <hi>Mesembrine.</hi> The Men possessed the rest, before the said Lodging of the Ladies, that they might have their Recreation between the two first Towers. One the out-side were placed the <hi>Tilt-yard,</hi> the <hi>Theatre</hi> and <hi>Natatorie</hi>; with most admirable Baths in three Stages, scituated above one another, well furnished with all necessary Accommodation, and store
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:46180:212"/>
of <hi>Myrtle-water.</hi> By the River side was the fair <hi>Garden</hi> of <hi>Pleasures</hi>; and in the midst of that of <hi>Labyrinth.</hi> Between the two other Towers were the Courts for the <hi>Tennis</hi> and the <hi>Baloon.</hi> Towards the Tower <hi>Criere</hi> stood the <hi>Orchard</hi> full of all Fruit-trees, set and ranged in a <hi>quincuncial</hi> Order. At the end of that was the great <hi>Park,</hi> abounding with all sort of Venison. Betwixt the third couple of Towers were the <hi>Buts</hi> and Marks for shooting with a snap work Gun, an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Bow for common Archery, or with a Cross-bow. The <hi>Office-houses</hi> were without the Tower <hi>Hesperie,</hi> of one story high. The <hi>Stable</hi> were beyond the Offices, and before them stood the <hi>Falconry,</hi> managed by Ostridge-keepers and Falconers, very expert in the Air. And it was yearly supplied and furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Candians; Venetians, Sarmates</hi> with all sorts of most excellent <hi>Hawks, Eagles, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falcons, Gosehawks, Sacres, Lannier, Falcons, Spar-hawks, Marlins,</hi> and all other kinds of them; so gentle and perfectly well manned, that flying of themselves sometimes from the Castle for their own desport, they would not fail to catch whatever they encountred. The <hi>Venerie</hi> where the Beagles and Hounds were kept, was a little farther off drawing towards the Park,</p>
                     <p>All the Halls, Chambers and Closets or Cabinets were richly hung with Tapestry, and Hangings of divers sorts, according to
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:46180:212"/>
the variety of the Seasons of the Year. All the Pavements and Floors were covered with green Cloath; the Beds were all Embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered: In every back-chamber or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing Room there was a Looking-glass of pure Crystal set in a frame of fine Gold, garnished all about with Pearls, and was of such greatness, that it would represent to the full the whole lineaments and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the person that stood before it. At the going out of the Halls, which belong to the Ladies Lodgings, were the <hi>Perfumers</hi> and <hi>Trimmers,</hi> through whose Hands the Gallants past when they were to visit the Ladies. Those sweet Artificers did every Morning furnish the Ladies Chambers with the Spirit of <hi>Roses, Orange</hi>-flower-water and <hi>Angelica</hi>; and to each of them gave a little precious Casket, vapouring forth the most odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Exhalations of the choisest aromatical Scents.</p>

Pleasure and Liking. But since that of their <hi>own accord</hi> and free will they have reformed themselves, their Accoutrements is in manner as followeth. They wore Stockings of scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let Crimson, or ingrained purple Die, which reached just three Inches above the Knee, having a list beautified with exquisite em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broideries, and rare incisions of the Cutters Art. Their Garters were of the colour of their Bracelets, and circled the knee a little, both over and under. Their Shooes, Pumps and Slippers were either of red, violet or crimson-velvet, pinked and jagged like Lob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster wadles.</p>
                     <p>Next to their Smock they put on the pretty Kirtle or Vasquin of pure silk Chamlet: Above that went the taffaty or taby Vardin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale, of white, red, tawny, gray or of any other colour: Above this taffaty Petticoat they had another of Cloath of tissue or bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cado, embroidered with fine Gold, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laced with Needle-work, or as they thought good, and according to the temperature and disposition of the Weather, had their upper coats of Satin, Damask or Velvet, and those either orange, tawny, green, ash colour'd, blew, yelow, bright, red, crimson or white, and so forth; or had them of cloath of Gold, cloath of Silver, or some other choice stuff, inriched with Purple, or embroidered accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the dignity of the festival Days and Times wherein they wore them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="221" facs="tcp:46180:213"/>Their Gowns being still correspondent to the Season, were either of cloath of Gold frizled with a silver-raised work; of red Sattin, covered with Gold purple; of taby or taffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, white, blew, black, tawny, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of silk Serge, silk Chamlet, Velvet, cloath of Silver, silver Tissue, cloath of Gold, gold Wire, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur'd Velvet, or figur'd Sattin tinselled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and overcast with golden Threads, in divers vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously purfled draughts.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Summer</hi> some days instead of Gowns they wore light handsom Mantles, made ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the stuff of the aforesaid Attire, or like <hi>Moresco</hi> Rugs, of Violet, velvet frizled, with a raised work of Gold upon silver Purle; or with a knotted Cord-work of Gold em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery, every where garnished with little <hi>Indian</hi> Pearls. They always carried a fair <hi>Pannache,</hi> or plume of Feathers, of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of their Muff, bravely adorned and tricked out with glistering Spangles of Gold. In the <hi>Winter</hi>-time they had their taffaty Gowns of all Colours, as above-named: And those lined with the rich Furrings of Hind-Wolves, or speckled Linxes, black-spotted Weesils, martlet-skins of <hi>Calabria,</hi> Sables, and other costly Furs of inestimable value. Their Beads, Rings, Bracelets, Collars, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canets and Neck chains were all of precious Stones, such as Carbuncles, Rubies, Baleus, Diamonds, Saphirs, Emeralds, Turkoises, Garnets, Agates, Berilles and excellent Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garits,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:46180:214"/>
Their Head-dressing also varied with the season of the year, according to which they decked themselves. In <hi>Winter</hi> it was of the <hi>French</hi> fashion; in the <hi>Spring</hi> of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>; in <hi>Summer</hi> of the fashion of <hi>Tuscany,</hi> except only upon the holy Days and <hi>Sundays,</hi> at which time they were accoutred in the <hi>French</hi> mode, because they accounted it more honourable, and better befitting the garb of a <hi>matronal pudicity.</hi>

                     <p>The Men were Apparelled after their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion: Their Stockins were of Tamine, or of cloath Serge, of white, black, scarlet, or some other ingrain'd Colour: Their Breeches were of Velvet, of the same Colour with their Stokins, or very near, embroidered and cut according to their Fancy.

The points were of Silk of the same colours; the tags were of Gold well enamelled. Their Coats and Jerkins were of cloath of Gold, cloath of Silver, Gold, Tissue or Velvet embroidered, as they thought fit. Their Gowns were every whit as costly as those of the Ladies. Their Girdles were of silk, of the colour of their Doublets. Every one had a gallant Sword by his side, the hilt and handle whereof were gilt, and the scabbard of Velvet of the colour of his Breeches, with a chape of Gold, and pure
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:46180:214"/>
Goldsmiths work. The Dagger was of the same. Their Caps or Bonnets were of black Velvet, adorned with Jewels and Buttons of gold; upon that they wore a white Plume, most pritily and minion-like, parted by so many rows of gold Spangles, at the end whereof hung dangling in a more sparkling resplendency fair Rubies, Emeralds, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but there was such a sympathy betwixt the Gallants and the Ladies, that every day they were apparelled in the same Livery. And that they might not miss, there were certain Gentlemen appointed to tell the Youths every morning what Vestments the Ladies would on that day wear; for all was done according to the pleasure of the Ladies. In these so handsom Cloaths and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biliaments so rich, think not that either one or other of either Sex did waste any time at all; for the Masters of the Wardrobes had all their Raiments and Apparel so ready for every Morning, and the Chamber Ladies so well skilled, that in a trice they would be dressed, and compleatly in their clothes from head to foot. And to have those Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutrements with the more conveniency. There was about the Wood of <hi>Theleme</hi> a row of Houses of the extent of half a league, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neat and cleanly, wherein dwelt the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smiths, Lapidaries, Jewellers, Embroiderers, Tailors, Gold-drawers, Velvet-weavers, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestry-makers and Upholsters, who wrought
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:46180:215"/>
there every one in his own Trade, and all for the aforesaid jolly Friars and Nuns of the new Stamp. They were furnished with Matter and Stuff from the hands of the Lord <hi>Nausiclete,</hi> who every year brought them seven Ships from the <hi>Perlas</hi> and <hi>Cannibal</hi> Islands, laden with ingots of Gold, with raw Silk, with Pearls and precious stones.

                     <head>CHAP. LVII. How the <hi>Thelemites</hi> were governed and of their manner of Living.</head>
                     <p>ALL their life was spent not in Laws, Statutes or Rules, but according to their own free Will and Pleasure. They rose out of their Beds, when they thought good: They did eat, drink, labour, sleep, when they had a mind to it, and were dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for it. None did awake them, none did offer to constrain them to eat, drink, nor to do any other thing; for so had <hi>Gargantua</hi> established it. In all their Rule, and strictest tie of their order, there was but this one clause to be observed.</p>
                     <q>
                        <pb n="225" facs="tcp:46180:215"/>Do what thou wilt.</q>
                     <p>Because Men that are free, well-born, well-bred and conversant in honest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, have naturally an <hi>Instinct</hi> and Spur that prompteth them unto vertuous Actions, and withdraws them from Vice, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>honour.</hi> Those same Men, when by base subjection and constraint they are brought under and kept down, turn aside from that noble disposition, by which they formerly were inclined to <hi>Vertue,</hi> to shake off and break that bond of servitude, wherein they are so tyranniously inslaved; for it is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the nature of Man to long after things forbidden, and to desire what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied us.</p>
                     <p>By this Liberty they entered into a very laudable emulation, to do all of them what they saw did please one. If any of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants or Ladies should say, <hi>Let us drink,</hi> they would all drink. If any one of them said, <hi>Let us play,</hi> they all played. If one said, <hi>Let us go a walking into the Fields,</hi> they went all. If it were to go a hawking or a hunting, the Ladies mounted upon dainty well-paced Nags, seated in a stately Palfrey saddle, carried on their lovely fists <hi>Miniardly begloved</hi> every one of them, either a Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawk, or a Laneret, or a Marlin, and the young Gallants carried the other kinds of
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:46180:216"/>
Haws. So nobly were they taught, that there was neither he nor she amongst them, but could read, write, sing, play upon several musical Instruments, speak five or six several Languages, and compose in them all very quaintly, both in Verse and Prose. Never were seen so valiant <hi>Knights,</hi> so noble and worthy, so dextrous and skilful both on foot and a horseback, more brisk and lively, more nimble and quick, or better handling all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Weapons then were there. Never were seen <hi>Ladies</hi> so proper and handsom, so miniard and dainty, less froward, or more ready with their hand, and with their needle, in every honest and free Action belonging to that Sex then were there. For this reason when the time came, that any <hi>Man</hi> of the said <hi>Abbey,</hi> either at the request of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, or for some other cause, had a mind to go out of it, he carried along with him one of the <hi>Ladies,</hi> namely her whom he had before that chosen for his <hi>Mistress,</hi> and were married together. And if they had formerly in <hi>Theleme</hi> lived in good Devotion and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, they did continue therein, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease it to a greater height in their state of Matrimony: And did entertain that mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Love till the very last day of their Life, in no less vigour and fervency, then at the very day of their Wedding. Here must I not forget to set down unto you a Riddle, which was found under the Ground, as they
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:46180:216"/>
were laying the foundation of the <hi>Abbey,</hi> ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in copper Plate and it was thus as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>

                  <head>THE Author's Prologue.</head>
                  <p>MOst illustrious and thrice valorous Champions, Gentlemen and others, who willingly apply your Minds to the high flights and harmless sallies of Wit. You have not long ago seen, read and understood the great and inestimable Chronicles of the huge Giant <hi>Gargantua;</hi> and like true <hi>Men of Faith,</hi> have firmly believed all that is contained in them, and have very often past your Time amongst Honourable Ladies and Gentlewomen, telling them fair long Stories when you were out of all other Talk, for which you are worthy of great Praise and sempiternal Memory. And I do heartily wish that every Man would lay aside his own Business, meddle no more with his Profession nor Trade, and throw all Affairs concerning himself behind his Back, to attend this wholly, without distracting or troubling his Mind with any thing else, until he have learned all without Book; that if by chance the Art of Printing should cease, or in case that in time to come all Books should perish, every Man might truly teach them to his Children, and deliver them
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:46180:221"/>
over to his Successors and Survivors from hand to hand, as a religious <hi>Cabal:</hi> for there is in it more Profit, than a Rabble of great pocky Logger-heads are able to discern, who surely understand far less in these little Merriments, than <hi>Raclet</hi> did in the Institutes.</p>
                  <p>I have known great and mighty Lords, and of those not a few, who going a Deer-hunting, or a hawking after wild Ducks, when the Chase had not encountred with the Blinks, that were cast in her way to retard her Course, or that the Hawk did but <hi>plain</hi> and smoothly fly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out moving her Wings, perceiving the Prey by force of flight to have gained <hi>Bounds</hi> of her, have been much chafed and vexed, as you understand well enough; but the Comfort unto which they had Refuge, and that they might not take cold, who was to relate the inestimable Deeds of the said <hi>Gargantua.</hi> There are others in the World, (these are no flimflam Stories) who being much troubled with the Tooth-ache, after they had spent their Goods upon <hi>Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> without receiving at all any ease of their Pain, have found no more ready Remedy than to put the said <hi>Chronicles</hi> betwixt two pieces of Linen Cloth made somewhat hot, and so apply them to the place that smarteth <hi>synapising</hi> them with a little Pouder of <hi>Projection,</hi> otherways called <hi>Doribus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what shall I say of those poor Men that are plagued with the Pox and the Gout? O how often have we seen them, even immediately
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:46180:222"/>
after they were anointed and throughly greased, till their Faces did glister like the Key-hole of a Powdering-Tub, their Teeth dance like the Iacks of a pair of little Organs or Virginals when they are play'd upon, and that they foamed from their very Throats like a Boar, which the Mongrel Mastiff-hounds have driven in, and overthrown amongst the Toils: What did they then? All their Consolation was to have some Page of the said jolly Book read unto them. And we have seen those who have given them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to an <hi>hundred Punchions of old Devils,</hi> in case that they did not feel a manifest Ease and Asswagement of Pain, at the hearing of the said Book read, even when they were kept in a Purgatory of Torment; no more nor less than Women in Travail use to find their Sorrow abated, when the Life of St. <hi>Margarite</hi> is read unto them. Is this nothing? find me a Book in any Language, in any Faculty or Science whatsoever, that hath such Virtues, Properties and Prerogatives, and I will be content to pay you a <hi>Chapine</hi> of Tripes. No, my Masters, no, it is peerless, incomparable, and not to be matched, and this am I resolved for ever to maintain even unto the <hi>Fire exclusivè.</hi> And those that will pertinaciously hold the contrary Opinion, let them be accounted Abusers, Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, Impostors and Seducers of the People. It is very true, that there are found in some noble and famous Books, certain occult and hidden Properties, in the number of which are
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:46180:222"/>
reckoned <hi>Whippot, Orlando furioso, Robert the Devil, Fierabras, William without fear, Huon</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux, Monteville,</hi> and <hi>Mata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brune:</hi> but they are not comparable to that which we speak of: And the World hath well known by infallible Experience, the great Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument and Vtility which it hath received by this <hi>Gargantuine</hi> Chronicle; for the Printers have sold more of them in two Months time, than there will be bought of Bibles in nine Years.</p>
                  <p>I therefore (your humble Slave) being very willing to increase your Solace and Recreations yet a little more, do offer you for a Present, another Book of the same <hi>stamp,</hi> only that it is a little more <hi>reasonable</hi> and worthy of <hi>Credit</hi> than the other was; for think not (unless you wilfully will err against your Knowledg) that I speak of it as the <hi>Jews</hi> do of the Law. I was not born under such a <hi>Planet,</hi> neither did it ever befal me to lie, or affirm a thing for true that was not: I speak of it like a jolly <hi>Onocrotarie,</hi> I should say <hi>Preignotary</hi> of the martyrized Lovers, and <hi>Croquenotarie</hi> of Love: <hi>Quod vidimus, testamur.</hi> It is of the horrible and dreadful Feats and Prowesses of <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel,</hi> whose Menial Servant I have been ever since I was a <hi>Page</hi> till this hour, that by his leave I am permitted to visit my <hi>Cow-Country,</hi> and to know if any of my Kindred there be alive.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:46180:223"/>And therefore to make an end of this <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,</hi> even as I give my self fairly to an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Panniers full of Devils, Body and Soul, Tripes and Guts, in case that I lie so much as one single word in this whole History. In like manner St. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Fire burn you, <hi>Mawmet</hi>'s Disease whirl you, the Squinzy choke you, Botches, Crinckums sink you plumb down to <hi>Pegtrantums,</hi> Plagues of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah,</hi> cram your pocky Arse with Sorrow, Fire, Brimstone, and Pits bottomless swallow you all alive, in case you do not firmly believe all that I shall relate unto you in this present <hi>Chronicle.</hi>

their Teeth had been pretty long if they could have reached thither.</p>
                     <p>However account you it for a Truth, that every body did then most heartily eat of these <hi>Medlars,</hi> for they were fair to the Eye, and in Taste delicious. But even as <hi>Noah</hi> that holy Man (to whom we are so much behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, bound and obliged, for that he planted to us the Vine, from whence we have that nectarian, delicious, precious, heavenly, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and deifick Liquor, which they call the <hi>Piot,</hi> or <hi>Tiplage</hi>) was deceived in the drinking of it, for he was ignorant of the great Virtue and Power thereof: So likewise the Men and Women of that time did delight much in the eating of that fair great Fruit, but divers and very different Accidents did ensue thereupon; for there fell upon them all in their Bodies a most terrible <hi>Swelling,</hi> but not upon all in the same place; for some were <hi>swollen</hi> in the Belly, and their Belly strouted out big like a great Tun; of whom it is written, <hi>Ventrem Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentem</hi>; who were all very honest Men, and merry Blades: and of this Race came St. <hi>Fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulch</hi> and <hi>Shrovetuesday.</hi> Others did <hi>swell</hi> at the Shoulders, who in that place were so crump and knobby, that they were therefore called <hi>Montifers,</hi> (which is as much as to say <hi>Hill-carriers</hi>) of whom you see some yet in the World of divers Sexes and Degrees. Of this Race came <hi>Aesop,</hi> some of whose excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Words and Deeds you have in Writing,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46180:225"/>
Some other <hi>Puffes</hi> did <hi>swell</hi> in length by the <hi>Member,</hi> which they call the <hi>Labourer</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> in such sort that it grew marvellous long, plump, jolly, lusty, stirring and Crest-risen in the Antick fashion; so that they made use of it as of a Girdle, winding it five or six times about their Waste: But if it happened the foresaid <hi>Member</hi> to be in good case, spooming with a full Sail, bunt fair before the Wind, then to have seen those strouting Champions, you would have taken them for Men that had their Lances setled on their Rest, to run at the Ring, or tilting <hi>Whintam.</hi> Of these believe me the Race is utterly lost and quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, as the Women say; for they do lament continually, that there are none extant now of those <hi>long, plump,</hi> &amp;c. you know the rest of the Song. Others did grow in matter of Ballocks so enormously, that three of them would fill a Sack; from them are descended the Ballocks of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> which never dwell in Codpieces, but fall down to the bottom of the Breeches. Others grew in the <hi>Hams,</hi> and to see them, you would have said they had been Cranes, or <hi>Flamans,</hi> or else Men walking upon Stilts; the little School-boys called these <hi>Iambicks.</hi> In others, their Nose did grow so, that it seemed to be the Beak of a <hi>Limbeck,</hi> in every part thereof most variously diapred with the twinkling Sparkles of Crimson-blisters bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding forth, and purpled with Pimples all enamaled with thick-set Wheals of a sanguine
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46180:225"/>
Colour, bordered with <hi>Queules</hi>; and such have you seen the Prebend <hi>Panzoul,</hi> and <hi>Woodenfoot</hi> the Physician of <hi>Angiers:</hi> of which Race there were few that liked the <hi>Ptisane,</hi> but all of them were perfect lovers of the pure <hi>sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tembral Iuice. Naso</hi> and <hi>Ovid</hi> had their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction from thence, and all those of whom it is written, <hi>Ne reminiscaris.</hi> Others grew in <hi>Ears,</hi> which they had so big, that out of one would have been stuff enough got to make a Doublet, a pair of Breeches and a Jacket, whilst with the other they might have covered themselves as with a <hi>Spanish</hi> Cloak: and they say, that in <hi>Bourbonois</hi> this Race remaineth yet: And from thence they are called the <hi>Ears</hi> of <hi>Burbon.</hi> Others grew in length of Body, and of those came the <hi>Giants,</hi> and of them <hi>Pantagruel.</hi>

                     <p>I know that reading this Passage, you will make a doubt within your selves, and that grounded upon very good Reason, which is this, How is it possible that this Relation can be true, seeing at the time of the Flood all the World was destroyed except <hi>Noah,</hi> and seven Persons more with him in the Ark, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whose number <hi>Hurtali</hi> is not admitted: Doubtless the Demand is well made, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry apparent; but the Answer shall satisfy you, or my Wit is not rightly caulked: and because I was not at that time to tell you any thing of my own fancy, I will bring unto you the Authority of the <hi>Masorets,</hi> good honest Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, true <hi>Ballockeering</hi> Blades, and exact <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braical</hi> Bagpipers, who affirm that verily the said <hi>Hurtali</hi> was not within the Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> (neither could he get in, for he was too big) but he sat astride upon it, with one Leg on the one side, and another on the other, as little Children used to do upon their wooden Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; or as the great Bull of <hi>Berne,</hi> which was
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46180:227"/>
killed at <hi>Marinian,</hi> did ride for his Hackney the great Murdering-Piece, a pretty Beast of a fair and pleasant Amble without all question.</p>
                     <p>In that posture he, after God, saved the said Ark from danger, for with his Legs he gave it the Brangle that was needful, and with his Foot turned it whither he pleased, as a Ship answereth her Rudder. Those that were within sent him up Victuals in abundance by a Chimney, as People very thankfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the Good that he did them: And sometimes they did talk together, as <hi>Varomenippus</hi> did to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> according to the report of <hi>Lucian.</hi> Have you understood all this well?

In respect of Men, there was the Pity, you should have seen them lay out their Tongues like Hares that have been run six Hours; many did throw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into the Wells; others entred within a Cow's Belly to be in the Shade; those <hi>Homer</hi> calls <hi>Alibants:</hi> all the Country was at a stand, and nothing could be done; it was a most

lamentable case to have seen the Labour of Mortals in defending themselves from the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency of this horrifick Drought; for they had work enough to do to save the <hi>holy Water</hi> in the Churches from being wasted: but there was such order taken by the Counsel of my Lords the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> and of our <hi>Holy Father,</hi> that none did dare to take above one lick; yet when any one came into the Church, you should have seen above twenty poor thirsty Fellows hang upon him that was the Distributer of the <hi>Water,</hi> and that with a wide open Throat, gaping for some little drop (like the rich Glutton in St. <hi>Luke</hi>) that might fall by, lest any thing should be lost. O <hi>how happy</hi> was he in that Year who had a <hi>cool Cellar</hi> under ground, well plenished with fresh Wine!</p>
                     <p>The Philosopher reports in moving the Question, Wherefore is it that the Sea-Water is salt? That at the time when <hi>Phoebus</hi> gave the Government of his resplendent Chariot to his Son <hi>Phaeton,</hi> the said <hi>Phaeton,</hi> unskilful in the Art, and not knowing how to keep the <hi>Ecliptick</hi>-Line betwixt the two <hi>Tropicks</hi> of the <hi>Latitude</hi> of the Sun's Course, strayed out of his way, and came so near the Earth, that he dried up all the Countries that were under it, burning a great part of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which the <hi>Philosophers</hi> call <hi>Via lactea,</hi> and the <hi>Huffsnuffs,</hi> St. <hi>Iames</hi> his way; altho the most lofty and high-crested Poets affirm

that to be the place where <hi>Iuno</hi>'s Milk fell when she gave Suck to <hi>Hercules.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Earth at that time was so excessively heated, that it fell into an enormous Sweat, yea such an one that made it <hi>sweat</hi> out the <hi>Sea,</hi> which is therefore <hi>salt,</hi> because all <hi>Sweat</hi> is <hi>salt</hi>; and this you cannot but confess to be true, if you will taste of your own, or of those that have the Pox when they are put into a <hi>sweating,</hi> it is all one to me. Just such another case fell out this same Year; for on a certain <hi>Friday,</hi> when the whole People were bent upon their Devotions, and had made goodly <hi>Processions,</hi> with store of <hi>Letanies,</hi> and fair <hi>Preachings,</hi> and Beseechings of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty to look down with his Eye of Mercy upon their miserable and disconsolate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, there was even then visibly seen issue out of the Ground great drops of Water, such as fall from a Man in a top <hi>Sweat</hi>; and the poor <hi>Hoydons</hi> began to rejoice, as if it had been a thing very profitable unto them; for some said that there was not one drop of Moisture in the Air, whence they might have any Rain, and that the Earth did supply the default of that. Other learned Men said, that it was a Shower of the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> as <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi> saith in his fourth Book <hi>Quaestionum Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalium,</hi> speaking of the Source and Spring of <hi>Nilus</hi>; but they were deceived; for the Procession being ended, when every one went about to gather of this Dew, and to drink
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46180:229"/>
of it with full Bowls, they found that it was nothing but <hi>Pickle,</hi> and the very <hi>Brine</hi> of Salt, more brackish in Taste than the saltest Water of the Sea: and because in that very Day <hi>Pantagruel</hi> was born, his Father gave him that Name; for <hi>Panta</hi> in <hi>Greek</hi> is as much as to say <hi>all,</hi> and <hi>Gruel</hi> in the <hi>Hagarene</hi> Language doth signify <hi>thirsty</hi>; inferring here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that <hi>at his Birth the whole World was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry and thirsty</hi>; as likewise foreseeing that he would be some day Supream Lord and Soveraign of the <hi>thirsty Companions,</hi> which was shewn to him at that very same hour by a more evident sign; for when his Mother <hi>Badebec</hi> was in the bringing of him forth, and that the Midwives did wait to receive him, there came first out of her Belly three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score and eight <hi>Salt-sellers,</hi> every one of them leading in a Halter a <hi>Mule</hi> heavy loaded with <hi>Salt</hi>; after whom issued forth nine <hi>Dromeda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> with great Loads of Gammons of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, and dried Neats-Tongues on their Backs; then followed seven <hi>Camels</hi> loaded with Links and Chitterlins, Hogs-puddings and Sassages; after them came out five great <hi>Wains</hi> full of Leeks, Garlick, Onions and Chibols, drawn with five and thirty strong Cart-horses, which was six for every one, besides the <hi>Thiller.</hi> At the sight hereof the Midwives were much amazed; yet some of them said, Lo, here is good Provision, and indeed we need it, for we drink but lazily, as if our Tongues walked
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46180:230"/>
on Crutches: truly this is a good sign there is nothing here but what is fit for us, these are the <hi>Spurs of Wine that set it a going.</hi> As they were tatling thus together after their own man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Chat, behold, out comes <hi>Pantagruel</hi> all hairy like a Bear; whereupon one of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired with a Prophetical Spirit, said, <hi>This will be a terrible Fellow, he is born with all his Hair, he is undoubtedly to do wonderful things; and if he live, he will be of Age.</hi>

                     <p>WHen <hi>Pantagruel</hi> was born, there was none more astonished and perplexed than was his Father <hi>Gargantua</hi>; for on the one side seeing his Wife <hi>Badebec</hi> dead, and on the other side his Son <hi>Pantagruel</hi> born, so fair and so goodly, <hi>he knew not what to say nor what to do</hi>; and the Doubt that troubled his Brain, was to know whether he should <hi>cry</hi> for the Death of his Wife, or <hi>laugh</hi> for the Joy of his Son: he was <hi>hinc inde</hi> choaked with Sophistical Arguments, for he framed them very well <hi>in modo &amp; figura,</hi> but he could not resolve them, remaining pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered and entangled by this means, like a <hi>Mouse</hi> catch'd in a Trap, or <hi>Kite</hi> snar'd in a Gin. Shall I weep? (said he) Yes, for why? my so good
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:46180:230"/>
                        <hi>Wife</hi> is dead, who was the most <hi>this,</hi> the most <hi>that,</hi> that ever was in the World: Never shall I see her, never shall I recover such another; it is unto me an inestimable Loss! O my good God, what had I done that thou shouldst thus punish me? Why didst thou not take me away before her? seeing for me to live without her, is but to languish. Ah, <hi>Badebec, Badebec,</hi> my Minion, my dear Heart, my Pigsney, my Duck, my Honey, my little C— (yet it hath in Circumference full six Acres, three Rods, five Poles, four Yards, two Feet, one Inch and a half of good Woodland Measure) my ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Peggy, my Codpiece-Darling, my bob and hit, my Slipshoe-Lovy, never shall I see thee! Ah, poor <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> thou hast lost thy good Mother, thy sweet Nurse, thy well-beloved Lady! O false Death, how injurious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spightful hast thou been to me? How mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and outragious have I found thee, in taking her from me, my well-beloved Wife, who should of right have been immortal?</p>
                     <p>With these words he did cry like a Cow, but on a sudden fell a laughing like a Calf, when <hi>Pantagruel</hi> came into his Mind. Ha, my lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Son (said he) my Childilolly, Fedlifondy, Dandlichucky, my Ballocky, my pretty Rogue; O how jolly thou art, and how much am I bound to my gracious God, that hath been pleased to bestow on me a Son so fair, so sprite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, so lively, so smiling, so pleasant, and so gentle. <hi>Ho, ho, ho, ho,</hi> how glad I am? Let

us drink, <hi>ho,</hi> and put away Melancholy; bring of the best, rinse the Glasses, lay the Cloth, drive out these Dogs, blow this Fire, light Candles, shut that Door there, cut this Bread in sippets for Brewis, send away these poor Folks, give them what they ask; hold my Gown, I will strip my self into my Doublet, (<hi>én cuerpo</hi>) to make the Gossips merry, and keep them company.</p>
                     <p>As he spake this, he heard the <hi>Letanies</hi> and the <hi>Memento's</hi> of the Priests that carried his Wife to be buried, which dash'd all his Merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment agen, and was suddenly ravished ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, saying, Lord God, must I again <hi>contrist</hi> my self? this grieves me, I am no longer young, I grow old, the Weather is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, I am sick, I faint away; by the Faith of a Gentleman, it were better to <hi>cry</hi> less, and <hi>drink</hi> more.</p>
                     <p>My Wife is dead, well, by G— (<hi>da juran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di</hi>) I shall not raise her again by my crying: she is well, she is in Paradise at least, if she be no higher: she prayeth to God for us, she is happy, she is above the sense of our Miseries, nor can our Calamities reach her: What tho she be dead, must not we also die? the same Debt which she hath paid, hangs over our Heads; Nature will require it of us, and we must all of us some day taste of the same sauce: let her pass then, and the Lord pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Survivors, for I must now cast about how to get another Wife. But I will tell you

what you shall do, said he to the Midwives, (where be they, good Folks, I cannot see them) go you to my Wife's Interment, and I will the while <hi>rock</hi> my Son; for I find my self strangely altered, and in danger of falling sick: but drink one good Draught first, you will be the better for it; believe me upon my Honour.

That which <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> did was nothing, when in his Cradle he slew two Serpents; for those Serpents were but little and weak: but <hi>Pantagruel</hi> being ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I pass by here the Relation of how at every one of his Meals he supped up the Milk of four thousand and six hundred Cows; and how to make him a Skellet to boil his Milk in, there were set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work all the Brasiers of <hi>Somure</hi> in <hi>Anjoy,</hi> of <hi>Villedieu</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and of <hi>Bramont</hi> in <hi>Lorrain:</hi> and they served in this Whitepot-meat to him in a huge great Bell, which is yet to be seen in the City of <hi>Bourge</hi> in <hi>Berry,</hi> near the Palace: but his Teeth were already so well grown, and so strengthned in Vigor, that of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:46180:232"/>
the said Bell he bit off a great Morsel, as very plainly doth appear till this hour.</p>
                     <p>One Day in the Morning when they would have made him suck one of his Cows (for he never had any other Nurse, as the History tells us) he got one of his Arms loose from the swadling Bands, wherewith he was kept fast in the Cradle, laid hold on the said Cow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the left fore-Ham, and grasping her to him, ate up her Udder and half her Paunch, with the Liver and the Kidnies, and had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured all up if she had not cried out most hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly, as if the Wolves had held her by the Legs: at which Noise Company came in and took away the said Cow from <hi>Pantagruel</hi>; yet could they not so well do it, but that the Quarter whereby he caught her was left in his Hand, of which Quarter he gulp'd up the Flesh in a trice, even with as much ease as you would eat a Sassage; and that so greedily with desire of more, that when they would have taken away the Bone from him, he swallowed it down whole, as a Cormorant would do a little Fish; and afterwards began fumblingly to say, <hi>Good, good, good,</hi> for he could not yet speak plain, giving them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand thereby, that he had found it very good, and that he did lack but so much more; which when they saw that attended him, they bound him with great Cable-Ropes, like those that are made at <hi>Tain</hi> for the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of Salt to <hi>Lyons</hi>; or such as those are

whereby the great <hi>French</hi> Ship rides at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor in the Road of <hi>New-haven</hi> in <hi>Normandy.</hi> But on a certain time, a great Bear which his Father had bred, got loose, came towards him, began to lick his Face, for his Nurses had not throughly wiped his Chaps; at which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected approach, being on a sudden offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he as lightly rid himself of those great Cables, as <hi>Samson</hi> did of the Hauser Ropes wherewith the <hi>Philistines</hi> had tied him, and by your leave, takes up <hi>Monsieur</hi> the Bear, and tears him to you in pieces like a Pullet, which served him for a Gorge-full, or good warm Bit for that Meal.</p>
                     <p>Whereupon <hi>Gargantua</hi> fearing lest the Child should hurt himself, caused four great Chains of Iron to be made to bind him, and so many strong Wooden Arches unto his Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, most firmly stocked and mortaised in huge Frames: Of those Chains you have one at <hi>Rochel,</hi> which they drew up at Night betwixt the two great Towers of the Haven. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is at <hi>Lyons</hi>; a third at <hi>Angiers</hi>; and the fourth was carried way by the Devils to bind <hi>Lucifer,</hi> who broke his Chains in those days, by reason of a Cholick that did extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily torment him, taken with eating a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant's Soul <hi>en Fricasseé,</hi> for his Breakfast: And therefore you may believe that which <hi>Nicolas de Lyra</hi> saith upon that place of the <hi>Psalter,</hi> where it is written, <hi>Et Og Regem Basan</hi>; that the said <hi>Og</hi> being yet little, was
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46180:233"/>
so strong and robustious, that they were fain to bind him with Chains of Iron in his Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. Thus continued <hi>Pantagruel</hi> for a while very calm and quiet, for he was not able so easily to break those Chains, especially having no room in the Cradle to give a swing with his Arms. But see what happened; Once upon a great Holiday, that his Father <hi>Gargantua</hi> made a sumptuous Banquet to all the Princes of his Court: I am apt to believe, that the Menial Officers of the House were so imbusied in waiting each on his proper Service at the Feast, that no body took care of poor <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel,</hi> who was left <hi>a reculorum,</hi> behind-hand all alone, and as forsaken. What did he? Heark what he did, good People; he strove and essayed to break the Chains of the Cradle with his Arms, but could not, for they were too strong for him; then did he keep with his Feet such a stamping Stir, and so long, that at last he beat out the lower end of his Cradle, which notwithstanding was made of a great Post five Foot in square; and as soon as he had gotten out his Feet, he slid down as well as he could, till he had got his Soles to the Ground; and then with a mighty force he rose up, carrying his Cradle upon his Back, bound to him like a Tortoise that crawls up against a Wall; and to have seen him, you would have thought it had been a great <hi>Carrick</hi> of five hundred Tun upon one end. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he entred into the great Hall, where they
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:46180:234"/>
were banqueting, and that very boldly, which did much afright the Company; yet because his Arms were tied in, he could not reach any thing to eat, but with great Pain stopped now and then a little, to take with the whole flat of his Tongue some Lick, good Bit or Morsel.</p>
                     <p>Which when his Father saw, he knew well enough that they had left him without giving him any thing to eat, and therefore command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he should be loosed from the said Chains, by the Counsel of the Princes and Lords there present: Besides that, also the Physicians of <hi>Gargantua</hi> said, that if they did thus keep him in the Cradle, he would be all his Life-time subject to the Stone. When he was unchain'd, they made him to sit down, where after he had fed very well, he took his Cradle and broke it into more than five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand pieces with one Blow of his Fist that he struck in the midst of it, swearing that he would never come into it again.</p>

Father to rejoice by a natural Affection; therefore caused he to be made for him, whilst he was yet little, a pretty Cross-bow, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to shoot at small Birds, which now they call the great Cross-bow at <hi>Chantelle.</hi> Then he sent him to the School to learn, and to spend his Youth in Vertue: in the Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of which Design he came first to <hi>Poictiers,</hi> where, as he studied and profited very much, he saw that the Scholars were oftentimes idle, and knew not how to bestow their Time, which moved him to take such Compassion on them, that one day he took from a long Ledg of Rocks (called there <hi>Passelourdin</hi>) a huge great Stone, of about twelve Fathom square, and fourteen Handfuls thick, and with great Ease set it upon four Pillars in the midst of a Field to no other end, but that the said Scholars when they had nothing else to do, might pass their time in getting up on that Stone, and feast it with store of Gammons, Pasties and Flaggons, and carve their Names upon it with a Knife; in token of which Deed, till this hour the Stone is called the <hi>lifted Stone:</hi> and in remembrance hereof there is none entered into the Register and <hi>Matricular</hi> Book of the said University, or accounted capable of taking any Degree therein, till he have first drunk in the <hi>Caballine</hi> Fountain of <hi>Croustelles,</hi> passed at <hi>Passelourdin,</hi> and got up upon the <hi>lifted Stone.</hi>

                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:46180:235"/>Afterwards reading the delectable Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of his Ancestors, he found that <hi>Iafrey</hi> of <hi>Lusinian,</hi> called <hi>Iafrey</hi> with the <hi>great Tooth,</hi> Grandfather to the Cousin-in-Law of the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest Sister of the Aunt of the Son-in-Law of the Unkle of the good Daughter of his Step-mother, was interred at <hi>Maillezais</hi>; therefore he took a <hi>Play-day</hi> to pay his Respects to him in a Visit; and going from <hi>Poictiers</hi> with some of his Companions, they passed by the <hi>Guge,</hi> visiting the noble Abbot <hi>Ardillon:</hi> then by <hi>Lusinian,</hi> by <hi>Sansay,</hi> by <hi>Celles,</hi> by <hi>Coalonges,</hi> by <hi>Fontenay</hi> the <hi>Conte,</hi> saluting the learned <hi>Tiraquean,</hi> and from thence arrived at <hi>Mail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lezais,</hi> where he went to see the Sepulchre of the said <hi>Iafrey</hi> with the <hi>great Tooth,</hi> which made him somewhat afraid, looking upon the Portraiture, representing a Man in an extream Fury, drawing his great <hi>Malchus</hi> Faulchion half way out of his Scabbard. When the reason hereof was demanded, the Chanons of the said Place told him that there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cause of it, but that <hi>Pictoribus atque Poetis,</hi> &amp;c. that is to say, that Painters and Poets have liberty to paint and devise what they list after their own Fancy: but he was not satisfied with their Answer, and said, He is not thus painted without a cause; and I suspect that at his Death there was some Wrong done him, whereof he requireth his Kindred to take Revenge; I will enquire further into it, and then do what shall be reasonable: then
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:46180:235"/>
he returned not to <hi>Poictiers,</hi> but would take a view of the other Universities of <hi>France</hi>; therefore going to <hi>Rochel,</hi> he took Shipping and arrived at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> where he found no great Diversion, only now and then he would see some Mariners and Lightermen a wrestling on the Key or Strand by the River side. From thence he came to <hi>Tholouse,</hi> where he learned to <hi>dance</hi> very well, and to <hi>play</hi> with the <hi>two-handed Sword,</hi> as the fashion of the Scholars of the said University is. But he staid not long there, when he saw that they did cause burn their <hi>Regents</hi> alive, like <hi>Red-herring,</hi> saying, Now God forbid that I should die this Death, for I am by Nature sufficienly <hi>dry</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, without being <hi>heated</hi> any further.</p>
                     <p>He went then to <hi>Monpellier,</hi> where he met with the good Wives of <hi>Mirevaux,</hi> and good jovial Company withal, and thought to have set himself to the study of <hi>Physick</hi>; but he considered that that Calling was too troublesome and melancholy, and that <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians</hi> did smell of <hi>Glisters</hi> like old Devils: therefore he resolved he would study the <hi>Laws</hi>; but seeing that there were but three scauld, and one bald-pated <hi>Legist</hi> in that place, he departed from thence, and in his way made the Bridg of <hi>Gard,</hi> and the <hi>Amphitheater</hi> of <hi>Neems</hi> in less than three hours, which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless seems to be more than mortal Man could do. After that he came to <hi>Avignon,</hi> where he was not above three days before he fell in

                        <hi>love</hi>; for the <hi>Women</hi> there take great delight in playing at the close Buttock-Game, because it is <hi>Papal Ground</hi>; which his Tutor <hi>Episte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> perceiving, he drew him out of that place and brought him to <hi>Valence</hi> in the <hi>Dauphinee,</hi> where he saw no great matter of Recreation, only that the <hi>Lubbards</hi> of the Town did beat the <hi>Scholars</hi>; which so incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him with Anger, that when upon a certain very fair Sunday, the People being at their publick dancing in the Streets, and one of the <hi>Scholars</hi> offering to put himself into the Ring, the Bumkins would not let him: whereupon <hi>Pantagruel</hi> taking the Scholar's part, so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laboured them with Blows, and laid such load upon them that he drove them all before him, even to the Brink of the River <hi>Rhosne,</hi> and would have there drowned them, but that they did squat to the Ground, and there lay close a full half League under the River. The Hole is to be seen there yet.</p>
                     <p>After that he departed from thence, and in three Strides and one Leap came to <hi>Angiers,</hi> where he found himself very well, and would have continued there some space, but that the Plague drove them away. So from thence he came to <hi>Bourges,</hi> where he studied a good long time, and profited very much in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the <hi>Laws</hi>; and would sometimes say, that <hi>Law-Books</hi> were like a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful rich Cloth of Gold, edg'd with Fur; for in the World are no goodlier Books to be
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:46180:236"/>
seen, more ornate, nor more eloquent than the <hi>Texts</hi> of the <hi>Pandects</hi>; but the <hi>bordering</hi> of them, that is to say, the <hi>Gloss</hi> of <hi>Accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi> is so vile, mean and scandalous, that it is nothing but Dirt and Excrement.</p>
                     <p>Going from <hi>Bourges,</hi> he came to <hi>Orleans,</hi> where he found store of sparkish <hi>Scholars</hi> that made him great Entertainment at his coming, and with whom he learned to play at <hi>Tennis</hi> so well, that he was a Master at that Game: for the Students there are excellent at it. And sometimes they carried him unto <hi>Cupid</hi>'s Gardens, there to recreate his Person at the <hi>Poussevant,</hi> or <hi>In</hi> and <hi>In.</hi> As for breaking his Head with over-much study, he had an especial care not to do it in any case for <hi>fear of spoiling his Eyes</hi>; which he the rather ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, for that one of the <hi>Regents</hi> there had often in his <hi>Lectures</hi> maintain'd, that <hi>nothing could be so hurtful to the sight, as to have sore Eyes.</hi> So one day, when a <hi>Scholar</hi> of his Acquaintance (who had of Learning not much more than his Brethren, tho instead of that he could <hi>dance</hi> very well, and play at <hi>Tennis</hi>) was made a <hi>Licentiate</hi> in Law, he blazon'd the <hi>Licentiates</hi> of that University in this manner.</p>

                     <p>AFter that <hi>Pantagruel</hi> had studied very well at <hi>Orleans,</hi> he resolved to see the great University of <hi>Paris</hi>; but before his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, he was informed that there was a huge big Bell at St. <hi>Anian,</hi> in the said Town of <hi>Orleans,</hi> under the Ground, which had been there above two hundred and fourteen Years; for it was so great that they could not by any device get it so much as above the Ground, although they used all the means that are found in <hi>Vitruvius de Architectura, Albertus de re aedificatoria, Euclid, Theon, Archimedes,</hi> and <hi>Hero de ingeniis:</hi> for all that was to no purpose. Wherefore condescending heartily to the humble Request of the Citizens and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the said Town, he determined to remove it to the Tower that was erected for it. With that he came to the Place where it was, and lifted it out of the Ground with his little Finger, as easily as you would have done a Hawk's Bell: But before he would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it to the foresaid Tower, he would needs make some Musick with it about the Town, and ring it alongst all the Streets, as he carried it in his Hand; wherewith all the People were
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:46180:239"/>
very glad: but there happened one great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency; for with carrying it so, and ringing it about the Streets, all the good <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi> Wine <hi>turned</hi> instantly, and was spoiled; which no Body there did perceive till the Night following: for every Man found himself so a dry with drinking these <hi>flat</hi> Wines, that they did nothing but spit, and that as white as <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi> Cotton, saying, We have got the <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel,</hi> and our very <hi>Throats are salted.</hi>

leave off their continual Transmutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; seeing the so much desired Peace shall be attained unto and enjoyed, and that all things shall be brought to their End and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod. And therefore not without just and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable cause do I give thanks to God my Saviour and Preserver, for that he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled me to see my bald old Age reflourish in thy Youth: for when at his good Pleasure, who rules and governs all things, my Soul shall leave this mortal Habitation; I shall not account my self wholly to die, but to pass from one place unto another: Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that in and by that, I continue in my visible Image living in the World, visiting and conversing with People of Honour, and other my good Friends, as I was wont to do. Which Conversation of mine, although it was not without Sin, (because we are all of us Trespassers, and therefore ought continually to beseech his Divine Majesty, to blot our Transgressions out of his Memory) yet was it by the Help and Grace of God, without all manner of reproach before Men.</q>

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:46180:244"/>
is the Body, would abide in thee: and the best, to wit, that which is the Soul, and by which our Name continues blessed amongst Men, would be degenerate and abastardized. This I do not speak out of any distrust that I have of thy Vertue, which I have heretofore already tried, but to encourage thee yet more earnestly to proceed from good to better. And that which I now write unto thee, is not so much that thou shouldest live in this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Course, as that thou shouldest rejoice in so living and having lived, and cheer up thy self with the like Resolution in time to come. To the Prosecution and Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which Enterprise and generous Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, thou mayest easily remember how that I have spared nothing, but have so help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee, as if I had had no other Treasure in this World, but to see thee once in my Life compleatly well bred and accomplished, as well in Vertue, Honesty and Valour, as in all liberal Knowledg and Civility: and so to leave thee after my Death, as a Mirror, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting the Person of me thy Father; and if not so excellent, and such <hi>indeed</hi> as I do wish thee, yet such in <hi>Desire.</hi>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:46180:245"/>
thou mayest well understand, the time then was not so proper and fit for Learning as it is at present, neither had I plenty of such good Masters as thou hast had: for that time was darksom, obscured with Clouds of Ignorance, and savouring a little of the Infelicity and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity of the <hi>Gothes,</hi> who had, where-ever they set footing, destroyed all good Literature, which in my Age hath by the Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness been restored unto its former Light and Dignity, and that with such Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Increase of Knowledg, that now hardly should I be admitted unto the first Form of the little Grammar School-Boys: I say, I, who in my youthful days was (and that justly) reputed the most Learned of that Age. Which I do not speak in vain-boasting, although I might lawfully do it in writing unto thee, by the Authority of <hi>Marcus Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> in his Book of <hi>Old Age,</hi> and the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in the Book, intituled, <hi>How a Man may praise himself without Envy</hi>: but to give thee an emulous Encouragement to strive yet further.</q>

                              <q>What shall I say? The very Women and Children have aspired to this Praise and Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial <hi>Manna</hi> of good Learning: Yet so it is, that in the Age I am now of, I have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to learn the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, which I contemned not like <hi>Cato,</hi> but had not the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in my younger Years to attend the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of it. And I take much delight in the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s Morals, the pleasant Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues of <hi>Plato,</hi> the Monuments of <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanias,</hi> and the Antiquities of <hi>Athenaeus,</hi> whilst I wait the Hour wherein God my Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator shall call me, and command me to depart
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:46180:246"/>
from this Earth and transitory Pilgrimage. Wherefore (my Son) I admonish thee, to imploy thy Youth to profit as well as thou canst, both in thy Studies and in Vertue. Thou art at <hi>Paris,</hi> where the laudable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of many brave Men may stir up thy Mind to gallant Actions; and hast like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise for thy Tutor the Learned <hi>Epistemon,</hi> who by his lively and vocal Documents may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct thee in the Arts and Sciences.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <q>I intend, and will have it so, that thou learn the Languages perfectly. First of all, the <hi>Greek,</hi> as <hi>Quintilian</hi> will have it. Secondly, the <hi>Latin</hi>; and then the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> for the Holy Scripture-sake. And then the <hi>Chaldee</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabick</hi> likewise. And that thou frame thy stile in <hi>Greek</hi> in imitation of <hi>Plato</hi>; and for the <hi>Latin,</hi> after <hi>Cicero.</hi> Let there be no History which thou shalt not have ready in thy Memory; and to help thee therein, the Books of <hi>Cosmography</hi> will be very conducible. Of the liberal Arts of <hi>Geometry, Arithmetick</hi> and <hi>Musick,</hi> I gave thee some taste when thou wert yet little, and not above five or six Years old; proceed further in them, and learn the Remainder if thou canst. As for <hi>Astronomy,</hi> study all the Rules thereof; let pass nevertheless the divining and judicial <hi>Astrology,</hi> and the Art of <hi>Lullius,</hi> as being nothing else but plain Cheat and Vanities. As for the <hi>Civil Law,</hi> of that I would have thee to know the <hi>Texts</hi> by heart, and then to confer them with <hi>Philosphy.</hi>

                              <pb n="55" facs="tcp:46180:246"/>
                              <q>Now in matter of the Knowledg of the Works of <hi>Nature,</hi> I would have thee to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that exactly; and that so there be no Sea, River or Fountain, of which thou dost not know the Fishes; all the Fowls of the Air, all the several kinds of Shrubs and Trees, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Forests or Orchards: All the Sorts of Herbs and Flowers that grow upon the Ground: all the various Metals that are hid within the bowels of the Earth: together with all the diversity of precious Stones, that are to be seen in the <hi>Orient</hi> and South-parts of the World; let nothing of all these be hidden from thee. Then fail not most carefully to peruse the Books of the <hi>Greek, Arabian</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Physicians; not despising the <hi>Talmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dists</hi> and <hi>Cabalists</hi>; and by frequent Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomies get thee the perfect Knowledg of the <hi>Microcosm,</hi> which is Man. And at some Hours of the Day, apply thy Mind to the Study of the Holy Scriptures: first in <hi>Greek,</hi> the New-Testament with the Epistles of the Apostles; and then the Old-Testament in <hi>Hebrew.</hi> In brief, Let me see thee an <hi>Abyss,</hi> and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomless-Pit of Knowledg: for from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward, as thou growest great and becomest a Man, thou must part from this Tranquillity and Rest of Study: thou must learn <hi>Chival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Warfare,</hi> and the Exercises of the Field, the better thereby to defend my House and our Friends, and to succour and protect them at all their Needs against the Invasion and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults of Evil-doers.</q>

                              <q>Furthermore, I will that very shortly thou try how much thou hast profited, which thou canst not better do than by maintaining pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly <hi>Theses</hi> and Conclusions in all Arts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all Persons whatsoever, and by haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Company of learned Men, both at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> and otherwhere. But because, as the wise Man <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Wisdom entreth not into a malicious Mind</hi>; and that <hi>Science</hi> without <hi>Conscience</hi> is but the <hi>Ruin of the Soul,</hi> it behoveth thee to serve, to love, to fear God, and on him to cast all thy Thoughts and all thy Hope, and by Faith formed in Charity, to cleave unto him, so that thou mayest ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be separated from him by thy Sins. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the Abuses of the World: set not thy Heart upon Vanity; for this Life is transitory, but the Word of the Lord endureth for ever. Be serviceable to all thy Neighbours, and love them as thy self: reverence thy <hi>Praeceptors</hi>; shun the Conversation of those whom thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirest not to resemble, and receive not in vain the Graces which God hath bestowed upon thee. And when thou shalt see that thou hast attained to all the Knowledg that is to be acquired in that part, return unto me, that I may see thee, and give thee my Blessing before I die. <hi>My Son,</hi> the Peace and Grace of our Lord be with thee.</q>

                     <p>ONe Day as <hi>Pantagruel</hi> was taking a Walk without the City, towards St. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Abby, discoursing and philosophating with his own Servants and some other Scholars, met with a young Man of a very comely Stature, and surpassing Handsom in all the Lineaments of his Body, but in several parts thereof most pitifully wounded; in such bad Equipage in matter of his Apparel, which was but Totters and Rags, and every way so far out of order, that he seemed to have been a fighting with Mastiff-dogs, from whose Fury he had made an Escape; or to say better, he looked, in the Condition wherein he then was, like an <hi>Apple-gatherer</hi> of the Country of <hi>Perche.</hi>

Now as he was just amongst them, <hi>Pantagruel</hi> said unto him, Let me intreat you (<hi>Friend</hi>) that you may be pleased to stop here a little, and answer me to that which I shall ask you, and I am confident you will not think your Time ill bestowed: for I have an extream Desire (according to my Ability) to give you some Supply in this Distress where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I see you are; because I do very much commiserate your case, which truly moves me to great pity: Therefore (my <hi>Friend</hi>) tell me, Who you are? whence you come? whither you go? what you desire? and what your Name is? The <hi>Companion</hi> answered him in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Tongue, thus;</p>

Amongst which, it is to be remarked, that the greatest part were resty and head-strong, and in their Opinions obstinate; but he took such course with them, that for all their <hi>Ergoes</hi> and Falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, he put their Backs to the Wall, gravelled them in the deepest Questions, and made it vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly appear to the World, that compared to him, they were but <hi>Monkies,</hi> and a Knot of <hi>muffled Calves.</hi> Whereupon every Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to keep a bustling Noise, and talk of his so marvellous Knowledg, through all degrees of Persons in both Sexes, even to the very Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses, Brokers, Rostmeat-sellers, Penknife-makers and others; who, when he past along in the Street, would say, <hi>This is he</hi>; in which he took delight, as <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Greek</hi> Orators did, when a mumping old Hag, pointing at him with her Fingers, said, <hi>This is the Man.</hi>

                        <pb n="66" facs="tcp:46180:252"/>Now at this same very time there was a Suit in Law, depending in Court between two great Lords, of which one was called my Lord <hi>Kissebreech,</hi> Plaintiff, of one side; and the other my Lord <hi>Suckfist,</hi> Defendant, of the other; whose Controversy was so high and difficult in Law, that the Court of Parliament could make nothing of it. And therefore by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the King, there were assembled four of the greatest, and most learned of all the Parliaments of <hi>France,</hi> together with the great Councel, and all the principal Regents of the Universities, not only of <hi>France,</hi> but of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> also and <hi>Italy,</hi> such as <hi>Iason, Philippus-Decius, Petrus de Petronibus,</hi> and a Rabble of other old <hi>Rabanists.</hi> Who being thus met together, after they had thereupon consulted for the space of six and forty Weeks, finding that they could not <hi>fasten their Teeth</hi> in it, nor with such clearness understand the Case, as that they might in any manner of way be able to right it, or take up the Difference betwixt the two aforesaid Parties, it did so grievously vex them, that they most villanously conshit themselves for shame. In this great Extremity, one amongst them named <hi>Du Douhait,</hi> the learnedst of all, and more expert and prudent than any of the rest, whilst one Day they were thus at their Wits end, all-to-be-dunced and <hi>philogrobolized</hi> in their Brains, said unto them; We have been here (my Masters) good long space without doing any thing else, than trifle
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:46180:252"/>
away both Time and Money, and can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless find neither Brim nor Bottom in this Matter: for the more we study about it, the less we understand therein, which is a great Shame and Disgrace to us, and a heavy Burthern to our Consciences; yea such, that in my Opinion we shall not rid our selves of it without Dishonour, unless we take some other course; for we do nothing but dote in our Consultations.</p>
                     <p>See therefore what I have thought upon: You have heard much talking of that worthy Personage named Master <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> who hath been found to be learned above the Capacity of this present Age, by the Proofs he gave in those great Disputations, which he held pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly against all Men. My Opinion is, that we send for him, to confer with him about this Business; for never any Man will encompass the bringing of it to an end, if he do it not.</p>
                     <p>Hereunto all the Counsellors and Doctors willingly agreed, and according to that their Result, having instantly sent for him, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to be pleased to canvass the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,</hi> and <hi>sift</hi> it throughly; that after a deep Search and narrow Examination of all the Points thereof, he might forthwith make the <hi>Report</hi> unto them, such as he shall think good in true and legal Knowledg. To this effect they delivered into his Hands the <hi>Bags</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were the <hi>Writs</hi> and <hi>Pancarts</hi> concerning that Suit, which for Bulk and Weight were
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:46180:253"/>
almost enough to lade four great stoned Asses. But <hi>Pantagruel</hi> said unto them, Are the two Lords, between whom this Debate and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess is, yet living? it was answered him, Yes: To what a Devil then (said he) serve so many paultry Heaps, and Bundles of Papers and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies which you give me? Is it not better to hear their Controversy from their own Mouths, whilst they are Face to Face before us, than to read these vile Fopperies, which are nothing but Chicaneries, Deceits, diabolical Cozenages of <hi>Cepola,</hi> pernicious Slights, and Subversions of Equity? For I am sure, that you, and all those through whose Hands this <hi>Process</hi> hath past, have by your Devices added what you could to it <hi>pro &amp; contra</hi>; in such sort, that although their Difference perhaps was clear and easy enough to determine at first, you have perplexed and <hi>puzzl'd the Cause,</hi> by the frivolous, sottish, unreasonable, and foolish Reasons and Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Accursius, Baldus, Bartolus, de Castro, de Imola, Hippolytus, Panormo, Bertachin, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander, Curtius,</hi> and those other old <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiffs,</hi> who never understood the least Law of the <hi>Pandects,</hi> they being but meer Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads and great <hi>Tithe-calves,</hi> ignorant of all that which was needful for the understanding of the Laws. For (as it is most certain) they had not the Knowledg either of the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> Tongue, but only of the <hi>Gothick</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian.</hi> The Laws nevertheless were first taken from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> according to the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:46180:253"/>
of <hi>Vlpian. l. poster. de origine juris,</hi> which we likewise may perceive by that all the Laws are full of <hi>Greek</hi> Words and Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And then we find that they are reduced into a <hi>Latin</hi> Stile, the most elegant and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that whole Language is able to afford, without excepting that of any that ever wrote therein; nay, not of <hi>Salust, Varro, Cicero, Seneca, Titus Livius,</hi> nor <hi>Quintilian.</hi> How then could these old Dotards be able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand aright the Text of the Laws, who never in their time had looked upon a good <hi>Latin</hi> Book, as doth evidently enough appear by the Rudeness of their Stile; which is fitter for a Chimney-sweeper, a Cook or a Scullion, than for a <hi>Iurisconsult</hi> and Doctor in the Laws?</p>
                     <p>Furthermore; Seeing the Laws are <hi>excerp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> out of the middle of <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Natural</hi> Philosophy, how should these Fools have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood it, that have by G— studied less in Philosophy than my <hi>Mule?</hi> in respect of Humane Learning, and the Knowledg of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities</hi> and <hi>Histories,</hi> they were truly laden with those Faculties <hi>as a Toad is with Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:</hi> and yet of all this the Laws are so full, that without it they cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood; as I intend more fully to shew unto you in a peculiar Treatise, which on that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose I am about to publish. Therefore if you will that I meddle in this <hi>Process</hi>; First, cause all these Papers to be burnt: Secondly, Make the two Gentlemen come personally before
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:46180:254"/>
me; and afterwards, when I shall have heard them, I will tell you my Opinion freely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Fiction or Dissimulation whatsoever.</p>
                     <p>Some amongst them did contradict this Motion, as you know that in all Companies there are <hi>more Fools than wise Men,</hi> and that the greater part always surmounts the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; as saith <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> in speaking of the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> But the foresaid <hi>Du Douhait</hi> held the contrary Opinion, maintaining that <hi>Pantagruel</hi> had said well, and what was right, in affirming that these Records, Bills of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, Replies, Rejoinders, Exceptions, Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, and other such <hi>Diableries</hi> of Truth-intangling Writs, were but Engines where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to overthrow Justice, and unnecessarily to prolong such Suits as did depend before them; and that therefore the <hi>Devil</hi> would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them all away to Hell, if they did not take another Course, and proceeded not in times coming according to the Prescripts of <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical</hi> and <hi>Philosophical Equity.</hi> In fine, all the Papers were burnt, and the two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men summoned and personally convented. At whose Appearance before the Court, <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel</hi> said unto them, Are you they that have this great Difference betwixt you? Yes, (my Lord) said they. Which of you (said <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) is the Plaintiff? It is I, said my Lord <hi>Kissebreech.</hi> Go too then, my Friend, (said he) and relate your Matter unto me from Point to Point, according to the real Truth, or
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:46180:254"/>
else (by Cocks Body) if I find you to lie so much as in one word, I will make you shorter by the Head, and take it from off your Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to shew others by your Example, that in Justice and Judgment Men ought to speak nothing but the Truth; therefore take heed you do not add nor impair any thing in the Narration of your Case. <hi>Begin.</hi>

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:46180:255"/>
to go a handsel-getting on the first Day of the new Year, at that very time when they give Brewis to the Oxen, and deliver the Key of the Coals to the Country-girls, for serving in of the Oats to the Dogs. All the Night long they did nothing else (keeping their Hands still upon the Pot) but dispatch Bulls a-foot, and Bulls a-horseback, to stop the Boats: for the Tailors and Sales-men would have made of the stollen Shreds a goodly Sagbut to cover the face of the Ocean, which then was great with Child of a Potful of Cabbidge, according to the Opinion of the Hay-bundle-makers: but the Physicians said, that by the Urine they could discern no manifest Sign of the Bustard's Pace, nor how to eat double-tongued Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks with Mustard, unless the Lords and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the Court should be pleased to give by <hi>B. mol</hi> express command to the Pox, not to run about any longer, in gleaning up of Copper-smiths and Tinkers; for the Jober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolls had already a pretty good beginning in their Dance of the British Gig, called the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strindore,</hi> to a perfect <hi>Diapason,</hi> with one Foot in the Fire, and their Head in the middle, as good Man <hi>Ragot</hi> was wont to say.</p>
                     <p>Ha, <hi>(my Masters)</hi> God moderates all things, and disposeth of them at his Pleasure; so that against unlucky Fortune a Carter broke his frisking Whip, which was all the Wind-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument he had: this was done at his return from the little paultry Town, even then when
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:46180:255"/>
Master <hi>Amitus</hi> of <hi>Cresseplots</hi> was licentiated, and had past his Degrees in all Dullery and Blockishness, according to this Sentence of the Canonists, <hi>Beati Dunces, quoniam ipsi stumblaverunt.</hi> But that which makes <hi>Lent</hi> to be so high, by St. <hi>Fiacre</hi> of <hi>Bry,</hi> is for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but that the <hi>Pentecost</hi> never comes but to my cost: yet <hi>on afore there, hoe:</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Rain stills a great Wind; and we must think so, seeing that the Serjeant hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the Matter so far above my reach, that the Clerks and Secondaries could not with the Benefit thereof lick their Fingers feathered with Gaunders, so orbicularly, as they were wont in other things to do. And we do manifestly see, that every one acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth himself to be in the Error, wherewith another hath been charged, reserving only those Cases whereby we are obliged to take an ocular Inspection in a prospective Glass of these things, towards the place in the Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, where hangeth the Sign of the Wine of forty Girths, which have been always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted very necessary for the number of twenty Panels and Pack-saddles of the bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Protectionaries of five Years respit: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, at least he that would not let fly the Fowl before the Cheese-cakes, ought in Law to have discovered his Reason why not; for the <hi>Memory</hi> is often lost <hi>with a wayward Shooing.</hi> Well, God keep <hi>Theobald Mitain</hi> from all danger.

there: Ho, <hi>my Friend,</hi> soft and fair, speak at leisure, and soberly, without putting your self in choler: I understand the Case, go on. Now then, <hi>(my Lord)</hi> said <hi>Kissebreech,</hi> the foresaid good Woman, saying her <hi>gaudez and audinos,</hi> could not cover her self with a treacherous Back-blow, ascending by the Wounds and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the Privileges of the University; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less by the Virtue of a Warming-pan she had angelically fomented every part of her Body, in covering them with a Hedg of Garden-Beds: then giving in a swift unavoidable Thrust very near to the place where they sell the old Rags, whereof the Painters of <hi>Flanders</hi> make great use, when they are about neatly to clap on Shoes on Grashoppers, Locusts, Cigals, and such like Fly-fowls; so strange to us, that I am wonderfully astonished why the World doth not <hi>lay,</hi> seeing it is so good to <hi>hatch.</hi>

                     <p>Here the Lord of <hi>Suckfist</hi> would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted him and spoken somewhat; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Pantagruel</hi> said unto him, <hi>St,</hi> by St. <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>'s Belly, doth it become thee to speak with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Command? I sweat here, and crack my Brain to understand the Proceeding of your mutual Difference, and yet thou comest to trouble and disquiet me.

Go on, (said he to <hi>Kissebreech</hi>) speak calmly, and do not over-heat your self with too much haste.</p>

                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:46180:256"/>I perceiving then (said <hi>Kissebreech</hi>) that the <hi>pragmatical Sanction</hi> did make no mention of it, and that the holy <hi>Pope</hi> to every one gave liberty to <hi>fart</hi> at his own ease, if that the Blankets had no Streaks, wherein the Liars were to be crossed with a Ruffian-like Crew: and the Rain-bow being newly sharpned at <hi>Milan</hi> to bring forth Larks, gave his full consent that the good Woman should tread down the Heel of the Hipgut-pangs, by virtue of a solemn Protestation put in by the little <hi>testiculated</hi> or codsted Fishes; which to tell the truth, were at that time very necessary for understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Syntax</hi> and Construction of old Boots. Therefore <hi>Iohn Calfe,</hi> her Cousin-gervais once removed, with a Log from the Woodstack, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry seriously advised her not to put her self into the hazard of quagswagging in the Lee, to be scoured with a buck of Linen Clothes, till first she had kindled the Paper: this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel she laid hold on, because he desired her to take nothing, and throw out, for <hi>Non de ponte vadit, qui cum sapientia cadit.</hi> Matters thus standing, seeing the Members of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee did not fully agree amongst themselves in casting up the number of the <hi>Almany</hi> Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, whereof were framed those <hi>Spectacles for Princes,</hi> which have been lately printed at <hi>Antwerp.</hi> I must needs think that it makes a bad <hi>return</hi> of the <hi>Writ,</hi> and that the adverse Party is not to be believed, <hi>in sacer verbo dotis.</hi> For that having a great Desire to obey the

Pleasure of the King, I armed my self from Toe to Top with Belly-furniture, of the Soles of good Venison-pasties, to go see how my Grape-gatherers and Vintagers had pinked and cut full of small Holes their high Coped-caps, to lecher it the better, and play at <hi>in and in.</hi> And indeed the time was very dangerous in coming from the Fair, in so far that many <hi>trained Bow-men</hi> were cast at the Muster, and quite rejected, although the Chimney-tops were high enough, according to the proportion of the <hi>Windgalls,</hi> and the <hi>Malaunders Lami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baudichon.</hi> And by this means there was that Year great abundance throughout all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Artois,</hi> of tawny buzzing Beetles, to the no small profit of the Gentlemen-great-stick-faggot-carriers, when they did eat without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining the <hi>Cocklicranes,</hi> till their Belly was like to crack with it again. As for my part, such is my <hi>Christian</hi> Charity towards my Neighbours, that I could wish from my Heart every one had as good a Voice, it would make us play the better at the Tennis and the Baloon. And truly <hi>(my Lord)</hi> to express the real Truth without Dissimulation, I cannot but say, that those petty subtile Devices, which are found out in the etymologizing of Patins, would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend more easily into the River of <hi>Seine,</hi> to serve for ever at the Millers-Bridg, as it was heretofore decreed by the King of the <hi>Canar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> which is to be seen in the Registry and Records within the Clerks Office of this House.</p>

And, <hi>good Lady!</hi> how many great Captains have we seen in the Day of Battel, when in open field the <hi>Sacrament</hi> was distributed in Lunchions of the <hi>sanctified Bread</hi> of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraternity, the more honestly to nod their Heads, play on the Lute, crack with their Tails, and make pretty little platform Leaps? But now the World is unshackled from the Corners of the Packs of <hi>Leicester,</hi> one flies out lewdly and becomes debauch'd; another likewise five, four and two, and that at such random, that if the Court take not some course therein, it will make as bad a Season in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Gleaning this Year, as ever it made, or it will make Goblets. If any poor Creature go to the Stoves to illuminate his Muzzle with a Cow-shard, or to buy Winter-boots, and that the Serjeants passing by, or those of the Watch happen to receive the Decoction of a Clyster, or the fecal Matter of a Close-stool, upon their Rustling-wrangling-clutter-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Masterships, should any because of that

                     <p>Very true it is, that the four Oxen which are in debate, and whereof mention was made, were somewhat short in memory: nevertheless, to understand the <hi>gamme</hi> aright, they feared neither the Cormorant nor Mallard of <hi>Savoy,</hi> which put the good People of my Country in great hope, that their Children sometime should become very skilful in <hi>Algorism</hi>; therefore is it, that by a Law <hi>Rubrick</hi> and special Sentence thereof, that we cannot fail to take the Wolf, if we make our Hedges higher than the Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mill, whereof somewhat was spoken by the Plaintiff.

                     <head>CHAP. XIII. How <hi>Pantagruel</hi> gave Iudgment upon the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the two Lords.</head>
                     <p>THen <hi>Pantagruel</hi> rising up, assembled all the Presidents, Counsellors and Doctors that were there, and said unto them; Come now, (my Masters) you have heard <hi>(vivae vocis oraculo)</hi> the Controversy that is in question, what do you think of it? They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered him, We have indeed heard it, but have not understood the Devil so much as one Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of the Case; and therefore we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you <hi>unâ voce,</hi> and in courtesy request you, that you would give Sentence as you think good; and <hi>ex nunc prout ex tunc,</hi> we are satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with it, and do ratify it with our full Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents. Well, my Masters (said <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) seeing you are so pleased, I will do it: but I do not truly find the Case so difficult as you make it: Your Paragraph <hi>Caton,</hi> the Law <hi>Frater,</hi> the Law <hi>Gallus,</hi> the Law <hi>Quinque pedum,</hi> the Law <hi>Vinum,</hi> the Law <hi>Si Dominus,</hi> the Law <hi>Mater,</hi> the Law <hi>Mulier bona,</hi> the Law <hi>Si quis,</hi> the Law <hi>Pomponius,</hi> the Law <hi>Fundi,</hi> the Law <hi>Emptor,</hi> the Law <hi>Praetor,</hi> the Law <hi>Venditor,</hi> and a great many others are far more intricate in my Opinion. After he had spoke this, he walked a turn or two about the Hall, plodding
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:46180:261"/>
very profoundly as one may think; for he did groan like an Ass, whilst they girth him too hard, with the very Intensiveness of considering how he was bound in Conscience to do right to both Parties, without varying or accepting of Persons. Then he returned, sate down, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to pronounce Sentence as followeth:</p>
                     <p>Having seen, heard, calculated and well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered of the Difference between the Lords of <hi>Kissebreech</hi> and <hi>Suckfist</hi>; the Court saith unto them, that in regard of the sudden Shivering of the Flickermouse, bravely declining from the <hi>estival Solstice,</hi> to attempt by private means the surprizal of toyish Trifles in those, who are a little unwel for having taken a Draught too much, through the lewd Demeanour and Vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Beetles, that inhabit the <hi>Diarodal</hi> Climate of an hypocritical Ape on Horseback, bending a Cross-bow backwards. The Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff truly had just cause to <hi>calfet,</hi> and stop the Chinks of the Gallion, which the good Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man blew up with Wind, having one Foot shod and the other bare, re-imbursing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing to him low and stiff in his Conscience, as many Bladder-nuts and wild <hi>Pistaches</hi> as there is of Hair in eighteen Cows, with as much for the Embroiderer, and so much for that. He is likewise declared innocent of the Case pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileged from the <hi>Knapdardies,</hi> into the danger whereof it was thought he had incurred; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he could not jocundly and with fulness of Freedom untruss and dung, by the decision of

a pair of Gloves perfumed with the Scent of Bum-gunshot, at the Walnut-tree Taper, as is usual in his Country of <hi>Mirobalois.</hi> Slacking therefore the Top-sail, and letting go the Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin with the Brazen-bullets, wherewith the Mariners did by way of Protestation bake in Paste-meat great store of Pulse, interquilted with the Dormouse, whose Hawks Bells were made with a <hi>puntinaria,</hi> after the manner of <hi>Hungary</hi> or <hi>Flanders</hi> Lace, and which his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law carried in a Panier, lying near to <hi>three Chevrons or bordered Gueules,</hi> whilst he was clean out of heart, drooping and crest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen by the too narrow sifting, canvassing, and curious examining of the Matter, in the angu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary Dog-hole of nasty Scoundrels, from whence we shoot at the <hi>vermiformal</hi> Popingay, with the Flap made of a Fox-tail.</p>
                     <p>But in that he chargeth the Defendant, that he was a Botcher, Cheese-eater, and Trimmer of Man's Flesh imbalmed; which in the arsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy swagfal tumble was not found true, as by the <hi>Defendant</hi> was very well discussed.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Court</hi> therefore doth condemn and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce him in three Poringers of Curds, well cemented and closed together, shining like Pearls, and cod-pieced after the Fashion of the Country, to be payed unto the said <hi>Defendant</hi> about the middle of <hi>August</hi> in <hi>May:</hi> but on the other part, the <hi>Defendant</hi> shall be bound to furnish him with Hay and Stubble, for stopping the Caltrops of his Throat, troubled and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulregafized,</hi>

                     </head>
                     <p>THe great Wit and Judgment of <hi>Pantagruel</hi> was immediately after this made known unto all the World, by setting forth his Praises in Print, and putting upon Record this late wonderful Proof he hath given thereof amongst the Rolls of the Crown, and Registers of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, in such sort, that every Body began to say, that <hi>Solomon,</hi> who by a probable Guess only, without any further certainty, caused the Child to be delivered to its own Mother, shewed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in his time such a Master-piece of Wisdom, as the good <hi>Pantagruel</hi> had done: happy are we therefore that have him in our Country. And indeed they would have made him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Master of the Requests, and President in the Court: but he refused all, very graciously thanking them for their Offer; for (said he) there is too much <hi>Slavery</hi> in these <hi>Offices, and very hardly can they be saved that do exercise them, considering the great Corruption that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Men.</hi> Which makes me believe, if the empty Seats of Angels be not fill'd with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of People than those, we shall not have the final Judgment these seven thousand sixty and seven Jubilees yet to come; and so <hi>Cusanus</hi>
                        <pb n="89" facs="tcp:46180:263"/>
will be deceived in his Conjecture. Remember that I have told you of it, and given you fair Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement in time and place convenient.</p>
                     <p>But if you have any Hogsheads of good Wine, I willingly will accept of a Present of that; which they very heartily did do, in sending him of the best that was in the City, and he drank reasonably well. But poor <hi>Panurge</hi> bibbed and bowsed of it most villainously; for he was as dry as a <hi>Red herring,</hi> as lean as a Rake, and like a poor, lank, slender Cat, walked gingerly as if he had trod upon Eggs: so that by some one being admonished, in the midst of his Draught of a large deep Bowl, full of excellent Claret, with these words, <hi>Fair</hi> and <hi>softly Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sip,</hi> you suck up as if you were mad: I give thee to the Devil, (said he) thou hast not found here thy little tipling Sippers of <hi>Paris,</hi> that drink no more than the <hi>Chaffinch,</hi> and never take in their Beak full of Liquor, till they be bobbed on the Tails after the manner of the Sparrows. O Companion, if I could <hi>mount up</hi> as well as I can <hi>get down,</hi> I had been long e're this above the Sphere of the Moon with <hi>Empedocles.</hi> But I cannot tell what a Devil this means. This Wine is so good and delicious, that the more I drink thereof, the more I am a-thirst. I believe that the Shadow of my Master <hi>Pantagruel</hi> maketh Men a-thirsty, as the Moon doth the Catarrs and Defluxions. At which word the Company began to laugh. Which <hi>Pantagruel</hi> perceiving, said, <hi>Panurge,</hi> what is
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:46180:264"/>
that which moves you to laugh so? Sir, said he, I was telling them that these devilish <hi>Turks</hi> are very unhappy, in that they never drink one drop of Wine; and that though there were no other harm in all <hi>Mahomet's Alcoran,</hi> yet for this one base Point of Abstinence from Wine, which therein is commanded, I would not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my self unto their Law. But now tell me (said <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) how you escaped out of their Hands. By G—, Sir, (said <hi>Panurge</hi>) I will not lie to you in one word.</p>
                     <p>The rascally <hi>Turks</hi> had broached me upon a Spit all larded like a Rabbet, (for I was so dry and meagre, that otherwise of my Flesh they would have made but very bad Meat) and in this manner began to rost me alive. As they were thus roasting me, I recommended my self unto the <hi>Divine Grace,</hi> having in my Mind the good St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> and always hoped in God that he would deliver me out of this Torment, which came to pass, and that very strangely: for as I did commit my self with all my Heart unto God, crying, <hi>Lord God help me, Lord God save me, Lord God take me out of this Pain and hellish Torture,</hi> wherein these trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Dogs detain me for my Sincerity in the Maintenance of thy Law; the <hi>Turn-spit</hi> fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep by the Divine Will, or else by the Virtue of some good <hi>Mercury,</hi> who cunningly brought <hi>Argus</hi> into a Sleep for all his hundred Eyes. When I saw that he did no longer turn me in roasting, I looked upon him, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:46180:264"/>
that he was fast asleep, then took I up in my Teeth a Fire-brand by the end where it was not burnt, and cast it into the Lap of my <hi>Roaster</hi>; and another did I throw as well as I could under a Field-bed, that was placed near to the Chimney, wherein was the Straw-bed of my Master <hi>Turn-spit</hi>; presently the Fire took hold in the Straw, and from the Straw to the Bed, and from the Bed to the Loft, which was planked and cieled with Firr, after the fashion of the foot of a Lamp. But the best was, that the Fire which I had cast into the Lap of my paul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try <hi>Roaster,</hi> burnt all his Groin, and was begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to cease upon his <hi>Cullions,</hi> when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came sensible of the danger; for his Smelling was not so bad, but that he felt it sooner than he could have seen Day-light. Then suddenly getting up, and in a great Amazement running to the Window, he cried out to the Streets as high as he could, <hi>Dalbaroth, Dalbaroth, Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baroth</hi>; which is as much to say, <hi>Fire, Fire, Fire:</hi> incontinently turning about, he came streight towards me, to throw me quite into the Fire; and to that effect, had already cut the Ropes, wherewith my Hands were tied, and was undoing the Cords from off my Feet; when the Master of the House hearing him cry, <hi>Fire,</hi> and smelling the Smoke from the very Street where he was walking with some other <hi>Baashaws</hi> and <hi>Mustaphaes,</hi> ran with all the speed he had to save what he could, and to carry away his Jewels. Yet such was his Rage, (before he could well
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:46180:265"/>
resolve how to go about it) that he caught the Broach whereon I was spitted, and therewith killed my <hi>Roaster</hi> stark dead, of which Wound he died there for want of <hi>Government</hi> or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; for he ran him in with the Spit a little above the Navel, towards the right Flank, till he pierced the third Lappet of his Liver, and the Blow flanting upwards from the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragme,</hi> through which it had made <hi>Penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; the Spit past athwart the <hi>Pericardium,</hi> and came out above at his Shoulders, betwixt the <hi>Spondyls</hi> and the left <hi>Homoplat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>True it is, (for I will not lie) that in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spit out of my Body, I fell to the Ground near unto the Andirons, and so by the Fall took some hurt; which indeed had been greater, but that the <hi>Lardons,</hi> or little Slices of Bacon, wherewith I was stuck, kept off the Blow. My <hi>Baashaw</hi> then seeing the Case to be desperate, his House burnt without Remission, and all his Goods lost, gave himself over unto all the Devils in Hell, calling upon some of them by their Names, <hi>Gringoth, Astaroth, Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>lus</hi> and <hi>Gribonillis,</hi> nine several times; which when I saw, I had above six Penny-worth of Fear, dreading that the Devils would come e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven then to carry away this Fool, and seeing me so near him would perhaps snatch me up too. I am ready (thought I) half roasted, and my <hi>Lardons</hi> will be the cause of my Mischief; for these Devils are very lickorous of <hi>Lardons,</hi> according to the Authority which you have of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:46180:265"/>
the Philosopher <hi>Iamblicus</hi> and <hi>Murmault,</hi> in the Apology of <hi>Bossuris,</hi> adulterated <hi>pro magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stros nostros.</hi> But for my better security I made the sign of the Cross, crying, <hi>Hageos, athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos, hotheos,</hi> and none came: At which, my Rogue <hi>Baashaw</hi> being very much aggrieved, would in transpiercing his Heart with my Spit have killed himself; and to that purpose had set it against his Breast, but it could not enter, because it was not sharp enough. Whereupon I perceiving that he was not like to work upon his Body the Effect which he intended, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he did not spare all the Force he had to thrust it forward, came up to him and said, Master <hi>Bugrino,</hi> thou dost here but trifle away thy time, for thou wilt never kill thy self thus as thou doest. Well, thou mayest hurt or bruise somewhat within thee, so as to make thee lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish all thy Life-time most pitifully amongst the Hands of the Chirurgions; but if thou wilt be counselled by me, I will kill thee clear out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, so that thou shalt not so much as feel it; and trust me, for I have killed a great many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who never have complained afterwards. Ha, my Friend, said he, I prethee do so, and for thy pains I will give thee my <hi>Cod-piece</hi>; take, here it is, there are six hundred <hi>Seraphs</hi> in it, and some fine Diamonds, and most excellent Rubies. And where are they, said <hi>Epistemon?</hi> By St. <hi>Iohn</hi> (said <hi>Panurge</hi>) they are a good way hence, if they always keep going: But where is the last Year's Snow? This was the greatest
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:46180:266"/>
care that <hi>Villon</hi> the <hi>Parisian</hi> Poet took. Make an end (said <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) that we may know how thou didst dress thy <hi>Baashaw:</hi> By the Faith of an honest Man (said <hi>Panurge</hi>) I do not lie in one word; I swadled him in a scurvy Swathel-binding, which I found lying there half burnt, and with my Cords tied him Royster-like both Hand and Foot, in such sort that he was not able to winse; then past my Spit through his Throat, and hanged him thereon, fastening the end thereof at two great Hooks or Cramp-irons, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they did hang their Halberds; and then kindling a fair Fire under him, did flame you up my <hi>Milourt,</hi> as they use to do dry Herrings in a Chimney: with this, taking his Budget, and a little Javelin that was upon the foresaid Hooks, I ran away a fair Gallop-rake, and God he knows how I did smell my Shoulder of Mutton.</p>
                     <p>When I was come down into the Street, I found every Body come to put out the Fire with store of Water, and seeing me so half-roasted, they did naturally pity my Case, and threw all their Water upon me, which by a most joyful refreshing of me, did me very much good. Then did they present me with some Victuals, but I could not eat much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they gave me nothing to <hi>drink</hi> but <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> after their fashion. Other hurt they did me none, only one little villanous <hi>Turky</hi> knob-brested Rogue, came to snatch away some of my <hi>Lardons</hi>; but I gave him such a sturdy Thump, and sound Rap on the Fingers, with
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:46180:266"/>
all the weight of my Javelin, that he came no mote the second time. Shortly after this, there came towards me a pretty young <hi>Corinthian</hi> Wench, who brought me a Box full of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, of round <hi>Mirabolan</hi> Plums, called <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicks,</hi> and looked upon my poor <hi>Roger</hi> with an Eye of great Compassion, as it was Flea-bitten and pinked with the Sparkles of the Fire from whence it came, for it reached no further in length (believe me) than my Knees. But note, that this Roasting cured me entirely of a <hi>Sciatica,</hi> whereunto I had been subject above se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Years before, upon that side which my <hi>Roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> by falling asleep, suffered to be burnt.</p>
                     <p>Now whilst they were thus busy about me, the Fire triumphed, never ask, How? for it took hold on above two thousand Houses; which one of them espying, cryed out, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, By <hi>Mahooms</hi> Belly all the City is on fire, and we do nevertheless stand gazing here, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offering to make any Relief. Upon this, every one ran to save his own. For my part, I took my way towards the Gate. When I was got upon the Knap of a little Hillock, not far off, I turned me about as did <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, and looking back, saw all the City burning in a fair Fire; whereat I was so glad, that I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most beshit my self for Joy: but God punished me well for it. How? said <hi>Pantagruel.</hi> Thus, said <hi>Panurge</hi>; for when with Pleasure I beheld this jolly Fire, jesting with my self, and saying, <hi>Ha poor Flies, ha poor Mice,</hi> you will have a
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:46180:267"/>
bad Winter of it this Year; the Fire is in your Reeks, it is <hi>in your Bed-straw:</hi> Out came more than six, yea more than thirteen hundred and eleven Dogs great and small, altogether out of the Town, flying away from the Fire. At the first Approach they ran all upon me, being carried on by the Scent of my leacherous half-roasted Flesh, and had even then devoured me in a trice, if my good Angel had not well inspired me with the Instruction of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, very sovereign against the <hi>Pain of the Teeth.</hi> And wherefore (said <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) wert thou afraid of the <hi>Pain of the Teeth?</hi> wert thou not cured of thy Rheums? By <hi>Palm-Sunday</hi> (said <hi>Panurge</hi>) is there any greater <hi>Pain of the Teeth</hi> than when the Dogs have you by the Legs? But on a sudden (as my good Angel directed me) I thought upon my <hi>Lardons,</hi> and threw them into the midst of the Field among them: then did the Dogs run, and fight with one another at fair Teeth, which should have the <hi>Lardons:</hi> by this means they left me, and I left them also bustling with, and haring one another. Thus did I escape frolick and lively, <hi>Grammerie Roast-meat and Cookery.</hi>

                     </head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>PAntagruel</hi> one Day to refresh himself of his Study, went a walking towards St. <hi>Marcel</hi>'s Suburbs, to see the Extravagancy of the <hi>Gobeline</hi> Building, and to taste of their spiced Bread. <hi>Panurge</hi> was with him, having always a Flaggon under his Gown, and a good Slice of a Gammon of Bacon; for without this he never went, saying, That it was his <hi>Life-guard</hi>; other Sword carried he none. And when <hi>Pantagruel</hi> would have given him one, he answered, that he needed none, for that it would but <hi>heat his Feius.</hi> Yea, but (said <hi>Epistemon</hi>) if thou shouldest be set upon, how wouldest thou defend thy self? With great <hi>brodkin</hi> Blows, answered he, provided <hi>Thrusts</hi> were forbidden. At their return, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi> considered the Walls of the City of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> and in derision said to <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> See what fair <hi>Walls</hi> here are! O how strong they are, and well fitted to keep Geese in a Coop to fatten them! by my Beard they are very sorry <hi>Walls</hi> for such a City as this is; for a Cow with one Fart would go near to overthrow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove six fathoms of them. O my Friend (said <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) dost thou know what <hi>Agesilaus</hi>
                        <pb n="98" facs="tcp:46180:268"/>
said, when he was asked, Why the great City of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> was not inclosed with <hi>Walls?</hi> shewing them the Inhabitants and Citizens, so strong, so well armed, and so expert in Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Discipline; <hi>Lo here</hi> (said he) <hi>the Walls of the City:</hi> Signifying thereby, that there is no <hi>Wall</hi> but of <hi>Bones,</hi> and that Towns and Cities cannot have a surer <hi>Wall,</hi> nor better Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than the <hi>Prowess</hi> and <hi>Vertue</hi> of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens and Inhabitants. So is this City so strong, by the great number of Warlike People that are in it, that they care not for making any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Walls.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Besides, whosoever would go about to wall it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as <hi>Strasbourg, Orleans</hi> or <hi>Ferrara,</hi> would find it almost impossible, the Cost and Charges would be so excessive. Yea, but (said <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi>) it is good nevertheless to have an <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of Stone,</hi> when we are invaded by our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, were it but to ask, Who is below there? As for the enormous Expence, which you say would be needful for undertaking the great Work of <hi>walling</hi> this City about, if the Gentlemen of the Town will be pleased to give me a good rough Cup of Wine, I will shew them a pretty, strange and new way how they may build them good cheap. How, said <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel?</hi> Do not speak of it then, (answered <hi>Panurge</hi>) and I will tell it you. I see that the <hi>what d'ye Call-ums</hi> of the Women of this Country, are better cheap than Stones: of them should the <hi>Walls</hi> be built, ranging them in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:46180:268"/>
good Symmetry by the Rules of <hi>Architecture,</hi> and placing the largest in the first Ranks, then sloping downwards Ridg-ways, like the Back of an Ass; the middle sized ones must be ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked next, and last of all the least and smallest. This done, there must be a fine little interlacing of them, like Points of Diamonds, as is to be seen in the great Tower of <hi>Bourges,</hi> with a like number of the lusty <hi>Catfoes</hi> that dwell in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>claustral</hi> Cod-pieces. What <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> were able to overthrow such <hi>Walls?</hi> there is no Metal like it to resist Blows, in so far that if Culverin-shot should come to grase up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, you would incontinently see distil from thence the blessed Fruit of the great Pox, as small as Rain. Beware in the name of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and hold off. Furthermore, No Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt or Lightning would fall upon it; for why? they are all either <hi>blest</hi> or <hi>consecrated.</hi> I see but one Inconveniency in it. Ho, ho, ha, ha, ha, (said <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) and what is that? It is that the Flies would be so lickorish of them, to a Wonder, and would quickly gather there to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and there leave their Ordure and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions, and so all the Work would be spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. But see how that might be remedied: they must be wiped and made rid of the Flies with fair Fox-tails, or good great Ass-pizzles of <hi>Provence.</hi> And to this purpose I will tell you (as we go to Supper) a brave Example set down by <hi>Frater Lubinus, libro de compota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionibus mendicantium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="100" facs="tcp:46180:269"/>In the time that the <hi>Beasts</hi> did speak, (which is not yet three Days ago) a poor Lion walking through the Forest of <hi>Bieure,</hi> and saying his own little private Devotions, past under a Tree where there was a roguish Collier gotten up to cut down Wood: who seeing the Lion, cast his Hatchet at him, and wounded him enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously in one of his Legs: whereupon the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on halting, so long toiled and turmoiled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in roaming up and down the Forest to find help, till at last he met with a Carpenter, who willingly look'd upon his Wound, clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it as well as he could, and filled it with Moss, telling him that he must wipe his Wound well, that the Flies might not do their Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in it, whilst he should go search for some <hi>Millefoil,</hi> commonly called the <hi>Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Herb.</hi> The Lion being thus healed, walked along in the Forrest; at what time, a <hi>sempiternous</hi> old Hag was picking up, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering some Sticks in the said Forest, who seeing the Lion coming towards her, for fear fell down backwards, in such sort, that the Wind blew up her Gown, Coats and Smock e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as far as above her Shoulders. Which the Lion perceiving, for pity ran to see whether she had taken any hurt by the Fall; and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on considering her <hi>what you call it,</hi> said, O poor Woman, who hath thus wounded thee? which Words when he had spoken, he espied a Fox, whom he called to come to him, saying, <hi>Gossip Renard,</hi> hau, hither, hither, and for cause.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="101" facs="tcp:46180:269"/>When the Fox was come, he said unto him, My <hi>Gossip</hi> and Friend, they have hurt this good Woman here between the Legs most villanous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and there is a manifest <hi>Solution</hi> of <hi>Continui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>; see how great a Wound it is, even from the Tail up to the Navel, in measure four, nay full five Hand-fulls and a half; this is the Blow of an Hatchet, I doubt me it is an old Wound, and therefore that the Flies may not get into it, wipe it lustily well and hard, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee, both within and without; thou hast a good Tail and long; wipe, my Friend, wipe, I beseech thee, and in the mean while I will go get some Moss to put into it. For thus ought we to succour and help one another. Wipe it hard, thus, my Friend, wipe it well, for this Wound must be often wiped, otherwise the Party cannot be at ease. Go to, wipe well, my little <hi>Gossip,</hi> wipe, God hath furnished thee with a Tail; thou hast a long one, and of a Bigness proportionable, wipe hard and be not weary. A good <hi>Wiper,</hi> who in <hi>wiping</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, <hi>wipeth</hi> with his <hi>Wipard,</hi> by <hi>Wasps</hi> shall never be <hi>wounded.</hi> Wipe, my <hi>pretty Minion,</hi> wipe, my <hi>little Bully,</hi> I will not stay long. Then went he to get store of Moss; and when he was a little way off, he cried out in speaking to the Fox thus, Wipe well still, <hi>Gossip,</hi> wipe, and let it never grieve thee to wipe well, my <hi>little Gossip,</hi> I will put thee into Service to be Wiper to <hi>Don Pedro de Castille</hi>; wipe, only wipe, and no more. The poor Fox wiped as
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:46180:270"/>
hard as he could, here and there, within and without: but the false <hi>old Trot</hi> did so fizzle and foist, that she stunk like a hundred Devils. Which put the poor Fox to a great deal of ill ease; for he knew not to what side to turn himself, to escape the unsavoury Perfume of this old Woman's postern Blasts. And whilst to that effect he was shifting hither and thither, without knowing how to shun the Annoyance of those unwholesom Gusts, he saw that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind there was yet another Hole, not so great as that which he did wipe, out of which came this filthy and infectious Air. The Lion at last returned, bringing with him of Moss more than eighteen Packs would hold, and began to put it into the Wound, with a Staff which he had provided for that purpose; and had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready put in full sixteen Packs and a half, at which he was amazed: What a Devil? (said he) this Wound is very deep, it would hold above two Cart-loads of Moss. The Fox per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving this, said unto the Lion, O <hi>Gossip</hi> Lion, my Friend, I pray thee do not put in all thy Moss there, keep somewhat; for there is yet here another little Hole, that stinks like five hundred Devils. I am almost choaked with the smell thereof, it is so pestiferous and impoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning.</p>
                     <p>In this manner (said <hi>Panurge</hi>) must these <hi>Walls</hi> be kept from the Flies; and Wages al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to some for wiping of them. Then said <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> How dost thou know that the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:46180:270"/>
Parts of Women are at such a cheap Rate? for in this City there are many vertuous, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and chaste Women besides the Maids. <hi>Et ubi prenus,</hi> said <hi>Panurge?</hi> I will give you my Opinion of it, and that upon certain and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Knowledg. I do not brag that I have bum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basted four hundred and seventeen, since I came into this City, though it be but nine days ago. But this very Morning I met with a good Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, who in a Wallet, such as <hi>Aesop</hi>'s was, carried two little Girls of two or three years old at the most, one before, and the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. He demanded Alms of me, but I made him answer, that I had more Cods than Pence. Afterwards I asked him, <hi>good Man,</hi> these two Girls are they Maids? <hi>Brother,</hi> said he, I have carried them thus these two years, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of her that is before, whom I see continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, in my Opinion she is a Virgin, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less I will not put my Finger in the Fire for it; as for her that is behind, doubtless I can say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Indeed (said <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) thou art a merry Companion, I will have thee to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled in my Livery: and therefore caused him to be clothed most gallantly according to the Fashion that then was; only that <hi>Panurge</hi> would have the <hi>Cod-piece</hi> of his Breeches three Foot-long, and in shape square, not round, which was done, and was well worth the see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Often-times was he wont to say that the World had not yet known the Emolument and Utility that is in wearing <hi>great Cod-pieces</hi>;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:46180:271"/>
but Time would one day teach it them, <hi>as all things have been invented in time.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>God keep from hurt (said he) the good Fellow whose great Cod-piece hath saved his Life. God keep from hurt him, whose great Cod-piece hath been worth to him in one day, one hundred threescore thousand and nine Crowns. God keep from hurt him, who by his great Cod-piece hath saved a whole City from dying by Famine. And by G— I will make a Book of the Commodity of <hi>great Cod-pieces,</hi> when I shall have more leasure. And indeed he composed a fair great Book with Figures, but it is not printed as yet that I know of.</p>

his need.

And he was still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving some Plot, and devising Mischief against the Serjeants and the Watch.</p>
                     <p>At one time he assembled three or four e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>special good Hacksters and roaring Boys; made them in the Evening drink like <hi>Templers,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards led them till they came under St. <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieve,</hi> or about the College of <hi>Navar</hi>; and at the Hour that the Watch was coming up that way, which he knew by putting his Sword upon the Pavement, and his Ear by it, and when he heard his Sword shake, it was an infallible Sign that the Watch was near at that instant: then he and his Companions took a Tumbrel or Dung-cart, and gave it the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, hurling it with all their Force down the Hill, and so overthrew all the poor Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men like Pigs, and then ran away upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side; for in less than two days, he knew all the Streets, Lanes and Turnings in <hi>Paris,</hi> as well as his <hi>Deus de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>At another time he made in some fair Place, where the said Watch was to pass, a Train of Gun-powder, and at the very instant that they went along, set fire to it, and then made himself Sport to see what good <hi>Grace</hi>

One time at the entry of the Palace unto the great Hall, where a <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delier</hi> was to say <hi>Mass</hi> to the Counsellors; he did help to apparel him, and put on his Vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but in the accoutring of him, he sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his <hi>Alb,</hi> Surplice or Stole, to his Gown and Shirt, and then withdrew himself, when the said Lords of the Court, or Counsellors, came to hear the said <hi>Mass:</hi> but when it came to the <hi>Ite, missa est,</hi> that the poor <hi>Frater</hi> would have laid by his <hi>Stole,</hi> or Surplice, he plucked off withal both his Frock and Shirt which were well sowed together, and thereby stripping himself up to the very Shoulders, shewed his <hi>what do you Call-um</hi> to all the World, which was no small one, as you may imagine: and the Friar still kept haling, but so much the more did he discover himself, and lay open his Back-parts, till one of the Lords of the Court said, How now, what's the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? will this good <hi>Father</hi> make us here an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of his Tail to kiss it? nay, St. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Fire kiss it for us. From thenceforth was made an <hi>Ordinance</hi> that the poor <hi>Fathers</hi> should never disrobe themselves any more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World, but in their Vestry-room, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:46180:273"/>
in the presence of Women, lest it should tempt them to the Sin of <hi>Longing,</hi> and disordinate Desire. The People then asked, why it was the <hi>Friars</hi> had so long and large Genitories? the said <hi>Panurge</hi> resolved the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem</hi> very neatly, saying, That which makes Asses to have such great Ears, is that their Dams did put no Biggins on their Heads, as <hi>Alliaco</hi> mentioneth in his <hi>Suppositions</hi>; by the like Reason, that which makes the Generation-Tools of those fair <hi>Fraters</hi> so long, is, for that they ware no bottomed Breeches, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their jolly Member having no Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hangeth dangling at liberty, as far as it can reach, with a wigle-wagle down to their Knees, as Woman carry their <hi>Patinotre</hi> Beads. And the cause wherefore they have it so cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondently great, is, that in this constant wig-wagging the Humours of the Body de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend into the said Member: for according to the <hi>Legists,</hi> Agitation and continual Motion is cause of Attraction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> He had another Pocket full of itching Powder, called <hi>Stone-allum</hi>; whereof he would cast some into the Backs of those Women, whom he judged to be most beautiful and stately, which did so ticklishly gall them, that some would strip themselves in the open view of the World, and others dance like a Cock upon hot Embers, or a Drum-stick on a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: others again ran about the Streets, and he would run after them: to such as were in
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:46180:274"/>
the stripping Vein, he would very civilly come to offer his Attendance, and cover them with his Cloak, like a courteous and very gracious Man.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> In another he had a little Leather-bottle full of old Oil; wherewith, when he saw any Man or Woman in a rich new hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som Sute, he would grease, smutch and spoil all the best parts of it under colour and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of touching them, saying, This is good Cloth, this is good Sattin, good Taffaties; <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> God give you all that your noble Heart desireth: you have a new Sute, <hi>pretty Sir</hi>; and you a new Gown<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>sweet Mistris,</hi> God give you Joy of it, and maintain you in all Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and with this would lay his Hand upon their Shoulder; at which touch such a villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Spot was left behind, so enormously engraven to Perpetuity in the very Soul, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Reputation, that the Devil himself could never have taken it away. Then upon his departing, he would say, <hi>Madam,</hi> take heed you do not fall, for there is a filthy great Hole before you.</p>
                     <p>Another he had all full of <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> very finely pulverized: in that Powder did he lay a fair Handkerchief curiously wrought, which he had stollen from a pretty Seamstress of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, in taking away a Louse from off her Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, which he had put there himself. And when he came into the Company of some good La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, he would trifle them into a Discourse of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:46180:274"/>
some fine Workmanship of Bone-lace; then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately put his Hand into their Bosom, ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them, And this Work, is it of <hi>Flanders,</hi> or of <hi>Hainault?</hi> and then drew out his Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief, and said, Hold, hold, look what Work here is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is of <hi>Foutiman</hi> or of <hi>Foutarabia:</hi> and shaking it hard at their Nose, made them sneeze for four <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lours without ceasing. In the mean while he would fart like a Horse, and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men would laugh, and say, How now, do you fart <hi>Panurge?</hi> No, no, Madam, (said he) I do but tune my Tail to the plain Song of the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, which you make with your Nose. In ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had a Picklock, a Pellican, a Cramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iron, a Crook, and some other Iron Tools, wherewith there was no Door nor Coffer which he would not pick open. He had another full of little Cups, wherewith he played very artificial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for he had his Fingers made to his Hand, like those of <hi>Minerva</hi> or <hi>Arachne,</hi> and had heretofore cried <hi>Triacle.</hi> And when he changed a <hi>Teston, Cardecu,</hi> or any other piece of Money, the Changer had been more subtil than a Fox, if <hi>Panurge</hi> had not at every time made five or six <hi>Sols,</hi> vanish away invisibly, openly and manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without making any Hurt or Lesion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Changer should have felt nothing but the Wind.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XVII. How <hi>Panurge</hi> gained the Pardons, and marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the old Women; and of the Suit in Law which he had at <hi>Paris.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>ONe Day I found <hi>Panurge</hi> very much out of countenance, melancholick and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, which made me suspect that he had no Money; whereupon I said unto him, <hi>Panurge</hi> you are sick, as I do very well perceive by your Physiognomy; and I know the Disease, you have a Flux in your Purse; but take no care, I have yet seven Pence half-penny, that never saw Father nor Mother, which shall not be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting no more than the Pox in your necessity. Whereunto he answered me, Well, well, for Money, one Day I shall have but too much; for I have a <hi>Philosopher's Stone,</hi> which attracts Money out of Mens Purses, as the Adamant doth Iron. But will you go with me to gain the <hi>Pardons,</hi> said he? By my Faith (said I) I am no great <hi>Pardon-taker</hi> in this World; if I shall be any such in the other, I cannot tell. Yet let us go in God's Name, it is but one Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more or less. But (said he) lend me then a Farthing upon interest? No, no, (said I) I will give it you freely, and from my Heart, <hi>Grates vobis dominos,</hi> said he.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="113" facs="tcp:46180:275"/>So we went along, beginning at St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vase,</hi> and I got the <hi>Pardons</hi> at the first <hi>Box</hi> only; for in those Matters very little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenteth me. Then did I say my <hi>small Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> and the Prayers of St. <hi>Brigid</hi>; but he gained them at all the <hi>Boxes,</hi> and always gave Money to every one of the <hi>Pardoners.</hi> From thence we went to our <hi>Ladies</hi> Church, to St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s, to St. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s, and so to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches, where there was a <hi>Banquet</hi> of <hi>Pardons</hi>; for my part, I gained no more of them. But he at all the <hi>Boxes</hi> kissed the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,</hi> and gave at every one. To be brief, when we were returned, he brought me to drink at the <hi>Castle-Tavern,</hi> and there shewed me ten or twelve of his little Bags full of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; at which I blest my self, and made the <hi>Sign of the Cross,</hi> saying, Where have you recovered so much Money in so little time? Unto which he answered me, that he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it out of the <hi>Basons</hi> of the Pardons. For in giving them the first Farthing (said he) I put it in with such slight of hand, and so dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terously, that it appeared to be a Three-pence; thus with one Hand I took Three-pence, Nine-pence or Six-pence at the least, and with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as much, and so through all the Churches where we have been.</p>
                     <p>Yea, but (said I) you damn your self like a <hi>Snake,</hi> and are withal a <hi>Thief</hi> and <hi>sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Person. True, (said he) in your Opinion, but I am not of that Mind; for the <hi>Pardoners</hi>
                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:46180:276"/>
do give me it, when they say unto me in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting the <hi>Relicks</hi> to kiss, <hi>Centuplum accipies</hi>; that is, that for one Penny I should take a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. For <hi>Accipies</hi> is spoken according to the manner of the Hebrews, who use the future Tense instead of the Imperative, as you have in the Law, <hi>Diliges Dominum</hi>; that is, <hi>dilige:</hi> Even so when the <hi>Pardon-Bearer</hi> says to me, <hi>Centuplum accipies</hi>; his meaning is, <hi>Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plum accipe:</hi> and so doth <hi>Rabbi Kimi,</hi> and <hi>Rabbi Aben Ezra</hi> expound it, and all the <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorets, &amp; ibi Bartholus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreover, Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> gave me fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Francks of yearly Pension upon his Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Revenues and Treasure, for having cured him of a <hi>Canckrous Botch,</hi> which did so torment him, that he thought to have been a Cripple by it all his life. Thus I do pay my self at my own hand (for otherways I get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) upon the said Ecclesiastical Treasure.</p>
                     <p>Ho, my Friend! (said he) if thou didst know how well I feathered my Nest, by the Pope's Bull of the <hi>Croisade,</hi> thou wouldest wonder exceedingly. It was worth to me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove six thousand <hi>Florins.</hi> And what a Devil is become of them? said I; for of that Money thou hast not one Half-penny. They returned from whence they came, (said he) they did no more but change their Master.</p>
                     <p>But I employed at least three thousand of them in marrying (not young Virgins, for they find but too many Husbands) but great
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:46180:276"/>
old <hi>sempiternous Trots,</hi> which had not so much as one Tooth in their Heads. And that out of the Consideration I had, that these good old Women had very well spent the time of their Youth in playing at the Close-buttock-game to all Comers, serving the foremost first, till no Man would have any more dealing with them. And by G— I will have their Skin-coat shaken once yet before they die. By this means, to one I gave a hundred Florins, to another six score, to another three hundred, according as they were infamous, detest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and abominable. For by how much the more horrible and execrable they were, so much the more must I needs have given them, otherways the Devil would not have jum'd them. Presently I went to some great and fat Wood-porters, or such like, and did my self make the Match; but before I did shew him the <hi>old Hags,</hi> I made a fair muster to him of the Crowns, saying, <hi>Good Fellow,</hi> see what I will give thee, if thou wilt but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend to dufle, dinfredaille, or lecher it one good bout. Then began the poor Rogues to gape like old Mules, and I caused to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for them a Banquet, with Drink of the best, and store of Spiceries, to put the old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in rut and heat of Lust. To be short, they occupied all like good Souls; only to those that were horribly ugly and ill-favoured, I caused their Heads to be put within a Bag, to hide their Face.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="116" facs="tcp:46180:277"/>Besides all this, I have lost a great deal in <hi>Suits of Law.</hi> And what <hi>Law-Suits</hi> couldst thou have, said I? thou hast neither House nor Lands. My Friend, (said he) the <hi>Gentlewomen</hi> of this City had found out, by the instigation of the Devil of Hell, a manner of high-mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Gorgets,</hi> and Neckerchiefs for Women, which did so closely cover their Bosoms, that Men could no more put their Hands under; for they had put the Slit behind, and those Neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloths were wholly shut before; whereat the poor sad contemplative Lovers were much discontented. Upon a fair <hi>Tuesday,</hi> I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented a Petition to the <hi>Court,</hi> making my self a Party against the said <hi>Gentlewomen,</hi> and shewing the great Interest that I pretended therein, protesting that by the same reason, I would cause the <hi>Cod-piece</hi> of my Breeches to be sowed behind, if the <hi>Court</hi> would not take order for it. In sum, the <hi>Gentlewomen</hi> put in their Defences, shewed the Grounds they went upon, and constituted their <hi>Attorney</hi> for the prosecuting of the Cause; but I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued them so vigorously, that by a Sentence of the <hi>Court</hi> it was decreed, those <hi>high Neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloths</hi> should be no longer worn, if they were not a little cleft and open before: but it cost me a good Sum of Money. I had another very filthy and beastly Process against Master <hi>Foh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foh</hi> and his Deputies, that they should no more read privily the Pipe, Punehon, nor quart of Sentences; but in fair full-day, and that in the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:46180:277"/>
                        <hi>Fodder-Schools,</hi> in face of the <hi>Arrian</hi> Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, where I was ordained to pay the Charges, by reason of some <hi>Clause</hi> mistaken in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the <hi>Serjeant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another time I framed a Complaint to the Court, against the <hi>Mules</hi> of the Presidents, Counsellors and others, tending to this purpose; that when in the lower Court of the Palace, they left them to champ on their Bridles, some Bibs might be made for them, that with their Drivelling they might not spoil the Pavement, to the end, that the Pages of the Palace might play upon it at Dice, or Coxbody at their own ease, without spoiling their Breeches at the Knees. And for this I had a fair <hi>Decree,</hi> but it cost me dear. Now reckon up what Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence I was at in little Banquets, which from Day to Day I made to the Pages of the Palace. And to what end, said I? My Friend (said he) thou hast no pass-time at all in this World, I have more than the King; and if thou wilt join thy self with me, we will do the Devil to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                     <p>No, no, (said I) by St. <hi>Adauras</hi> that will I not, for thou wilt be hanged one time or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. And thou (said he) wilt be <hi>interred</hi> sometime or other. Now which is most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, the Air or the Earth? Ho, <hi>grosse Pecore.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whilst the Pages are at their Banqueting, I keep their Mules, and to some one I cut the Stirrup-leather of the Mounting side, till it hang
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:46180:278" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but by a thin Strap or Thread, that when the great Puff-guts of the Counsellor or some other hath taken his Swing to get up, he may fall flat on his Side like a Pork, and so furnish the Spectators with more than a hundred Francks worth of Laughter. But I laugh yet further, to think how at his home-coming the Master-page is to be whipp'd like green Rie, which makes me not to repent what I have bestowed in feasting them. In brief, he had (as I said before) threescore and three Ways to acquire Money, but he had two hundred and fourteen to spend it, besides his Drinking.</p>

philosophizing after the Fashion of the Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teticks At his first Entrance he startled, and was almost out of his Wits for Fear, seeing him so great and so tall; then did he salute him courteously, as the Manner is, and said unto him, Very true it is, saith <hi>Plato</hi> the Prince of Philosophers, that if <hi>the Image of Knowledg and Wisdom were corporeal and visible to the Eyes of Mortals, it would stir up all the World to admire her.</hi> Which we may the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the very bare Report thereof, scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the Air, if it happen to be received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ears of Men, who for being studious, and Lovers of vertuous things, are called Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, doth not suffer them to sleep nor rest in Quiet, but so pricketh them up, and sets them on fire, to run unto the Place where the Person is, in whom the said Knowledg is said to have built her Temple, and uttered her Oracles; as it was manifestly shewn unto us in the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> who came from the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Borders of the East and Persian Sea, to see the Order of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s House, and to hear his Wisdom.

And indeed, having heard the Report of your so inestimable Knowledg, I have left my Country, my Friends, my Kindred and my House, and am come thus far, valuing at nothing the length of the Way, the Tediousness of the Sea, nor Strangeness of the Land, and that only to see you, and to confer with you about some Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages in <hi>Philosophy,</hi> of <hi>Geomancie,</hi> and of the <hi>Cabalistick</hi> Art; whereof I am doubtful, and cannot satisfy my Mind; which if you can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve, I yield my self unto you for a Slave hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward, together with all my Posterity; for other Gift have I none, that I can esteem a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence sufficient for so great a Favour. I will reduce them into Writing, and to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row publish them to all the learned Men in the City, that we may dispute publickly before them.</p>
                     <p>But see in what manner, I mean that we shall dispute. I will not argue <hi>pro &amp; contra,</hi>
                        <pb n="121" facs="tcp:46180:279"/>
as do the sottish <hi>Sophisters</hi> of this Town, and other Places. Likewise I will not dispute after the manner of the <hi>Academicks,</hi> by Declamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Nor yet by Numbers, as <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was wont to do, and as <hi>Picus de la mirandula</hi> did of late at <hi>Rome.</hi> But I will dispute by Signs only, without speaking; for the Matters are so abstruse, hard and arduous, that Words pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the Mouth of Man, will never be sufficient for unfolding of them to my liking. May it therefore please your Magnificence to be there, it shall be at the great Hall of <hi>Navarre,</hi> at seven a Clock in the Morning. When he had spoke these Words, <hi>Pantagruel</hi> very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably said unto him, Sir, of the Graces that God hath bestowed upon me, I would not deny to communicate unto any Man to my Power; for whatever comes from him is good, and his Pleasure is, that it should be increased when we come amongst Men worthy and fit to receive this celestial <hi>Manna</hi> of honest <hi>Litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> In which Number, because that in this Time (as I do already very plainly perceive) thou holdest the first Rank, I give thee Notice that at all Hours thou shalt find me ready to condescend to every one of thy Requests, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my poor Ability: although I ought rather to learn of thee, than thou of me; but as thou hast protested, we will confer of these Doubts together, and will seek out the Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, even unto the bottom of that <hi>undraina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Well, where <hi>Heraclitus</hi> says the Truth lies
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:46180:280"/>
hidden. And I do highly commend the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of arguing which thou hast proposed, to wit, by <hi>Signs</hi> without speaking; for by this Means thou and I shall understand one another well enough, and yet shall be free from this clapping of Hands, which these blockish <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisters</hi> make, when any of the Arguers hath gotten the better of the Argument.

                     <p>My Lord, leave all these Thoughts, and go to Bed; for I perceive your Spirits to be so troubled by a too intensive bending of them, that you may easily fall into some <hi>Quotidian Fever</hi> with this so excessive thinking and plod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: but having first drank twenty five, or thirty good Draughts, retire your self and sleep your fill; for in the Morning I will argue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, and answer your <hi>Monsieur</hi> the <hi>English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>; and if I drive him not <hi>ad metam non lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui,</hi> then call me Knave. Yea but (said he) my Friend <hi>Panurge,</hi> he is marvellously learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how wilt thou be able to answer him? Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, (answered <hi>Panurge</hi>) I pray you talk no more of it, but let me alone; is any Man so learned as the Devils are? No, indeed (said <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) without God's especial Grace. Yet for all that (said <hi>Panurge</hi>) I have argued against them, gravelled and blanked them in Disputation, and laid them so squat upon their
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:46180:281"/>
Tails, that I have made them look like Monkies: therefore be assured, that to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row I will make this vain-glorious <hi>Englishman</hi> to skite Vinegar before all the World. So <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi> spent the Night with tipling amongst the Pages, and played away all the Points of his Breeches at <hi>primus secundus,</hi> and at Peck-point. Yet when the appointed Time was come, he failed not to conduct his Master <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel</hi> to the Place, unto which (believe me) there was neither great nor small in <hi>Paris</hi> but came, thinking with themselves that this devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> who had overthrown and vanquished in Dispute all these doting <hi>fresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water</hi> Sophisters, would now get full Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and be tickled to some purpose; for this <hi>Englishman</hi> is another Devil of a Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant; we will see who will be Conqueror.</p>
                     <p>Thus all being assembled, <hi>Thaumast</hi> stayed for them; and then when <hi>Pantagruel</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi> came into the Hall, all the School-boys, Professors of Arts, Senior-Sophisters and Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelors began to clap their Hands, as their scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Custom is: but <hi>Pantagruel</hi> cried out with a loud Voice, as if it had been the Sound of a double Cannon, saying, Peace, with a Devil to you, Peace; by G— you Rogues, if you trouble me here, I will cut off the Heads of every one of you. At which Words they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained all daunted and astonished, like so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ducks, and durst not do so much as cough, although they had swallowed fifteen Pounds o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Feathers: withal they grew so dry with this only Voice, that they laid out their Tongues a full half Foot beyond their Mouths, as if <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel</hi> had <hi>salted all their Throats.</hi> Then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan <hi>Panurge</hi> to speak, saying to the <hi>English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> Sir, are you come hither to dispute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiously in those Propositions you have set down, or otherways but to learn and know the Truth? To which answered <hi>Thaumast,</hi> Sir, no other thing brought me hither, but the great Desire I had to learn, and to know that of which I have doubted all my Life long, and have neither found Book nor Man able to content me in the Resolution of those Doubts which I have proposed. And as for disputing contentiously, I will not do it, for it is too base a thing, and therefore leave it to those sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish <hi>Sophisters,</hi> who in their Disputes do not search for the Truth, but for Contradiction only and Debate. Then said <hi>Panurge,</hi> If I who am but a mean and inconsiderable Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of my Master my Lord <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> content and satisfy you in all and every thing, it were a thing below my said Master, wherewith to trouble him: therefore is it fitter that he be Chair-man, and sit as a Judg and Moderator of our Discourse and Purpose, and give you Satisfaction in many things, wherein perhaps I shall be wanting to your Expectation. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (said <hi>Thaumast</hi>) it is very well said: begin then. Now you must note that <hi>Panurge</hi> had set at the End of his long <hi>Codpiece</hi> a pretty Tuft

of red Silk, as also of white, green and blew, and within it had put a fair Orange.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XIX. How <hi>Panurge</hi> put to a <hi>non-plus</hi> the <hi>English-man</hi> that argued by Signs.</head>
                     <p>EVery Body then taking heed, and harkning with great Silence, the <hi>English-man</hi> lift up on high into the Air his two Hands several<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, clinching in all the Tops of his Fingers together, after the manner they call <hi>en Chinon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois,</hi> the Hens Arse, and struck the one Hand on the other by the Nails four several times: then he opening them, struck the one with the flat of the other, till it yielded a clashing Noise, and that only once: again in joining them as before he struck twice, and afterwards four times in opening them; then did he lay them joined, and extended the one towards the other, as if he had been devoutly to send up his Prayers unto God. <hi>Panurge</hi> suddenly lifted up in the Air his right Hand, and put the Thumb thereof into the Nostril of the same Side, holding his four Fingers streight out, and closed orderly in a parallel Line to the Point of his Nose, shutting the left Eye wholly, and making the other wink with a profound Depression of the Eye-brows and Eye-lids. Then lifted he up his left Hand, with hard
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:46180:282"/>
wringing and stretching forth his four Fingers, and elevating his Thumb, which he held in a Line directly correspondent to the Situation of his right Hand, with the Distance of a Cubit and a half between them. This done, in the same Form he abased towards the Ground, both the one and the other Hand. Lastly, he held them in the midst, as aiming right at the <hi>English-man's</hi> Nose. And if <hi>Mercurie,</hi> said the <hi>English-man—:</hi> there <hi>Panurge</hi> interrupted him, and said, You have spoken <hi>Mask.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then made the <hi>English-man</hi> this Sign, his left Hand all open he lifted up into the Air, then instantly shut into his Fist the four Fingers thereof, and his Thumb extended at length he placed upon the Gristle of his Nose. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after he lifted up his right Hand all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and all open abased and bent it down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, putting the Thumb thereof in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Place where the little Finger of the left Hand did close in the Fist, and the four right-Hand-Fingers he softly moved in the Air. Then contrarily he did with the right Hand what he had done with the left, and with the left what he had done with the right.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Panurge</hi> being not a whit amazed at this, drew out into the Air his <hi>Trismegist</hi> Codpiece with the left Hand, and with his right drew forth a Trunchion of a white Ox-rib, and two Pieces of Wood of a like Form, one of black Eben, and the other of Incarnation Brasil, and put them betwixt the Fingers of that Hand in
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:46180:283"/>
good Symmetrie: then knocking them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, made such a Noise as the <hi>Lepers</hi> of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainie</hi> use to do with their clappering Clickets, yet better resounding, and far more harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and with his Tongue contracted in his Mouth, did very merrily warble it, always looking fixedly upon the English-man. The Divines, Physicians and Chirurgions that were there, thought that by this <hi>Sign</hi> he would have inferred that the English-man was a <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi> The Counsellors, Lawyers and Decreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists conceived, that by doing this, he would have concluded some kind of <hi>mortal Felicity</hi> to consist in <hi>Leprosie,</hi> as the Lord maintained heretofore.</p>
                     <p>The English-man for all this was nothing daunted, but holding up his two Hands in the Air, kept them in such Form, that he closed the three Master-fingers in his Fist; and passing his Thumbs thorow his indical and middle Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, his auriculary Fingers remained extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and stretched out, and so presented he them to <hi>Panurge:</hi> then joined he them so, that the right Thumb touched the left, and the left little Finger touched the right. Hereat <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge,</hi> without speaking one Word, lift up his Hands and made this <hi>Sign.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He put the Nail of the Forefinger of his left Hand, to the Nail of the Thumb of the same, making in the middle of the Distance as it were a Buckle, and of his right Hand shut up all the Fingers into his Fist, except the Forefin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:46180:283"/>
which he often thrust in and out through the said two others of the left Hand: then stretched he out the Forefinger and middle Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or medical of his right Hand, holding them asunder as much as he could, and thrusting them towards <hi>Thaumast.</hi> Then did he put the Thumb of his left Hand upon the Corner of his left Eye, stretching out all his Hand like the Wing of a Bird, or the Fin of a Fish, and moving it very daintily this way and that way; he did as much with his right Hand upon the Corner of his right Eye. <hi>Thaumast</hi> began then to wax somewhat pale, and to tremble, and made him this <hi>Sign.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>With the middle Finger of his right Hand he struck against the Muscle of the Palm or Pulp, which is under the Thumb: then put he the Forefinger of the right Hand in the like Buckle of the left, but he put it under and not over, as <hi>Panurge</hi> did. Then <hi>Panurge</hi> knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one Hand against another, and blowed in his Palm, and put again the Forefinger of his right Hand into the Overture or Mouth of the left, pulling it often in and out: then held he out his Chin, most intensively looking upon <hi>Thaumast.</hi> The People there which under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood nothing in the other Signs, knew very well what therein he demanded, without speaking a Word to <hi>Thaumast:</hi> What do you mean by that? In Effect, <hi>Thaumast</hi> then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to sweat great Drops, and seemed to all the Spectators a Man strangely ravished in high
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:46180:284"/>
Contemplation. Then he bethought himself, and put all the Nails of his left Hand against those of his right, opening his Fingers as if they had been Semicircles, and with this Sign lift up his Hands as high as he could. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Panurge</hi> presently put the Thumb of his right Hand under his Jaws, and the little Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger thereof in the Mouth of the left Hand, and in this Posture made his Teeth to sound very melodiously, the upper against the lower. With this <hi>Thaumast</hi> with great Toil and Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spirit rose up, but in rising let a great Bakers Fart, for the Bran came after; and pissing withal very strong Vineger, stunk like all the Devils in Hell. The Company began to stop their Nose; for he had conskitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with meer Anguish and Perplexity. Then lifted he up his right Hand, clinching it in such sort, that he brought the Ends of all his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to meet together; and his left Hand he laid flat upon his Breast. Whereat <hi>Panurge</hi> drew out his long Codpiece with his Tuft, and stretched it forth a Cubit and a half, holding it in the Air with his right Hand, and with his left took out his Orange, and casting it up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Air seven times, at the eighth he hid it in the Fist of his right Hand, holding it steadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly up on high, and then began to shake his fair Codpiece, shewing it to <hi>Thaumast.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After that <hi>Thaumast</hi> began to puff up his two Cheeks like a Player on a Bagpipe, and blew as if he had been to puff up a Pig's Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:46180:284"/>
Whereupon <hi>Panurge</hi> put one Finger of his left Hand in his Nockandrow, and with his Mouth suck'd in the Air, in such a manner as when one eats Oysters in the Shell, or when we sup up our Broth: this done, he opened his Mouth somewhat, and struck his right Hand flat upon it, making therewith a great and a deep Sound, as if it came from the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> through the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiartere:</hi> and this he did for sixteen Times; but <hi>Thaumast</hi> did always keep blowing like a Goose. Then <hi>Panurge</hi> put the Forefinger of his right Hand into his Mouth, pressing it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard to the Muscles thereof: then he drew it out, and withal made a great Noise, as when little Boys shoot Pellets out of the Pot-cannons made of the hollow Sticks of the Branch of an Elder-tree; and he did it nine times.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Thaumast</hi> cried out, Ha, my Masters, a great Secret: with this he put in his Hand up to the Elbow; then drew out a Dagger that he had, holding it by the Point down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Whereat <hi>Panurge</hi> took his long Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, and shook it as hard as he could against his Thighs; then put his two Hands intwined in manner of a Comb upon his Head, laying out his Tongue as far as he was able; and turning his Eyes in his Head, like a Goat that is ready to die. Ha, I understand (said <hi>Thau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mast</hi>) but what? making such a <hi>Sign,</hi> that he put the Haft of his Dagger against his Breast,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:46180:285"/>
and upon the Point thereof the flat of his Hand, turning in a little the Ends of his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; whereat <hi>Panurge</hi> held down his Head on the left side, and put his middle Finger into his right Ear, holding up his Thumb bolt upright; then he cross'd his two Arms upon his Breast, and coughed five times, and at the fifth time he struck his right Foot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Ground: then he lift up his left Arm, and closing all his Fingers into his Fist, held his Thumb against his Forehead, striking with his right Hand six times against his Breast. But <hi>Thaumast,</hi> as not content therewith, put the Thumb of his left Hand upon the Top of his Nose, shutting the rest of his said Hand. Whereupon <hi>Panurge</hi> set his two Master-fingers upon each side of his Mouth, drawing it as much as he was able, and widening it so, that he shewed all his Teeth: and with his two Thumbs pluck'd down his two Eye-lids very low, making therewith a very ill-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd Countenance, as it seemed to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>

                     <p>THen <hi>Thaumast</hi> rose up, and putting off his Cap, did very kindly thank the said <hi>Panurge,</hi> and with a loud Voice said unto all the People that were there, <hi>My Lords, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> at this time may I to some good Purpose speak that Evangelical Word, <hi>Et ecce plus quàm Salomon hîc.</hi> You have here in your Presence an incomparable Treasure, that is, my Lord <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> whose great Renown hath brought me hither, out of the very Heart of <hi>England,</hi> to confer with him about the insoluble Problems, both in <hi>Magick, Alchymy,</hi> the <hi>Caballe, Geomancy, Astrology</hi> and <hi>Philosophy,</hi> which I had in my Mind. But at present I am angry, even with Fame it self, which I think was envious to him, for that it did not declare the thousandth Part of the Worth that indeed is in him. You have seen how his Disciple only hath satisfied me, and hath told me more than I asked of him: besides, he hath opened unto me and resolved other inestimable Doubts, wherein I can assure you he hath to me discovered the very true Well, Fountain and Abyss of the <hi>Encyclopedeia</hi> of Learning; yea in such a sort,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:46180:286"/>
that I did not think I should ever have found a Man that could have made his Skill appear, in so much as the first Elements of that concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which we disputed by <hi>Signs,</hi> without speaking either Word or half Word. But in fine, I will reduce into Writing that which we have said and concluded, that the World may not take them to be Fooleries, and will hereafter cause them to be printed, that every one may learn as I have done. Judg then what the Master had been able to say, seeing the Disciple hath done so valiantly; for, <hi>Non est Discipulus super Magistrum.</hi> Howsoever God be praised, and I do very humbly thank you for the Honour that you have done us at this Act: God reward you for it eternally. The like Thanks gave <hi>Pantagruel</hi> to all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and going from thence, he carried <hi>Thaumast</hi> to Dinner with him, and believe that they drank as much as their Skins could hold; or, as the Phrase is, with unbottomed Bellies, (for in that Age they made fast their Bellies with Buttons, as we do now the Collars of our Doublets) even till they neither knew where they were, nor whence they came. <hi>Blessed Lady,</hi> how they did carouze it, and pluck (as we say) at the Kids Leather; and Flaggons to trot, and they to toot, Draw, give (Page) some Wine; here, reach hither, fill with a Devil, so? There was not one but did drink five and twenty or thirty Pipes, can you tell how? even <hi>sicut terra sine aqua</hi>; for
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:46180:286"/>
the Weather was hot; and besides that, they were very dry. In Matter of the Exposition of the Propositions set down by <hi>Thaumast</hi>; and the Signification of the <hi>Signs</hi> which they used in their Disputation, I would have set them down for you according to their own Relation; but I have been told that <hi>Thaumast</hi> made a great Book of it, imprinted at <hi>London,</hi> wherein he hath set down all without omitting any thing, and therefore at this Time I do pass by it.</p>

leaving a Rabble of long Prologues and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations, which ordinarily these dolent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative <hi>Lent-lovers</hi> make, who never med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the Flesh; one Day he said unto her, <hi>Madam,</hi> it would be a very great Benefit to the Commonwealth, delightful to you, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to your Progeny, and necessary for me, that I cover you for the propagating of my Race; and believe it, for Experience will teach it you. The Lady at this Word thrust him back above a hundred Leagues, saying, You mischievous Fool, is it for you to talk thus unto me? whom do you think you have in hand? be gone, never to come in my Sight again; for if one thing were not, I would have your Legs and Arms cut off.</p>
                     <p>Well, (said he) that were all one to me, to want both Legs and Arms, provided you and I had but one merry bout together at the brangle Buttock-game; for here within is (in shewing her his long <hi>Codpiece</hi>) Master <hi>Iohn Thursday,</hi> who will play you such an <hi>Antick,</hi> that you shall feel the Sweetness thereof even to the very Marrow of your Bones: He is a Gallant, and doth so well know how to find out all the Corners, Creeks and ingrained In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates in your carnal Trap, that after him there needs no Broom, he'l sweep so well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and leave nothing to his Followers to work upon.

Ha, (said he) you are not so bad as you say, no, or else I am deceived in your Physiognomy; for sooner shall the Earth mount up unto the Heavens, and the highest Heavens descend unto the Hells, and all the Course of Nature be quite pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than that in so great Beauty and Neatness as in you is, there should be one Drop of Gall or Malice: They say indeed, that hardly shall a Man ever see a fair Woman that is not also stubborn; yet that is spoke only of those vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Beauties, but yours is so excellent, so sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and so heavenly, that I believe Nature hath given it you as a Paragon and Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece of her Art, to make us know what she can do, when she will imploy all her Skill, and all her Power. There is nothing in you but Honey, but Sugar, but a sweet and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Manna. To you it was to whom <hi>Paris</hi> ought to have adjudged the golden Apple, not to <hi>Venus,</hi> no nor to <hi>Iuno,</hi> nor to <hi>Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi>; for never was there so much Magnificence in <hi>Iuno,</hi> so much Wisdom in <hi>Minerva,</hi> nor so much Comeliness in <hi>Venus,</hi> as there is in you.</p>
                     <p>O heavenly Gods and Goddesses! how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py shall that Man be to whom you will grant the Favour to embrace her, to kiss her, and to rub his Bacon with hers? by G— that shall be I, I know it well; for she loves me already her Belly full, I am sure of it; and so was I predestinated to it by the <hi>Fairies.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

that we lose no Time, put on, thrust out your Gamons: Then he would have imbraced her; but she made as if she would put out her Head at the Window, to call her Neighbours for Help. Then <hi>Panurge</hi> on a sudden ran out, and in his running away said, <hi>Madam,</hi> stay here till I come again, I will go call them my self, do not you take so much Pains. Thus went he away, not much caring for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse he had got, nor made he any whit the worse cheer for it. The next Day he came to the Church, at the Time that she went to <hi>Mass</hi>; at the Door he gave her some of the <hi>Holy Water,</hi> bowing himself very low before her: afterwards he kneeled down by her very familiarly, and said unto her, <hi>Madam,</hi> know that I am so amorous of you, that I can neither piss nor dung for love: I do not know <hi>(Lady)</hi> what you mean, but if I should take any hurt by it, how much would you be to blame?</p>
                     <p>Go, said she, go, I do not care, let me alone to say my Prayers. Ay but (said he) equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate upon <hi>a Beaumon le viconte.</hi> I cannot, said she. It is, said he, <hi>a beau con le vit mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te:</hi> and upon this pray to God to give you that which your noble Heart desireth; and I pray you give me these <hi>Patenotres.</hi> Take them (said she) and trouble me no longer. This done, she would have taken off her <hi>Patenotres,</hi> which were made of a kind of yellow Stone called <hi>Cestrin,</hi> and adorned with great Spots of Gold; but <hi>Panurge</hi> nimbly drew out one
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:46180:288"/>
of his Knives, wherewith he cut them off very handsomly; and whilst he was going away to carry them to the Brokers, he said to her, Will you have my Knife? No, no, said she. But (said he) to the Point, I am at your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, Body and Goods, Tripes and Bowels.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the Lady was not well content with the Want of her <hi>Patinotres,</hi> for they were one of her Implements to keep her Countenance by in the Church; then thought with her self, this bold flouting <hi>Royster</hi> is some giddy, fantastical, light-headed Fool of a strange Country; I shall never recover my <hi>Patenotres</hi> again, what will my Husband say? he will no doubt be angry with me; but I will tell him that a Thief hath cut them off from my Hands in the Church, which he will easily believe, seeing the End of the Ribbon left at my Girdle. After Dinner <hi>Panurge</hi> went to see her, carrying in his Sleeve a great Purse full of <hi>Palace-crowns,</hi> (called Counters) and began to say unto her, Which of us two loveth other best, you me, or I you? Whereunto she an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, As for me, I do not hate you; for as God commands, I love all the World. But to the Point, (said he) are not you in love with me? I have (said she) told you so many times already, that you should talk so no more to me; and if you speak of it again, I will teach you, that I am not one to be talked unto dishonestly: get you hence packing, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

me my <hi>Patenotres,</hi> that my Husband may not ask me for them.</p>
                     <p>How now, <hi>(Madam)</hi> said he, your <hi>Pate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notres?</hi> Nay, by mine Oath I will not do so, but I will give you others; had you rather have them of Gold well enamelled in great round Knobs, or after the manner of Love-knots, or otherwise all massive, like great <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots</hi>; or if you had rather have them of <hi>Ebene,</hi> of <hi>Iacinth,</hi> or of <hi>grained</hi> Gold, with the Marks of fine <hi>Turkoises,</hi> or of fair <hi>Topazes,</hi> marked with fine <hi>Saphirs,</hi> or of <hi>baleu Rubies,</hi> with great Marks of <hi>Diamonds</hi> of eight and twenty Squares? No, no, all this is too little. I know a fair Bracelet of fine <hi>Emeraulds,</hi> marked with spotted <hi>Ambergris,</hi> and at the Buckle a <hi>Persian Pearl</hi> as big as an Orange; it will not cost above five and twenty thousand Ducats, I will make you a Present of it, for I have ready Coin enough; and withal he made a Noise with his Counters as if they had been <hi>French</hi> Crowns.</p>
                     <p>Will you have a Piece of Velvet, either of the Violet Colour, or of Crimson died in Grain; or a piece of broached or crimson Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin? Will you have Chains, Gold, Tablets, Rings? You need no more but say, Yes; so far as fifty thousand Ducats may reach, it is but as nothing to me. By the Virtue of which Words he made the Water come in her Mouth. But she said unto him, No, I thank you, I will have nothing of you. By G— said he,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:46180:289"/>
but I will have somewhat of you; yet shall it be that which shall cost you nothing, neither shall you have a jot the less, when you have given it: hold, (shewing his long <hi>Codpiece</hi>) this is Master <hi>Iohn Goodfellow,</hi> that asks for Lodging, and with that would have imbraced her; but she began to cry out, yet not very loud. Then <hi>Panurge</hi> put off his counterfeit Garb, changed his false Visage, and said unto her, You will not then otherways let me do a little, a Turd for you, you do not deserve so much Good, nor so much Honour: but by G— I will make the Dogs ride you, and with this he ran away as fast as he could, for fear of Blows, whereof he was naturally fearful.</p>

                     <p>NOW you must note that the next Day was the great Festival of <hi>Corpus Christi,</hi> called the <hi>Sacre,</hi> wherein all Women put on their best Apparel; and on that Day the said Lady was clothed in a rich Gown of Crimson-Sattin, under which she wore a very costly white Velvet Petticoat.</p>
                     <p>Now on the <hi>Vigil, Panurge</hi> searched so long of one side and another, that he found a hot or salt Bitch, which when he had tied her

with his Girdle, he led to his Chamber, and fed her very well all that Day and Night; in the Morning thereafter he killed her, and took that Part of her which the <hi>Greek Geomanciers</hi> know, and cut it into several Pieces as small as he could; then carrying it away as close as might be, he went to the Place where the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> was to come along to follow the <hi>Procession,</hi> as the Custom is upon the said Holy Day. And when she came in, <hi>Panurge</hi> sprinkled some ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Water on her, saluting her very courteously.

                     <p>And as she was opening this Paper to see what it was, <hi>Panurge</hi> very promptly and lightly scattered the Drug that he had upon her in divers Places, but especially in the Plaits of her Sleeves, and of her Gown: then said he unto her, <hi>Madam,</hi> the poor Lovers are not always at ease. As for me, I hope that those heavy Nights, those Pains and Troubles which I suffer for Love of you, shall be a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to me of so much Pain in Purgatory: yet at the least pray to God to give me Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in my Misery. <hi>Panurge</hi> had no sooner spoke this, but all the Dogs that were in the Church came running to this Lady with the Smell of the Drugs that he had strowed upon her, both small and great, big and little, all came, laying out their Member; smelling to her, and pissing every where upon her; it was the greatest Villany in the World.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Panurge</hi> made some Offers of driving them away; then took his leave of her, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himself into a Chappel or Oratory of the said Church, to see the Sport; for these villanous Dogs did compiss all her Habilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and left none of her Attire unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sprinkled
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:46180:291"/>
with their Staling, in so much that a tall Grey-hound piss'd upon her Head; others in her Sleeves; others on her Crupper-piece; and the little ones pissed upon her Pattains: so that all the Women that were round about her had much ado to save her. Whereat <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi> very heartily laughing, he said to one of the Lords of the City, I believe that the same Lady is hot, or else that some Grey-hound hath covered her lately. And when he saw that all the Dogs were flocking about her, yarring at the Retardment of their Access to her, and every way keeping such a Coil with her as they are wont to do about a proud or salt Bitch; he forthwith departed from thence, and went to call <hi>Pantagruel</hi>; not forgetting in his way alongst all the Streets thorow which he went, where he found any Dogs, to give them a Bang with his Foot, saying, Will you not go with your Fellows to the <hi>Wedding?</hi> Away hence, <hi>avant, avant, with a Devil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</hi> And being come home, he said to <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> Master, I pray you come and see all the Dogs of the Country, how they are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled about a Lady, the fairest in the City, and would dufle and line her. Whereunto <hi>Pantagruel</hi> willingly condescended, and saw the Mystery, which he found very pretty and strange. But the best was at the Procession, in which were seen above six hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand and fourteen Dogs about her, which did very much trouble and molest her; and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersoever
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:46180:291"/>
she pass'd, those Dogs that came afresh, tracing her Footsteps, followed her at the Heels, and piss'd in the way where her Gown had touched.</p>
                     <p>All the World stood gazing at this Spectacle, considering the Countenance of those Dogs, who leaping up got about her Neck, and spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all her gorgeous Accoutrements, for the which she could find no Remedy, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire unto her House, which was a Palace. Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther she went, and the Dogs after her; she ran to hide her self, but the Chamber-maids could not abstain from Laughing. When she was entred into the House, and had shut the Door upon her self, all the Dogs came running, of half a League round, and did so well bepiss the Gate of her House, that there they made a Stream with their Urine, wherein a Duck might have very well swimmed, and it is the same Current that now runs at St. <hi>Victor,</hi> in which <hi>Gobelin</hi> dieth Scarlet, for the specifical Vertue of these Piss-Dogs, as our Master <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus</hi> did heretofore preach publickly.

                     </head>
                     <p>A Little while after <hi>Pantagruel</hi> heard News that his Father <hi>Gargantua</hi> had been translated into the Land of the <hi>Fairies</hi> by <hi>Morgue,</hi> as heretofore were <hi>Oger</hi> and <hi>Arthur:</hi> and that the Report of his Translation being spread abroad, the <hi>Dipsodes</hi> had issued out beyond their Borders, with Inrodes had wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted a great part of <hi>Vtopia,</hi> and at that very time had besieged the great City of the <hi>Amau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rots.</hi> Whereupon departing from <hi>Paris,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bidding any Man farewel, for the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness required Diligence, he came to <hi>Rowen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Pantagruel</hi> in his Journey, seeing that the Leagues of that little Territory about <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> called <hi>France,</hi> were very short in regard of those of other Countries, demanded the cause and reason of it from <hi>Panurge</hi>; who told him a Story which <hi>Marotus du Lac Monachus</hi> set down in the Acts of the Kings of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narre</hi>; saying, that in old times Countries were not distinguished into Leagues, Miles, Furlongs, nor Parasanges, until that King <hi>Pharamond</hi> divided them, which was done in
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:46180:292"/>
manner as followeth. The said King chose at <hi>Paris</hi> a hundred fair, gallant, lusty, brisk young Men, all resolute and bold Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in <hi>Cupid</hi>'s Duels, together with a hundred comely, pretty, handsome, lovely and well complexioned Wenches of <hi>Picardy,</hi> all which he caused to be well entertained, and highly fed for the space of eight days; then having called for them, he delivered to every one of the young Men his Wench, with store of Money to defray their Charges, and this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction besides, to go unto divers Places here and there. And wheresoever they should bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cot and thrum their Wenches, that they setting a Stone there, it should be accounted for a League. Thus went away those brave Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows and sprightly Blades most merrily, and because they were fresh, and had been at rest, they were jumming and tumbling almost at every Field's end, and this is the Cause why the Leagues about <hi>Paris</hi> are so short. But when they had gone a great way, and were now as weary as poor Devils, all the Oil in their Lamps being almost spent, they did not chink and dufle so often, but content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves, (I mean for the Mens part) with one scurvy paultry Bout in a day. And this is that which makes the Leagues in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany, Delanes, Germany,</hi> and other more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Countries so long. Other Men give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reasons for it, but this seems to me of all other the best. To which <hi>Pantagruel</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly

                     <p>WHen <hi>Pantagruel</hi> had read the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, he was much amazed, and therefore demanded of the said Messenger the Name of her that had sent it.

Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering at this, he called <hi>Panurge</hi> to him, and

shewed him the case; whereupon <hi>Panurge</hi> told him, that the Leaf of Paper was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon, but with such Cunning and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that no Man could see the Writing at the first sight; therefore to find it out, he set it by the Fire, to see if it was made with <hi>Sal Almo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack</hi> soaked in Water: then put he it into the Water, to see if the Letter was written with the Juice of <hi>Tithymalle.</hi> After that he held it up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Candle, to see if it was written with the Juice of <hi>white Onions.</hi>

Afterwards he rubbed one Corner with the Ashes of a Swallow's Nest, to see if it were not written with the Dew that is found within the Herb <hi>Alcakengy,</hi> called the Winter-cherry. He rubbed after that one end with Ear-wax, to see if it were not written with the <hi>Gall</hi> of a <hi>Raven.</hi> Then did he dip it into Vineger, to try if it was not written with the Juice of the Garden <hi>Spurge.</hi> After that he greased it with the Fat of a Bat or Flittermouse, to see if it was not written with the <hi>Sperm</hi> of a <hi>Whale,</hi> which some call <hi>Ambergris.</hi> Then put it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fairly into a Basin full of fresh Water, and forthwith took it out, to see whether it were written with <hi>Stone-allum.</hi> But after all Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments,

when he perceived that he could find out nothing, he called the Messenger, and asked him, <hi>Good Fellow,</hi> the Lady that sent thee hither, did she not give thee a Staff to bring with thee? thinking that it had been according to the Conceit, whereof <hi>Aulus Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> maketh mention; and the Messenger an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered him, <hi>No, Sir.</hi> Then <hi>Panurge</hi> would have caused his Head to be shaven, to see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Lady had written upon his bald Pate, with the hard Lee whereof Sope is made, that which she meant; but perceiving that his Hair was very long, he forbore, considering that it could not have grown to so great a length in so short a time.</p>
                     <p>Then he said to <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> Master, by the Virtue of G— I cannot tell what to do nor say in it. For to know whether there be any thing written upon this or no, I have made use of a good part of that which Master <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisco di Nianto,</hi> the <hi>Tuscan</hi> sets down, who hath written the <hi>Manner</hi> of <hi>reading Letters that do not appear.</hi> That which <hi>Zoroastes</hi> published, <hi>Peri grammaton acriton.</hi> And <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurnius Bassus de literis illigibilibus.</hi> But I can see nothing, nor do I believe that there is any thing else in it than the Ring. Let us therefore look upon it; which when they had done, they found this in <hi>Hebrew</hi> written with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <hi>Lamach sabathani</hi>; whereupon they called <hi>Epistemon,</hi> and asked him what that meant? to which he answered, that they were <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>
                        <pb n="151" facs="tcp:46180:294"/>
Words, signifying, <hi>Wherefore hast thou forsaken me?</hi> Upon that <hi>Panurge</hi> suddenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, I know the Mystery, do you see this <hi>Diamond?</hi> it is a false one. This then is the Exposition of that which the Lady means, <hi>Diamant faux</hi>; that is, <hi>false Lover, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> Which Interpretation <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel</hi> presently understood, and withal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering, that at his Departure he had not bid the <hi>Lady</hi> farewel; he was very sorry, and would fain have returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> to make his Peace with her. But <hi>Epistemon</hi> put him in mind of <hi>Aeneas</hi>'s Departure from <hi>Dido,</hi> and the Saying of <hi>Heraclitus</hi> of <hi>Tarentum,</hi> That <hi>the Ship being at anchor when need requireth, we must cut the Cable rather than lose time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout untying of it.</hi> And that he should lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side all other Thoughts to succour the City of his Nativity, which was then in danger. And indeed within an Hour after that, the Wind arose at the <hi>North North-west</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they hoised Sail, and put out, even into the main Sea; so that within few Days, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing by <hi>Porto Sancto,</hi> and by the <hi>Maderas,</hi> they went Ashore in the <hi>Canary</hi> Islands: Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from thence, they passed by <hi>Capobianco,</hi> by <hi>Senege,</hi> by <hi>Capoverde,</hi> by <hi>Gambre,</hi> by <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gres,</hi> by <hi>Melli,</hi> by the <hi>Cap di buona Speranza,</hi> and set ashore again in the Kingdom of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda:</hi> parting from thence, they sailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with a <hi>Tramoutan</hi> or Northerly Wind, passing by <hi>Meden,</hi> by <hi>Vti,</hi> by <hi>Vden,</hi> by <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasim,</hi>
                        <pb n="152" facs="tcp:46180:295"/>
by the Isles of the <hi>Fairies,</hi> and alongst the Kingdom of <hi>Achory,</hi> till at last they arrived at the Port of <hi>Vtopia,</hi> distant from the City of the <hi>Amaurots</hi> three Leagues and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more.</p>
                     <p>When they were ashore, and pretty well refreshed, <hi>Pantagruel</hi> said, Gentlemen, the City is not far from hence, therefore were it not amiss before we set forward, to advise well what is to be done, that we be not like the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,</hi> who never took Counsel until after the Fact: Are you resolved to live and die with me? Yes, Sir, said they all, and be as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of us, as of your own Fingers. Well, (said he) there is but one thing that keeps my Mind in great doubt and suspense, which is this, that I know not in what Order nor of what Number the Enemy is, that layeth siege to the City; for if I were certain of that, I should go forward, and set on with the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter assurance. Let us therefore consult toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and bethink our selves by what means we may come to this Intelligence. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they all said, Let us go thither and see, and stay you here for us; for this very Day, without further respite, do we make account to bring you a certain Report thereof.</p>
                     <p>My self (said <hi>Panurge</hi>) will undertake to enter into their Camp, within the very midst of their Guards, unespied by their Watch, and merrily feast and lecher it at their cost, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being known of any, to see the Artillery
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:46180:295"/>
and the Tents of all the Captains, and thrust my self in with a grave and magnifick Carriage, amongst all their Troops and Companies, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being discovered, the Devil would not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to peck me out with all his Circumven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: for I am of the Race of <hi>Zopyrus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And I (said <hi>Epistemon</hi>) know all the Plots and Stratagems of the valiant Captains, and warlike Champions of former Ages, together with all the Tricks and Subtilties of the Art of War. I will go, and though I be detected and revealed, I will escape, by making them believe of you whatever I please; for I am of the Race of <hi>Sinon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I (said <hi>Eusthenes</hi>) will enter and set upon them in their Trenches, in spight of their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and all their Guards; for I will tread up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Bellies, and break their Legs and Arms, yea though they were every whit as strong as the Devil himself; for I am of the Race of <hi>Hercules.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And I (said <hi>Carpalin</hi>) will get in there, if the Birds can enter; for I am so nimble of Body, and light withal, that I shall have leaped over their Trenches, and ran clean through all their Camp, before that they perceive me: neither do I fear Shot, nor Arrow, nor Horse, how swift soever, were he the <hi>Pegasus</hi> of <hi>Persee,</hi> or <hi>

                     <head>CHAP XXV. How <hi>Panurge, Carpalin, Eusthenes</hi> and <hi>Episte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> (the Gentlemen Attendants of <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel</hi>) vanquished and discomfited six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and threescore Horse-men very cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly.</head>
                     <p>AS he was speaking this, they perceived six hundred and threescore light Horse-men, gallantly mounted, who came to discover what Ship and Company it was that was newly arrived in the Harbour; and came in a full Gallop to take them if they had been able. Then said <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> my Lads, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire your selves unto the Ship, here are some of our Enemies coming apace, but I will kill them here before you like Beasts, although they were ten times so many; in the mean time withdraw your selves, and take your sport at it. Then answered <hi>Panurge,</hi> No, Sir, there is no reason that you should do so; but on the contrary, retire you unto the Ship, both you and the rest; for I alone will here discomfit them, but we must not linger, come, set forward. Whereunto the others said, It is well advised; Sir, withdraw your self, and we will help <hi>Panurge</hi> here, so shall you know
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:46180:296"/>
what we are able to do. Then said <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> Well, I am content, but if that you be too weak, I will not fail to come to your assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
                     <p>With this <hi>Panurge</hi> took two great Cables of the Ship, and tied them to the <hi>Capstane</hi> which was on the Deck towards the Hatches, and fastned them in the Ground, making a long Circuit, the one further off, the other within that. Then said he to <hi>Epistemon,</hi> Go aboard the Ship, and when I give you a Call, turn about the <hi>Capstane</hi> upon the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop</hi> diligently, drawing unto you the two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-robes. And said to <hi>Eusthenes,</hi> and to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palin, My Bullies,</hi> stay you here, and offer your selves freely to your Enemies, do as they bid you, and make as if you would yield unto them: but take heed you come not within the Compass of the Ropes; be sure to keep your selves free of them. And presently he went aboard the Ship, and took a Bundle of Straw, and a Barrel of Gun-powder, strewed it round about the Compass of the Cords, and stood by with a Brand of Fire or Match lighted in his Hand. Presently came the Horse-men with great Fury, and the foremost ran almost home to the Ship; and by reason of the Slipperiness of the Bank, they fell they and their Horses, to the number of four and fourty; which the rest seeing, came on, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Resistance had been made them at their arrival. But <hi>Panurge</hi> said unto them,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:46180:297"/>
My Masters, I believe that you have hurt your selves; I pray you pardon us, for it is not our Fault, but the Slipperiness of the Sea-water that is always flowing: we sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our selves to your good pleasure: So said likewise his two other Fellows, and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistemon</hi> that was upon the Deck. In the mean time, <hi>Panurge</hi> withdrew himself, and seeing that they were all within the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of the Cables, and that his two Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions were retired, making room for all those Horses which came in a Croud, thronging up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Neck of one another to see the Ship, and such as were in it, cried out on a sudden to <hi>Epistemon,</hi> Draw, draw. Then began <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistemon</hi> to wind about the <hi>Capstane,</hi> by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof the two Cables so intangled and impestered the Legs of the Horses, that they were all of them thrown down to the Ground easily, together with their Riders. But they seeing that, drew their Swords, and would have cut them. Whereupon <hi>Panurge</hi> set Fire to the Train, and there burnt them up all like damned Souls, both Men and Horses, not one escaping save one alone; who being mounted on a fleet <hi>Turky</hi> Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, by meer speed in Flight got himself out of the Circle of the Ropes. But when <hi>Carpalin</hi> perceived him, he ran after him with such Nimbleness and Celerity, that he overtook him in less than a hundred Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; than leaping close behind him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:46180:297"/>
the Crupper of his Horse, clasped him in his Arms, and brought him back to the Ship.</p>
                     <p>This Exploit being ended, <hi>Pantagruel</hi> was very jovial, and wondrously commended the Industry of these Gentlemen, whom he called his <hi>Fellow-Souldiers,</hi> and made them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh themselves, and feed well and merrily upon the Sea-shore, and drink heartily with their Bellies upon the Ground, and their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner with them, whom they admitted to that Familiarity; only that the poor Devil was not well assured but that <hi>Pantagruel</hi> would have eaten him up whole; which, considering the Wideness of his Mouth, and Capacity of his Throat, was no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for him to have done; for he could have done it, as easily as you would eat a small Comfit, he shewing no more in his Throat than would a Grain of Millet-Seed in the Mouth of an Ass.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXVI. How <hi>Pantagruel</hi> and his Company were weary in eating still salt Meats: and how <hi>Carpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> went a hunting to have some Venison.</head>
                     <p>THus as they talked and chatted together, <hi>Carpalin</hi> said, And by the Belly of St. <hi>Quenet,</hi> shall we never eat any Venison? this salt Meat makes me horribly dry. I will go fetch you a Quarter of one of those Horses which we have burnt, it is well roasted already. As he was rising up to go about it, he perceived under the side of a Wood a fair great <hi>Roe-Buck,</hi> which was come out of his Fort (as I conceive) at the sight of <hi>Panurge</hi>'s fire. Him did he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue and run after with as much Vigour and Swiftness as if it had been a Bolt out of a Cross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, and caught him in a moment; and whilst he was in his Course, he with his Hands took in the Air four great <hi>Bustards,</hi> seven <hi>Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns,</hi> six and twenty <hi>gray Partridges,</hi> two and thirty <hi>red legged</hi> Ones, sixteen <hi>Pheasants,</hi> nine <hi>Woodcocks,</hi> nineteen <hi>Herons,</hi> two and thirty <hi>Coushots</hi> and <hi>Ring-Doves:</hi> and with his Feet killed ten or twelve <hi>Hares</hi> and <hi>Rabbets,</hi> which were then at relief, and pretty big withal.

Then the good <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> thinking he had fainted, commanded them to provide him some Vineger. But <hi>Panurge</hi> knew well that there was some good Prey in hands, and forthwith shewed unto noble <hi>Pantagruel</hi> how he was bearing upon his Back a fair <hi>Roe-Buck,</hi> and all his Girdle bordered with Hares; then imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately did <hi>Epistemon</hi> make <hi>in the name of the nine Muses,</hi> nine antick wooden Spits. <hi>Eust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes</hi> did help to flay, and <hi>Panurge</hi> placed two great Cuirasier Saddles in such sort, that they served for Andirons; and making their Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to be their Cook, they roasted their Veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son by the Fire, wherein the Horsemen were burnt.

                     <p>But, said <hi>Panurge,</hi> it were better we thought a little upon our business, and by what means
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:46180:299"/>
we might get the upper hand of our Enemies· That is well remembred, said <hi>Pantagruel</hi>; therefore spoke he thus to the Prisoner, <hi>My Friend,</hi> tell us here the truth, and do not lie to us at all, if thou wouldest not be slayed alive, for it is I that eat the little Children: relate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us at full, the Order, the Number, and the Strength of the Army. To which the Prisoner answered, <hi>Sir,</hi> know for a truth that in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my there are three hundred <hi>Giants,</hi> all armed with Armour of proof, and wonderful great: nevertheless, not fully so great as you, except one that is their head, named <hi>Loup-garou,</hi> who is armed from Head to Foot with <hi>Cyclopical</hi> Annvils. Furthermore, one hundred three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score and three thousand Foot, all armed with the Skins of <hi>Hobgoblins,</hi> strong and valiant Men; eleven thousand four hundred Cuirasiers; three thousand six hundred double Canons, and Harque-busiers without number; fourscore and fourteen thousand Pioneers: one hundred and fifty thousand <hi>Whores</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fair like Goddesses, (that is for me, said <hi>Panurge.</hi>) Whereof some are <hi>Amazons,</hi> some <hi>Lionnoises,</hi> others <hi>Parisien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, Taurangelles, Angevines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Poictevines, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi> and high <hi>Dutch</hi>; there are of them of all Countrys and all Languages.</p>
                     <p>Yea, but (said <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) is the King there? Yes, Sir, (said the Prisoner) he is there in Person, and we call him <hi>Anarchus,</hi> King of the <hi>Dipsodes</hi>; which is as much to say, as <hi>thirsty People</hi>; for you never saw Men more
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:46180:299"/>
thirsty, nor more willing to drink; and his Tent is guarded by the Giants. It is enough, (said <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) come brave Boys, are you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to go with me? To which <hi>Panurge</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, God confound him that leaves you. I have already bethought my self how I will kill them all like Pigs, and so that the Devil one Leg of them shall escape. But I am somewhat troubled about one thing. And what is that? said <hi>Pantagruel:</hi> It is (said <hi>Panurge</hi>) how I shall be able to set forward to the <hi>jusling</hi> and <hi>bragmardising</hi> of all the Whores that be there this Afternoon, in such sort, that there escape not one unbumped by me; breasted and jum'd after the ordinary Fashion of Man and Women. Ha, ha, ha, ha, said <hi>Pantagruel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And <hi>Carpalin</hi> said, The Devil take these Sink-holes, if by G— I do not bumbast some one of them.</p>
                     <p>And I, (said <hi>Eusthenes</hi>) what d'ye make of me? who since we came from <hi>Rowen</hi> have never been wound up that my Needle could mount above to ten or eleven a Clock, now stiff and strong, like a hundred Devils? Truly, (said <hi>Panurge</hi>) thou shalt have of the fattest, and of those that are most plump, and in the case.</p>
                     <p>How now, (said <hi>Epistemon</hi>) every <hi>one shall ride,</hi> and <hi>I must lead the Ass?</hi> the Devil take him that will do so. We will make use of the right of War, <hi>Qui potest capere, capiat.</hi> No, no, said <hi>Panurge,</hi> but tie thine Ass to a Crook,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:46180:300"/>
and ride as the World doth. And the good <hi>Pantagruel</hi> laughed at all this, and said unto them, <hi>You reckon without your Host.</hi> I am much afraid, that before it be Night I shall see you in such taking, that you will have no great sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach to ride<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but more like to be rode upon, with sound Blows of Pike and Lance.</p>
                     <p>Enough of that, said <hi>Epistemon,</hi> I will not fall to bring them to you, either to rost or boil, to fry or put in Paste. They are not so many in number as were in the Army of <hi>Xerxes</hi>; for he had thirty hundred thousand sighting Men, if you will believe <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus Pompeius</hi>; and yet <hi>Themistocles</hi> with a few Men overthrew them all. For God's sake take you no care for that. <hi>Cobsminnie, Cobsminnie,</hi> (said <hi>Panurge</hi>) my <hi>Cod-piece</hi> alone shall suffice to overthrow all the Men: and St. <hi>Sweephole</hi> that dwells within it, shall lay all the Women squat upon their Backs. Up then my Lads (said <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) and let us march along.</p>

                     <p>Then (said <hi>Pantagruel</hi>), Come, my Lads, let us be gone, we have stayed here too long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our Victuals; for very seldom doth it fall out, that the greatest Eaters do the most Martial Exploits. There is no <hi>Shadow</hi> like that of fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Colours, no <hi>Smoke</hi> like that of Horses, no <hi>Clattering</hi> like that of Armour. At this <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistemon</hi> began to smile, and said, There is no <hi>Shadow</hi> like that of the Kitchin, no <hi>Smoke</hi> like that of Pasties, and no <hi>Clattering</hi> like that of Goblets. Unto which answered <hi>Panurge,</hi> There is no <hi>Shadow</hi> like that of Courtains, no <hi>Smoke</hi> like that of Womens Breasts, and no <hi>Clattering</hi> like that of Ballocks: then forthwith rising
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:46180:302"/>
up he gave a Fart, a Leap, and a Whistle, and most joyfully cried out aloud, <hi>Ever live, Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel.</hi> When <hi>Pantagruel</hi> saw that, he would have done as much; but with the Fart that he let, the Earth trembled nine Leagues about; wherewith, and with the corrupted Air, he begot above three and fifty thousand little Men, ill favoured Dwarfs; and with one Fisg that he let, he made as many little Women, crouching down, as you shall see in divers places, which never grow but like Cows Tails downwards, or like the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosin</hi> Radishes, round. How now, (said <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi>) are your <hi>Farts</hi> so fertil? by G— here be brave <hi>farted</hi> Men, and <hi>fisgued</hi> Women; let them be married together, they will beget fine Hornets and Dorflies. So did <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> and called them <hi>Pigmies.</hi> Those he sent to live in an Island thereby, where since that time they are increased mightily: but the <hi>Cranes</hi> make War with them continually, against which they do most couragiously defend themselves; for these little Ends of Men and Dandiprats, (whom in <hi>Scotland</hi> they call Whiphandles, and Knots of a Tar-barrel) are commonly very teasty and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick. The Physical Reason whereof, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their Heart is near their Turd.</p>
                     <p>At this same time, <hi>Panurge</hi> took two drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glasses that were there, both of one bigness, and filled them with Water up to the brim, and set one of them upon one Stool, and the other upon another, placing them above five Foot from one another: then he took the Staff of a
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:46180:302"/>
Javelin, about five Foot and a half long, and put it upon the two Glasses, so that the two ends of the Staff did come just to the Brims of the Glasses. This done, he took a great Stake, and said to <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> and to the rest; <hi>My Masters,</hi> behold, how easily we shall have the Victory over our Enemies; for just as I shall break this Staff here upon these Glasses, with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But that you may not think there is any <hi>Witchcraft</hi> in this, hold (said he to <hi>Eusthenes</hi>) strike upon the midst as hard as thou canst with this Log. <hi>Eusthenes</hi> did so, and the Staff broke in two pieces, and not one drop of the Water fell out of the Glasses. Then said he, I know a great many such other Tricks, let us now therefore march boldly.</p>

                     <p>AFter all this Talk <hi>Pantagruel</hi> took the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner to him, and sent him away, saying, Go thou unto thy King in his Camp, and tell him Tidings of what thou hast seen, and let
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:46180:303"/>
him resolve to feast me to Morrow about Noon; for as soon as my Galleys shall come, which will be to Morrow at farthest, I will prove unto him by eighteen hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand fighting Men, and seven thousand Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, all of them greater than I am; that he hath done foolishly and against Reason, thus to invade my Country: wherein <hi>Pantagruel</hi> feigned that he had an Army at Sea. But the Prisoner answered, That he would yield him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be his Slave; and that he was content never to return to his own People, but rather with <hi>Pantagruel</hi> to fight against them; and for God's sake besought him, that he might be permitted so to do. Whereunto <hi>Pantagruel</hi> would not give Consent, but commanded him to depart thence speedily, and be gone, as he had told him, and to that Effect gave him a Box full of <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> together with some Grains of the black <hi>Chameleon Thistle,</hi> steeped in <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> and made up into the Condiment of a wet Sucket, commanding him to carry it to his King, and to say unto him, that if he were able to eat one Ounce of that without drinking after it, he might then be able to resist him, without any Fear or Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of Danger.</p>
                     <p>The Prisoner then besought him with joint Hands, that in the Hour of the Battel he would have Compassion upon him. Whereat <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel</hi> said unto him, After that thou hast delivered all unto the King, put thy whole
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:46180:303"/>
Confidence in God, and he will not forsake thee: Because, although for my Part I be mighty, as thou mayst see, and have an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Number of Men in Arms, I do neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less trust neither in my Force nor in mine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, but all my Confidence is in God my Protector, who doth never forsake those that in him do put their Trust and Confidence. This done, the Prisoner requested him that he would be contented with some reasonable Composition for his Ransom. To which <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel</hi> answered, that his End was <hi>not to rob nor ransom Men, but to enrich them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to total Liberty:</hi> Go thy way (said he) in the Peace of the living God, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver follow evil Company, lest some Mischief befal thee. The Prisoner being gone, <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel</hi> said to his Men, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I have made this Prisoner believe that we have an Army at Sea, as also that we will not assault them till to Morrow at Noon, to the end, that they doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the great Arrival of our Men, may spend this Night in providing and strengthning themselves; but in the mean time my Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, that we charge them about the Hour of the first Sleep.</p>
                     <p>Let us leave <hi>Pantagruel</hi> here with his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and speak of King <hi>Anarchus</hi> and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. When the Prisoner was come, he went unto the King, and told him how there was a great Giant come, called <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> who had overthrown, and made to be cruelly roasted
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:46180:304"/>
all the six hundred and fifty nine Horsemen, and he alone escaped to bring the News. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that, he was charged by the said Giant to tell him, that the next Day about Noon he must make a Dinner ready for him, for at that Hour he was resolved to set upon him. Then did he give him that Box wherein were those Confitures; but as soon as he had swallowed down one spoonful of them, he was taken with such a Heat in the Throat, together with an Ulceration in the Flap of the Top of the Wind-pipe, that his Tongue peel'd with it in such Sort, that for all they could do unto him, he found no Ease at all, but by drinking only without Cessation: for as soon as ever he took the Goblet from his Head, his Tongue was on a Fire; and therefore they did nothing but still pour in Wine into his Throat with a Funnel.</p>
                     <p>Which when his Captains, <hi>Bashaws,</hi> and Guard of his Body did see, they tasted of the same Drugs, to try whether on them they would have the same Operation or no: but it so befel them as it had done their King; and they plied the Flagon so well, that the Noise ran throughout all the Camp, how the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was returned; that the next Day they were to have an Assault; that the King and his Captains did already prepare themselves for it, together with his Guards, and that with ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowsing lustily, and quaffing as hard as they could. Every Man therefore in the Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to tipple, ply the Pot, swill and guzzle,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:46180:304"/>
till in fine they fell asleep like Pigs, all out of Order throughout the whole Camp.</p>
                     <p>Let us now return to the good <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> and relate how he carried himself in this Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Departing from the Place of the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies,</hi> he took the Mast of their Ship in his Hand like a Pilgrim's Staff, and put within the Top of it two hundred and thirty seven Punchions of White-wine of <hi>Anjou,</hi> the rest was of <hi>Rowen</hi>; and tied up to his Girdle the Bark all full of Salt, as easily as the <hi>Lansken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets</hi> carry their little Panniers; and so set on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on his way with his Fellow-souldiers. When he was come near to the Enemies Camp, <hi>Panurge</hi> said unto him, <hi>Sir,</hi> if you would do well, let down this White-wine of <hi>Anjou</hi> from the Scuttle of the Mast of the Ship, that we may all drink thereof, like <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hereunto <hi>Pantagruel</hi> very willingly consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they drank so neat, that there was not so much as one poor Drop left of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty seven Punchions, except one leathern Bottle of <hi>Tours,</hi> which <hi>Panurge</hi> filled for himself, (for he called that his <hi>Vade me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi>) and some scurvy Lees of Wine in the bottom, which served him in stead of Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. After they had whitled and curried the Can pretty handsomly, <hi>Panurge</hi> gave <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel</hi> to eat some devilish Drugs, compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of <hi>Lithotripton, Nephrocatarticon,</hi> the Marmalade of Quinces, with <hi>Cantharides,</hi> and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:46180:305"/>
other <hi>Diureticks.</hi> This done, <hi>Pantagruel</hi> said to <hi>Carpalin,</hi> Go into the City, scrambling like a Cat up against the Wall, as you can well do, and tell them that now presently they come out, and charge their Enemies as rudely as they can; and having said so, come down, taking a lighted Torch with you, wherewith you shall set on fire all the Tents and Pavilions in the Camp; then cry as loud as you are able with your great Voice, and then come away from thence. Yea but, said <hi>Carpalin,</hi> were it not good to nail all their Ordnance? No, no, (said <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) only blow up all their Powder. <hi>Carpalin</hi> obeying him, departed suddenly, and did as he was appointed by <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel</hi>; and all the Combatants came forth that were in the City: And when he had set fire in the Tents and Pavilions, he pass'd so lightly through them, and so highly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly did they snort and sleep, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver perceived him. He came to the Place where their Artillery was, and set their Munition on fire; but here was the Danger, the Fire was so sudden, that poor <hi>Carpalin</hi> had almost been burnt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and had it not been for his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Agility, he had been fried like a roasting Pig; but he departed away so speedily, that a Bolt or Arrow out of a Crossbow could not have had a swifter Motion. When he was clear of their Trenches, he shouted aloud, and cried out so dreadfully, and with such Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Hearers, that it seemed all the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:46180:305"/>
Devils of Hell had been let loose. At which Noise the Enemies awaked, but can you tell how? even no less astonished than are <hi>Monks</hi> at the ringing of the first Peal to <hi>Matins,</hi> which in <hi>Lusonnois</hi> is called <hi>Rubbalock.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Pantagruel</hi> began to sow the Salt that he had in his Bark, and because they slept with an open gaping Mouth, he filled all their Throats with it, so that those poor Wretches were by it made to cough like Foxes. Ha, <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> how thou addest greater Heat to the Firebrand that is in us. Suddenly <hi>Pantagruel</hi> had will to piss, by Means of the Drugs which <hi>Panurge</hi> had given him, and piss'd amidst the Camp so well and so copiously, that he drowned them all, and there was a particular Deluge ten Leagues round about; the History saith, if his Father's great Mare had been there, and piss'd likewise, it would undoubtedly have been a more enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Deluge than that of <hi>Deucalion</hi>; for she did never piss but she made a River, greater than is either the <hi>Rhosne</hi> or the <hi>Danube</hi>; which those that were come out of the City, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, said, They are all cruelly slain, see how the Blood runs along: but they were deceived, in thinking <hi>Pantagruel</hi>'s Urine had been the Blood of their Enemies; for they could not see but by the Light of the Fire of the Pavilions, and some small Light of the Moon.</p>
                     <p>The Enemies after that they were awaked, seeing on one side the Fire in the Camp, and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:46180:306"/>
on the other the Inundation of the urinal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, could <hi>not tell what to say, nor what to think:</hi> Some said, that it was the End of the World, and the final Judgment, which ought to be by Fire. Others again thought, that the Sea-Gods, <hi>Neptune, Protheus, Triton,</hi> and the rest of them, did persecute them, for that indeed they found it to be like Sea-water and Salt.</p>

Well, (said <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) of Courage I have more than for fifty Franks; but let us be wise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for <hi>Hercules never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took against two</hi> that is well <hi>cack'd,</hi> well <hi>scum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mered:</hi> (said <hi>Panurge</hi>) do you compare your self with <hi>Hercules?</hi> You have by G— more Strength in your Teeth, and more Scent in your Burn, than ever <hi>Hercules</hi> had in all his Body and Soul: so much is a Man worth as he esteems himself. Whilst they spake those Words, behold <hi>Loupgarou</hi> was come with all his Giants, who seeing <hi>Pantagruel</hi> in a manner alone, was carried away with Temerity and Presumption, for Hopes that he had to kill the good Man: whereupon he said to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions the Giants, You Wenchers of the Low-countrey, by <hi>Mahoon,</hi> if any of you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to fight against these Men here, I will
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:46180:307"/>
put you cruelly to Death: It is my Will that you let me fight single; in the mean time you shall have good Sport to look upon us. Then all the other Giants retired with their King to the Place where the Flagons stood, and <hi>Panurge</hi> and his <hi>Camerades</hi> with them, who counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited those that have had the Pox, for he wreathed about his Mouth, shrunk up his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and with a harsh and hoarse Voice said unto them, I forsake —od <hi>(Fellow-souldiers)</hi> if I would have it to be believed, that we make any War at all; give us somewhat to eat with you, whilst our Masters fight against one another. To this the King and Giants jointly condescended, and accordingly made them to banquet with them.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Panurge</hi> told them the Follies of <hi>Turpin,</hi> the Examples of St. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas,</hi> and the Tale of a Tub. <hi>Loupgarou</hi> then set forward towards <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> with a Mace all of Steel, and that of the best sort, weighing nine thousand seven hundred Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and two Quarterons, at the End whereof were thirteen pointed Diamonds, the least whereof was as big as the greatest Bell of our <hi>Ladies</hi> Church at <hi>Paris,</hi> (there might want perhaps the Thickness of a Nail, or (at most that I may not lie) of the Back of those Knives which they call Cut-lugs, but for a little off or on, more or less, it is no Matter) and it was inchanted in such sort, that it could never break, but contrarily all that it did touch did
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:46180:307"/>
break immediately. Thus then as he appoach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great Fierceness and Pride of Heart, <hi>Pantagruel</hi> casting up his Eyes to Heaven, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended himself to God with all his Soul, making such a Vow as followeth;</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>O thou Lord God, who hast always been my Protector and my Saviour, thou seest the Distress wherein I am at this Time: Nothing brings me hither but a natural Zeal, which thou hast permitted unto Mortals; to keep and defend themselves, their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Country and Family, in case thy own proper Cause were not in question, which is the <hi>Faith</hi>; for in such a Business thou wilt have no Coadjutors, only a Catholick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession and Service of thy Word, and hast forbidden us all Arming and Defence: for thou art the Almighty, who in thine own Cause, and where thine own Business is taken to Heart, canst defend it far beyond all that we can conceive; thou who hast thousand thousands of hundreds of Millions of Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Angels, the least of which is able to kill all mortal Men, and turn about the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and Earth at his Pleasure, as heretofore it very plainly appeared in the Army of <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib.</hi> If it may please thee therefore at this time to assist me, as my whole Trust and Confidence is in thee alone, I vow unto thee, that in all Countries whatsoever, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I shall have any Power or Authority, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this of <hi>Vtopia,</hi> or elsewhere, I will
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:46180:308"/>
cause thy holy Gospel to be purely, simply and entirely preached; so that the Abuses of a Rabble of Hypocrites and false Prophets, who by humane Constitutions and depraved Inventions have impoisoned all the World, shall be quite exterminated from about me.</q>
This Vow was no sooner made, but there was heard a Voice from Heaven, saying, <hi>Hoc f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                     </p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Pantagruel</hi> seeing that <hi>Loupgarou</hi> with his Mouth wide open was drawing near to him, went against him boldly, and cried out as loud as he was able, Thou diest, Villain, thou diest; purposing by his horrible Cry to make him afraid, according to the Discipline of the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> Withal, he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately cast at him out of his Bark which he wore at his Girdle, eighteen Cags, and four Bushels of Salt, wherewith he filled both his Mouth, Throat, Nose and Eyes. At this <hi>Loup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garou</hi> was so highly incensed, that most fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly setting upon him, he thought even then with a Blow of his Mace to have beat out his Brains: but <hi>Pantagruel</hi> was very nimble, and had always a quick Foot and a quick Eye, and therefore with his left Foot did he step back one Pace, yet not so nimbly, but that the Blow falling upon the Bark, broke it in four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand fourscore and six Pieces, and threw all the rest of the Salt about the Ground. <hi>Pantagruel</hi> seeing that, most gallantly displayed the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:46180:308"/>
of his Arms, and according to the Art of the Axe, gave him with the great End of his Mast a home-thrust a little above the Breast; then bringing along the Blow to the left side with a Slash, struck him between the Neck and Shoulders: After that, advancing his right Foot, he gave him a Push upon the Couillons, with the upper End of his said Mast, wherewith breaking the Scuttle, on the Top thereof he spilt three or four Punchions of Wine that were left therein.</p>
                     <p>Upon that <hi>Loupgarou</hi> thought that he had pierced his Bladder, and that the Wine that came forth had been his Urine: <hi>Pantagruel</hi> being not content with this, would have dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled it by a side-blow; but <hi>Loupgarou</hi> lifting up his Mace, advanced one Step upon him, and with all his Force would have dash'd it upon <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> wherein (to speak the Truth) he so sprightfully carried himself, that if God had not succoured the good <hi>Pantagru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> he had been cloven from the top of his Head to the bottom of his Milt; but the Blow glanced to the right side by the brisk Nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> and his Mace sank into the Ground above threescore and thirteen Foot, through a huge Rock, out of which the Fire did issue greater than nine thousand and six Tuns. <hi>Pantagruel</hi> seeing him busy about plucking out his Mace, which stuck in the Ground between the Rocks, ran upon him, and would have clean cut off his Head, if by
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:46180:309"/>
Mischance his Mast had not touched a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Stock of <hi>Loupgarou</hi>'s Mace, which was inchanted, as we have said before: by this means his Mast broke off about three-hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls above his Hands, whereat he stood amazed like a Bell-founder, and cried out, Ah <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge,</hi> where art thou? <hi>Panurge</hi> seeing that, said to the King and the Giants, By G— they will hurt one another if they be not parted; but the Giants were as merry as if they had been at a Wedding: Then <hi>Carpalin</hi> would have risen from thence to help his Master, but one of the Giants said unto him, By <hi>Golfarin</hi> the Nephew of <hi>Mahoon,</hi> if thou stir hence I will put thee in the bottom of my Breeches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of a Suppository, which cannot chuse but do me good; for in my Belly I am very costive, and cannot well <hi>cagar</hi> without gnash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Teeth, and making many filthy Faces.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> thus destitute of a Staff, took up the End of his Mast, striking athwart and alongst upon the Giant, but he did him no more hurt than you would do with a Filip upon a Smith's Anvil. In the time <hi>Loupga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rou</hi> was drawing his Mace out of the Ground, and having already plucked it out, was ready therewith to have struck <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very quick in turning, avoided all his Blows in taking only the defensive Part in hand, until on a sudden he saw that <hi>Loupgarou</hi> did threaten him with these Words, saying, <hi>Now, Villain, will no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ver making any more poor Men athirst.</hi> Then without any more ado <hi>Pantagruel</hi> struck him such a Blow with his Foot against the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he made him fall backwards, his Heels over his Head, and dragged him thus along at flay-buttock above a flight-shot. Then <hi>Loupgarou</hi> cried out, bleeding at the Throat, <hi>Mahoon, Mahoon, Mahoon,</hi> at which Noise all the Giants arose to succour him; but <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi> said unto them, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> do not go, if you will believe me, for our Master is mad, and strikes athwart and alongst, he cares not where, he will do you a Mischief; but the Giants made no Account of it, seeing that <hi>Pantagruel</hi> had never a Staff.</p>
                     <p>And when <hi>Pantagruel</hi> saw those Giants ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach very near unto him, he took <hi>Loupgarou</hi> by the two Feet, and lift up his Body like a Pike in the Air, wherewith (it being harnished with Anvils) he laid such heavy load amongst those Giants, armed with Free-stone, that striking them down as a Mason doth little Knobs of Stones, there was not one of them that stood before him, whom he threw not flat to the Ground; and by the breaking of this stony Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour there was made such a horrible Rumble, as put me in mind of the Fall of the Butter-tower of St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s at <hi>Bourge,</hi> when it mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before the Sun. <hi>Panurge,</hi> with <hi>Carpalin</hi> and <hi>Eusthenes,</hi> did cut in the mean time the Throats <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>f those that were struck down; in such sort,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:46180:310"/>
that there escaped not one. <hi>Pantagruel</hi> to any Man's sight was like a Mower, who with his Sithe, which was <hi>Loupgarou,</hi> cut down the Meddow Grass, to wit the Giants. But with this fencing of <hi>Pantagruel</hi>'s, <hi>Loupgarou</hi> lost his Head, which happened when <hi>Pantagruel</hi> struck down one whose Name was <hi>Riflandouille,</hi> who was armed <hi>cap-a-pe</hi> with Grison-stones, one Chip whereof splintring abroad cut off <hi>Episte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s Neck clean and fair. For otherwise the most part of them were but lightly armed with a kind of sandy Brittle-stone, and the rest with Slaits. At last, when he saw that they were all dead, he threw the Body of <hi>Loupgarou</hi> as hard as he could against the City, where falling like a Frog upon his Belly, in the great <hi>Piazza,</hi> he with the fall killed a <hi>singed He-cat,</hi> a <hi>wet She-cat,</hi> a <hi>farting Duck,</hi> and a <hi>brideled Goose.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. XXX. How <hi>Epistemon,</hi> who had his Head cut off, was finely healed by <hi>Panurge;</hi> and of the News which he brought from the Devils, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned People in Hell.</head>
                     <p>THis Gigantal Victory being ended, <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel</hi> withdrew himself to the place of the Flagons, and called for <hi>Panurge</hi> and the rest, who came unto him safe and sound, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Eusthenes,</hi> (whom one of the Giants had
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:46180:310"/>
scratched a little in the Face, whilst he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the cutting of his Throat) and <hi>Episte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> who appeared not at all. Whereat <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel</hi> was so aggrieved that he would have killed himself. But <hi>Panurge</hi> said unto him, Nay, Sir, stay a while, and we will search for him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Dead, and find out the truth of all. Thus as they went seeking after him, they found him stark dead, with his Head between his Arms all bloody. Then <hi>Eusthenes</hi> cried out, Ah cruel Death! hast thou taken from me the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectest amongst Men? At which words <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel</hi> rose up with the greatest Grief that ever any Man did see, and said to <hi>Panurge,</hi> Ha, my Friend, the <hi>Prophecy of your two Glasses,</hi> and the Javelin Staff was a great deal too deceitful. But <hi>Panurge</hi> answered, My dear Bullies all, weep not one drop more; for he being yet all hot, I will make him as sound as ever he was. In saying this, he took the Head, and held it warm fore-gainst his <hi>Cod-piece,</hi> that the Wind might not enter into it. <hi>Eusthenes</hi> and <hi>Carpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> carried the Body to the place where they had banqueted, not out of any hope that ever he would recover, but that <hi>Pantagruel</hi> might see it.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheless, <hi>Panurge</hi> gave him very good comfort, saying, If I do not heal him, I will be content to lose my Head, (which is a Fool's Wager) leave off therefore crying, and help me. Then cleansed he his Neck very well with pure White-wine; and after that, took his Head, and into it <hi>synapised</hi> some Powder of <hi>Diamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi>
                        <pb n="184" facs="tcp:46180:311"/>
which he always carried about him in one of his Bags. Afterwards, he anointed it with I know not what Ointment, and set it on very just, Vein against Vein, Sinew against Sinew, and Spondyle against Spondyle, that he might not be Wry-necked, (for such People he mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally hated); this done, he gave it round about some fifteen or sixteen Stitches with a Needle, that it might not fall off again; then on all sides, and every where, he put a little Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on it, which he called <hi>Resuscitative.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Suddenly <hi>Epistemon</hi> began to breath, then opened his Eyes, yawned, sneezed, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards let a great Houshold-Fart. Whereupon <hi>Panurge</hi> said, Now certainly he is healed, and therefore gave him to drink a large full Glass of strong White-wine, with a sugred Toast. In this Fashion was <hi>Epistemon</hi> finely healed, only that he was, somewhat hoarse for above three Weeks together, and had a dry Cough of which he could not be rid, but by the force of continual drinking. And now he began to speak, and said that he had seen the Devil, had spoken with <hi>Lucifer</hi> familiarly, and had been very merry in Hell, and in the <hi>Elysian</hi> Fields; affirming very seriously before them all, that the Devils were boon Companions, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Fellows: but in respect of the Damned, he said he was very sorry that <hi>Panurge</hi> had so soon called him back into this World again; for (said he) I took wonderful delight to see them. How so, said <hi>Pantagruel?</hi> because they do not
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:46180:311"/>
use them there (said <hi>Epistemon</hi>) so badly as you think they do. Their Estate and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of living is but only changed after a very strange manner.</p>
                     <p>For I saw <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding old Stockins, whereby he got but a very poor Living.</p>

The poor <hi>Pope</hi> went away weeping; who when he came to his Master the Pye-maker, told him that they had taken away his Pudding-pyes.

                     <p>Well, (said <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) reserve all these fair Stories for another time, only tell us how the Usurers are there handled. I saw them (said <hi>Epistemon</hi>) all very busily employed in seeking of rusty Pins, and old Nails in the Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of the Streets, as you see poor wretched Rogues do in this World; but the <hi>quintal</hi> or hundred Weight of this old Iron Ware, is there valued but at the price of a Cantle of Bread; and yet they have but a very bad Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch and Riddance in the Sale of it: Thus the poor Misers are sometimes three whole Weeks

without eating one Morsel or Crumb of Bread, and yet work both Day and Night looking for the <hi>fair to come:</hi> nevertheless, of all this Labour, Toil and Misery, they reckon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; so cursedly active they are in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of that their base Calling, in hopes at the end of the Year, to earn some scurvy Penny by it.</p>
                     <p>Come, (said <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) let us now make our selves merry one bout, and drink (my Lads) I beseech you, for it is very good drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all this Month. Then did they uncase their Flagons by Heaps and Dozens, and with their Leaguer-provision made excellent good Chear. But the poor King <hi>Anarchus</hi> could not all this while settle himself to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards any fit of Mirth: whereupon <hi>Panurge</hi> said, Of what Trade shall we make my Lord the King here, that he may be skilful in the Art, when he goes thither to sojourn, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all the Devils of Hell? Indeed (said <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) that was well advised of thee, do with him what thou wilt: I give him to thee. Grammercy (said <hi>Panurge</hi>) the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent is not to be refused, and I love it from you.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXXI. How <hi>Pantagruel</hi> entred into the City of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maurots,</hi> and how <hi>Panurge</hi> married King <hi>Anarchus</hi> to an old Lantern-carrying Hag, and made him a Crier of Green-sauce.</head>
                     <p>AFter this wonderful Victory, <hi>Pantagruel</hi> sent <hi>Carpalin</hi> unto the City of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maurots,</hi> to declare and signify unto them how the King <hi>Anarchus</hi> was taken Prisoner, and all the Enemies of the City overthrown; which News when they heard, all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the City came forth to meet him in good order, and with a great triumphant Pomp, conducting him with a heavenly Joy into the City, where innumerable Bonfires were kindled every-where, and fair round Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles furnished with store of good Victuals, set out in the middle of the Streets. This was a Renewing of the <hi>Golden-Age:</hi> so good was the Cheer which then they made.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Pantagruel</hi> having assembled the whole Senate, and Common-Council-Men of the Town, said <hi>(My Masters)</hi> we must now strike the Iron whilst it is hot; it is therefore my Will, that before we frolick it any longer, we advise how to assault and take the whole Kingdom of the <hi>Dipsodes.</hi> To which effect, let those that will go with me provide themselves against to

Morrow after drinking; for then will I begin to march. Not that I need any more Men than I have to help me to conquer it; for I could make it as sure that way as if I had it already, but I see this City is so full of Inhabitants, that they scarce can turn in the Streets: I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore carry them as a Colony into <hi>Dipsody,</hi> and will give them all that Country, which is fair, wealthy, fruitful and pleasant, above all other Countries in the World, as many of you can tell who have been there heretofore. Every one of you therefore that will go along, let him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide himself as I have said. This Counsel and Resolution being published in the City, the next Morning there assembled in the <hi>Piazza,</hi> before the Palace, to the number of Eighteen hundred fifty six thousand and eleven, besides Women and little Children. Thus began they to march streight into <hi>Dipsody,</hi> in such good order as did the People of <hi>Israel</hi> when they departed out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to pass over the Red-sea.</p>
                     <p>But before we proceed any further, I will tell you how <hi>Panurge</hi> handled his Prisoner the King <hi>Anarchus.</hi> For having remembred that which <hi>Epistemon</hi> had related, how the Kings and rich Men in this World were used in the <hi>Elysian</hi> Fields, and how they got their Living there by base and ignoble Trades; he therefore one day apparelled his King in a pretty little Canvass Doublet, all jagged and pinked like the Tippet of a light Horse-man's Cap, together with a Pair of large Mariner's Breeches, and Stockins

without Shoes: For (said he) they would but spoil his Sight; and a little peach-coloured Bonnet, with a great <hi>Capon's</hi> Feather in it. I lie, for I think he had two: and a very handsom Girdle, <hi>de pers &amp; vert</hi>; saying, that such a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very did become him well, for that he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been <hi>perverse.</hi> And in this Plight bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him before <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> said unto him, Do you know this Royster? No indeed, said <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel.</hi> It is (said <hi>Panurge</hi>) my Lord, the King of the <hi>clowted Hose.</hi> I intend to make him an honest Man. These <hi>Devils</hi> of Kings here are but as so many Calves; they know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and are good for nothing but to do a thousand Mischiefs to their poor Subjects, and to trouble all the World with War for their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just and detestable Pleasure. I will put him to a Trade, and make him a <hi>Crier of Green-sauce.</hi> Go to, begin and cry; <hi>Do you lack any Green-sauce?</hi> and the poor Devil cried. That is too low (said <hi>Panurge</hi>); then took him by the Ear, saying, Sing higher in <hi>Ge, sol, re, ut.</hi> So, so, (poor Wretch) thou hast a good Throat: Thou could'st never have been so happy hadst thou continued longer King.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Pantagruel</hi> made himself merry with all this. For I dare boldly say, that he was the best little Gaffer that was to be seen between this and the end of a Staff. Thus was <hi>Anarchus</hi> made a good <hi>Crier of Green-sauce.</hi> Two Days thereafter, <hi>Panurge</hi> married him with an <hi>old Lantern-carrying Hag</hi>; and he himself made
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:46180:317"/>
the Wedding with fine Sheeps-Heads, brave Haslets with Mustard, gallant Salligots with Garlick, of which he sent five Horse-loads unto <hi>Pantagruel</hi>; which he ate up all, he found them so <hi>appetizing.</hi> And for their Drink, they had a kind of small well-watered Wine, and some Sorbapple-cider. And to make them dance, he hired a blind Man that made Musick to them with a Windbroach.</p>
                     <p>After Dinner he led them to the Palace, and shewed them to <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> and said, pointing to the married Woman, You need not fear that she will <hi>crack.</hi> Why? said <hi>Pantagruel.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, said <hi>Panurge,</hi> she is well slit and broke up already. What do you mean by that? said <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel.</hi> Do not you see, said <hi>Panurge,</hi> that the <hi>Chesnuts</hi> which are roasted in the Fire, if they be whole, they <hi>crack</hi> as if they were mad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to keep them from <hi>cracking,</hi> they make an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision in them, and slit them: So this new Bride is in her lower Parts well <hi>slit</hi> before, and therefore will not <hi>crack</hi> behind.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pantagruel</hi> gave them a little Lodg near the Lower-street, and a Mortar of Stone wherein to bray and <hi>pound their Sauce.</hi> And in this manner did they do their little Business, he being as pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a <hi>Crier of Green-sauce</hi> as ever was seen in the Country of <hi>Vtopia.</hi> But I have been told since, that his Wife doth beat him like Plaister, and the poor Sot dares not defend himself, he is so sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXXII. How <hi>Pantagruel</hi> with his Tongue covered a whole Army, and what the Author saw in his Mouth.</head>
                     <p>THus as <hi>Pantagruel</hi> with all his Army had entered into the Country of the <hi>Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sodes,</hi> every one was glad of it, and inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently rendred themselves unto him, bringing him out of their own good Wills the Keys of all the Cities where he went, the <hi>Almirods</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excepted; who being resolved to hold out against him, made answer to his <hi>Heraulds</hi> that they would not yield but upon very honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and good Conditions.</p>
                     <p>What, (said <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) do they ask any better Terms than the Hand at the Pot, and the Glass in their Fist? Come let us go sack them, and put them all to the Sword. Then did they put themselves in good order, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fully determined to give an Assault. But by the way passing through a large Field, they were overtaken with a great Shower of Rain. Whereat they began to shiver and tremble, to croud, press and thrust close to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. When <hi>Pantagruel</hi> saw that, he made their Captains tell them, that it was nothing, and that he saw well above the Clouds, that it would be nothing but a little Dew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:46180:318"/>
howsoever, that they should put themselves in order, and he would cover them. Then did they put themselves in a close order, and stood as near to other as they could; and <hi>Pantagruel</hi> drew out his Tongue only halfway, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them all, as a Hen doth her Chickens.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time I who relate to you these so veritable Stories, hid my self under a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock-leaf, which was not much less in Large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness than the Arch of the Bridg of <hi>Montrible:</hi> but when I saw them thus covered, I went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them to shelter my self likewise, which I could not do; for that (as the Saying is) <hi>at the Yards End there is no Cloth left.</hi> Then as well as I could, I got upon it, and went along full two Leagues upon his Tongue, and so long marched, that at last I came into his Mouth: But O <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Goddesses,</hi> what did I see there? <hi>Iupiter</hi> confound me with his <hi>trisulk</hi> Lightning if I lie: I walked there as they do in <hi>Sophie</hi> at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and saw there great Rocks like the Mountains in <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> I believe that those were his Teeth; I saw also fair Medows, large Forests, great and strong Cities, not a jot less than <hi>Lyons</hi> or <hi>Poictiers:</hi> The first Man I met with there was a good honest Fellow planting Colworts; whereat being very much amazed, I asked him, My Friend, what dost thou make here? I plant Colworts, said he: But how, and wherewith said I? Ha Sir, said he, every one cannot have his Ballocks as heavy as a Mortar;
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:46180:318"/>
neither can we be all rich: thus do I get my poor Living, and carry them to the Market to sell in the City which is here behind. <hi>Iesus!</hi> (said I) is there here a new World? Sure (said he) it is never a jot new, but it is commonly reported, that without this there is an Earth, whereof the Inhabitants enjoy the Light of a Sun and a Moon; and that it is full of, and replenished with very good Commodies; but yet this is more ancient than that. Yea, but (said I) my Friend, what is the Name of that City whither thou carriest thy Colworts to sell? It is called <hi>Alpharage,</hi> (said he) and all the Indwellers are <hi>Christians,</hi> very honest Men, and will make you good chear. To be brief, I resolved to go thither. Now in my way I met with a Fellow that was lying in wait to catch Pigeons, of whom I asked, <hi>(My Friend)</hi> from whence come these Pigeons? Sir, (said he) they come from the other World. Then I thought that when <hi>Pantagruel</hi> yawned, the Pigeons went into his Mouth in whole Flocks, thinking that it had been a Pigeon-House.</p>
                     <p>Then I went into the City, which I found fair, very strong, and seated in a good Air; but at my Entry the Guard demanded of me my Pass or Ticket; whereat I was much asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, and asked them, (<hi>My Masters</hi>) is there any Danger of the Plague here? O Lord, (said they) they die hard by here so fast, that the Cart runs about the Streets. Good God! (said I) and where? whereunto they answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:46180:319"/>
That it was in <hi>Larinx</hi> and <hi>Phaerinx,</hi> which are two great Cities, such as <hi>Rowen</hi> and <hi>Nantz,</hi> rich and of great Trading: and the Cause of the Plague was by a stinking and infectious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation which lately vapoured out of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bismes, whereof there have died above two and twenty hundred and threescore thousand and sixteen Persons within this Seven night. Then I considered, calculated and found, that it was a rank and unsavoury Breathing, which came out of <hi>Pantagruel</hi>'s Stomach when he did eat so much Garlick, as we have aforesaid.</p>
                     <p>Parting from thence I pass'd amongst the Rocks, which were his Teeth, and never left walking till I got upon one of them, and there I found the pleasantest Places in the World, great large Tennis-courts, fair Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries, sweet Meddows, store of Vines, and an infinite Number of Banqueting Summer Out-houses in the Fields, after the <hi>Italian</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion, full of Pleasure and Delight, where I stayed full four Months, and never made bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cheer in my Life as then. After that I went down by the hinder Teeth to come to the Chaps; but in the way I was robbed by Thieves in a great Forest that is in the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory towards the Ears. Then (after a little further travelling) I fell upon a pretty petty Village, (truly I have forgot the Name of it) where I was yet merrier than ever, and got some certain Money to live by, can you tell how? by Sleeping: for there they hire Men
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:46180:319"/>
by the Day to sleep, and they get by it six Pence a Day; but they that can snort hard get at least Nine-pence. How I had been robbed in the Valley I informed the Senators, who told me that in very truth the People of that side were bad Livers, and naturally thievish; whereby I perceived well, that as we have with us the Countreys <hi>Cisalpine</hi> and <hi>Transalpine,</hi> so have they there the Countreys <hi>Cidentine</hi> and <hi>Tradentine,</hi> that is, behither and beyond the Teeth: but it is far better living on this side, and the Air is purer. There I began to think, that it is very true which is commonly said, that the one half of the World knoweth not how the other half liveth. Seeing none before my self had ever written of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, wherein are above five and twenty King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms inhabited, besides Deserts, and a great Arm of the Sea. I have composed a great Book, intituled, <hi>The History of the</hi> Gorgians, because they dwell in the <hi>Gorge</hi> of my Master <hi>Pantagruel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At last I was willing to return, and passing by his Beard, I cast my self upon his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and from thence slid down to the Ground, and fell before him. As soon as I was perceived by him, he asked me, Whence comest thou, <hi>Alcosribas?</hi> I answered him, Out of your Mouth, <hi>my Lord?</hi> And how long hast thou been there, said he? Since the time (said I) that you went against the <hi>Almi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rods</hi>; that is, about six Months ago, said he.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:46180:320"/>
And wherewith didst thou live? what didst thou drink? I answered, My Lord, of the same that you did, and of the daintiest Morsels that pass'd through your Throat I took Toll. Yea, but said he, where didst thou shite? In your Throat (my Lord) said I. Ha, ha, thou art a merry Fellow, said he.

You must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that by the Advice of the <hi>Physicians,</hi> it was ordered that what did offend his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach should be taken away; and therefore they made seventeen great Balls of Copper,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:46180:321"/>
each whereof was bigger than that which is to be seen on the top of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Needle at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in such sort, that they did open in the midst, and shut with a Spring.

                     <p>GOOD People, most Illustrious Drinkers, and you thrice preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous gouty Gentlemen. Did you ever <hi>see Diogenes</hi> the <hi>Cynick</hi> Philosopher, if
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46180:326"/>
you have <hi>seen</hi> him, you then had your Eyes in your Head, or I am very much out of my Understanding and Logical Sense. It is a gallant thing to see the clearness of (Wine, Gold) the Sun. I'll be judged by the blind born so renowned in the Sacred Scriptures; who having at his choice to ask whatever he would from him who is Almighty, and whose Word in an Instant is effectually performed, asked nothing else but that he might <hi>see. Item</hi> you are not young, which is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Quality for you to Philosophat more than Physically in <hi>Wine</hi> (not in vain) and henceforwards to be of the <hi>Bacchick</hi> Council; to the end that <hi>opining</hi> there, you may give your <hi>Opinion</hi> faithfully of the Substance, Colour, excellent Odour, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency, Propriety, Faculty, Vertue, and effectual Dignity of the said blessed and desired Liquor.</p>
                     <p>If you have not <hi>seen</hi> him (as I am ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily induced to believe that you have not) at least you have heard some talk of him. For through the Air, and the whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of this Hemisphere of the Heavens hath his Report and Fame, even until this present time, remained very memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and renowned. Then all of you are derived from the <hi>Phrygian</hi> Blood (if I be not deceived) if you have not so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46180:326"/>
Crowns as <hi>Midas</hi> had, yet have you something (I know not what) of him, which the <hi>Persians</hi> of old esteemed more of in all their <hi>Otacusts,</hi> and which was more desired by the Emperor <hi>Antonine</hi>; and gave occasion thereafter to the <hi>Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisco</hi> at <hi>Rohan</hi> to be Surnamed <hi>Goodly ears.</hi> If you have not heard of him, I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently tell you a Story to make your Wine relish: Drink then, so, to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; hearken now whilst I give you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice (to the end that you may not like Infidels be by your simplicity abused) that in his time he was a rare Philosopher, and the chearfullest of a thousand: If he had some Imperfection, so have you, so have we; for there is nothing (but God) that is perfect: Yet so it was, that by <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Great (although he had <hi>Aristotle</hi> for his Instructor and Domestick) was he held in such Estimation, that he wish'd if <hi>he had not been</hi> Alexander <hi>to have been</hi> Diogenes <hi>the</hi> Sinopian.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Diogenes</hi> seeing them all so warm at work, and himself not employed by the Magistrates in any business whatsoever, he did very seriously (for many days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, without speaking one Word) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46180:328"/>
and contemplate the Countenance of his Fellow-Citizens.</p>
                     <p>Then on a sudden, as if he had been roused up and inspired by a Martial Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he girded his Cloak, scarf-ways, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Left Arm, tucked up his Sleeves to the Elbow, trussed himself like a Clown gathering Apples, and giving to one of his old Acquaintance his Wallet, Books, and <hi>Opistrographs,</hi> away went he out of Town towards a little Hill or Promonto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Corinth</hi> called <hi>Cranie</hi>; and there on the Strand, a pretty level place, did he roul his Jolly Tub, which serv'd him for an House to shelter him from the Injuries of the Weather: There, I say, in a great Vehemency of Spirit, did he turn it, veer it, wheel it, whirl it, frisk it, jumble it, shuffle it, huddle it, tumble it, hurry it, joult it, justle it, overthrow it, evert it, invert it, subvert it, overturn it, beat it, thwack it, bump it, batter it, knock it, thrust it, push it, jert it, shock it, shake it, toss it, throw it, overthrow it up-side down, topsiturvy, arsiturvy, tread it, trample it, stamp it, tap it, ting it, ring it, tingle it, towl it, sound it, resound it, stop it, shut it, unbung it, close it, unstopple it. And then again in a mighty bustle he bandy'd it, slubber'd it, hack'd it, whitled it, way'd it, darted it, hurled it, stagger'd
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46180:328"/>
it, reel'd it, swing'd it, brangled it, totter'd it, lifted it, heaved it, transformed it, transfigur'd it, transpos'd it, transplaced it, reared it, raised it, hoised it, washed it, dighted it, cleansed it, rinced it, nailed it, setled it, fastned it, shackled it, fetter'd it, level'd it, block'd it, tugg'd it, tew'd it, carry'd it, bedash'd it, beray'd it, parch'd it, mounted it, broach'd it, nick'd it, notch'd it, bespatter'd it, deck'd it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd it, trimmed it, garnished it, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it, furnish'd it, boar'd it, pierc'd it, trap'd it, rumbled it, slid it down the Hill, and precipitated it from the very height of the <hi>Cranie</hi>; then from the foot to the top (like another <hi>Sisyphus</hi> with his Stone) bore it up again, and every way so bang'd it and belabour'd it, that it was ten thousand to one he had not struck the bottom of it out.</p>
                     <p>Which when one of his Friends had seen, and asked him why he did so toil his Body, perplex his Spirit, and torment his Tub? The Philosopher's Answer was, That not being employed in any other Charge by the <hi>Republick,</hi> he thought it expedient to thunder and storm it so tempestuously upon his <hi>Tub,</hi> that amongst a People so fervently busie, and earnest at work, he alone might not seem a loytering Slug

<q>
                           <l>Tho I be rid from Fear,</l>
                           <l>I am not void of Care.</l>

For perceiving no Account to be made of me towards the Discharge of a Trust of any great Concernment, and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that through all the parts of this most noble Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> both on this and on the other side of the <hi>Mountains,</hi> every one is most diligently exercised and busied; some in the fortifying of their own Native Country, for its Defence; others, in the repulsing of their Enemies by an Offensive War; and all this with a Policy so excellent, and such admirable Order, so manifestly profitable for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereby <hi>France</hi> shall have its Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers most <hi>magnifically</hi> enlarged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the <hi>Frenches</hi> assured of a long and well-grounded Peace, that very little<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds me from the Opinion of good <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclitus,</hi> which affirmeth <hi>War to be the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all good things</hi>; and therefore do I believe that <hi>War</hi> is in <hi>Latin</hi> called <hi>Bellum,</hi> not by <hi>Antiphrasis,</hi> as some Patchers of old rusty Latin would have us to think; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in <hi>War</hi> there is little Beauty to be seen, but absolutely and simply; for that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46180:329"/>
in <hi>War</hi> appeareth all that is <hi>good</hi> and graceful, and that by the <hi>Wars</hi> is purged out all manner of Wickedness and Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. For Proof whereof the wise and pacifick <hi>Solomon</hi> could no better represent the unspeakable Perfection of the Divine Wisdom, than by comparing it to the due disposure and ranking of <hi>an Army in Battel Array, well provided and ordered.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore by reason of my Weakness and Inability, being reputed by my Compatriots unfit for the <hi>Offensive</hi> part of Warfare; and on the other side, being no way employed in matter of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive,</hi> although it had been but to carry Burthens, fill Ditches, or break Clods, either whereof had been to me indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, I held it not a little disgraceful to be only an <hi>Idle Spectator</hi> of so many valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, eloquent and warlike Persons, who in the view and sight of all <hi>Europe</hi> act this notable <hi>Interlude</hi> or <hi>Tragicomedy,</hi> and not make some Effort towards the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this, <hi>nothing at all</hi> remains for me to be done. In my Opinion, little Honour is due to such as are meer <hi>Lookers on,</hi> liberal of their Eyes, and of their Purse parsimonious; who conceal their Crowns, and hide their Silver; scratching their Head with one Finger like grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Puppies, gaping at the Flies like
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46180:330"/>
                        <hi>Tithe Calves</hi>; clapping down their Ears like <hi>Arcadian</hi> Asses at the Melody of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians, who with their very Countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the depth of silence express their Consent to the <hi>Prosopopeie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having made this Choice and Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it seemed to me that my Exercise therein would be neither unprofitable nor troublesom to any, whilst I should thus set agoing my <hi>Diogenical</hi> Tub, which is all that is left me safe from the Shipwrack of my former Misfortunes.</p>
                     <p>At this dingle dangle wagging of my Tub, what would you have me to do? By the <hi>Virgin</hi> that tucks up her Sleeve, I know not as yet: Stay a little till I suck up a Draught of this Bottle, it is my true and only <hi>Helicon</hi>; it is my <hi>Caballine</hi> Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; it is my sole <hi>Entousiasm.</hi> Drinking thus I meditate, discourse, resolve and conclude. After that the <hi>Epilogue</hi> is made, I laugh, I write, I compose, and drink again. <hi>Cynius</hi> drinking wrote, and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drank. <hi>Aschylus</hi> (if <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his <hi>Symposiaes</hi> merit any Faith) drank compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and drinking composed. <hi>Homer</hi> never wrote fasting, and <hi>Cato</hi> never wrote till after he had drunk. These Passages I have brought before you, to the end you may not say that I live without the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Men well praised, and better.

prised. It is good and fresh enough, even (as if you would say) it is entring upon the Second Degree. God the good God <hi>Sabaoth</hi> (that is to say, the <hi>God of Armies</hi>) be praised for it eternally. If you after the same manner would take one great Draught, or two little ones, whilst you have your Gown about you. I truly find no kind of Inconveniency in it, provided you send up to God for all some small scantling of Thanks.</p>
                     <p>Since then my Luck or Destiny is such as you have heard, for it is not for every body to go to <hi>Corinth,</hi> I am fully resolved to be so little idle and unprofitable, that I will set my self to serve the one and the other sort of People, amongst the <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> Pioniers and Rampire-builders, I will do as did <hi>Neptune</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> at <hi>Troy</hi> under <hi>Laomedon,</hi> or as did <hi>Renault</hi> of <hi>Mountau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> in his latter days: I will serve the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, I'll set on the Pot to boyl for the Bricklayers; and whilst the minced Meat is making ready at the sound of my small Pipe, I'll measure the Muzzle of the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Dotards. Thus did <hi>Amphion</hi> with the Melody of his Harp, found, build and finish the great and renowned City of <hi>Thebes.</hi>

black, and the other white, not in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of breadth by the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> as was that Woman consecrated to the <hi>Indian Venus,</hi> whom the <hi>Tyanean</hi> Philosopher did see between the River <hi>Hydaspes,</hi> and mount <hi>Caucasus,</hi> but in a perpendicular Dimension of Altitude; which were things never before that seen in <hi>Egypt.</hi> He expected by the show of these Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to win the love of the People. But what hapned thereupon? At the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Camel</hi> they were all affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and offended at the sight of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-coloured Man: Some scoffed at him as a detestible Monster brought forth by the Errour of Nature. In a word, of the Hope which he had to please these <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> and by such means to encrease the Affection which they naturally bore him, he was altogether frustrate and disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; understanding fully by their Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they took more pleasure and delight in things that were proper, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som and perfect, than in mishapen, mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous and ridiculous Creatures; since which time he had both the <hi>Slave</hi> and the <hi>Camel</hi> in such dislike that very shortly thereafter, either through Negligence, or for want of ordinary Sustenance, they did exchange their Life with Death.</p>

                           <hi>PAntagruel</hi> having wholly subdued the Land of <hi>Dypsodie,</hi> transported thereunto a Colony of <hi>Utopians,</hi> to the number of 9876543210 Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Women and little Children, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers of all Trades, and Professors of all Sciences; to people, cultivate and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove that Country, which otherways was ill inhabited, and in the greatest part thereof but a meer Desert and Wilderness; and did transport them so much for the excessive multitude of Men and Women which were in <hi>Utopia,</hi> multiplied (for number) like Grashoppers upon the face of the Land. You understand well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, nor is it needful further to explain it to you, that the <hi>Utopian</hi> Men had so rank and fruitful Genetories, and that the <hi>Utopian</hi> Women carryed Matrixes so ample, so glutonous, so tenaciously reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and so <hi>Architectonically cellulated,</hi> that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46180:334"/>
at the end of every Ninth Month Seven Children at the least (what Male what Female) were brought forth by every Married Woman, in imitation of the People of <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> if <hi>Anthony de Lira</hi> be to be trusted. Nor yet was this Transplantation made so much for the Fertility of the Soil, the Wholsomness of the Air, or Commodity of the Country of <hi>Dypsodie,</hi> as to retain that Rebellious People within the bounds of their Duty and Obedience, by this new Transport of his ancient and most faithful Subjects, who from all time out of mind, never knew, acknowledged, owned or served any other <hi>Soveraign Lord</hi> but him; and who likewise from the very instant of their Birth, as soon as they were entred into this World, had, with the <hi>Milk</hi> of their Mothers and Nurses, sucked in the Sweetness, Humanity and Mildness of his Government, to which they were all of them so nourished and habituated, that there was nothing surer, than that they would sooner abandon their Lives, than swerve from this singular and primitive Obedience <hi>naturally</hi> due to their Prince, whithersoever they should be dispersed or removed.</p>

For if the <hi>Utopians</hi> were before their Transplantation thither dutiful and faithful Subjects, the <hi>Dypsodes,</hi> after some few days conversing with them, were every whit as (if not more) <hi>loyal</hi> than they; and that by vertue of I know not what <hi>natural</hi> Fervency in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to all Humane Creatures at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of any labour wherein they took delight; solemnly attesting the <hi>Heavens,</hi> and supreme <hi>Intelligences</hi> of their being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sorry, that no sooner unto their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge had arrived the great Renown of the good <hi>Pantagruel.</hi>

                        <p>WHilst <hi>Pantagruel</hi> was giving Order for the Government of all <hi>Dyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sodie,</hi> he assigned to <hi>Panurge</hi> the <hi>Laird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> of <hi>Salmygoudin,</hi> which was yearly worth 6789106789 Ryals of certain Rent, besides the uncertain Revenue of the <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custs</hi> and <hi>Periwinkles,</hi> amounting one year with another to the value of 435768, or 2435769 <hi>French</hi> Crowns of <hi>Berry.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it did amount to 1230554321 Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphs when it was a good Year, and that Locusts and Periwinkles were in request; but that was not every Year.</p>
                        <p>Now his Worship, the new <hi>Laird,</hi> hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded this his Estate so providently well and prudently, that in less than fourteen days he wasted and dilapidated all the certain and uncertain Revenue of his Lairdship for three whole Years: Yet did
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:46180:338"/>
not he properly dilapidate it, as you might say, in founding of Monasteries, building of Churches, erecting of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and setting up of Hospitals, or casting his Bacon-Flitches to the Dogs; but spent it in a thousand little Banquets and jolly Collations, keeping open House for all Comers and Goers; yea, to all good Fellows, young Girls, and pretty Wenches; felling Timber, burning the great Logs for the Sale of the Ashes, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing Money before-hand, buying dear, selling cheap, and eating his Corn (as it were) whilst it was but Grass.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Pantagruel</hi> being advertised of this his Lavishness, was in good sooth no way offended at the matter, angry nor sorry; for I once told you, and again tell it you, that he was the best, little, great Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that ever girded a Sword to his Side; he took all things in good part, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted every Action to the best Sence: He never vexed nor disquieted himself with the least pretence of Dislike to any thing; because he knew that he must have most grosly abandoned the Divine Mansion of Reason, if he had permitted his Mind to be never so little grieved, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted or altered at any occasion whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. For all the Goods that the <hi>Heaven</hi> covereth, and that the <hi>Earth</hi> containeth in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:46180:339"/>
all their Dimensions of Heighth, Depth, Breadth and Length, are not of so much worth, as that we should for them disturb or disorder our Affections, trouble or perplex our Senses or Spirits.</p>
                        <p>He drew only <hi>Panurge</hi> aside, and then making to him a sweet Remonstrance and mild Admonition, very gently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented before him in strong Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, That if he should continue in such an unthrifty course of living, and not become a better <hi>Mesnagier,</hi> it would prove altogether impossible for him, or at least hughly difficult at any time to make him rich. Rich! answered <hi>Panurge,</hi> Have you fixed your Thoughts there? Have you underraken the Task to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich me in this World? Set your Mind to live merrily in the Name of God and good Folks, let no other Cark nor Care be harboured within the <hi>Sacro sanctified Domicile</hi> of your Celestial Brain. May the Calmness and Tranquility thereof be never incommodated with, or over-sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed by any frowning Clouds of fullen Imaginations and displeasing Annoyance. For if you live joyful, meery, jocund and glad, I cannot be but rich enough. Every body cries up <hi>thrift, thrift,</hi> and good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry; but many speak of <hi>Robin Hood</hi> that never shot in his Bow; and talk of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46180:339"/>
that Vertue of <hi>Mesnagery,</hi> who know not what belong to it. It is by me that they must be advised. From me therefore take this Advertisement and Information, that what is imputed to me for a Vice, hath been done in imitation of the <hi>University</hi> and Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> places in which is to be found the true Spring and <hi>Source</hi> of the lively <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Pantheology,</hi> and all manner of Justice. Let him be counted an <hi>Heretick</hi> that doubteth thereof, and doth not firmly believe it: Yet they in one day eat up their <hi>Bishop,</hi> or the Revenue of the <hi>Bishoprick</hi> (is it not all one) for a whole year; yea, sometimes for two. This is done on the day he makes his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and is <hi>installed:</hi> Nor is there any place for an Excuse; for he cannot avoid it, unless he would be houted at and sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for his Parsimony.</p>
                        <p>It hath been also esteemed an act flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Habit of the Four <hi>Cardinal</hi> Vertues. Of <hi>Prudence</hi> in borrowing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney before-hand; for none knows what may fall out; who is able to tell if the World shall last yet three years?

                        <p>Of <hi>Commutative Iustice,</hi> in buying dear (I say upon trust) and selling good cheap, (that is, for ready Money) what says <hi>Cato</hi> in his Book of <hi>Husbandry</hi> to this purpose?

                        <p>Of <hi>Distributive Iustice</hi> it doth partake, in giving Entertainment to good (remark good) and gentle Fellows, whom For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had Shipwrack'd (like <hi>Ulysses</hi>) upon the Rock of a hungry Stomach without provision of Sustenance: And likewise to the good (remark the good) and young Wenches: For according to the Sentence of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> Youth is impatient of Hunger, chiefly if it be vigorous, lively, frolick, brisk, stirring and bouncing; which wanton Lasses willingly and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily devote themselves to the pleasure of Honest Men; and are in so far both <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick</hi> and <hi>Ciceronian,</hi> that they do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their being <hi>born</hi> into this World, not to be <hi>for themselves alone,</hi> but that in their proper Persons their Acquaintance may

                        <p>The Vertue of <hi>Fortitude</hi> appears there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by the cutting down and overthrowing of the great Trees, like a second <hi>Milo</hi> making Havock of the dark Forests, which did serve only to furnish Dens, Caves, and Shelter to Wolves, wild Boars and Foxes; and afford Receptacles, withdrawing Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Refuges to Robbers, Thieves and Murtherers; lurking holes and sculking places for Cut-throat Assassinators; secret obscure Shops for Coiners of false money, and safe Retreats for <hi>Hereticks,</hi> laying them even and level with the plain Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian Fields and pleasant Heathy Ground, at the sound of the Hau-bois and Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipes playing, reeks with the high and stately Timber, and preparing Seats and Benches for the Eve of the dreadful day of Judgment.</p>

I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand you very well (says <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) you would thereby infer, that those of a mean Spirit and shallow Capacity, have not the <hi>skill to spend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> much in a short time:</hi> You are not the first in whose Conceit that <hi>Heresie</hi> hath entred: <hi>Nero</hi> maintained it, and above all Mortals admired most his Unkle <hi>Caius Caligula,</hi> for having in few days, by a most wonderfully pregnant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, totally spent all the Goods and Patrimony which <hi>Tiberius</hi> had left him.</p>
                        <p>But instead of observing the <hi>Sumptuous Supper-curbing</hi> Laws of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Orchia,</hi> the <hi>Fannia,</hi> the <hi>Didia,</hi> the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinia,</hi> the <hi>Cornelia,</hi> the <hi>Lepidiana,</hi> the <hi>Antia,</hi> and of the <hi>Corinthians</hi>; by the which they were inhibited, under pain of great punishment, not to spend more in one year than their annual Revenue did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to.

                        <p>BUT, quoth <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> when will you be out of Debt? At the next ensuing Term of the <hi>Greek Calends,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered <hi>Panurge,</hi> when all the World shall be content, and that it be your Fate to become your own Heir. The Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that I should be out of Debt, as if, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I could not be trusted. <hi>Who leaves
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:46180:342"/>
not some Leaven over night, will hardly have paste the next morning.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Be still indebted to some body or other, that there may be some body always to pray for you; that the Giver of all good things may grant unto you a blessed, long, and prosperous Life, fearing if Fortune should deal crosly with you, that it might be his chance to come short of being paid by you; he will always speak good of you in every Company, ever and anon purchase new Creditors unto you; to the end that through their means you may make a shift by borrowing from <hi>Peter</hi> to pay <hi>Paul,</hi> and with other folks Earth fill up his Ditch. When of old in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> by the Institution of the <hi>Druids,</hi> the Servants, Slaves and Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were burnt quick at the Funerals and Obsequies of their Lords and Masters; had not they fear enough, think you, that their Lords and Masters should die? for <hi>per force,</hi> they were to die with them for Company. Did not they uncessantly send up their Supplications to their great God <hi>Mercury,</hi> as likewise unto <hi>Dis</hi> the Father of Wealth, to lengthen out their days, and preserve them long in health? Were not they very careful to entertain them well, punctually to look unto them, and to attend them faithfully and circumspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:46180:343"/>
For by those means were they to live together at least until the hour of Death. Believe me, your Creditors with a more fervent Devotion will beseech Almighty God to prolong your Life, they being of nothing more afraid than that you should die; for that they are more concerned for the Sleeve than the Arm, and love Silver better than their own Lives; as it evidently appeareth by the Usurers of <hi>Landerousse,</hi> who not long since hanged themselves, because the price of the Corn and Wines was fallen, by the return of a gracious Season. To this <hi>Pantagruel</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering nothing, <hi>Panurge</hi> went on in his Discourse, saying, Truly, and in good sooth (Sir,) when I ponder my Destiny aright, and think well upon it, you put me shrewdly to my Plunges, and have me at a Bay in twitting me with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of my Debts and Creditors: And yet did I, in this only respect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of being a <hi>Debtor,</hi> esteem my self worshipful, reverend and formidable. For against the Opinion of most Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, that of <hi>nothing ariseth nothing</hi>; yet without having bottomed on so much as that which is called the <hi>First Matter,</hi> did I out of <hi>nothing</hi> become such <hi>Maker</hi> and <hi>Creator,</hi> that I have created, what? a gay number of fair and jolly <hi>Creditors.</hi> Nay,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:46180:343"/>
                           <hi>Creditors</hi> (I will maintain it, even to the very <hi>Fire</hi> it self exclusively) are fair and <hi>goodly Creatures.</hi> Who lendeth nothing is an ugly and <hi>wicked Creature,</hi> and an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed <hi>Imp</hi> of the Infernal <hi>Old Nick.</hi> And there is made, what? <hi>Debts</hi>: A thing most precious and dainty, of great Use and Antiquity. <hi>Debts</hi> (I say) surmounting the number of Syllables which may result from the Combinations of all the Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, with each of the Vowels hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore projected, reckoned and calculated by the Noble <hi>Xenocrates.</hi> To judge of the perfection of <hi>Debtors</hi> by the Numerosity of their <hi>Creditors,</hi> is the readiest way for entring into the Mysteries of <hi>Practical Arithmetick.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You can hardly imagine how glad I am, when every Morning I perceive my self environed and surrounded with Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades of <hi>Creditors</hi>; humble, fawning, and full of their Reverences: And whilst I remark, that as I look more favourably upon, and give a chearfuller Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to one than to another, the Fellow thereupon buildeth a Conceit that he shall be the first Dispatched, and the foremost in the Date of Payment; and he valueth my Smiles at the rate of ready Money. It seemeth unto me, that I then act and personate the <hi>God of the Passion of</hi> Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:46180:344"/>
accompanied with his Angels and Cherubims.</p>
                        <p>These are my Flatterers, my Soothers, my Claw backs, my Smoothers, my Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites, my Saluters, my Givers of good Morrows, and perpetual Orators; which makes me verily think, that the supream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Height of <hi>Heroick</hi> Vertue, described by <hi>Hesiode,</hi> consisteth in being a <hi>Debtor,</hi> wherein I held the first <hi>degree</hi> in my <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement.</hi> Which Dignity though all Humane Creatures seem to aim at, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire thereto, few nevertheless, because of the difficulties in the way, and incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances of hard Passages are able to reach it, as is easily perceivable by the ardent desire and vehement longing harboured in the Breast of every one, to be still creating more <hi>Debts,</hi> and the new <hi>Creditors.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yet doth it not lie in the power of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one to be a <hi>Debtor.</hi> To acquire <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors</hi> is not at the Disposure of each Man's Arbitriment. You nevertheless would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive me of this sublime Felicity. You ask me when I will be out of Debt. Well, to go yet further on, and possibly worse in your Conceit, may <hi>Sanct Bablin,</hi> the good Sanct, snatch me, if I have not all my Life-time held <hi>Debt</hi> to be as an Union or Conjunction of the Heavens with the Earth, and the whole Cement whereby
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:46180:344"/>
the Race of Mankind is kept together; yea, of such Vertue and Efficacy, that, I say, the whole Progeny of <hi>Adam</hi> would very suddenly perish without it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, perhaps, I do not think amiss, when I repute it to be the great Soul of the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,</hi> which (according to the Opinion of the <hi>Academicks</hi>) vivifyeth all manner of things. In Confirmation whereof, that you may the better believe it to be so, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present unto your self, without any preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicacy of Spirit, in a clear and serene Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the <hi>Idea</hi> and Form of some other World than this; take if you please, and lay hold on the <hi>thirtieth</hi> of those which the Philosopher <hi>Methrodorus</hi> did enumerate, wherein it is to be supposed there is no <hi>Debtor</hi> or <hi>Creditor,</hi> that is to say, a World without Debts.</p>

                           <hi>Mercury</hi> then would be no more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the other Planets; he would scorn to be any longer their <hi>Camillus,</hi> as he was of old termed in the <hi>Hetrurian</hi> Tongue; for it is to be imagined that he is no way a Debtor to them.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>O the fine Saying! Now let our <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocosm</hi> be fancied conform to this Model in all its Members; <hi>lending, borrowing</hi> and <hi>owing,</hi> (that is to say) according to its own Nature: For Nature hath not to any other end created Man, but to <hi>owe, borrow</hi> and <hi>lend</hi>; no greater is the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony amongst the Heavenly Spheres, than that which shall be found in its well-ordered Policy. The Intention of the Founder of this Microcosm is, to have a Soul therein to be entertained, which is lodged there, as a Guest with its Host, it may live there for a while. Life consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in Blood, Blood is the Seat of the Soul; therefore the chiefest Work of the Microcosm, is, to be making Blood continually.</p>
                        <p>At this Forge are exercised all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Body; none is exempted from Labour, each operates apart, and doth its proper Office. And such is their Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erarchy, that perpetually the one <hi>borrows</hi> from the other, the one <hi>lends</hi> the other, and the one is the others <hi>Debtor.</hi> The stuff and matter convenient which Nature

giveth to be turned into Blood is <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine.</hi> All kind of nourishing Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals is understood to be comprehended in these two, and from hence in the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thish</hi> Tongue is called <hi>Companage.</hi> To find out this Meat and Drink, to prepare and boil it, the Hands are put to Work, the Feet do walk and bear up the whole Bulk of the Corporal Mass; the Eyes guide and conduct all; the Appetite in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Stomach, by means of little sowrish black Humour (called Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) which is transmitted thereto from the Milt, giveth warning to shut in the Food. The Tongue doth make the first Essay, and tastes it; the Teeth do chaw it, and the Stomach doth receive, digest and chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie it; the Mesaraick Veins suck out of it what is good and fit, leaving behind the Excrements, which are, through spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Conduits for that purpose, voided by an expulsive Faculty; thereafter it is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Liver, where it being changed again, it by the vertue of that new Transmutation becomes <hi>Blood.</hi> What Joy, conjecture you, will then be found amongst those Officers, when they see this <hi>Rivolet of Gold,</hi> which is their sole <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storative?</hi> No greater is the Joy of Alchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists, when after long Travel, Toil and Expence, they see in their Furnaces the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:46180:349"/>
Transmutation: Then is it that every Member doth prepare it self, and strive a-new to purifie and to refine this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. The Kidneys through the emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Veins draw that Aquosity from thence which you call Urine, and there send it away through the Ureters to be slipt downwards; where, in a lower Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepticle, and proper for it, (to wit, the Bladder) it is kept, and stayeth there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til an opportunity to void it out in his due time. The Spleen draweth from the <hi>Blood</hi> its Terrestrial part, <hi>viz.</hi> The Grounds, Lees or thick Substance setled in the bottom thereof, which you term <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly</hi>: The Bottle of the Gall substracts from thence all the superfluous <hi>Choler</hi>; whence it is brought to another Shop or Work-house to be yet better purified and fined, that is, the Heart, which by its agitation of <hi>Diastolick</hi> and <hi>Systolick</hi> Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons so neatly subtilizeth and inflames it, that in the <hi>right side</hi> Ventricle it is brought to perfection, and through the Veins is sent to all the Members; each parcel of the Body draws it then unto its self, and after its own fashion is cherished and ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by it: Feet, Hands, Thighs, Arms, Eyes, Ears, Back, Breast, yea, all; and then it is, that who before were <hi>Lenders,</hi> now become <hi>Debtors.</hi> The Heart doth

in its <hi>left side</hi> Ventricle so thinnifie the Blood, that it thereby obtains the Name of <hi>Spiritual</hi>; which being sent through the <hi>Arteries</hi> to all the Members of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, serveth to warm and winnow the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Blood which runneth through the Veins: The Lights never cease with its Lappets and Bellows to cool and refresh it; in acknowledgment of which good the Heart through the Arterial Vein im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts unto it the choicest of its Blood: At last it is made so fine and subtle within the <hi>Rete Mirabilis,</hi> that thereafter those <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> are framed and composed of it; by means whereof the Imagination, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, Judgment, Resolution, Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Ratrocination and Memory have their Rise, Actings and Operations.</p>

Yet is not this all; this little World thus <hi>lending, owing</hi> and <hi>borrowing,</hi> is so good and charitable, that no sooner is the above-specified Alimentation finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that it forthwith projecteth, and hath already forecast, how it shall <hi>lend</hi> to those who are not as yet born, and by

To this end every Member hath of the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest and most precious of its Nourishment, pare and cut off a Portion, then instantly dispatcheth it downwards to that place, where Nature hath prepared for it very fit Vessels and Receptacles, through which descending to the Genitories by long Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bages, Circuits and Flexuosities, it receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a competent Form, and Rooms apt enough both in the Man and Woman for the future Conservation and perpetuating of Humane kind. All this is done by <hi>Loans</hi> and <hi>Debts</hi> of the one unto the other; and hence have we this word, the <hi>Debt of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</hi> Nature doth reckon Pain to the Refuser, with a most grievous Vexation to his Members, and an outragious Fury amidst his Senses.

                        <p>I Understand you very well, (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) and take you to be very good at Topicks, and throughly affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to your own Cause: But preach it up, and patrocinate it; prattle on it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it as much as you will, even from hence to the next <hi>Whitsuntide,</hi> if you please so to do, yet in the end will you be astonished to find how you shall have gained no ground at all upon me, nor perswaded me by your fair Speeches and smooth Talk to enter never so little into the Thraldom of <hi>Debt.</hi> You <hi>shall owe to none</hi> (saith the Holy Apostle) <hi>any thing save Love,</hi> Friendship and a mutual Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence.</p>
                        <p>You serve me here, I confess, with fine <hi>Graphides</hi> and <hi>Diatyposes,</hi> Descriptions and Figures, which truly please me very well: But let me tell you, if you will represent unto your Fancy an impudent blustering Bully and an importunate Borrower, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring

afresh and newly into a Town al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready advertised of his Manners, you shall find that at his Ingress the Citizens will be more hideously affrighted and amazed, and in a greater terror and fear, dread and trembling, than if the Pest it self should step into it in the very same Garb and Accoutrement wherein the <hi>Tyanaean</hi> Philosopher found it within the City of <hi>Ephesus.</hi> And I am fully confirmed in the Opinion, that the <hi>Persians</hi> erred not, when they said, That <hi>the Second Vice was to Lie,</hi> the <hi>first</hi> being that of <hi>owing Money.</hi> For in very truth, <hi>Debts</hi> and <hi>Lying</hi> are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily joyned together. I will never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless not from hence infer, that none must <hi>owe</hi> any thing, or <hi>lend</hi> any thing. For who so rich can be, that sometimes may not <hi>owe</hi>; or who can be so poor, that sometimes may not <hi>lend?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Let the occasion notwithstanding in that case (as <hi>Plato</hi> very wisely sayeth, and ordaineth in his Laws) be such, that none be permitted to draw any Water out of his Neighbour's Well, until first, they by continual digging and delving into their own proper Ground, shall have hit upon a kind of Potters Earth, which is called <hi>Ceramite,</hi> and there had found no source or drop of Water; for that sort of Earth, by reason of its Substance, which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:46180:351"/>
is fat, strong, firm and close; so retaineth its Humidity, that it doth not easily eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate it by any outward excursion or evaporation.</p>
                        <p>In good sooth, it is a great shame to choose rather to be still <hi>borrowing</hi> in all places from every one, than to work and win. Then only in my Judgment should one <hi>lend,</hi> when the diligent, toiling and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious Person is no longer able by his labour to make any Purchase unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or otherwise, when by mischance he hath suddenly fallen into an unexpected loss of his Goods.</p>
                        <p>Howsoever let us leave this Discourse, and from henceforwards do not hang upon <hi>Creditors,</hi> nor tie your self to them; I make account for the time past to rid you freely of them, and from their Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to deliver you. The least I should in this point, (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) is to thank you, though it be the most I can do: And if Gratitude and Thanksgiving be to be estimated and prized by the Affection of the Benefactor, that is to be done in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely and sempiternally; for the love which you bear me of your own accord and free Grace, without any merit of mine, goeth far beyond the reach of any price or value; it transcends all weight, all number, all measure, it is endless and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:46180:352"/>
everlasting; therefore should I offer to commensurate and adjust it, either to the size and proportion of your own noble and gracious Deeds, or yet to the Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Delight of the obliged Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, I would come off but very faintly and flaggingly. You have verily done me a great deal of good, and multiplied your Favours on me more frequently than was fitting to one of my condition. You have been more bountiful towards me than I have deserved, and your Courtesies have by far surpassed the extent of my merits, I must needs confess it. But it is not, as you suppose, in the proposed matter: For there it is not where I itch, it is not there where it fretteth, hurts or vexeth me; for henceforth being <hi>quit</hi> and out of <hi>Debt,</hi> what Countenance will I be able to keep? You may imagine that it will become me very ill, for the first month, because I have never hitherto been brought up or accustomed to it, I am very much afraid of it. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, there shall not one hereafter, Native of the Country of <hi>Salmigondy,</hi> but he shall level the Shot towards my Nose; all the back-cracking Fellows of the World, in discharging of their Postern Petarades, use commonly to say, <hi>Voila pour les quitters</hi>; that is, <hi>For the quit.</hi> My
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:46180:352"/>
Life will be of very short continuance, I do foresee it, I recommend to you the making of my Epitaph; for I perceive I will die confected in the very stinch of Farts. If at any time to come, by way of restorative to such good Women as shall happen to be troubled with the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous pain of the Wind-Cholick, the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Medicaments prove nothing effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, the Mummy of all my befarted Body will streight be as a present Remedy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Physicians; whereof they taking any small <hi>Modicum,</hi> it will inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently for their Ease afford them a Rattle of Bum-shot, like a Sal of Muskets.</p>
                        <p>Therefore would I beseech you to leave me some few Centuries of <hi>Debts</hi>; as King <hi>Louis</hi> the Eleventh, exempting from Suits in Law the Reverend <hi>Milles d' Illiers,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Chartre,</hi> was by the said Bishop most earnestly sollicited to leave him some few for the Exercise of his mind. I had rather give them all my Revenue of the <hi>Periwinkles,</hi> together with the other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of the <hi>Locusts,</hi> albeit I should not thereby have any parcel abated from off the principal Sums which I owe.

                        <p>BUT, in the Interim, asked <hi>Panurge,</hi> by what Law was it constituted, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and established, that such as should plant a new Vineyard, those that should build a new House, and the new married Men should be exempted and discharged from the Duty of Warfare for the first year? By the Law (answered <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) of <hi>Moyses.</hi> Why (replyed <hi>Panurge</hi>) the lately married? As for the Vine-Planters, I am now too old to reflect on them; my Condition, at this present, induceth me to remain satisfied with the care of Vintage, finishing and turning the Grapes into Wine: Nor are these pretty new Builders of <hi>Dead Stones</hi> written or pricked down in my Book of Life; it is all with <hi>Live Stones</hi> that I set up, and erect the Fabricks of my Architecture, to wit, <hi>Men.</hi> It was (according to my Opinion, quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) to the end, First, That the fresh married Folks should for the first
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:46180:353"/>
year reap a full and compleat Fruition of their Pleasures in their mutual exercise of the act of Love, in such sort, that in waiting more at leisure on the production of Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and propagating of their Progeny, they might the better encrease their Race, and make Provision of new Heirs. That if in the years thereafter the Men should, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their undergoing of some Military Adventure, happen to be killed, their Names and Coats of Arms might conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue with their Children in the same Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies: And next that, the Wives there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, coming to know whether they were barren or fruitful (for one years Trial, in regard of the maturity of Age, wherein; of old, they married, was held sufficient for the Discovery) they might pitch the more suitably, in case of their first Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Decease, upon a <hi>Second Match.</hi> The fertile Women to be wedded to those who desire to multiply their Issue; and the steril ones to such other Mates, as misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the storing of their own Lineage, choose them only for their Vertues, Learning, Genteel Behaviour, Domestick Consolation, management of the House, and Matrimonial Conveniences and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and such like. The Preacher of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennes</hi> (saith <hi>Panarge</hi>) detest and abhor the <hi>Second Marriages,</hi> as altogether foolish and dishonest.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="58" facs="tcp:46180:354"/>Foolish and dishonest, (quoth <hi>Pantagru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>) a plague take such Preachers! Yea but (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) the like Mischief also befal the Friar, <hi>Charmer,</hi> who in a full Auditory, making a Sermon at <hi>Perille,</hi> and therein abominating the Reiteration of Marriage, and the entring again in the Bonds of a Nuptial Tie, did swear and heartily give himself to the swiftest Devil in Hell, if he had not rather choose, and would much more willingly undertake the <hi>unmaidning</hi> or <hi>depucelating</hi> of a hundred Virgins, than the simple Drudgery of one Widow. Truly I find your Reason in that point right good, and strongly grounded.</p>
                        <p>But what would you think, if the Cause why this Exemption or Immunity was granted, had no other Foundation, but that, during the whole space of the said first year, they so lustily bobbed it with their Female Consorts, (as both Reason and Equity require they should do) that they had drained and evacuated their Spermatick Vessels; and were become thereby altogether feeble, weak, emascu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, drooping and flaggingly pithless; yea, in such sort, that they in the day of Battel, like Ducks which plunge over Head and Ears, would sooner hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves behind the Baggage than in the Company of valiant Fighters and daring
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:46180:354"/>
Military Combatants, appear where stern <hi>Bellona</hi> deals her Blows, and moves a bustling Noise of Thwacks and Thumps. Nor is it to be thought that under the Standard of <hi>Mars</hi> they will so much as once strike a fair Stroke, because their most considerable Knocks have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready jerked and whirrited within the Curtines of his Sweet-heart <hi>Venus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In confirmation whereof, amongst other Relicks and Monuments of Antiquity, we now as yet often see, that in all great Houses, after the expiring of some few days, these young married Blades are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily sent away to visit their <hi>Uncles,</hi> that in the Absence of their Wives, reposing themselves a little, they may recover their decayed Strength by the Recruit of a fresh Supply, the more vigorous to return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and face about to renew the dueling Shock and Conflict of an amorous Dalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: Albeit (for the greater part) they have neither <hi>Uncle</hi> nor <hi>Aunt</hi> to go to.</p>

                           <hi>PAnurge</hi> the day thereafter, caused pierce his right Ear, after the <hi>Pewish</hi> Fashion, and thereto clasped a little Gold Ring, of a Fearny-like kind of Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship, in the Beazil or Collet where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was set and inchased a <hi>Flea</hi>; and to the end you may be rid of all Doubts, you are to know that the Flea was black. O what a brave thing it is, in every case and circumstance of a matter, to be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well informed! The Sum of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence hereof, being cast up, brought in, and laid down upon his Council-board Carpet, was found to amount to no more quarterly than the Charge of the Nuptials of a <hi>Hircanian</hi> Tigress; even as you would say 600000 <hi>Maravedis.</hi> At these vast Costs and excessive Disbursements, as soon as he perceived himself to be out of Debt, he fretted much; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:46180:356"/>
as Tyrants and Lawyers use to do, he nourish'd and fed her with the Sweat and Blood of his Subjects and Clients.</p>
                        <p>He then took four <hi>French</hi> Ells of a course brown Russet Cloth, and therein appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling himself, as with a long, plain-seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and single-stitched Gown, left off the wearing of his Breeches, and tied a pair of Spectacles to his Cap. In this Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page did he present himself before <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel</hi>; to whom this Disguise appeared the more strange, that he did not, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, see that goodly, fair and stately Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, which was the sole Anchor of Hope, wherein he was wonted to rely, and last Refuge he had 'midst all the Waves and boysterous Billows, which a stormy Cloud in a cross Fortune would raise up against him. Honest <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> not understanding the Mystery, asked him by way of interrogatory, what he did intend to personate in that new-fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled <hi>Prosopopeia?</hi> I have (answered <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge) a Flea in mine Ear,</hi> and have a mind to marry. In a good time (quoth <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel</hi>) you have told me joyful Tidings; yet would not I hold a red hot Iron in my hand for all the Gladness of them. But it is not the fashion of Lovers to be accoutred in such dangling Vestments, so as to have their Shirts flagging down over
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:46180:356"/>
their Knees, without Breeches, and with a long Robe of a dark brown mingled Hue, which is a Colour never used, in <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larian</hi> Garments amongst any Persons of Honour, Quality or Vertue. If some <hi>Heretical</hi> Persons and Schismatical Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries have at any time formerly been so arrayed and cloathed, (though many have imputed such a kind of Dress to Cosenage, Cheat, Imposture, and an Affectation of Tyranny upon credulous Minds of the rude Multitude) I will nevertheless not blame them for it, nor in that point judge rashly or sinistrously of them; every one overflowingly aboundeth in his own Sense and Fancy: Yea, in things of a Foreign Consideration, altogether extrinsical and indifferent, which in and of themselves are neither commendable nor bad, because they proceed not from the Interior of the Thoughts and Heart, which is the Shop of all Good and Evil. Of Goodness, if it be upright, and that its Affections be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by the pure and clean Spirit of Righteousness; and on the other side, of Wickedness, if its Inclinations, stray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beyond the bounds of Equity be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and depraved by the Malice and Suggestions of the Devil. It is only the Novelty and new-fangledness thereof which I dislike, together with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:46180:357"/>
of common Custom, and the Fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is in use.</p>
                        <p>The Colour (answered <hi>Panurge</hi>) is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, for it is conform to that of my Council-Board Carpet, therefore will I henceforth hold me with it, and more narrowly and circumspectly than ever hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto I have done, look to my Affairs and Business. Seeing I am once out of <hi>Debt,</hi> you never yet saw Man more unpleasing then I will be, if God help me not. Lo here be my Spectacles. To see me afar off, you would readily say, that it were Fryar <hi>Burgess.</hi> I believe certainly, that in the next ensuing Year, I shall once more preach the <hi>Croisade, Bounce Buckram.</hi> Do you see this Russet? doubt not but there lurketh under it some hid Property and occult Vertue, known to very few in the World. I did not take it on before this Morning; and nevertheless, am already in a rage of Lust, mad after a Wife, and vehemently hot upon untying the Codpiece-point, I itch, I tingle, I wriggle, and long exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to be married; that without the danger of Cudgel-blows, I may labour my Female Copes-mate with the hard push of a Bull-horned Devil. O the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident and thrifty Husband that I then will be! After my Death, with all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Respect due to my Frugality,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:46180:357"/>
will they burn the Sacred Bulk of my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, of purpose to preserve the Ashes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in memory of the choicest Pattern that ever was, of a perfectly wary, and compleat Housholder. Cops-body, this is not the Carpet whereon my Treasurer shall be allowed to play false in his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts with me, by setting down an X for an V, or an L for an S; for in that case, should I make a hail of Fifti-cuffs to fly into his face. Look upon me (Sir) both before and behind, it is made after the manner of a <hi>Toge,</hi> which was the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fashion of the <hi>Romans</hi> in time of Peace. I took the Mode, Shape, and Form thereof in <hi>Trajan</hi>'s Column at <hi>Rome,</hi> as also in the Triumphant Arch of <hi>Septi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Severus.</hi> I am tired of the Wars, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of wearing Buff-coats, Cassocks, and Hoquetons. My Shoulders are pitifully worn, and bruised with the carrying of Harness; let Armour cease, and the Long Robe bear sway: at least it must be so for the whole space of the succeeding Years. If I be married as yesterday, by the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law, you evidenced, in what concerneth the Breeches: my great Aunt <hi>Laurence</hi> did long ago tell me, that the Breeches were only ordained for the use of the Codpiece, and to no other end; which I, upon a no less forcible consequence, give Credit to,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:46180:358"/>
every whit as well, as to the Saying of the fine Fellow <hi>Galen,</hi> who in his Ninth Book <hi>Of the Use,</hi> and <hi>Employment of our Members,</hi> alledgeth, That the <hi>Head was made for the Eyes:</hi> for Nature might have placed our Heads in our Knees or Elbows, but having before-hand determined that the Eyes should serve to discover things from afar, she for the better enabling them to execute their designed Office, fixed them in the Head (as on the top of a long Pole) in the most eminent part of all the Body: no otherwise then we see the <hi>Phares,</hi> or high Towers erected in the Mouths of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, that Navigators may the further off perceive with ease the Lights of the night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fires and Lanterns. And because I would gladly, for some short while (a Year at least) take a little rest and breathing-time from the toylsome Labour of the Military Profession; that is to say, be married, I have desisted from wearing any more a Codpiece, and consequently have laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side my Breeches: for the Codpiece is the principal and most especial Piece of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that a Warriour doth carry; and therefore do I maintain even to the Fire (exclusively, understand you me) that no <hi>Turks</hi> can properly be said to be armed Men, in regard that Codpieces are by their Law forbidden to be worn.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. VIII. Why the Codpiece is held to be the chief piece of Armour amongst Warriours.</head>
                        <p>WIll you maintain (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) that the Codpiece is the chief piece of a Military Harness? It is a new kind of Doctrine very paradoxical: for we say at Spurs begins the arming of a Man. Sir, I maintain it, (answered <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi>) and not wrongfully do I maintain it. Behold how Nature having a fervent desire after its Production of Plants, Trees, Shrubs, Herbs, Sponges, and plant Animals, to eternize, and continue them unto all Succession of Ages (in their several Kinds, or Sorts at least, although the Individuals perish) unruinable, and in an everlasting Being, hath most cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously armed and fenced their Buds, Sprouts, Shutes, and Seeds, wherein the above-mentioned perpetuity consisteth, by strengthning, covering, guarding, and fortifying them with an admirable indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, with Husks, Cases, Scurfs, and Swads,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:46180:359"/>
Hulls, Cods, Stones, Films, Cartels, Shells, Ears, Rinds, Barks, Skins, Ridges, and Prickles, which serve them instead of strong, fair, and <hi>natural Codpieces:</hi> as is manifestly apparent in Pease, Beans, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, Pomegranates, Peaches, Cottons, Gourds, Pumpions, Melons, Corn, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Almonds, Walnuts, Filberts, and Chestnuts; as likewise in all Plants, Slips, or Sets whatsoever, wherein it is plainly and evidently seen, that the Sperm and <hi>Semenae</hi> is more closely veiled, oversha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed, corroborated, and throughly har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed than any other part, portion, or parcel of the whole.</p>
                        <p>Nature nevertheless did not after that manner provide for the sempiternizing of Human Race: but on the contrary crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Man naked, tender, and frail, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either offensive or defensive Arms; and that in the Estate of Innocence, in the first Age of all, which was the Golden Season; not as a Plant, but living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, born for Peace, not War, and brought forth into the World with an unquestio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Right and Title to the plenary fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition and enjoyment of all Fruits and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables; as also to a certain calm and gentle Rule and Dominion over all Kinds of Beasts, Fowls, Fishes, Reptils, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects. Yet afterwards it hapning in the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:46180:359"/>
time of the Iron Age, under the Reign of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> when to the multiplication of mischievous Actions, wickedness and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice began to take root and footing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the then perverted Hearts of Men, that the Earth began to bring forth Nettles, Thistles, Thorns, Bryars, and such other stubborn and rebellious Vegetables to the Nature of Man; nor scarce was there any Animal, which by a fatal disposition did not then revolt from him, and tacitly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire, and covenant with one another to serve him no longer, (nor in case of their ability to resist) to do him any manner of Obedience, but rather (to the uttermost of their power) to annoy him with all the hurt and harm they could. The Man then, that he might maintain his primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Right and Prerogative, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue his Sway and Dominion over all, both Vegetable and Sensitive Creatures; and knowing of a truth, that he could not be well accommodated as he ought, without the servitude and subjection of several A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals, bethought himself, that of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he must needs put on Arms, and make provision of Harness against Wars and Violence. By the holy Saint <hi>Babingoose,</hi> (cried out <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) you are become, since the last Rain, a great <hi>Lifre lofre, Philosopher,</hi> I should say. Take Notice,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:46180:360"/>
Sir, (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) when Dame Nature had prompted him to his own Arming, what part of the Body it was, where, by her Inspiration, he clapped on the first Harness: It was forsooth by the double pluck of my little Dog the <hi>Ballock,</hi> and good <hi>Senor Don Priapos Stabo-stando,</hi> which done, he was content, and sought no more. This is certified by the Testimony of the great <hi>Hebrew</hi> Captain Philosopher <hi>Moyses,</hi> who affirmeth, That he fenced that Member with a brave and gallant Codpiece, most exquisitely framed, and by right curious Devices of a notably pregnant Invention, made up and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of <hi>Fig-tree-leaves,</hi> which by reason of their solid stiffness, incisory notches, curled frisling, sleeked smoothness, large ampleness, together with their colour, smell, vertue, and faculty, were exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proper, and fit for the covering and arming of the Sachels of Generation, the hideously big Lorram Cullions being from thence only excepted; which swaggring down to the lowermost bottom of the Breeches, cannot abide (for being quite out of all order and method) the stately fashion of the high and lofty Codpiece; as is manifest, by the Noble <hi>Valentin Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardiere,</hi> whom I found at <hi>Nancie,</hi> on the First Day of <hi>May</hi> (the more flauntingly
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:46180:360"/>
to gallantrize it afterwards) rubbing his Ballocks, spread out upon a Table after the manner of a <hi>Spanish</hi> Cloak. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, that none should henceforth say, who would not speak improperly, when any Country-Bumpkin hyeth to the Wars, <hi>Have a care,</hi> (my Roysters, <hi>of the Wine-pot,</hi> that is the Scull, but <hi>have a care</hi> (my Royster) <hi>of the Milk-pot</hi>; that is, the Testicles. By the whole Rabble of the horned Fiends of Hell, the Head being cut off, that single Person only thereby dieth: but if the Ballocks be marred, the whole Race of Humane Kind would forthwith perish, and be lost for ever.</p>
                        <p>This was the motive which incited the goodly Writer <hi>Galen, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>De Spermate,</hi> to aver with boldness, <hi>That it were better</hi> (that is to say, a less evil) <hi>to have no Heart at all, than to be quite destitute of Genitories:</hi> for there is laid up, conserved, and put in store, as in a Secessive Repository, and Sacred Warehouse, the <hi>Semenae,</hi> and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Source of the whole Off-spring of Mankind. Therefore would I be apt to believe, for less than a hundred Franks, that those are the very same Stones, by means whereof <hi>Deucalion</hi> and <hi>Pyrrha</hi> resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Humane Race, in peopling with Men and Women the World, which a little before that, had been drowned in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:46180:361"/>
the overflowing Waves of a Poetical Deluge. This stirred up the valiant <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinian,</hi> L. 1.4. <hi>De Cagotis tollendis,</hi> to collocate his <hi>Summum Bonum,</hi> in <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guibus, &amp; Braguetis.</hi> For this, and other Causes, the Lord <hi>Humphry de Merville,</hi> following of his King to a certain War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Expedition, whilst he was in trying upon his own Person a new Suit of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, for of his old rusty Harness he could make no more use, by reason that some few Years since, the Skin of his Belly was a great way removed from his Kidneys, his Lady thereupon in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found musing of a contemplative Spirit, very maturely considering that he had but small care of the Staff of Love, and Packet of Marriage, seeing he did no otherways arm that part of the Body, then with Links of Mail, advised him to shield, fence, and gabionate it with a big tilting Helmet, which she had lying in her Closet, to her otherways utterly unprofitable.

                        <p>TO this <hi>Pantagruel</hi> replying nothing, <hi>Panurge</hi> prosecuted the Discourse he had already broached, and therewithal fetching, as far from the bottom of his Heart, a very deep sigh, said, My Lord and Master, you have heard the Design I am upon, which is to marry, if by some disastrous mischance, all the Holes in the World be not shut up, stopped, closed, and bush'd. I humbly beseech you for the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which of a long time you have born me, to give me your best Advice therein. Then (answered <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) seeing you have so decreed, taken deliberation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that the matter is fully determined, what need is there of any further Talk thereof, but forthwith to put it into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution what you have resolved. Yea, but (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) I would be loath to act any thing therein without your Counsel
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:46180:362"/>
had thereto. It is my Judgment also (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) and I advise you to it. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) if I understood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right that it were much better for me to remain a Batchellor as I am, than to run headlong upon new hair-brain'd Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings of Conjugal Adventure, I would rather choose not to marry, quoth <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel.</hi> Then do not marry. Yea, but (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) would you have me so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarily drive out the whole Course of my Life, without the Comfort of a Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Consort? You know it is written, <hi>Vae soli,</hi> and a single Person is never seen to reap the Joy and Solace that is found with married Folks. Then marry, in the Name of God, quoth <hi>Pantagruel.</hi> But if (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) my Wife should make me a Cuckold; as it is not unknown unto you, how this hath been a very plentiful Year in the production of that kind of Cattel; I would fly out, and grow impatient, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all measure and mean. I love Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kolds with my Heart, for they seem unto me to be of a right honest Conversation, and I, truly, do very willingly frequent their Company: but should I die for it, I would not be one of their number, that is a Point for me of a two-sore prickling Point. Then do not marry (quoth <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel</hi>) for without all controversie, this
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:46180:363"/>
Sentence of <hi>Seneca</hi> is infallibly true, <hi>What thou to others shalt have done, others will do the like to thee.</hi> Do you (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) aver that without all exceptions? Yes, truly, (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) without all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. Ho, ho (says <hi>Panurge</hi>) by the Wrath of a little Devil, his meaning is, either <hi>in this World,</hi> or in <hi>the other,</hi> which <hi>is to come.</hi> Yet seeing I can no more want a Wife, then a blind Man his Staff, the Funnel must be in agitation, without which manner of Occupation I cannot live. Were it not a great deal better for me to apply and associate my self to some one honest, lovely, and vertuous Woman, then (as I do) by a new change of Females every Day, run a hazard of being Bastinadoed, or (which is worse) of the Great Pox, if not of both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For never (be it spoken, by their Husbands leave and favour) had I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment yet of an honest Woman. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry then in God's Name, quoth <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel.</hi> But if (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) it were the Will of God, and that my Destiny did unluckily lead me to marry an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Woman who should beat me, I would be stor'd with more than two third parts of the Patience of <hi>Iob,</hi> if I were not stark mad by it, and quite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted with such rugged Dealings: for
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:46180:363"/>
it hath been told me, that those exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing honest Women have ordinarily very wicked Head-pieces; therefore is it that their Family lacketh not for good Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar. Yet in that case should it go worse with me, if I did not then in such sort bang her Back and Breast, so thump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly bethwack her Gillets, to wit, her Arms, Legs, Head, Lights, Liver, and Milt, with her other Intrails, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, jag, and slash her Coats, so after the Cross billet fashion, that the greatest Devil of Hell should wait at the Gate for the reception of her damned Soul. I could make a shift for this Year to wave such molestation and disquiet, and be content to lay aside that trouble, and not to be engaged in it.</p>
                        <p>Do not marry then, answered <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel.</hi> Yea, but (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Condition wherein I now am, out of Debt and Unmarried; mark what I say, free from all Debt, in an ill hour (for were I deeply on the Score, my Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors would be but too careful of my Paternity) but being quit, and not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, no Body will be so regardful of me, or carry towards me a Love like that which is said to be in a Conjugal Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And if by some mishap I should fall sick, I would be lookt to very waywardly.

The wise Man saith, <hi>Where there is no Woman</hi> (I mean the Mother of a Family, and Wife in the Union of a lawful Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock) <hi>the Crazy and Diseased are in danger of being ill used, and of having much brab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and strife about them:</hi> as by clear Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath been made apparent in the Persons of Popes, Legates, Cardinals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, Abbots, Priors, Priests and Monks: but there, assure your self, you shall not find me. Marry then in the Name of God, answered <hi>Pantagruel.</hi> But if (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) being ill at ease, and possibly thrô that Distemper, made unable to discharge the Matrimonial Duty that is incumbent to an active Husband, my Wife, impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of that drooping Sickness, and faint Fits, of a pining Languishment, should abandon and prostitute herself to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of another Man, and not only then not help and assist me in my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity and need, but withal f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>Pantagruel</hi>).

For being free from Debt, and yet not married, if casually I should fret and be angry, although the cause of my Grief and Displeasure were never so just, I am afraid instead of Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that I should meet with nothing else but Scoffs, Frumps, Gibes, and Mocks at my disastrous Fortune.

It is therefore expedient, seeing you are resolved for once to take a trial of the state of Marriage, that, with shut Eyes, bowing your Head, and kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Ground, you put the business to a Venture, and give it a fair hazard in recommending the success of the residue to the disposure of Almighty God.

(Quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) that sort of <hi>Lottery</hi> is deceitful, abusive, illici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, and exceedingly scandalous; never trust in it; the accursed Book of the <hi>Recreation of Dice</hi> was a great while ago excogitated in <hi>Achaia</hi> near <hi>Bourre,</hi> by that ancient Enemy to Mankind, the Infernal Calumniator, who before the Statue or Massive Image of the <hi>Bourraick Hercules,</hi> did of old, and doth in several places of the World as yet, make many simple Souls to err and fall into his Snares. You know how my Father <hi>Gargantua</hi> hath forbidden it over all his Kingdoms and Dominions; how he hath caused burn the Moulds and Draughts thereof, and altogether suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, abolished, driven forth and cast it out
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:46180:369"/>
of the Land, as a most dangerous Plague and Infection to any well-polished State or Commonwealth. What I have told you of <hi>Dice,</hi> I say the same of the Play at <hi>Cockall.</hi> It is a Lottery of the like Guile and Deceitfulness; and therefore do not for convincing of me, alledge in oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to this my Opinion, or bring in the Example of the fortunate Cast of <hi>Teberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> within the Fountain of <hi>Appona,</hi> at the Oracle of <hi>Gerion.</hi> These are the bait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hooks by which the Devil attracts and draweth unto him the foolish Souls of silly People into eternal Perdition.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless to satisfie your Humour in some measure, I am content you throw three <hi>Dice</hi> upon this Table, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the number of the Blots which shall happen to be cast up, we may hit upon a Verse of that Page, which in the setting open of the Book you shall have pitched upon.</p>

A whole Bag full, answered <hi>Panurge,</hi> that is Provision against the Devil, as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by <hi>Merlin Coccajus,</hi> Lib. 2. <hi>De Patria Diabolorum,</hi> the Devil would be sure to take me napping; and very much at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares, if he should find me without Dice. With this the three Dice being taken out, produced and thrown, they fell so pat

upon the lower Points, that the Cast was <hi>Five, Six</hi> and <hi>Five.</hi> These are (quoth <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge) Sixteen</hi> in all. Let us take the Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Line of the Page, the number pleaseth me very well; I hope we shall have a prosperous and happy Chance. May I be thrown amidst all the Devils of Hell, even as a great Bowl cast athwart at a Set of Nine Pins, or Cannon-ball shot among a Batalion of Foot, in case so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times I do not boult my future Wife the first Night of our Marriage. Of that, forsooth, I make no doubt at all: (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) You needed not to have rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped forth such a horrid Imprecation, the sooner to procure Credit for the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of so small a business, seeing possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the first Bout will be <hi>amiss,</hi> and that you know is usually at Tennis called <hi>Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen.</hi> At the next justling Turn you may readily amend that Fault, and so compleat your Reckoning of <hi>Sixteen.</hi> Is it so (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) that you understand the matter? and must my Words be thus interpreted? Nay, believe me, never yet was any <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecism</hi> committed by that valiant Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who often hath for me in <hi>Belly-dale</hi> stood Centry at the <hi>Hypogastrian</hi> Crany. Did you ever hitherto find me in the Confraternity of the Faulty? Never, I trow; never, nor ever shall, for ever and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:46180:370"/>
a day. I do the Feat like a goodly Friar, or Father Confessor without Default: And therein am I willing to be judged by the Players. He had no sooner spoke these Words, than the Works of <hi>Virgil</hi> were brought in: But before the Book was laid open, <hi>Panurge</hi> said to <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> My Heart, like the Furch of a Hart in Rut, doth beat within my Breast.

This was verified in the Conflagration of the Ships of <hi>Ajax Oileus,</hi> nor doth this fulminating Power belong to any other of the <hi>Olympick</hi> Gods; Men therefore stand not in such fear of them. Moreover, I will tell you, and you may take it as extracted out of the profoundest Mysteries of Mythology, that when the Giants had enterprized the waging of a War against the Power of the Coelestial Orbs, the Gods at first did laugh at those Attempts, and scorn'd such despicable Enemies, who were in their conceit, not strong enough to cope in Feats of Warfare with their Pages: but when they saw by the Gigantine labour the high Hill <hi>Pelion</hi> set on lofty <hi>Ossa,</hi> and that the Mount <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympus</hi> was made shake to be erected on the top of both.</p>

and others, the Soul doth often times foresee what is to come.</p>
                        <p>How true this is, you may conceive by a very vulgar and familiar Example; as when you see that at such a time as Suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Babes, well nourished, fed and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred with good Milk, sleep soundly and profoundly, the Nurses in the interim get leave to sport themselves, and are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiated to recreate their Fancies at what Range to them shall seem most fitting and expedient; their Presence, Sedulity and Attendance on the Cradle being, during all that space, held unnecessary.</p>
                        <p>Even just so, when our Body is at rest, that the Concoction is every where ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, and that, till it awake, it lacks for nothing, our Soul delighteth to disport it self, and is well-pleased in that Frolick to take a review of its Native Country, which is the Heavens, where it receiveth a most notable Participation of its first beginning with an Imbuement from its Divine Source, and in Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of that Infinite and Intellectual Sphere, whereof the Center is every where, and the Circumference in no place of the universal World, to wit, God, according to the Doctrine of <hi>Hermes Tris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megistus,</hi> to whom no new thing hapneth, whom nothing that is past escapeth, and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:46180:376"/>
unto whom all things are alike present, remarketh not only what is <hi>preterit,</hi> and gone in the inferiour Course and Agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sublunary matters, but withal taketh notice what is to come; then bringing a Relation of those future Events unto the Body by the outward Senses and exterior Organs, it is divulged abroad unto the hearing of others. Whereupon the Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of that Soul deserveth to be termed a <hi>Vatiemator,</hi> or Prophet.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless the truth is, that the Soul is seldom able to report those things in such Sincerity as it hath seen them, by reason of the Imperfection and Frailty of the Corporeal Senses, which obstruct the effectuating of that Office; even as the Moon doth not communicate unto this Earth of ours that Light which she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth from the Sun with so much Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, Heat, Vigour, Purity and Liveliness as it was given her. Hence it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site for the better reading, explaining and unfolding of these <hi>Somniatory Vaticiations</hi> and Predictions of that nature, that a dexterous, learned, skilful, wise, industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, expert, rational and peremptory Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounder or Interpreter be pitched upon, such a one as by the <hi>Greeks</hi> is called <hi>Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocrit,</hi> or <hi>Oniropolist.</hi>

The Sacred Scriptures testifie no less, and profane Histories assure us of it, in both which are exposed to our view a thousand several kinds of strange Adventures, which have befallen pat according to the nature of the Dream, and that as well to the Party Dreamer as to others.

                        <p>AT Seven a Clock of the next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Morning, <hi>Panurge</hi> did not fail to present himself before <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> in whose Chamber were at that time <hi>Episte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> Fryar <hi>Iohn of the Funnels, Ponocrates, Eudemon, Carpalin,</hi> and others, to whom, at the entry of <hi>Panurge, Pantagruel</hi> said, <hi>Lo, here cometh our Dreamer.</hi> That word (quoth <hi>Epistemon</hi>) in ancient times cost very much, and was dearly sold to the Children of <hi>Iacob.</hi> Then, said <hi>Panurge,</hi> I have been plunged into my dumps so deeply, as if I had been lodged with Gaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>Noddy cap:</hi> dreamed indeed I have, and that right lustily; but I could take a long with me no more thereof, that I did goodly understand, save only, that I in my Vision had a pretty, fair, young, gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, handsome Woman, who no less lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly and kindly treated and entertained me, hugg'd, cherish'd, cocker'd, dandled,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:46180:382"/>
and made much of me, as if I had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother neat dillidarling Minion, like <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis:</hi> never was Man more glad then I was then, my joy at that time was incompera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; she flattred me, tickled me, stroaked me, groped me, frizled me, curled me, kissed me, embraced me, laid her Hands about my Neck, and now and then made jestingly, pretty little Horns above my Forehead: I told her in the like disport, as I did play the Fool with her, that she should rather place and fix them in a little below mine Eyes, that I might see the better what I should stick at, with them: for being so situated, <hi>Momus</hi> then would find no fault therewith, as he did once with the position of the Horns of Bulls. The wanton, toying Girl, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any remonstrance of mine to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, did always drive and thrust them further in: yet thereby (which to me seemed wonderful) she did not do me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hurt at all. A little after, though I know not how, I thought I was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd into a <hi>Tabor,</hi> and she into a <hi>Chough.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>My sleeping there being interrupted, I awaked in a start, angry, displeased, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, chafing, and very wroth. There have you a large-Platter-full of Dreams, make thereupon good Chear, and, if you
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:46180:382"/>
please, spare not to interpret them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Understanding which you may have in them. Come <hi>Carpalin,</hi> let us to Breakfast. To my sence and meaning, (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) if I have skill or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Art of Divination by Dreams, your Wife will not really, and to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance of the World, plant, or set Horns, and stick them fast in your Forehead, after a visible manner, as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs use to wear and carry them; but she will be so far from preserving herself Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in the discharge and observance of a Conjugal Duty, that on the contrary she will violate her plighted Faith, break her Marriage-Oath, infringe all Matrimonial Tyes, prostitute her Body to the Dalliance of other Men, and so make you a Cuckold. This point is clearly and manifestly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained and expounded by <hi>Artemidorus,</hi> just as I have related it. Nor will there be any metamorphosis, or transmutation made of you into a <hi>Drum,</hi> or <hi>Tabor,</hi> but you will surely be as soundly beaten as e're was <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor</hi> at a merry Wedding: nor yet will she be changed into a <hi>Chough,</hi> but will steal from you, chiefly in the Night, as is the nature of that thievish Bird. Hereby may you perceive your <hi>Dreams</hi> to be in every jot conform and agreeable to the <hi>Virgilian</hi> Lots: A Cuckold you will be, beaten
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:46180:383"/>
and robbed. Then cryed out Father <hi>Iohn</hi> with a loud Voice: He tells the truth; upon my Conscience, thou wilt be a Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kold, an honest one, I warrant thee; O the brave Horns that will be born by thee! Ha, ha, ha. Our good Master <hi>De Corni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> God save thee, and shield thee; Wilt thou be pleased to preach but two words of a Sermon to us, and I will go through the Parish-Church to gather up Alms for the poor.</p>
                        <p>You are (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) very far mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken in your Interpretation; for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is quite contrary to your sence thereof; my Dream presageth, that I shall by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage be stored with plenty of all manner of Goods, the hornifying of me shewing, that I will possess a <hi>Cornucopia,</hi> that <hi>Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaean</hi> Horn, which is called, <hi>The Horn of Abundance,</hi> whereof the fruition did still portend the Wealth of the Enjoyer. You possibly will say, that they are rather like to be Satyrs Horns; for you of these did make some mention. <hi>Amen, Amen, Fiat siat, ad differentiam papae.</hi> Thus shall I have my <hi>Touch-her-home</hi> still ready; my <hi>Staff of Love</hi> sempiternally in a good case, will, Satyr-like, be never toyled out; a thing which all Men wish for, and send up their Prayers to that purpose, but such a thing as nevertheless is granted but to a few; hence
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:46180:383"/>
doth it follow by a consequence as clear as the Sun-beams, that I will never be in the danger of being made a Cuckold, for the defect hereof is, <hi>Causa sine qua non</hi>; yea, the sole cause (as many think) of making Husbands Cuckolds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What makes poor scoundrel Rogues to beg (I pray you)? Is it not because they have not enough at home, wherewith to fill their Bellies, and their Poaks. What is it makes the Wolves to leave the Woods? Is it not the want of Flesh Meat. What maketh Women Whores? you understand me well enough. And herein may I very well submit my Opinion to the Judgment of learned Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, Presidents, Counsellors, Advocates, Procurers, Attorneys, and other Glossers and Commentators on the venerable Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, <hi>De Frigidis, &amp; maleficiatis.</hi> You are in truth, Sir, as it seems to me (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse my boldness if I have transgressed) in a most palpable and absurd Error, to attribute my Horns to Cuckoldry: <hi>Diana</hi> wears them on her Head after the manner of a <hi>Cressant,</hi> is she a <hi>Cuequean</hi> for that? How the Devil can she be cuckolded, who never yet was married? Speak some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more correctly, I beseech you, least she being offended, furnish you with a pair of Horns, shapen by the Pattern of those which she made for <hi>Actaeon.</hi> The

goodly <hi>Bacchus</hi> also carries Horns; <hi>Pan, Iupiter Hammon,</hi> with a great many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, are they all Cuckolds? If <hi>Iove</hi> be a Cuckold, <hi>Iuno</hi> is a Whore: this follows by the Figure <hi>Metalepsis.</hi> As to call a Child in the presence of his Father and Mother, a Bastard, or Whore's Son, is tacitly and under-board, no less than if he had said openly, the Father is a Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kold, and his Wife a Punk. Let our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse come nearer to the purpose: The Horns that my Wife did make me are Horns of Abundance, planted and grafted in my Head for the increase and shooting up of all good things: this will I affirm for truth, upon my Word, and pawn my Faith and Credit both upon it; as for the rest, I will be no less joyful, frolick, glad, cheerful, merry, jolly, and gamesome then a well-bended <hi>Tabor</hi> in the Hands of a good Drummer, at a Nuptial Feast, still making a noise, still rowling, still buzzing and cracking. Believe me, Sir, in that consisteth none of my least good Fortunes. And my Wife will be jocund, feat, compt, neat, quaint, dainty, trim, trick'd up, brisk, smirk and smug, even as a pretty little <hi>Cornish Chough:</hi> who will not believe this, let <hi>Hell</hi> or the <hi>Gallows</hi> be the Burden of his <hi>Christmas</hi> Carol.</p>

                           <pb n="119" facs="tcp:46180:384"/>I remark (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) the last point or particle which you did speak of, and having seriously conferred it with the first, find that at the beginning you were delighted with the sweetness of your Dream; but in the end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and final closure of it, you startingly awaked, and on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den were forthwith vexed in Choler, and annoyed. Yea, (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of that was, because I had fasted too long. Flatter not your self (quoth <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel</hi>) all will go to ruine: know for a certain truth, that every Sleep that end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with a starting, and leaves the Person irksome, grieved, and fretting, doth either signifie a present evil, or otherways pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sageth, and portendeth a future imminent mishap. To signifie an Evil, that is to say, to shew some Sickness hardly cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, a kind of pestilentious, or malignant Bile, Botch, or Sore, lying and lurking, hid, occult, and latent within the very Center of the Body, which many times doth by the means of Sleep (whose nature is to reinforce, and strengthen the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Vertue of Concoction) begin ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Theorems of Physick to declare itself, and moves toward the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Superficies. At this sad stirring is the Sleeper's rest and ease disturbed and broken, whereof the first feeling and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:46180:385"/>
stinging smart admonisheth, that he must patiently endure great pain and trouble, and thereunto provide some remedy: as when we say proverbially to incense Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, to move a stinking Puddle, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake a sleeping Lyon, instead of these more usual expressions, and of a more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar and plain meaning, to provoke an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Persons, to make a thing the worse by medling with it, and to irritate a testy cholerick Man when he is at quiet. On the other part, to presage or fore-tell an Evil, especially in what concerneth the Exploits of the Soul, in matter of <hi>Somnial Divinations,</hi> is as much to say, as that it giveth us to understand, that some dismal Fortune or Mischance is destinated and prepared for us, which shortly will not fail to come to pass. A clear and evident Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample hereof is to be found in the Dream, and dreadful awaking of <hi>Hecuba,</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in that of <hi>Euridice,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus,</hi> (neither of which was sooner finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, saith <hi>Cunius</hi>) but that incontinently thereafter they awaked in a start, and were affrighted horribly; thereupon these Accidents ensued, <hi>Hecuba</hi> had her Husband <hi>Priamus,</hi> together with her Children, slain before her eyes, and saw then the Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of her Country; and <hi>Euridice</hi> died speedily thereafter, in a most miserable
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:46180:385"/>
manner. <hi>Aeneas</hi> dreaming that he spoke to <hi>Hector</hi> a little after his Decease, did on a sudden in a great start awake, and was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid: now hereupon did follow this event; <hi>Troy</hi> that same Night was spoil'd, sack'd, and burnt. At another time the same <hi>Aeneas,</hi> dreaming that he saw his familiar <hi>Geniuses</hi> and <hi>Penates,</hi> in a ghastly fright and astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment awaked, of which terrour and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the issue was, that the very next day subsequent, by a most horrible Tempest on the Sea, he was like to have perished, and been cast-away. Moreover, <hi>Turnus</hi> being prompted, instigated, and stirred up, by the fantastick Vision of an infernal Fury, to enter into a bloody War against <hi>Aeneas,</hi> awaked in a start much troubled and disquieted in Spirit, in sequel whereof, after many notable and famous Routs, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feats and Discomfitures in open Field, he came at last to be killed in a single Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, by the said <hi>Aeneas.</hi> A thousand other instances I could afford, if it were needful, of this matter. Whilst I relate these Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> remark the saying of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius Pictor,</hi> who faithfully averred, That nothing had at any time befallen unto, was done, or enterprized by him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he <hi>preallably</hi> had not Notice, and before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand fore seen it to the full, by sure Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, altogether founded on the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:46180:386"/>
of <hi>Somnial Divination.</hi> To this there is no want of pregnant Reasons, no more then of Examples: for if Repose and Rest in Sleeping be a special Gift and Favour of the Gods, as is maintained by the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, and by the Poet attested in these Lines:
<q>
                              <l>Then Sleep, that heavenly Gift, came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh,</l>
                              <l>Of humane Labourers, the wearied Flesh.</l>

Such a Gift or Benefit can never finish or terminate in wrath and indignation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out portending some unlucky Fate, and most disastrous Fortune to ensue; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways it were a Molestation, and not an Ease; a Scourge and not a Gift, at least, proceeding from the Gods above, but from the infernal Devils our Enemies, according to the common vulgar Saying.</p>

                        <p>THE Lord save those who see, and do not hear, (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) I see you well enough, but know not what it is that you have said: the Hunger-starved Belly wanteth Ears: For lack of Victuals, before God, I roar, bray, yell and fume as in a furious Madness. I have perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med too hard a Task to day, an extrordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Work indeed: He shall be craftier, and do far greater Wonders than ever did Mr. <hi>Mush,</hi> who shall be able any more this year to bring me on the Stage of Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a dreaming Verdict. Fy; not to sup at all, that is the Devil. Pox take that Fashion. Come Friar <hi>Iohn,</hi> let us go break our Fast; for if I hit on such a round Refection in the morning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as will serve throughly to fill the Mill-hopper and Hogshide of my Stomach, and furnish it with Meat and Drink sufficient, then at a
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:46180:387"/>
pinch, as in the case of some extream ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity which presseth, I could make a shift that day to forbear Dining. But not to Sup: A Plague-rot that base Custom, which is an Error offensive to Nature. That <hi>Lady</hi> made the Day for Exercise, to travel, work, wait on and labour in each his Negotiation and Employment; and that we may with the more Fervency and Ardour prosecute our business, she sets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us a clear burning Candle, to wit, the Suns Resplendency: And at Night, when she begins to take the Light from us, she thereby tacitly implies no less, than if she would have spoken thus unto us: <hi>My Lads and Lasses,</hi> all of you are good and honest Folks, you have wrought well to day, toiled and turmoiled enough, the Night approacheth, therefore cast off these moiling Cares of yours, desist from all your swinking painful Labours, and set your Minds how to refresh your Bodies in the renewing of their Vigour with good Bread, choice Wine, and store of whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som Meats; then may you take some Sport and Recreation, and after that lie down and rest your selves, that you may strongly, nimbly, lustily, and with the more Alacrity to morrow attend on your Affairs as formerly.</p>

                           <pb n="126" facs="tcp:46180:388"/>Falconers in like manner, when they have fed their Hawks, will not suffer them to fly on a full Gorge, but let them on a Pearch abide a little, that they may rouse, bait, tour and soar the better. That good <hi>Pope,</hi> who was the first Instituter of Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, understood this well enough; for he ordained that our <hi>Fast</hi> should reach but to the hour of <hi>Noon</hi>; all the remainder of that day was at our disposure, freely to eat and feed at any time thereof. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times there were but few that dined, as you would say, some Church men, Monks and Canons; for they have little other Occupation; each day is a Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val unto them; who diligently heed the Claustral Proverb, <hi>De missa ad mensam.</hi> They do not use to linger and defer their sitting down and placing of themselves at Table, only so long as they have a mind in waiting for the coming of the Abbot; so they fell to without Ceremony, Terms or Conditions; and every body supped, unless it were some vain, conceited, dreaming Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard. Hence was a Supper called <hi>Caena,</hi> which sheweth that it is <hi>common</hi> to all sorts of People. Thou knowest it well, Friar <hi>Iohn.</hi> Come let us go, my dear Friend in the name of all the Devils of the Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Regions, let us go: The Gnawings of my Stomach, in this rage of Hunger, are
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:46180:388"/>
so taring, that they make it bark like a Mastiff. Let us throw some Bread and Beef into his Throat to pacifie him, as once the <hi>Sibyl</hi> did to <hi>Cerberus.</hi> Thou likest best <hi>Monastical Browess,</hi> the prime, the flower of the Pot. I am for the solid, principal Verb that comes after: The good brown Loaf, always accompany'd with a round slice of the <hi>Nine-lecture-poudred Labourer.</hi> I know thy meaning, (answered Friar <hi>Iohn</hi>) this Metaphor is extracted out of the <hi>Claustral Kettle</hi>; the <hi>Labourer</hi> is the Ox, that hath wrought and done the Labour; after the fashion of <hi>Nine Lectures,</hi> that is to say, most exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitely well and throughly boil'd. These holy Religious Fathers, by a certain Cabalistick Institution of the Ancients, not written, but carefully by <hi>Tradition</hi> conveyed from hand to hand, rising betimes to go to Morning Prayers, were wont to flourish that their matutinal. Devotion with some certain notable Preambles before their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try into the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> They dunged in the Dungeries, pissed in the Pisseries, spit in the Spitteries, melodiously coughed in the Cougheries, and doted in their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, that to the Divine Service they might not bring any thing that was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean or foul.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="128" facs="tcp:46180:389"/>These things thus done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously made their repair to the <hi>Holy Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> (for so was, in their canting Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, termed the <hi>Covent Kitchin</hi>) where they with no small earnestness, had Care that the <hi>Beef Pot</hi> should be put on the Crook for the Breakfast of the Religious <hi>Brothers</hi> of our Lord and Saviour; and the Fire they would kindle under the Pot themselves. Now the <hi>Matines</hi> consisting of <hi>Nine Lessons,</hi> was so incumbent on them, that they must have risen the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the more expedite dispatching of them all. The sooner that they rose, the sharper was their Appetite, and the Barkings of their Stomachs, and the Gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings increase in the like proportion, and consequently made these Godly Men thrice more a hungred and a-thirst, than when their <hi>Matines</hi> were <hi>hem'd</hi> over only with three Lessons.</p>
                        <p>The more betimes they rose by the said Cabal, the sooner was the <hi>Beef Pot</hi> put on; the longer that the Beef was on the Fire, the better it was boiled; the more it boiled, it was the tenderer; the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer that it was, the less it troubled the Teeth, delighted more the Palats, less charged the Stomach, and nourished our good <hi>Religious</hi> Men the more substantial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; which is the only end and prime in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:46180:389"/>
of the first <hi>Founders,</hi> as appears by this, That <hi>they eat not to live,</hi> but <hi>live to eat,</hi> and in this World have nothing but their Life. Let us go, <hi>Panurge.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now have I understood thee, (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) my Plushcod Friar, my Cabal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line and Claustral Ballock. I freely quit the Costs, Interest and Charges, seeing you have so egregiously commented up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the most especial Chapter of the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linary</hi> and <hi>Monastick Cabal.</hi> Come along, my <hi>Garpalin,</hi> and you Friar <hi>Iohn,</hi> my Leather-dresser: Good morrow to you all, my good Lords: I have dreamed too much to have so little. Let us go. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi> had no sooner done speaking, than <hi>Epistemon</hi> with a loud Voice said these Words: It is a very ordinary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thing amongst Men to conceive, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see, know and presage the misfortune, bad luck or disaster of another; but to have the understanding, providence, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and prediction of a Man's own mishap is very scarce and rare to be found any where. This is exceeding judiciously and prudently deciphered by <hi>Esop</hi> in his Apologues, who there affirmeth, That every Man in the World carrieth about his Neck a Wallet, in the Fore-bag where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were contained the Faults and Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chances of others, always exposed to his
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:46180:390"/>

Take <hi>Epestimon</hi> in your Company, repair towards her, and hear what she will say unto you. She is

possibly (quoth <hi>Epistemon</hi>) she is some <hi>Canidia, Sagane</hi> or <hi>Pythonisse,</hi> either where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with us is vulgarly called a <hi>Witch.</hi> I being the more easily induced to give Credit to the truth of this Character of her, that the place of her Abode is vilely stained with the abominable repute of abounding more with <hi>Sorcerers</hi> and <hi>Witches</hi> than ever did the Plains of <hi>Thessaly.</hi> I should not, to my thinking, go thither willingly, for that it seems to me a thing unwarrantable, and altogether forbidden in the Law of <hi>Moyses.</hi> We are not <hi>Iews,</hi> (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) nor is it a matter judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously confess'd by her, nor authentical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved by others that she is a <hi>Witch.</hi> Let us for the present suspend our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and defer till after your return from thence, the sifting and garbeling of those Niceties. Do we know but that she may be an Eleventh <hi>Sibyl,</hi> or a Second <hi>Cassan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra?</hi> But although she were neither, and she did not merit the Name or Title of any of these Renowned Prophetesses, what Hazard, in the Name of God, do you run, by offering to talk and confer with her of the instant Perplexity and Perturbation of your Thoughts?

He was indeed Victorious in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> but withal so far distant from <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> his Hereditary Kingdom, that the Joy of the one did not expel the extream
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:46180:391"/>
Grief, which through occasion of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had inwardly conceived; for not being able with all his Power to find or invent a convenient Mean and Expedient, how to get or come by the certainty of any News from thence; both by reason of the huge remoteness of the places from one to another, as also because of the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditive Interposition of many great Rivers, the interjacent Obstacle of divers wild Deserts, and obstructive Interjection of sundry almost inaccessible Mountains. Whilst he was in this sad quandary and sollicitous pensiveness, which, you may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, could not be of a small Vexation to him; considering that it was a matter of no great difficulty to run over his whole Native Soil, possess his Country, seize on his Kingdom, install a new King in the Throne, and plant thereon Foreign Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, long before he could come to have any Advertisement of it. For obviating the Jeopardy of so dreadful Inconveniency, and putting a fit Remedy thereto, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Sydonian</hi> Merchant of a low Stature, but high Fancy, very poor in shew, and to the outward appearance of little or no Account, having presented himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, went about to affirm and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that he had excogitated and hit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ready mean and way, by the which
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:46180:392"/>
those of his Territories at home should come to the certain notice of his <hi>Indian</hi> Victories, and himself be perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the state and condition of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Macedonia</hi> within less then five days. Whereupon the said <hi>Alexander,</hi> plunged into a sullen Animadvertency of mind, through his rash Opinion of the Improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of performing a so strange and impossible-like Undertaking, dismissed the Merchant without giving ear to what he had to say, and villify'd him. What could it have cost him to hearken unto what the honest Man had invented and contrived for his good? What Detriment, Annoyance, Damage or Loss could he have undergone to listen to the Discovery of that Secret, which the good Fellow would have most willingly revealed unto him? Nature, I am perswaded, did not without a cause frame our Eyes open, putting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to no Gate at all, nor shutting them up with any manner of Inclosures, as she hath done unto the Tongue, the Eyes, and other such out-jetting parts of the Body: The Cause, as I imagine, is, to the end that every Day and every Night, and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in the knowledge of most things· And I give them the Title of <hi>Presage,</hi> for that they <hi>Divinely</hi> foresee, and certainly <hi>foretel</hi> future Contingencies, and Events of things to come. Sometimes I call them not <hi>Maunettes,</hi> but <hi>Monettes,</hi> from their wholsom Monitions. Whether it be so, ask <hi>Pythagoras, Socrates, Empedocles,</hi> and our Master <hi>Ortuinus.</hi> I furthermore praise and commend above the Skies the ancient memorable Institution of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine <hi>Germans,</hi> who ordained the Responces and Documents of <hi>Old Women</hi> to be highly extolled, most cordially reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and prised at a rate, in nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the weight, test and standerd of the Sanctuary: And as they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectfully prudent in receiving of these sound Advices, so by honouring and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them did they prove no less fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in the happy Success of all their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours.

                        <p>The old Trot for a while remained si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, pensive, and girning like a Dog, then, after she had set her withered Breech upon the bottom of a Bushel, she took into her Hands three old Spindles, which when she had turned and whirled betwixt her Fingers very diversly, and after several fashions, she pryed more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly into, by the tryal of their points; the sharpest whereof she retained in her hand, and threw the other two under a Stone Trough; after this she took a pair of Yarn Windles, which she nine times unintermittedly veered, and frisked about, then at the ninth revolution or turn, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out touching them any more, maturely perpending the manner of their motion, she very demurely waited on their repose and cessation from any further stirring. In sequel whereof, she pull'd off one of her wooden Pattens, put her Apron over her Head, as a Priest use to do his <hi>Amice,</hi> when he is going to sing <hi>Mass,</hi> and with a kind of antick, gaudy, party-colour'd String, knit it under her Neck. Being
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:46180:395"/>
thus covered and muffled, she whiffed off a lusty good Draught out of the Borachoe, took three several Pence forth of the Ram Cod Fob, put them into so many Walnut-shells, which she set down upon the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of a Feather-pot; and then after she had given them three Whisks of a Broom Besom a-thwart the Chimney, casting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Fire half a Bevin of long Heather, together with a Branch of dry Laurel, she observed with a very hush, and coy si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, in what form they did burn, and saw, that although they were in a flame, they made no kind of noise, or crackling din, hereupon she gave a most hideous and horribly dreadful shout, muttering betwixt her Teeth some few barbarous words, of a strange termination.</p>
                        <p>This so terrified <hi>Panurge,</hi> that he forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with said to <hi>Epistemon,</hi> The Devil mince me into a <hi>Gally-mafry,</hi> if I do not tremble for fear. I do not think but that I am now inchanted; for <hi>she uttereth not her Voice in the terms of any Christian Language.</hi> O look, I pray you, how she seemeth unto me, to be by three full spans higher than she was, when she began to hood her self with her Apron.</p>
                        <p>What meaneth this restless wagging of her slouchy Chaps? What can be the signification of the uneven shrugging of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:46180:396"/>
her hulchy Shoulders? to what end doth she quaver with her Lips, like a Monkey in the dismembring of a Lobster? My Ears through horrour glow; ah! how they tingle. I think I hear the skreaking of <hi>Proserpina</hi>; the Devils are breaking loose to be all here. O the foul, ugly, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Beasts! Let us run away! by the Hook of God, I am like to die for fear! I do not love the Devils; they vex me, and are unpleasant Fellows. Now let us fly, and betake us to our heels. Farewel <hi>Gammer</hi>; Thanks and Grammercy for your Goods. I will not marry, no, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, I will not; I fairly quit my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest therein, and totally abandon and renounce it, from this time forward, even as much as at present. With this, as he endeavoured to make an escape out of the room, the <hi>old Crone</hi> did anticipate his flight, and make him stop; the way how she prevented him was this: whilst in her hand she held the Spindle, she flung out to a Back-yard close by her Lodge, where after she had peeled off the Barks of an old Sycamore, three several times, she ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry summarily, upon eight Leaves which dropt from thence, wrote with the Spin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-point some curt, and briefly couched Verses, which she threw into the Air, then said unto them, Search after them if
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:46180:396"/>
you will; find them if you can; the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Destinies of your Marriage written in them.</p>
                        <p>No sooner had she done thus speaking, when she did withdraw herself unto her lurking Hole, where on the upper Seat of the Porch, she tucked up her Gown, her Coats and Smock, as high as her Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, and gave them a full inspection of the <hi>Nockandroe:</hi> which being perceived by <hi>Panurge,</hi> he said to <hi>Epistemon,</hi> Gods Bodekins, I see the <hi>Sybil's Hole.</hi> She sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly then bolted the Gate behind her, and was never since seen any more. They joyntly ran in hast after the fallen and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed Leaves, and gathered them at last, though not without great labour and toyl, for the Wind had scattered them amongst the Thorn-bushes of the Valley. When they had ranged them each after other in their due places, they found out their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, as it is metrified in this Ocstatick:

                        </head>
                        <p>THE Leaves being thus collected, and orderly disposed, <hi>Epistemon</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi> returned to <hi>Pantagruel</hi>'s Court, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well pleased, and other part discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: glad for their being come back, and vexed for the trouble they had sustained by the way, which they found to be craggy, rugged, stony, rough, and ill adjusted. They made an ample and full Relation of their Voyage, unto <hi>Pantagruel</hi>; as likewise of the Estate and Condition of the <hi>Sybil.</hi> Then having presented to him the Leaves of the <hi>Sycamore,</hi> they shew him the short and twattle Verses that were written in them. <hi>Pantagruel</hi> having read and considered the whole sum and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the matter, fetch'd from his Heart a deep and heavy Sigh, then said to <hi>Panurge</hi>: You are now, forsooth, in a good taking, and have brought your Hogs
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:46180:397"/>
to a fine Market: the Prophesie of the <hi>Sybil</hi> doth explain and lay out before us, the same very Predictions which have been denotated, foretold, and presaged to us by the Decree of the <hi>Virgilian Lots,</hi> and the Verdict of your own proper <hi>Dreams:</hi> to wit, that you shall be very much disgraced, shamed, and discredited by your Wife: for that she will make you a <hi>Cuckold</hi> in prostituting herself to others, being big with Child by another than you; will steal from you a great deal of your Goods, and will beat you, scratch, and bruise you, even from plucking the skin in apart from off you; will leave the Print of her Blows in some Member of your Body. You understand as much (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered <hi>Panurge</hi>) in the veritable Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, and Expounding of recent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies, as a Sow in the matter of Spice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Be not offended (Sir, I beseech you) that I speak thus boldly; for I find myself a little in Choler, and that not without cause, seeing it is the contrary that is true; take heed, and give attentive Ear unto my words: The old Wife said, that as the Bean is not seen till first it be unhuskt, and that its swad or hull be shaled, and <hi>pilled</hi> from off it: so is it that my vertue and transcendent worth will never come by the <hi>Mouth of Fame,</hi> to be blazed abroad
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:46180:398"/>
proportionable to the height, extent, and measure of the excellency thereof, until <hi>preallably</hi> I get a Wife, and make the full half of a married Couple. How many times have I heard you say, that the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a Magistrate, or Office of Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, discovereth the Merits, Parts, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments of the Person so advanced and promoted, and what is in him: that is to say, we are then best able to judge aright of the Deservings of a Man, when he is called to the management of Affairs: for when before he lived in a private Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we could have no more certain knowledge of him, then of a <hi>Bean</hi> within his <hi>Husk.</hi> And thus stands the first Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle explained: otherways could you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that the good Fame, Repute, and Estimation of an Honest Man, should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Tayl of a Whore?</p>
                        <p>Now to the meaning of the Second Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle: My Wife will be <hi>with Child,</hi> (here lies the prime Felicity of Marriage) but not of me. Copsody, that I do believe indeed: It will be of a pretty little Infant: O how heartily I shall love it! I do alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy dote upon it; for it will be my dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Fedle-darling, my gentiel Dilli-minion. From thenceforth no Vexation, Care, or Grief, shall take such deep impression in my Heart, how hugely great or vehement
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:46180:398"/>
soever it otherways appear; but that it shall evanish forthwith, at the sight of that my future Babe; and at the hearing of the Chat and Prating of its Childish Gibbridge: And blessed be the Old Wife. By my truly, I have a mind to settle some good Revenue or Pension upon her, out of the readiest Increase of the Lands of my <hi>Salmigondinois</hi>; not an inconstant, and uncertain Rent-seek, like that of witless, giddy-headed <hi>Batchellors,</hi> but sure and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of the nature of the well-payed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of <hi>Regenting Doctors.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If this Interpretation doth not please you, think you my Wife will <hi>bear</hi> me in her Flanks: Conceive with me, and be of me delivered, as Women use in Childbed to bring forth their Young Ones: so as that it may be said, <hi>Panurge</hi> is a second <hi>Bacchus,</hi> he hath been twice born; he is re-born, as was <hi>Hypolitus,</hi> as was <hi>Proteus,</hi> one time of <hi>Thetis</hi>; and secondly, of the Mother of the Philosopher <hi>Apollonius</hi>: as were the two <hi>Palices,</hi> near the Flood <hi>Same<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoe,</hi> in <hi>Sicily:</hi> his Wife was big of Child with him.

                           <pb n="148" facs="tcp:46180:399"/>The words of the third Article are: <hi>She will suck me at my best End.</hi> Why not? that pleaseth me right well. You know the thing, I need not tell you, that it is my intercrural Pudding with one end. I swear and promise, that in what I can, I will preserve it sappy, full of juyce, and as well victualled for her use as may be; she shall not <hi>suck</hi> me, I believe, in vain, nor be destitute of her allowance; there shall her <hi>justum</hi> both in Peck and Lippy be furnish'd to the full eternally. You ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this passage allegorically, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret it to Theft and Larceny. I love the Exposition, and the Allegory pleaseth me; but not according to the Sence whereto you stretch it. It may be that the sincerity of the Affection which you bear me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> moveth you to harbour in your Breast those refractory thoughts concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, with a suspition of my Adversity to come. We have this saying from the Learned, <hi>That a marvelously fearful thing is Love,</hi> and that <hi>true Love is never without fear.</hi> But (Sir) according to my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you do understand both of and by your self, that here <hi>Stealth</hi> signifieth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, no more then in a thousand other places of Greek and Latin, Old and Modern Writings, but the sweet fruits of amorous Dalliance, which <hi>Venus</hi> liketh
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:46180:399"/>
best, when reap'd in secret, and cull'd by fervent Lovers filchingly.</p>
                        <p>Why so? I prithee tell: Because when the Feat of the loose Coat Skirmish hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth to be done under-hand and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, between two well-disposed, athwart the Steps of a Pair of Stairs, lurkingly, and in covert, behind a Suit of Hangings, or close hid and trussed upon an unbound Faggot, it is more pleasing to the <hi>Cyprian</hi> Goddess, (and to me also, I speak this without prejudice to any better, or more sound Opinion) then to perform that Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busting Art, after the <hi>Cynick</hi> manner, in the view of the clear Sun-shine, or in a rich Tent, under a precious stately Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, within a glorious and sublime Pavili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or yet on a soft Couch betwixt rich Curtains of Cloth of Gold, without af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightment, at long intermediate Respits, enjoying of Pleasures and Delights a Belly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, all at great ease, with a huge fly-flap Fan of Crimson Sattin, and a Bunch of Feathers of some <hi>East-Indian</hi> Ostrich, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to give Chace unto the Flyes all round about: whilst; in the Interim, the Female picks her Teeth with a stiff Straw, pick'd even then from out of the bottom of the Bed she lies on.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="150" facs="tcp:46180:400"/>If you be not content with this my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, are you of the mind that my Wife will <hi>suck</hi> and sup me up as People use to gulp and swallow Oysters out of the Shell? Or as the <hi>Cilician</hi> Women, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Testimony of <hi>Dioscorides,</hi> were wont to do the Grain of <hi>Alkermes?</hi> Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly that is an Error. Who seizeth on it, doth neither gulch up, nor swill down; but takes away what hath been packed up, catcheth, snatcheth, and plies the Play of <hi>Hey pass, Repass.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Fourth Article doth imply, That my Wife will <hi>flay</hi> me, but <hi>not at all.</hi> O the fine Word! You interpret this to beating Strokes and Blows. Speak wisely: Will you eat a Pudding? Sir, I beseech you to raise up your Spirits above the low-sized pitch of earthly Thoughts unto that hight of sublime Contemplation, which reacheth to the Apprehension of the Mysteries and Wonders of Dame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And here be pleased to condemn your self, by a renouncing of those Errors which you have committed very grosly, and somewhat perversly, in expounding the Prophetick Sayings of the Holy <hi>Sybil.</hi> Yet put the case (albeit I yield not to it) that by the Instigation of the Devil, my Wife should go about to wrong me, make me a Cuckold downwards to the very
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:46180:400"/>
Breech, disgrace me otherways, steal my Goods from me; yea, and lay vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently her Hands upon me; she neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less should fail of her Attempts, and not attain to the proposed end of her unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Undertakings.</p>
                        <p>The Reason which induceth me hereto, is grounded totally on this last Point, which is extracted from the profoundest Privacies of a Monastick Pantheology, as good Friar <hi>Arther Wagtaile</hi> told me once upon a <hi>Monday</hi> morning; as we were (if I have not forgot) eating a Bushel of Trot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-pies; and I remember well it rained hard: God give him the good Morrow.</p>
                        <p>The Women at the beginning of the World, or a little after, conspired to <hi>flay</hi> the Men quick, because they found the Spirit of Mankind inclined to domineer it, and bear rule over them upon the face of the whole Earth; and in pursuit of this their Resolution, promised, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, sworn and covenanted amongst them all, by the pure Faith they owe to the nocturnal Sanct <hi>Rogero.</hi> But O the vain Enterprises of Women! O the great Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gility of that Sex Feminine! They did begin to <hi>flay</hi> the Man, or <hi>pill</hi> him, (as says <hi>Catullus</hi>) at that Member which of all the Body they loved best; to wit, the nervous and cavernous Cane; and that above five
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:46180:401"/>
thousand years ago; yet have they not of that small part alone flayed any more till this hour but the Head: In meer despite whereof the <hi>Iews</hi> snip off that parcel of the Skin in Circumcision, choosing far rather to be called Clip-yards, Raskals, than to be <hi>flayed</hi> by Women, as are other Nations. My Wife, according to this Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Covenant, will <hi>flay</hi> it to me, if it be not so already. I heartily grant my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent thereto, but will not give her leave to <hi>flay</hi> it all: Nay, truly will I not, my no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble King. Yea, but (quoth <hi>Epistemon</hi>) you say nothing of her most dreadful Cries and Exclamations, when she and we both saw the Lawrel-bough burn without yielding any noise or crackling. You know it is a very dismal Omen, an inauspicious sign, unlucky judice, and token formidable, bad, disastrous, and most unhappy, as is certified by <hi>Propertius, Tibullus,</hi> the quick Philosopher <hi>Porphyrius, Eustachius</hi> on the <hi>Iliads</hi> of <hi>Homer,</hi> and by many others.</p>
                        <p>Verily, verily, (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) brave are the Allegations which you bring me, and Testimonies of two-footed Calves.

                           <hi>PAntagruel,</hi> when this Discourse was ended, held for a pretty while his Peace, seeming to be exceeding sad and pensive, then said to <hi>Panurge,</hi> the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Spirit misleads, beguileth and sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth you. I have read that in times past the surest and most veritable Oracles were not those which either were delivered in Writing, or utter'd by word of Mouth in speaking: For many times, in their Interpretation, right witty, learned and ingenious Men have been deceived thro' Amphibolories, Equivoks, and Obscurity of Words, no less than by the brevity of their Sentences. For which cause <hi>Apollo,</hi> the God of Vaticination, was Surnamed <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. Those which were represented then by Signs and outward Gestures were accounted the truest and the most infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible. Such was the Opinion of <hi>Heracli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus:</hi> And <hi>Iupitur</hi> did himself in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:46180:402"/>
give forth in <hi>Amon</hi> frequently Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: Nor was he single in this Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; for <hi>Apollo</hi> did the like amongst the <hi>Assyrians.</hi> His prophesying thus unto those People, moved them to paint him with a large long Beard, and Cloaths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming an old setled Person, of a most posed, stayed and grave Behaviour; not naked, young and beardless, as he was pourtrayed most usually amongst the <hi>Graecians.</hi> Let us make trial of this kind of Fatidicency; and go you take Advice of some dumb Person without any speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I am content, (quoth <hi>Panurge.</hi>) But, says <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> it were requisite that the Dumb you consult with be such as have been deaf from the hour of their Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and consequently dumb; for none can be so lively, natural, and kindly dumb, as he who never heard.</p>
                        <p>How is it, (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) that you conceive this matter? If you apprehend it so, that never any spoke, who had not before heard the Speech of others, I will from that Antecedent bring you to infer very logically a most absurd and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxical Conclusion. But let it pass; I will not insist on it. You do not then believe what <hi>Herodotus</hi> wrote of two Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who at the special Command and Appointment of <hi>Psammeticus</hi> King of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi>
                           <pb n="155" facs="tcp:46180:402"/>
having been kept in a petty Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Cottage, where they were nourished and entertained in a perpetual silence, did at last, after a certain long space of time, pronounce this word <hi>Bee,</hi> which in the <hi>Phrygian</hi> Language signifieth <hi>Bread.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing less (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) do I believe, than that it is a meer abusing of our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings to give Credit to the words of those, who say that there is any such thing as a Natural Language. All Speeches have had their primary Origin from the Arbitrary Institutions, Accords and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Nations in their respective Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descendments to what should be noted and betokened by them. An Articulate Voice (according to the Dialecticians) hath naturally no signification at all; for that the sence and meaning thereof did totally depend upon the good will and pleasure of the first Deviser and Imposer of it. I do not tell you this without a Cause; for <hi>Bartholus, Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de Verb. Oblig.</hi> very seriously reporteth, that even in his time there was in <hi>Cugubia</hi> one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Sir Nello de Gabrielis,</hi> who although he by a sad mischance became altogether deaf, understood nevertheless every one that talked in the <hi>Italian</hi> Dialect howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he expressed himself; and that only by looking on his external Gestures, and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:46180:403"/>
casting an attentive Eye upon the divers motions of his Lips and Chaps. I have read, I remember also, in a very literate and eloquent Author, that <hi>Turidates</hi> King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> in the days of <hi>Nero,</hi> made a Voyage to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was received with great Honour and Solemnity, and with all manner of Pomp and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence: Yea, to the end there might be a sempiternal Amity and Correspondence preserved betwixt him and the <hi>Roman</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; there was no remarkable thing in the whole City which was not shown un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
                        <p>At his Departure the Emperor bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him many ample Donatives of an inestimable Value: And besides, the more entirely to testifie his Affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, heartily intrusted him to be pleased to make choice of any whatsoever thing in <hi>Rome</hi> was most agreeable to his Fancy; with a Promise juramentally confirmed, That he should not be refused of his Demand. Thereupon, after a suitable Return of Thanks for a so graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Offer, he required a certain <hi>Iack-pudding,</hi> whom he had seen to act his part most egregiously upon the Stage, and whose meaning (albeit he knew not what it was he had spoken) he understood per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly enough by the Signs and Gesticula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:46180:403"/>
which he had made. And for this Suit of his, in that he asked nothing else, he gave this Reason, That in the several wide and spacious Dominions, which were reduced under the Sway and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of his Sovereign Government, there were sundry Countries and Nations much differing from one another in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, with whom, whether he was to speak unto them, or give any Answer to their Requests, he was always necessitated to make use of divers sorts of <hi>Truchmen</hi> and Interpreters: Now with this Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, sufficient for supplying all their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, will that great Inconveniency here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be totally removed; seeing he is such a fine Gesticulator, and in the Practice of <hi>Chirology</hi> an Artist so compleat, expert and dextrous, that with his very Fingers he doth speak. Howsoever you are to pitch upon such a dumb Bone as is deaf by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and from his Birth; to the end that his Gestures and Signs may be the more vively and truly Prophetick, and not counterfeit by the intermixture of some adulterate Lustre and Affectation. Yet whether this dumb Person shall be of the Male or Female Sex is in your Option, lieth at your Discretion, and altogether dependeth on your own Election.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="158" facs="tcp:46180:404"/>I would more willingly (quoth <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi>) consult with and be advised by a Dumb Woman, were it not that I am affraid of two things. The first is, That the greater part of Women, whatever it be that they see, do always represent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Fancies, think and imagine, that it hath some relation to the sugred entring of the goodly <hi>Ithypallos,</hi> and graffing in the Cleft of the overturned Tree, the quick-set Imp of the Pin of Copulation. Whatever Signs, Shews or Gestures we shall make, or whatever our Behaviour, Carriage or Demeanour shall happen to be in their view and Presence, they will interpret the whole in reference to the act of <hi>Androgynation,</hi> and the culbatizing Exercise, by which means we shall be abusively disappointed of our Designs, in regard that she will take all our Signs for nothing else but Tokens and Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations of our Desire to entice her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lists of a <hi>Cyprian</hi> Combat, or Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senconny Skirmish.</p>
                        <p>Do you remember what hapned at <hi>Rome</hi> two hundred and threescore Years after the Foundation thereof? A young <hi>Roman</hi> Gentleman encountring by chance at the Foot of Mount <hi>Celion</hi> with a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Latin</hi>-Lady named <hi>Verona,</hi> who from her very Cradle upwards had always been
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:46180:404"/>
both deaf and dumb, very civilly asked her, (not without a Chironomatick Italia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nising of his Demand, with various Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctigation of his Fingers, and other Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticulations, as yet customary amongst the Speakers of that Country) what Senators in her Descent from the top of the Hill she had met with going up thither. For you are to conceive, that he knowing no more of her Deafness than Dumbness, was ignorant of both. She in the mean time, who neither heard nor understood so much as one word of what he had said, streight imagin'd, by all that she could apprehend in the lovely Gesture of his manual Signs, that what he then required of her was, what her self had a great mind to, even that which a Young Man doth naturally desire of a Woman. Then was it, that by Signs (which in all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences of Venerial Love are incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably more attractive, valid and efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than Words) she beckned to him to come along with her to her House; which when he had done, she drew him aside to a privy Room, and then made a most lively alluring Sign unto him, to shew that the Game did please her. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without any more Advertisement, or so much as the uttering of one Word on either side, they fell to, and bringuardised it lustily.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="160" facs="tcp:46180:405"/>The other Cause of my being averse from consulting with dumb Women, is, that to our Signs they would make no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer at all, but suddenly fall backwards in a divarication posture, to intimate thereby unto us the reality of their consent to the supposed motion of our tacit Demands. Or if they should chance to make any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre-signs responsory to our Propositions, they would prove so foolish, impertinent, and ridiculous, that by them our selves should easily judge their thoughts to have no excursion beyond the duffling Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy. You know very well how at <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiniole,</hi> when the religious Nun, sister <hi>Fatbum,</hi> was made big with Child by the young <hi>Stifly-Stantor,</hi> her Pregnancy came to be known, and she cited by the <hi>Abbess,</hi> and in a full Convention of the Convent, accused of Incest. Her excuse was, That she did not consent thereto, but that it was done by the violence and impetuous force of the Friar <hi>Stifly-stand-to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>t. Hereto</hi> the Abbess very austerely replying, Thou naughty wicked Girl, why didst thou not cry, a Rape, a Rape, then should all of us have run to thy Succour. Her answer was, That the Rape was committed in the <hi>Dorter,</hi> where she durst not cry, because it was a place of sempiternal Silence. But (quoth the Abbess) thou roguish Wench,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:46180:405"/>
why didst not thou then make some sign to those that were in the next Chamber beside thee? To this she answered, That with her Buttocks she made a sign unto them, as vigorously as she could, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver one of them did so much as offer to come to her help and assistance. But (quoth the Abbess) thou scurvy baggage, why didst not thou tell it me immediately after the perpetration of the Fact, that so we might orderly, regularly, and canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally have accused him? I would have done so, had the case been mine, for the clearer manifestation of mine Innocency. I truly, Madam, would have done the like with all my heart and soul, (quoth Sister <hi>Fatbum</hi>) but that fearing I should remain in Sin, and in the hazard of Eternal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, if prevented by a sudden Death, I did confess my self to the Father Fryar before he went out of the Room, who for my Penance, enjoyned me not to tell it, or reveal the matter unto any. It were a most enormous and horrid Offence, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable before God and the Angels, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal a Confession: such an abominable Wickedness would have possibly brought down Fire from Heaven, wherewith to have burnt the whole Nunnery, and sent us all headlong to the bottomless Pit, to bear company with <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biram.</hi>
                           <pb n="162" facs="tcp:46180:406"/>
You will not (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) with all your Jesting make me laugh; I know that all Monks, Fryars, and Nuns had rather violate and infringe the highest of the Commandments of God, then break the least of their Provincial Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.</p>
                        <p>Take you therefore <hi>Goatsnose,</hi> a Man very fit for your present purpose; for he is, and hath been, both dumb and deaf from the very remotest Infancy of his Childhood.</p>

                           <hi>Goatsnose</hi> being sent for, came the day thereafter to <hi>Pantagruel</hi>'s Court; at his arrival to which <hi>Panurge</hi> gave him a fat Calf, the half of a Hog, two Punchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Wine, one Load of Corn, and thirty Franks of small Money: then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving brought him before <hi>Pantatgruel,</hi> in presence of the Gentlemen of the Bed-chamber, he made this sign unto him.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:46180:406"/>
He yawned along time, and in yawning made without his mouth with the thumb of his right hand the figure of the Greek Letter <hi>Tau</hi> by frequent reiterations. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he lifted up his eyes to Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, then turned them in his Head like a Shee-goat in the painful fit of an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Birth, in doing whereof he did cough and sigh exceeding heavily: This done, after that he had made demonstration of the want of his Codpiece, he from under his shirt took his Placket-racket in a full gripe, making it therewithal clack very melodiously betwixt his Thighs: then no sooner had he with his Body stooped a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle forwards, and bowed his left Knee, but that immediately thereupon holding both his Arms on his Breast, in a loose faint-like Posture, the one over the other, he paused awhile. <hi>Goatsnose</hi> looked wistly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and having heedfully enough view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him all over, he lifted up into the Air his left Hand, the whole fingers whereof he retained fist-ways closed together, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Thumb and the Fore-finger, whose Nails he softly joyned and coupled to one another. I understand (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) what he meaneth by that sign: it denotes <hi>marriage,</hi> and withal the number <hi>thirty,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Profession of <hi>Pythagorians,</hi> you will be <hi>married.</hi> Thanks to you (quoth
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:46180:407"/>
                           <hi>Panurge</hi>) in turning himself towards <hi>Goats<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nose,</hi> my little Sewer, pretty Masters-mate, dainty Baily, curious Sergeant-Marshal, and jolly Catchpole-leader. Then did he lift higher up than before his said left Hand, stretching out all the five Fingers thereof, and severing them as wide from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as he possibly could get done. Here (says <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) doth he more amply and fully insinuate unto us, by the Token which he sheweth forth of the <hi>Quinary number,</hi> that you shall be <hi>married.</hi> Yea, that you shall not only be affianced, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trothed, wedded, and <hi>married,</hi> but that you shall furthermore cohabit, and live jollily and merrily with your Wife; for <hi>Pythagoras</hi> called <hi>five</hi> the <hi>Nuptial Number,</hi> which together with <hi>marriage,</hi> signifieth the <hi>Consummation</hi> of Matrimony, because it is composed of a <hi>ternary</hi> the first of the odd, and <hi>binary,</hi> the first of the even Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as of a Male and Female knit and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited together. In very deed it was the fashion of old in the City of <hi>Rome</hi> at Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Festivals to light <hi>five</hi> wax Tapers, nor was it permitted to kindle any more at the magnifick Nuptials of the most Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and Wealthy; nor yet any fewer at the penurious Weddings of the Poorest and most Abject of the World. Moreover in times past, the Heathen, or <hi>Paynius</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:46180:407"/>
the Assistance of <hi>five</hi> Deities, or of one helpful (at least) in <hi>five</hi> several good Offices to those that were to be married: of this sort were the Nuptial <hi>Iove, Iuno,</hi> President of the Feast, the fair <hi>Venus, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho</hi> the Goddess of Eloquence and Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and <hi>Diana,</hi> whose aid and succour was required to the labour of Child-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Then shouted <hi>Panurge,</hi> O the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile <hi>Goatsnose,</hi> I will give him a Farm near <hi>Gnais,</hi> and a Wind-mill hard by <hi>Mireba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais.</hi> Hereupon the dumb Fellow sneezeth with an impetuous vehemency, and huge concussion of the Spirits of the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, withdrawing himself in so doing with a jerting turn towards the left hand. By the Body of a Fox new slain (quoth <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel</hi>) what is that? this maketh nothing for your advantage; for he betokeneth thereby that your <hi>marriage</hi> will be inauspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and unfortunate. This snezing (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Doctrine of <hi>Terpsion,</hi> is the <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Demon) if done towards the right side, it imports and portendeth, that boldly, and with all assurance, one may go whither he will, and do what he listeth, according to what deliberation he shall be pleased to have thereupon taken: his entries in the beginning, progress in his proceedings, and success in the events and issues will be all lucky, good, and happy. The quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:46180:408"/>
thereto is thereby implied and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saged, if it be done towards the left. You (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) do take always the matter at the worst, and continually, like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Davus,</hi> casteth in new disturbances and obstructions; nor ever yet did I know this old paultry <hi>Terpsion</hi> worthy of citation, but in points only of Cosenage and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture. Nevertheless (quoth <hi>Pantagruel) Cicero</hi> hath written I know not what to the same purpose in his <hi>Second Book of Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Panurge</hi> then turning himself towards <hi>Goatsnose</hi> made this sign unto him. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted his Eye-lids upwards, wrinched his Jaws from the right to the left side, and drew forth his Tongue half out of his Mouth; this done, he posited his left Hand wholly open (the mid-finger wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, which was perpendicularly placed upon the Palm thereof) and set it just in the room where his Codpiece had been. Then did he keep his right Hand altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shut up in a fist, save only the Thumb, which he streight turned backwards di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly under the right Arm-pit, and settled it afterwards on that most eminent part of the Buttocks which the <hi>Arabs</hi> call the <hi>Alkatim.</hi> Suddenly thereafter he made this interchange, he held his right Hand after the manner of the left, and posited
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:46180:408"/>
it on the place wherein his Codpiece some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time was, and retaining his left Hand in the form and fashion of the right, he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it upon his <hi>Alkatim:</hi> this altering of Hands did he reiterate nine several times; at the last whereof, he reseated his Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids into their own first natural position. Then doing the like also with his Jaws and Tongue, he did cast a squinting look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Goatsnose,</hi> diddering and shivering his Chaps, as Apes use to do now-a-days, and Rabbets, whilst almost starved with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they are eating Oats in the Sheaf.</p>
                        <p>Then was it that <hi>Goatsnose</hi> lifting up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Air his right Hand wholly open and displayed, put the Thumb thereof, even close unto its first articulation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two third Joints of the middle and ring fingers, pressing about the said Thumb thereof very hard with them both, and whilst the remainent Joints were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted and shrunk in towards the Wrist, he stretched forth with as much straitness as he could, the fore and little fingers. That hand thus framed and disposed of, he laid and posited upon <hi>Panurge</hi>'s Navel, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving withal continually the aforesaid Thumb, and bearing up, supporting, or under-propping that Hand upon the above specified, and fore and little fingers, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on two Leggs. Thereafter did he make
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:46180:409"/>
in this posture his Hand by little and little, and by degrees and pauses, successively to mount from athwart the Belly to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, from whence he made it to ascend to the Breast, even upwards to <hi>Panurges</hi>'s Neck, still gaining ground, till having reached his Chin he had put within the concave of his Mouth his afore-mentioned Thumb: then fiercely brandishing the whole Hand, which he made to rub and grate against his Nose, he heaved it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up, and made the fashion, as if with the Thumb thereof he would have put out his Eyes. With this <hi>Panurge</hi> grew a little angry, and went about to withdraw, and rid himself from this ruggedly untoward dumb Devil. But <hi>Goatsnose</hi> in the mean time prosecuting the intended purpose of his <hi>Prognosticatory Response,</hi> touched very rudely with the above-mentioned shaking Thumb, now his Eyes, then his Forehead, and after that, the borders and corners of his Cap. At last <hi>Panurge</hi> cried out, saying, Before God, Master-Fool, if you do not let me alone, or that you will presume to vex me any more, you shall receive from the best hand I have a Mask, wherewith to cover your rascally scoundred Face, you paultry shitten Varlet. Then said Fryar <hi>Ihon,</hi> he is deaf, and doth not understand what thou sayest unto him. <hi>Bulliballock,</hi>
                           <pb n="169" facs="tcp:46180:409"/>
make sign to him of a hail of Fisticuffs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Muzzle.</p>
                        <p>What the Devil (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) means this busie restless Fellow? what is it that this Polypragmonetick Ardelione to all the Fiends of Hell doth aim at? he hath almost thrust out mine Eyes, as if he had been to potch them in a Skillet with Butter and Eggs, by God, <hi>da Iurandi,</hi> I will feast you with flirts and raps on the Snout, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlarded with a double row of bobs and finger filipings? Then did he leave him in giving him by way of <hi>Salve</hi> a Volley of Farts for his Farewel. <hi>Goatsnose</hi> perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Panurge</hi> thus to slip away from him, got before him, and by meer strength en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing him to stand, made this sign unto him. He let fall his right Arm toward his Knee on the same side as low as he could, and raising all the fingers of that Hand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a close fist, past his dexterer Thumb be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the foremost and mid-fingers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to belonging. Then scrubbing and swindg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little with his left Hand alongst, and upon the uppermost in the very bought of the Elbow of the said dexter Arm, the whole Cubit thereof by leisure fair, and softly, at these thumpatory warnings, did raise and elevate it self even to the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, and above it, on a suddain did he then let it fall down as low as before: and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:46180:410"/>
after that, at certain intervals and such spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of time, raising and abasing it, he made a shew thereof to <hi>Panurge.</hi> This so incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Panurge,</hi> that he forthwith lifted his Hand to have strucken him the dumb Royster, and given him a sound whirret on the Ear, but that the respect and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which he carried to the Presence of <hi>Pantagruel</hi> restrained his Choler, and kept his Fury within bounds and limits. Then said <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> If the bare signs now vex and trouble you, how much more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously will you be perplexed and disquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the real things, which by them are represented and signified. All Truths agree, and are consonant with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; this dumb Fellow Prophesieth and Foretelleth that you will be <hi>married, cuckold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, beaten</hi> and <hi>robbed.</hi> As for the marriage (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) I yield thereto, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the verity of that point of his Prediction; as for the rest I utterly abjure and deny it: and believe Sir, I beseech you, if it may please you so to do, that <hi>in the matter of Wives and Horses, never any Man was predestinated to a better Fortune than I.</hi>

                        </head>
                        <p>I Never thought (said <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) to have encountred with any Man so head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strong in his Apprehensions, or in his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions so wilful, as I have found you to be, and see you are. Nevertheless, the better to clear and extricate your Doubts, let us try all courses, and leave no stone unturned, nor wind unsailed by. Take good heed to what I am to say unto you, the <hi>Swans,</hi> which are Fouls consecrated to <hi>Apollo,</hi> never chant but in the hour of their approaching Death, especially in the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> Flood, which is a River that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth along some of the Territories of <hi>Phrygia.</hi> This I say, because <hi>Elianus</hi> and <hi>Alexander Wyndius</hi> write, that they had seen several Swans in other places die, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard any of them sing, or chant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their death. However, it passeth for current that the imminent death of a Swan is presaged by his foregoing Song, and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:46180:411"/>
that no <hi>Swan</hi> dieth until preallably he have Sung.</p>
                        <p>After the same manner <hi>Poets,</hi> who are under the protection of <hi>Apollo,</hi> when they are drawing near their latter end, do or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily become Prophets, and by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration of that God sing sweetly, in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticinating things which are to come. It hath been likeways told me frequently, That old decrepit Men upon the Brinks of <hi>Charon</hi>'s Banks, do usher their Decease with a disclosure, all at ease (to those that are desirous of such Informations) of the determinate and assured truth of future Accidents and Contingencies. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber also that <hi>Aristophanes,</hi> in a certain Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of his, calleth folks <hi>Sybils,</hi>

Just so the Angels, Heroes, and

good Demons (according to the Doctrine of <hi>Platonicks</hi>) when they see Mortals draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near unto the Harbour of the Grave, as the most sure and calmest Port of any, full of Repose, Ease, Rest, Tranquility; free from the Troubles and Sollicitudes of this tumultuous and tempestuous World; then is it that they with alacrity Hale and Salute them, Cherish and Comfort them, and speaking to them lovingly, begin even then to bless them with Illuminations, and to communicate unto them the abstrusest Mysteries of Divination. I will not offer here to confound your Memory by quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting antick Examples of <hi>Isaac,</hi> of <hi>Iacob,</hi> of <hi>Patroclus</hi> towards <hi>Hector,</hi> of <hi>Hector</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Achilles,</hi> of <hi>Polymnester</hi> towards <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamemnon,</hi> of <hi>Hecuba,</hi> of the <hi>Phodian</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned by <hi>Possidonius,</hi> of <hi>Calanus</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian towards <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, of <hi>Oro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> towards <hi>Mezentius,</hi> and of many others; it shall suffice for the present, that I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate unto you the learned and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Knight and Cavalier <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Ballay,</hi> late Lord of <hi>Langcy,</hi> who died on the Hill of <hi>Tarara,</hi> the Tenth of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> in the <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macterick</hi> year of his Age, and of our Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation 1543. according to the <hi>Roman</hi> Account. The last three or four hours of his Life he did imploy in the serious ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance of a very pithy Discourse, whilst
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:46180:412"/>
with a clear Judgment, and Spirit void of all Trouble, he did foretell several impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Things, whereof a great deal is come to pass, and the rest we wait for. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, his <hi>Prophesies</hi> did at that time seem unto us somewhat strange, absurd, and unlikely; because there did not then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear any sign of efficacy enough to engage our Faith to the belief of what he did prognosticate.</p>
                        <p>We have hear near to the Town of <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomer,</hi> a Man that is both <hi>Old</hi> and a <hi>Poet,</hi> to wit, <hi>Raminogrobis,</hi> who to his Second Wife espoused my Lady <hi>Broadsow,</hi> on whom he begot the fair <hi>Basoche</hi>; it hath been told me, he is a dying, and so near unto his latter end, that he is almost up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the very last moment, point, and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle thereof; repair thither as fast as you can, and be ready to give an attentive Ear to what he shall <hi>chant</hi> unto you: it may be, that you shall obtain from him what you desire, and that <hi>Apollo</hi> will be pleased, by his means, to clear your scruples. I am content (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) let us go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Epistemon,</hi> and that both instantly and in all hast, least otherways his Death prevent our coming. Wilt thou come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with us, Fryar <hi>Ihon?</hi> Yes, that I will, (quoth Fryar <hi>Ihon</hi>) right heartily to do thee a Courtesie, my Billy-ballocks; for
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:46180:412"/>
I love thee with the best of my Milt and Liver. Thereupon, incontinently, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further lingring to the way, they all three went, and quickly thereafter (for they made good speed) arriving at the Poetical Habitation, they found the jolly Old Man, albeit in the Agony of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from this World, looking chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, with an open Countenance, splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Aspect, and Behaviour full of alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. After that <hi>Panurge</hi> had very civilly saluted him, he in a free Gift did present him with a Gold Ring, which he even then put upon the Medical Finger of his Left Hand, in the Collet or Bezle where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was inchased an Oriental Saphire, very fair and large. Then, in imitation of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> did he make an Oblation unto him of a fair <hi>White Cock</hi>; which was no sooner set upon the Tester of his Bed, then that with a high raised Head and Crest, lustily shaking his Feather-Coat, he crowed <hi>Sten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriphonically</hi> loud. This done, <hi>Panurge</hi> very courteously required of him, that he would vouchsafe to favour him with the Grant and Report of his Sence and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, touching the future Destiny of his intended <hi>Marriage.</hi> For answer hereto, when the honest Old Man had forthwith commanded Pen, Paper, and Ink to be brought unto him, and that he was at the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:46180:413"/>

These Lines he gave out of his own Hands unto them, saying unto them, <hi>Go my Lads in Peace, the great God of the highest Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens be your Guardian and Preserver; and do not offer any more to trouble or disquiet me with this or any other Business whatsoever. I have this same very day (which is the last both of</hi> May <hi>and of me) with a great deal of labour, toyl, and difficulty, chased out of my House a rabble of filthy, unclean, and plagui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pestilentious Rake-hells, black Beasts, dusk,

But what harm in the Devil's Name, have these poor De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils the <hi>Capucins</hi> and <hi>Minims</hi> done unto him? Are not these beggarly Devils suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently wretched already? Who can imagine that these poor Snakes, the very Extracts of <hi>Ichthyophagy,</hi> are not throughly

enough besmoaked and besmeared with Misery, Distress, and Calamity? Dost thou think, Fryar <hi>Ihon,</hi> by thy Faith, that he is in the State of Salvation?

I will lay an even Wager, that he is a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creant Apostate. By the Belly of a stalled Oxe, how careful he is not to be mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in his words.</p>
                        <p>He answered but by <hi>Disjunctives,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can it not be true which he saith; for the verity of such like Propositions is inherent only in one of its two Members.

                        <p>I understand you not (quoth <hi>Episte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>) and it disliketh me very much, that you should so absurdly and perversly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret that of the Fryar <hi>Mendicants,</hi> which by the harmless <hi>Poet</hi> was spoken of black Beasts, dun, and other sorts of other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured Animals. He is not in my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on guilty of such a sophistical and fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick Allegory, as by that Phrase of his to have meaned the <hi>Begging Brothers</hi>; he in down right Terms speaketh abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and properly of Fleas, Punies, Hand-worms, Flies, Gnats, and other such-like scurvy Vermine, whereof some are black, some dun, some ash-coloured, some taw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,

and some brown and dusky, all noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, molesting, tyrannous, cumbersome, and unpleasing Creatures, not only to sick and diseased Folks, but to those also who are of a sound, vigorous, and healthful Temperament and Constitution. It is not unlike, that he may have the <hi>Asca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rids,</hi> and the <hi>Lumbricks,</hi> and Worms with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Intrails of his Body. Possibly doth he suffer (as is frequent and usual amongst the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> together with all those who inhabit the <hi>Erythraean</hi> Confines, and dwell along the Shores and Coasts of the Red Sea) some four prickings, and smart stingings in his Arms and Legs of those little speckled Dragons, which the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> call <hi>Meden.</hi> You are to blame for offering to expound his Words otherways, and wrong the ingenuous <hi>Poet,</hi> and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiously abuse and miscall the said Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by an imputation of baseness unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly laid to their charge. We still should in such-like Discourses of fatilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Southsayers, interpret all things to the best. Will you teach me (quoth <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi>) how to discern Flies among Milk, or shew your Father the way how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get Children: He is, by the Vertue of God, an <hi>arrant Heretick,</hi> a <hi>resolute formal Heretick</hi>; I say, a <hi>rooted combustible Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> one as fit to burn as the <hi>little wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en

This money'd Fellow meeting at the very Brink of the Bank of the Ford, with Fryar <hi>Adam Crankcod,</hi> a <hi>Franciscan Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servantin</hi> of <hi>Mirebeau,</hi> promised him a new Frock, provided, that in the transporting of him over the Water, he would bear him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Neck and Shoulders, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of carrying dead Goats: for he was a lusty, strong-limb'd, sturdy Rogue.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="188" facs="tcp:46180:419"/>The Condition being agreed upon, Friar <hi>Crankcod</hi> trusseth himself up to his very Ballocks, and layeth upon his Back like a fair little Saint <hi>Christopher,</hi> the load of the said Supplicant <hi>Dodin,</hi> and so car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd him gayly and with a good Will; as <hi>Aeneas</hi> bore his Father <hi>Anchises</hi> through the Conflagration of <hi>Troy,</hi> singing in the mean while a prety <hi>Ave maris Stella.</hi> When they were in the very deepest place of all the Foord, a little above the Master-wheel of the Water-Mill, he asked if he had any Coin about him. Yes, (quoth <hi>Dodin</hi>) a whole Bag full; and that he needed not to mistrust his Ability in the performance of the Promise, which he had made unto him, concerning a new Frock. How! (quoth Friar <hi>Cranckcod</hi>) thou knowest well enough, that by the express Rules, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and Injunctions of our Order, we are forbidden to carry on us any kind of Money: Thou art truly unhappy, for having made me in this point to commit a hainous Trespass. Why didst thou not leave thy Purse with the Miller? With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fail thou shalt presently receive thy Reward for it; and if ever hereafter I may but lay hold upon thee within the Limits of our Chancel at <hi>Mirebeau,</hi> thou shalt have the <hi>Miserere</hi> even to the <hi>Vitulos.</hi> With this suddenly discharging himself of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:46180:419"/>
his Burthen, he throws me down your <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi> headlong.</p>
                        <p>Take Example by this <hi>Dodin,</hi> my dear Friend Friar <hi>Iohn,</hi> to the end that the Devils may the better carry thee away at thine own ease. Give me thy Purse. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry no manner of Cross upon thee. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in lieth an evident and manifestly appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Danger: For if you have any Silver coined with a Cross upon it, they will cast thee down headlong upon some Rocks; as the Eagles use to do with the Tortoises for the breaking of their Shells, as the bald Pate of the Poet <hi>Eschilus</hi> can suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently bear witness. Such a Fall would hurt thee very sore by Sweet Bully, and I would be sorry for it; or otherways they will let thee fall, and tumble down into the high swollen Waves of some capacious Sea, I know not where; but I warrant thee far enough hence, (as <hi>Icarus</hi> fell) which from thy Name would afterwards get the Denomination of the <hi>Funnelian</hi> Sea.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> Out of Debt: For the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils carry a great liking to those that are out of Debt. I have sore felt the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thereof in mine own particular; for now the lecherous Varlets are always woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, courting me, and making much of me, which they never did when I was
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:46180:420"/>
all to pieces. The Soul of one in Debt is insipid, dry, and heretical altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> With the Cowl and <hi>Domino de Grobis,</hi> return to <hi>Raminagrobis</hi>; and in case, being thus qualify'd, Thirty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Boats full of Devils forthwith come not to carry thee quite away, I shall be content to be at the charge of paying for the Pinte and Fagot. Now if for the more Security thou wouldst some Associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate to bear thee Company, let not me be the Comrade thou searchest for, think not to get a Fellow-Traveller of me; nay, do not, I advise thee for the best. Get you hence; I will not go thither; the Devil take me if I go. Notwithstanding all the Fright that you are in, (quoth Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar <hi>Ihon</hi>) I would not care so much, as might possibly be expected I should, if I once had but my Sword in my hand. Thou hast verily hit the Nail on the Head, (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) and speakest like a Learned Doctor, subtile, and well skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Art of Devilry.</p>
                        <p>At the time when I was a Student in the University of <hi>Tolouse,</hi> that same Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Father in the Devil, <hi>Picarris,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of the Diabological Faculty, was wont to tell us, that the Devils did natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally fear the bright glancing of Swords,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:46180:420"/>
as much as the Splendour and Light of the Sun. In Confirmation of the Verity whereof he related this Story, That <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> at his Descent into Hell to all the Devils of those Regions, did not by half so much terrifie them with his <hi>Club</hi> and <hi>Lion's Skin,</hi> as afterwards <hi>Aeneas</hi> did with his clear shining Armour upon him, and his Sword in his hand well furbished and unrusted, by the Aid, Council and Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the <hi>Sybilla Cumana.</hi> That was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the reason why the Senior <hi>Ihon Iaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo di Trivulcio,</hi> whilst he was a dying at <hi>Chartres,</hi> called for his Cutlass, and died with a Drawn Sword in his hand, laying about him alongst and athwart around the Bed, and every where within his reach, like a stout, doughty, valorous and Knight-like Cavaleer: By which resolute manner of Fence he scared away and put to flight all the Devils that were then ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in wait for his Soul at the passage of his Death. When the <hi>Malsorets</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balists</hi> are asked, Why it is that none of all the Devils do at any time enter into the Terestrial Paradice? Their Answer hath been, is, and will be still, That there is a <hi>Cherubin</hi> standing at the Gate thereof with a Flame-like glistering Sword in his hand. Although to speak in the true <hi>Diabological</hi> Sence or Phrase of <hi>Toledo,</hi>
                           <pb n="192" facs="tcp:46180:421"/>
I must needs confess and acknowledge, that veritably the Devils cannot be killed, or die by the stroke of a Sword. I do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless avow and maintain, according to the Doctrine of the said <hi>Diabology,</hi> that they may suffer a Solution of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity; (as if with thy Shable thou shouldst cut athwart the Flamme of a burning Fire, or the gross opacous Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of a thick and obscure Smoak) and cry out, like very Devils, at their Sense and Feeling of this Dissolution, which in real Deed I must averr and affirm is devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishly painful, smarting and dolorous.</p>
                        <p>When thou seest the impetuous Shock of two Armies, and vehement Violence of the Push in their horrid Encounter with one another; dost thou think, <hi>Balockasso,</hi> that so horrible a noise as is heard there proceedeth from the Voice and Shouts of Men? The dashing and joulting of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish? The clattering and clashing of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? The hacking and slashing of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-Axes? The justling and crashing of Pikes? The bustling and breaking of Lances? The Clamour and Skrieks of the Wounded? The sound and din of Drums? The Clangour and Shrilness of Trumpets? The neighing and rushing in of Horses? with the fearful Claps and thundering of all sorts of Guns, from the Double Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:46180:421"/>
to the Pocket Pistol inclusively? I cannot, Goodly, deny, but that in these various things which I have rehearsed, there may be somewhat occasionative of the huge Yell and Tintamarre of the two engaged Bodies.</p>
                        <p>But the most fearful and tumultuous Coil and Stir, the terriblest and most boisterous Garboil and Hurry, the chiefest rustling <hi>Black Santus</hi> of all, and most prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Hurly Burly, springeth from the grievously plangorous howling and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Devils, who Pell-mell, in a hand-over-head Confusion, waiting for the poor Souls of the maimed and hurt Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery, receive unawares some Stroaks with Swords, and so by those means suffering a Solution of, and Division in the <hi>Continui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of their Aerial and Invisible Substances: As if some Lackey, snatching at the Lard-slices, stuck in a piece of Roast-meat on the Spit, should get from Mr. <hi>Greazyfist</hi> a good rap on the Knuckles with a Cudgel, they cry out and shout like Devils. Even as <hi>Mars</hi> did, when he was hurt by <hi>Diome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> at the Siege of <hi>Troy,</hi> who (as <hi>Homer</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth of him) did then raise his Voice more horrifically loud, and sonoriferously high, than ten thousand Men together would have been able to do. What ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all this for our present purpose? I
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:46180:422"/>
have been speaking here of well-furbished Armour and bright shining Swords. But so is it not (Friar <hi>Ihon</hi>) with thy Weapon; for by a long discontinuance of Work, cessation from Labour, desisting from making it officiate, and putting it into that practice wherein it had been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accustomed; and in a word, for want of occupation, it is, upon my Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more rusty than the Key-hole of an old Poudering-Tub. Therefore it is expedient that you do one of these two, either furbish your Weapon bravely, and as it ought to be, or otherwise have a care that in the rusty case it is in, you do not presume to return to the House of <hi>Rami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagrobis.</hi> For my part, I vow I will not go thither, the Devil take me if I go.</p>

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:46180:422"/>
to <hi>Epistemon,</hi> spoke thus: My most ancient Friend and Gossip, thou seest the perplexity of my Thoughts, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est many Remedies for the removal there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; art thou not able to help and succour me? <hi>Epistemon</hi> thereupon taking the Speech in hand, represented unto <hi>Panurge,</hi> how the open Voice and common Fame of the whole Country did run upon no other Discourse, but the derision and mockery of his new Disguise; wherefore his Counsel unto him was that he would in the first place be pleased to make use of a little <hi>Hellebore,</hi> for the purging of his Brain of that peccant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>umour, which thro' that extravagant and fantastick Mummery of his had furnished the People with a too just occasion of flouting and gibbing, jeering and scoffing him; and that next he would resume his ordinary Fashion of Accoutrement, and go apparelled as he was wont to do. I am (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) my dear Gossip <hi>Epistemon,</hi> of a mind and resolution to Marry, but am afraid of being a Cuckold, and to be unfortunate in my Wedlock: For this cause have I made a Vow to young St. <hi>Francis,</hi> (who at <hi>Plessiletours</hi> is much reverenced of all Women, earnestly cried unto by them, and with great Devotion; for he was the first Founder of the Confraternity of good
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:46180:423"/>
Men, whom they naturally covet, affect and long for) <hi>to wear Spectacles in my Cap,</hi> and <hi>to carry no Codpiece in my Breeches,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the present Inquietude and Perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my Spirits be fully setled.</p>
                        <p>Truly (quoth <hi>Epistemon</hi>) that is a pretty jolly <hi>Vow,</hi> of Thirteen to a Dozen: It is a shame to you, and I wonder much at it, that you do not return unto your self, and recall your Senses from this their wild swarving and straying abroad to that rest and stilness which becomes a vertuous Man. This whimsical Conceit of yours brings me to the remembrance of a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Promise made by the <hi>Shaghaired Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives,</hi> who having in their Controversie against the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> for the Terreto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Tyree</hi> lost the Battle, which they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped should have decided it for their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, <hi>vowed</hi> to carry never any hair on their Heads, till preallably they had recovered the loss of both their Honour and Lands: As likewise to the memory of the <hi>Vow</hi> of a pleasant <hi>Spaniard</hi> called <hi>Michel Doris,</hi> who <hi>vowed</hi> to carry in his Hat a piece of the Shin of his Leg, till he should be revenged of him who had struck it off. Yet do not I know which of these two deserveth most to wear a Green and Yellow Hood with a Hares Ears tied to it, either the aforesaid vain-glorious <hi>Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
                           <pb n="197" facs="tcp:46180:423"/>
or that <hi>Euguerrant,</hi> who having forgot the art and manner of writing Histories, set down by the <hi>Samosatian</hi> Philosopher, maketh a most tediously long Narrative and Relation thereof: For at the first reading of such a profuse Discourse, one would think it had been broached for the introducing of a Story of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and moment concerning the waging of some formidable War, or the notable change and mutation of potent States and Kingdoms; but in conclusion, the World laugheth at the capricious Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, at the <hi>English-man</hi> who had affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, as also at their Scribler <hi>Euguerrant,</hi> more driveling at the Mouth than a Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard-pot. The Jest and Scorn thereof is not unlike to that of the Mountain of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race,</hi> which by the Poet was made to cry out and lament most enormously as a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the Pangs and Labour of Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, at which deplorable and exorbitant Cries and Lamentations the whole Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood being assembled in expectation to see some marvellous monstrous Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, could at last perceive no other but the paultry ridiculous Mouse.</p>
                        <p>Your mousing (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) will not make me leave my musing why Folks should be so frumpishly disposed, seeing I am certainly perswaded that some flout,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:46180:424"/>
who merit to be flouted at; yet as my <hi>Vow</hi> imports so will I do. It is now a long time since, by <hi>Iupiter Philos,</hi> we did swear Faith and Amity to one another: Give me your Advice, and tell me your O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion freely, Should I marry or no? Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (quoth <hi>Epistemon</hi>) the case is hazardous, and the danger so eminently apparent, that I find my self too weak and insufficient to give you a punctual and peremptory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution therein; and if ever it was true, the <hi>Iudgment is difficult</hi> in matters of the <hi>Medicinal</hi> Art, what was said by <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> of <hi>Lango,</hi> it is certainly so in this case. True it is, that in my Brain there are some rowling Fancies, by means whereof some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what may be pitched upon of a seeming efficacy to the disintangling your mind of those dubious Apprehensions wherewith it is perplexed; but they do not tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly satisfie me. Some of the <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> Sect affirm, that whosoever is able to see his proper <hi>Genius,</hi> may know his own Destiny. I understand not their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; nor do I think that you adhere to them; there is a palpable Abuse. I have seen the experience of it in a very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Gentleman of the Country of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strangowre.</hi> This is one of the Points. There is yet another not much better. If there were any Authority now in the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:46180:424"/>
Oracles of <hi>Iupiter Ammon</hi>; of <hi>Apollo</hi> in <hi>Lebadia, Delphos, Delos, Cyrra, Patara, Tegires, Preneste, Lycia, Colophon,</hi> or in the <hi>Castalian</hi> Fountain; near <hi>Antiochia</hi> in <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>; between the <hi>Branchidians</hi>; of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> in <hi>Dodona</hi>; of <hi>Mercure</hi> in <hi>Phares</hi>; near <hi>Parras</hi>; of <hi>Apis,</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi>; of <hi>Serapis</hi> in <hi>Canorie</hi>; of <hi>Faunus</hi> in <hi>Menalia,</hi> and <hi>Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> near <hi>Tivoly</hi>; of <hi>Tiresias</hi> in <hi>Orchomenie</hi>; of <hi>Mosus</hi> in <hi>Silicia</hi>; of <hi>Orpheus</hi> in <hi>Lisbos</hi>; and of <hi>Trophonius</hi> in <hi>Lucadia.</hi> I would in that case advise you, and possibly not, to go thither for their Judgment concerning the Design and Enterprize you have in hand. But you know that they are all of them become as dumb as so many Fishes, since the <hi>Advent</hi> of that <hi>Saviour King,</hi> whose coming to this World hath made all Oracles and Prophesies to cease; as the approach of the Suns radiant Beams expelleth Goblins, Bugbears, Hobthrushes, Broams, Schriech-Owl-Mates, Night-walking Spirits, and Tenebrions. These now are gone; but although they were as yet in continuance, and in the same Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Rule and Request that formerly they were, yet would not I counsel you to be too credulous in putting any Trust in their Responses: Too many Folks have been deceived thereby. It stands further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more upon Record, how <hi>Agrippina</hi> did
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:46180:425"/>
charge the fair <hi>Lollia</hi> with the Crime of having interrogated the Oracle of <hi>Apollo Clarius,</hi> to understand if she should be at any time married to the Emperor <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi>; for which Cause she was first ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, and thereafter put to a shameful and ignominious Death.</p>
                        <p>But (saith <hi>Panurge</hi>) let us do better; the <hi>Ogygian</hi> Islands are not far distant from the Haven of <hi>Sammalo:</hi> Let us, after that we shall have spoken to our King, make a Voyage thither. In one of these four <hi>Isles,</hi> to wit, that which hath its primest Aspect towards the Sun setting, it is reported, (and I have read in good Antick and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Authors) that there reside many Soothsayers, Fortune-tellers, Vaticinators, Prophets, and Diviners of things to come; that <hi>Saturn</hi> inhabiteth that place, bound with fair Chains of Gold, and within the Concavity of a Golden Rock, being nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished with Divine <hi>Ambrosie</hi> and <hi>Nectar,</hi> which are daily in great store and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance transmitted to him from the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, by I do not well know what kind of Fowls (it may be that they are the same Ravens, which in the Deserts are said to have fed St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the first Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit) he very clearly foretelleth unto every one, who is desirous to be certified of the condition of his Lot, what his Destiny
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:46180:425"/>
will be, and what future Chance the Fates have ordained for him: for the <hi>Parques,</hi> or <hi>Weerd Sisters</hi> do not twist, spin, or draw out a Thread; nor yet doth <hi>Iupiter</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, project, or deliberate any thing, which the good old Coelestial Father knoweth not to the full, even whilst he is a sleep: This will be a very summary Abbreviation of our Labour, if we but hearken unto him a little upon the seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous debate and canvassing of this my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity. That is (answered <hi>Epistemon</hi>) a Gullery too evident, a plain Abuse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Fib too fabulous. I will not go, not I, I will not go.</p>

                        <p>NEvertheless, (quoth <hi>Epistemon,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing his Discourse) I will tell you what you may do, if you will believe me, before we return to our King: Hard by here, in the <hi>Brown-wheat Island,</hi> dwelleth <hi>Her Trippa</hi>; you know how by the Arts
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:46180:426"/>
of Astrology, Geomancy, Chiromancy, Metopomancy, and others of a like stuff and nature, he foretelleth all things to come: Let us talk a little, and confer with him about your Business. Of that (answered <hi>Panurge</hi>) I know nothing: but of this much concerning him I am assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that one day, and that not long since, whilst he was prating to the Great King, of Coelestial, Sublime, and Transcendent Things, the Lackqueys and Footboys of the Court, upon the upper Steps of Stairs between two Doors, jumbled, one after another, as often as they listed, his Wife; who is passable fair, and a pretty snug Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. Thus he who seemed very clearly to see all Heavenly and Terrestrial Things without Spectacles, who discoursed bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Adventures past, with great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence opened up present Cases and Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and stoutly professed the presaging of all future Events and Contingencies, and was not able with all the Skill and Cunning that he had, to perceive the Bumbasting of his Wife, whom he repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be very chast; and hath not till this hour, got Notice of any thing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Yet let us go to him, seeing you will have it so: for surely we can never learn too much. They on the very next ensuing Day, came to <hi>Her Trippa</hi>'s Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

                           <hi>Panurge,</hi> by way of Donative, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented him with a long Gown lined all thorough with Wolves-skins, with a short Sword mounted with a gilded Hilt, and covered with a Velvet Scabbard, and with fifty good single Angels: then in a familiar and friendly way did he ask of him his Opinion touching the Affair. At the very first <hi>Her Trippa</hi> looking on him very wist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the face, said unto him: Thou hast the Metoposcopy, and Physiognomy of a Cuckold; I say, of a notorious and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Cuckold. With this casting an eye upon <hi>Panurge</hi>'s right Hand in all the parts thereof, he said, This rugged Draught which I see here, just under the Mount of <hi>Iove,</hi> was never yet but in the Hand of a Cuckold. Afterwards, he with a White Lead Pen, swiftly, and hastily drew a certain Number of diverse kinds of Points, which by Rules of Geomancy he coupled and joyned together, then said, Truth it self is not truer, then that it is certain, thou wilt be a Cuckold, a little after thy Marriage. That being done, he asked of <hi>Panurge</hi> the Horoscope of his Nativity; which was no sooner by <hi>Panurge</hi> tendred unto him, then that, erecting a Figure, he very promptly and speedily formed and fashion'd a compleat Fabrick of the Houses of Heaven, in all their parts, whereof when

he had considered the Situation and the Aspects in their Triplicities, he fetched a deep sigh, and said: I have clearly enough already discovered unto you the Fate of your Cuckoldry, which is unavoidable, you cannot escape it; and here have I got of new a further assurance thereof, so that I may now hardily pronounce, and affirm without any scruple or hesitation at all, that thou wilt be a Cuckold; that fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, thou wilt be beaten by thine own Wife, and that she will purloyn, filch, and steal of thy Goods from thee; for I find the <hi>Seventh House,</hi> in all its Aspects, of a malignant Influence, and every one of the Planets threatning thee with Disgrace, according as they stand seated towards one another, in relation to the Horned Signs of <hi>Aries, Taurus,</hi> and <hi>Capricorn:</hi> In the <hi>Fourth House</hi> I find <hi>Iupiter</hi> in a Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as also in a Tetragonal Aspect to <hi>Saturn,</hi> associated with <hi>Mercury:</hi> thou wilt be soundly pepper'd, my good honest Fellow, I warrant thee. I will be: (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered <hi>Panurge</hi>) a Plague rot thee, thou old Fool, and doating Sot, how graceless and unpleasant thou art.</p>
                        <p>When all Cuckolds shall be at a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rendezvous, thou shouldst be their Standard-bearer. But whence comes this Ciron-worm betwixt these two Fingers?
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:46180:427"/>
This <hi>Panurge</hi> said, putting the Fore-finger of his Left-hand, betwixt the Fore and Mid-finger of the Right, which he thrust out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Her Trippa,</hi> holding them open af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of two Horns, and shutting into a Fist his Thumb, with the other Fingers. Then in turning to <hi>Epistemon,</hi> he said, Lo here the true <hi>Ollus</hi> of <hi>Martial,</hi> who addicted and devoted himself wholly to the observing the Miseries, Crosses, and Calamities of others, whilst his own Wife, in the Interim, did keep an open Bawdy-house.</p>
                        <p>This Varlet is poorer then ever was <hi>Irus,</hi> and yet he is a proud, vaunting, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant, self-conceited, over-weening, and more insupportable then Seventeen Devils; in one word, <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>Come, let us leave this Madpash Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam, this hair-brain'd Fop, and give him leave to rave and dose his Belly-full, with his private and intimately acquainted Devils; who, if they were not the very worst of all the infernal Fiends, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have daigned to serve such a knavish, barking Cur as this is. He hath not learnt the first Precept of Philosophy, which is, <hi>Know thy Self:</hi> for whilst he braggeth and boasteth, that he can discern the least
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:46180:428"/>
Mote in the Eye of another, he is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to see the huge Block that puts out the sight of both his Eyes. This is such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Polypragmon,</hi> as is by <hi>Plutarch</hi> descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed: He is of the nature of the <hi>Lamian</hi> Witches, who in forreign Places, in the Houses of Strangers, in Publick, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the common People, had a sharper and more piercing Inspection into their Affairs then any <hi>Lync</hi>; but at home in their own proper Dwelling-Mansions, were blinder then Mold-Warps, and saw nothing at all: for their Custom was at their return from abroad, when they were by themselves in private to take their Eyes out of their Head, from whence they were as easily removable as a Pair of Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles from their Nose, and to lay them up into a wooden Slipper, which for that purpose did hang behind the Door of their Lodging.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Panurge</hi> had no sooner done speaking, when <hi>Her Trippa</hi> took into his Hand a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marisk Branch.

                        <p>My Harcabuzing Cod, and Buttock-stirring Ballock, Fryar <hi>Ihon,</hi> my Friend: I do carry a singular respect unto thee, and honour thee with all my Heart, thy Counsel I hold for a choice and delicate Morsel, therefore have I reserved it for the last Bit. Give me thy Advice freely, I beseech thee; Should I marry, or no? Fryar <hi>Ihon</hi> very merrily, and with a sprightly chearfulness made this Answer to him: Marry, in the Devil's Name,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:46180:434"/>
Why not? What the Devil else shouldst thou do, but marry? Take thee a Wife, and furbish her Harnish to some tune: Swinge her Skin-coat, as if thou wert beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Stock-fish; and let the repercussi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy Clapper from her resounding Metal, make a Noise, as if a double Peal of Chiming-Bells were hung at the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters of thy Ballocks. As I say Marry, so do I understand, that thou shouldst fall to work as speedily as may be: yea, my meaning is, that thou oughtest to be so quick and forward therein, as on this same very day, before Sun-set, to cause, proclaim thy Banes of Matrimony, and make provision of Bedsteads. By the Blood of a Hog's-pudding, till when wouldst thou delay the acting of a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's part? Dost thou not know, and is it not daily told unto thee, that the end of the World approacheth? We are nearer it by three Poles, and half a Fathom, then we were two days ago. The <hi>Antichrist</hi> is already born, at least it is so reported by many: the truth is, that hitherto the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his wrath have not reached further then to the scratching of his Nurse and Governesses: his Nails are not sharp e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough as yet, nor have his Claws attained to their full growth; he is little.</p>

                           <hi>Crescat; Nos qui vivimus, multiplicemur.</hi> It is written so, and it is holy stuff, I warrant you: The truth whereof is like to last as long as a Sack of Corn may be had for a Penny, and a Punction of pure Wine for Three-pence. Would thou be content to be found with thy Genitories full in the Day of Judgment? <hi>Dum vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris judicari.</hi> Thou hast (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) a right, clear, and neat Spirit, Fryar <hi>Ihon,</hi> my Metropolitan <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <head>CHAP. XXVII. How Fryar <hi>Ihon</hi> merrily, and sportingly counselleth <hi>Panurge.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>BY Saint <hi>Rigomet</hi> (quoth Fryar <hi>Ihon</hi>) I do advise thee to nothing, my dear Friend <hi>Panurge</hi>) which I would not do my self, were I in thy place: only have a special care, and take good heed thou soulder well together the Joynts of the double backed, and two bellied Beast, and fortifie thy Nerves so strongly, that there be no discontinuance in the Knocks of the <hi>Venerian</hi> thwacking, else thou art lost, poor Soul: for if there pass long intervals betwixt the Priapising Feats, and that thou make an intermission of too large a time, that will befall thee, which betides the Nurses, if they desist from giving suck to
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:46180:435"/>
Children, they lose their Milk; and if continually thou do not hold thy Asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory Tool in exercise, and keep thy Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal going, thy <hi>Lacticinian</hi> Nectar will be gone, and it will serve thee only as a Pipe to piss out at, and thy Cods for a Wallet of lesser value then a Beggars Scrip. This is a certain truth I tell thee, Friend, and doubt not of it; for my self have seen the sad experiment thereof in many, who cannot now do what they would, because before they did not what they might have done: <hi>Ex desuetudine amittuntur Privilegia:</hi> Non-usage oftentimes destroys ones Right, say the learned Doctors of the Law: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, my <hi>Billy,</hi> entertain as well as possibly thou canst, that <hi>Hypogastrian,</hi> lower sort of Troglodytick People, that their chief plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure may be placed in the case of sempiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal labouring. Give order that henceforth they live not like adle Gentlemen, idly upon their Rents and Revenues, but that they may work for their Livelyhoood, by breaking ground within the <hi>Paphian</hi> Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Nay truly (answered <hi>Panurge</hi>) Fryar <hi>Ihon,</hi> my left Ballock, I will believe thee, for thou dealest plain with me, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest down-right square upon the business, without going about the Bush with frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous circumstances, and unnecessary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations. Thou with the splendour of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:46180:436"/>
a piercing Wit, hast dissipated all the lour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Clouds of anxious Apprehensions and Suspicions, which did intimidate and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie me: therefore the Heavens be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to grant to thee, at all She-conflicts, a stiff-standing Fortune. Well then, as thou hast said, so will I do, I will, in good Faith, Marry; in that point there shall be no failing, I promise thee, and shall have always by me pretty Girls clothed with the Name of my Wives Waiting-Maids, that lying under thy Wings, thou mayest be Night-Protector of their Sister<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
                        <p>Let this serve for the first part of the Sermon. Hearken (quoth Fryar <hi>Ihon</hi>) to the Oracle of the Bells of <hi>Varenes</hi>; What say they? I hear and understand them (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) their Sound is by my Thirst, more uprightly fatidical, then that of <hi>Iove</hi>'s Great Kettles in <hi>Dodona.</hi> Heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; <hi>Take thee a Wife, take thee a Wife, and marry, marry, marry: for if thou marry, thou shalt find good therein, herein, here in a Wife thou shalt find good; so marry, marry.</hi> I will assure thee, that I shall be married, all the Elements invite and prompt me to it: let this Word be to thee a Brazen Wall, by diffidence not to be broken thorough. As for the Second part of this our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: Thou seemest in some measure to
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:46180:436"/>
mistrust the readiness of my Paternity, in the practising of my Placket-Racket with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Aphrodisian</hi> Tennis-Court at all times fitting, as if the stiff God of Gardens were not favourable to me. I pray thee, favour me so much as to believe, that I still have him at a beck, attending always my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, docile, obedient, vigorous, and active in all things, and every-where, and never stubborn or refractory to my will or pleasure.</p>
                        <p>I need no more, but to let go the Reins, and slacken the Leash, which is the Belly-point, and when the Game is shewn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, say, Hey, <hi>Iack,</hi> to thy Booty, he will not fail even then to flesh himself up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Prey, and tuzle it to some purpose. Hereby you may perceive, although my future Wife were as unsatiable and glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous in her Voluptuousness, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of Venery, as ever was the Empress <hi>Messalina,</hi> or yet the Marchioness in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; and I desire thee to give credit to it, that I lack not for what is requisite to over<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Shall thou need to urge Authorities, or bring forth the Instance of the <hi>Indian</hi> Prince, of whom <hi>Theophrastus Plinius,</hi> and <hi>Athenaeus</hi> testifie, that with the help of a certain Herb, he was able, and had given frequent Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof, to toss his sinewy Piece of Generation, in the Act of carnal Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence, above Threescore and ten times in the space of Four and twenty hours. Of that I believe nothing, the number is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posititious, and too prodigally foisted in: Give no Faith unto it, I beseech thee, but prithee trust me in this, and thy credulity
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:46180:437"/>
therein shall not be wronged; for it is true, and <hi>Probatum est,</hi> that my Pionier of Nature, the sacred <hi>Ithyphallian</hi> Champion, is of all stiff-intruding Blades the primest: Come hither my Ballockette, and hearken, Didst thou ever see the Monk of <hi>Castres</hi> Cowl? when in any House it was laid down, whether openly in the view of all, or covertly out of the sight of any, such was the ineffable Vertue thereof for exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating and stirring up the People of both Sexes unto Lechery, that the whole Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants and Indwellers, not only of that, but likeways of all the circumjacent places thereto, within three Leagues around it, did suddenly enter into Rut, both Beasts and Folks, Men and Women, even to the Dogs and Hogs, Rats and Cats.</p>
                        <p>I swear to thee, that many times hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have perceived, and found in my <hi>Codpiece</hi> a certain kind of Energy, or effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious Vertue, much more irregular, and of a greater Anomaly, then what I have related: I will not speak to thee either of House or Cottage, nor of Church or Market, but only tell thee, that once at the Representation of the <hi>Passion,</hi> which was acted at Saint <hi>Mexents</hi>; I had no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er entred within the Pit of the Theater, but that forthwith, by the vertue and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult property of it, on a sudden all that
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:46180:438"/>
were there, both Players and Spectators, did fall into such an exorbitant Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Lust, that there was not Angel, Man, Devil, nor Deviless, upon the place, who would not then have Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collitched it with all their Heart and Soul.</p>
                        <p>The Prompter forsook his Copy, he who played <hi>Michael</hi>'s part, came down to rights, the Devils issued out of Hell, and carried along with them most of the pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty little Girls that were there; yea, <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi> got out of his Fetters; in a word: seeing the huge Disorder, I disparked my self forth of that inclosed place, in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Cato</hi> the <hi>Censor,</hi> who perceiving by reason of his presence, the <hi>Floralian</hi> Festivals out of order, withdrew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. XXVIII. How Friar <hi>Ihon</hi> comforteth <hi>Panurge</hi> in the douhtful matter of Cuckoldry.</head>
                        <p>I Understand thee well enough, said Friar <hi>Ihon</hi>; but <hi>time makes all things plain.</hi> The most durable Marbre or Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyr is subject to Old Age and Decay. Though for the present thou possibly be not weary of the Exercise, yet is it like, I will hear thee confess a few years hence, that thy Cods hang dangling downwards for want of a better Truss. I see thee waxing a little hoar-headed already; thy Beard by the Distinctions of grey, white, tawny and black, hath to my thinking the resemblance of a Map of the Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial Globe, or Geographical Cart. Look attentively upon, and take Inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of what I shall show unto thee. Behold there <hi>Asia,</hi> here are <hi>Tygris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates.</hi> Lo there <hi>Africk</hi>; here is the Mountain of the <hi>Moon,</hi> yonder thou mayst perceive the Fenny Marsh of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</hi> On this side lieth <hi>Europe:</hi> Dost thou
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:46180:439"/>
not see the Abby of <hi>Tileme</hi>? This little Tuft, which is altogether white, is the <hi>Hyperborean Hills.</hi> By the thirst of my Throple, Friend, when Snow is on the Mountains, I say the Head and the Chin, there is not then any considerable Heat to be expected in the Valleys and Low-Countries of the Codpiece. By the Kibes of thy Heels (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) thou dost not understand the Topicks. When Snow is on the tops of the Hills, Lightning, Thunder, Tempest, Whirlwinds, Storms, Hurricanes, and all the Devils of Hell rage in the Valleys. Wouldst thou see the experience thereof, go to the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the <hi>Swissers,</hi> and earnestly perpend with thy self there the Situation of the Lake of <hi>Wendelberliok,</hi> about four Leagues distant from <hi>Berne,</hi> on the <hi>Syon</hi>-side of the Land. Thou twittest me with my Grey Heirs, yet considerest not how I am of the Nature of Leeks, which with a white Head carry a green, fresh, streight, and vigorous Tail.</p>
                        <p>The truth is nevertheless, (why should I deny it) that I now and then discern in my self some indicative Signs of Old Age. Tell this, I prithee, to no body, but let it be kept very close and secret be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us two; for I find the Wine much sweeter now, more savoury to my taste,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:46180:439"/>
and unto my Palate of a better relish than formerly I was wont to do; and withal, besides mine accustomed manner, I have a more dreadful Apprehension than I ever heretofore have had of lighting on bad Wine. Note and observe that this doth argue and portend I know not what of the <hi>West</hi> and <hi>Occident</hi> of my time, and signifieth that the <hi>South</hi> and <hi>Meridian</hi> of mine Age is past. But what then? my Gentle Companion, that doth but beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that I will hereafter drink so much the more. That is not, the Devil hale it, the thing that I fear; nor is there where my Shoo pinches. The thing that I doubt most, and have greatest reason to dread and suspect, is, that through some long absence of our King <hi>Pantagruel</hi> (to whom I must needs bear Company, should he go to all the Devils of <hi>Berathrum</hi>) my fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Wife shall make me a Cuckold. This is, in truth, the long and the short on't: For I am by all those whom I have spoke to menac'd and threatned with a Horned Fortune; and all of them affirm, it is the Lot to which from Heaven I am pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinated. Every one (answered Friar <hi>Ihon</hi>) that would be a Cuckold, is not one: If it be thy Fate to be hereafter of the number of that <hi>Horned</hi> Cattle, then may I conclude with an <hi>Ergo,</hi> thy Wife
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:46180:440"/>
will be beautiful, and <hi>Ergo,</hi> thou wilt be kindly used by her: Likewise with this <hi>Ergo</hi> thou shalt be blissed with the fruition of many Friends and Well-willers: And finally with this other <hi>Ergo</hi> thou shalt be <hi>saved,</hi> and have a place in <hi>Paradise.</hi> These are Monachal Topicks and Maxims of the Cloyster: Thou mayst take more liberty to sin: Thou shalt be more at ease than ever: There will be nevertheless left for thee, nothing diminished, but thy Goods shall increase notably: And if so be it was preordinated for thee, wouldst thou be so impious as not to acquiesce in thy Destiny? Speak thou jaded Cod,

Wouldst thou disorder all the Coelestial Spheres? blame the Intelligences, blunt the Spindles, joynt the Wherves, slander the Spinning Quills, reproach the Bob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, revile the Clew-bottoms, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ravel and untwist all the Threads of both the warp and the waft of the weer'd Sister <hi>Parques?</hi> What a Pox to thy Bones dost thou mean, stony Cod? thou wouldst if thou couldst, a great deal worse than

the Gyants of old intended to have done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Come hither, Billicullion; Whether wouldst thou be Jealous without cause, or be a Cuckold and know nothing of it? Neither the one nor the other (quoth <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi>) would I choose to be: But if I get an inkling of the matter, I will provide well enough, or there shall not be one stick of Wood within Five hundred Leagues about me, whereof to make a Cudgel. In good Faith (Fryar <hi>Ihon</hi>) I speak now seriously unto thee, I think it will be my best not to marry: Hearken to what the Bells do tell me, now that we are nearer to them: <hi>Do not Marry, Marry not, not, not, not, not; Marry, Marry not, not, not, not, not: If thou Marry, thou wilt miscarry, carry, carry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou'lt repent it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent it, sent it: if thou Marry, thou a Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kold, a Cou-cou-Cuckoe, Cou-cou-Cuckold thou shalt be.</hi> By the worthy Wrath of God I begin to be angry; this <hi>Campanilian</hi> Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle fretteth me to the Guts, a <hi>March-Hare</hi> was never in such a Chaff as I am. O how I am vexed! you Monks and Fryars of the Cowl-pated, and Hood-poll'd Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, have you no Remedy nor Salve against this Malady of Graffing Horns in Heads? Hath Nature so abandoned Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane-kind, and of her help left us so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute, that married Men cannot know
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:46180:444"/>
how to sail through the Seas of this mortal Life, and be safe from the Whirlpools, Quicksands, Rocks, and Banks, that lie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longst the Coast of <hi>Cornwall.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I will (said Fryar <hi>Ihon</hi>) shew thee a way, and teach thee an expedient, by means whereof thy Wife shall never make thee a Cuckold without thy knowledge, and thine own consent. Do me the favour, I pray thee, (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) my pretty soft downy Cod; now tell it, <hi>Billy,</hi> tell it, I beseech thee. Take (quoth Fryar <hi>Ihon) Hans Carvel</hi>'s Ring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy Finger, who was the King of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda's</hi> chief Jeweller; besides that, this <hi>Hans Carvel</hi> had the Reputation of being very skilful and expert in the Lapidary's Profession, he was a studious, learned, and ingenious Man, a Scientifick Person, full of Knowledge, a great Philosopher, of a sound Judgment, of a prime Wit, good Sence, clear Spirited, an honest Creature, Courteous, Charitable, Giver of Alms, and of a Jovial Humour, a Boon Companion, and a Merry Blade, if ever there was any in the World: He was somewhat Gorbellied, had a little Shake in his Head, and in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect unwieldy of his Body; in his Old Age he took to Wife the Bayliff of <hi>Concordat</hi>'s Daughter, a young, fair, jolly, gallant, spruce, frisk, brisk, neat, feat, smirk <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:46180:445"/>
proper, graceful, handsome, beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, comely; and kind, a little too much to her Neighbours and Acquaintance.</p>
                        <p>Hereupon it fell out, after the expiring of a scantling of Weeks, that Master <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel</hi> became as jealous as a Tygar, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a very profound suspition, that his new-married Gixy did keep a Buttock-stirring with others: to prevent which inconveniency, he did tell her many tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Stories of the total Ruine of several Kingdoms by Adultery; did read unto her the Legend of chast Wives; then made some Lectures to her in the praise of the choice Vertue of Pucidity, and did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent her with a Book in Commendation of Conjugal Fidelity: wherein the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness of all licentious Women was odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously detested; and withal, he gave her a Chain enriched with pure Oriental Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phires. Notwithstanding all this, he found her always more and more inclined to the reception of her Neighbour Copes-mates, that day by day his Jealousie increased; in sequel whereof, one Night as he was lying by her, whilst in his Sleep the ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Fancies of the leacherous Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Wife, did take up the Celluls, of his Brain, he dreamt that he encountred with the Devil, to whom he had disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the full the buzzing of his Head,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:46180:445"/>
and suspicion that his Wife did tread her Shooe awry; the Devil, he thought, in this perplexity, did for his comfort, give him a Ring, and therewithal did kindly put it on his Middle-finger, saying, <hi>Hans Carvel,</hi> I give thee this Ring, whilst thou carriest it upon that Finger, thy Wife shall never carnally be known by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then thy self, without thy special knowledge and consent. Grammercy (quoth <hi>Hans Carvel</hi>) my Lord Devil, I renounce <hi>Mahomet,</hi> if ever it shall come off my Finger. The Devil vanished, as is his Custom, and then <hi>Hans Carvel</hi> full of Joy awaking, found that his Middle-finger was as far as it could reach within the <hi>What-do-you-call-it</hi> of his Wife. I did forget to tell thee, how his Wife, as soon as she had felt the Finger there, said in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyling her Buttocks, Off, yes, nay, tut, pish, tush, aye, Lord, that is not the thing which should be put up in that place. With this <hi>Hans Carvel</hi> thought that some pilferring Fellow was about to take the Ring from him.</p>
                        <p>Is not this an Infallible and Sovereign Antidote? therefore, if thou wilt believe me, in imitation of this Example, never fail to have continually the Ring of thy Wife's Commodity upon thy Finger. When that was said, their Discourse and their Way ended.</p>

                        <p>NO sooner were they come into the Royal Palace, but they, to the full, made Report unto <hi>Pantagruel</hi> of the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of their Expedition; they shew him the Response of <hi>Paminagrobis.</hi> When <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel</hi> had read it over and over again, the oftner he perused it, being the better pleased therewith; he said, in addressing his Speech to <hi>Panurge,</hi> I have not as yet seen any Answer framed to your Demand, which affordeth me more Contentment: for in this his succinct Copy of Verses, he summarily, and briefly, yet fully enough expresseth, how he would have us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that every one in the Project and Enterprize of Marriage, ought to be his own Carver, sole Arbitrator of his proper Thoughts, and from himself alone take Counsel in the main and peremptory
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:46180:446"/>
closure of what his Determination should be, in either his assent to, or dissent from it. Such always hath been my Opinion to you, and when at first you spoke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to me, I truly told you this same very thing; but tacitly you scorned my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and would not harbour it within your mind. I know for certain, and therefore may I with the greater confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence utter my conception of it, that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lauty,</hi> or Self love, is that which blinds your Judgment, and deceiveth you.</p>
                        <p>Let us do otherways, and that is this: Whatever we are, or have, consisteth in Three Things: the Soul, the Body, and the Goods: now for the preservation of these Three, there are Three sorts of Learned Men ordained, each respectively to have care of that one which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to his charge. <hi>Theologues</hi> are appointed for the Soul, <hi>Physitians</hi> for the Welfare of the Body, and <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers</hi> for the Safety of our Goods: hence it is, that it is my Resolution to have on <hi>Sunday</hi> next with me at Dinner, a <hi>Divine,</hi> a <hi>Physician,</hi> and a <hi>Lawyer,</hi> that with those Three assembled thus together, we may in every Point and Particle, confer at large of your Perplexity. By Saint <hi>Picot</hi> (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered <hi>Panurge</hi>) we never shall do any good that way: I see it already, and you
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:46180:447"/>
see your self how the World is vilely abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as when with a Fox-tayl one claps a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother's Breech, to cajole him. We give our Souls to keep to the <hi>Theologues,</hi> who for the greater part are <hi>Hereticks</hi>: Our Bodies we commit to the <hi>Physitians,</hi> who never themselves take any <hi>Physick</hi>: and then we intrust our Goods to <hi>Lawyers,</hi> who never go to <hi>Law</hi> against one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. You speak like a Courtier (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) but the first Point of your As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion is to be denied: for we daily see how good <hi>Theologues</hi> make it their chief Business, their whole and sole Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by their Deeds, their Words, and Writings, to extirpate Errors and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies out of the Hearts of Men; and in their stead profoundly plant the true and lively Faith. The Second Point you spoke of I commend: for whereas the Professors of the Art of <hi>Medicine,</hi> give so good order to the <hi>Prophylactick,</hi> or <hi>Conservative</hi> part of their Faculty, in what concerneth their proper Healths, that they stand in no need of making use of the other Branch, which is the <hi>Curative,</hi> or <hi>Therapentick,</hi> by Medicaments. As for the Third, I grant it to be true: for Learned <hi>Advocates</hi> and <hi>Counsellors</hi> at <hi>Law,</hi> are so much taken up with the Affairs of others in their Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, Pleadings, and such-like Patroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:46180:447"/>
of those who are their Clients, that they have no leisure to attend any Controversies of their own. Therefore, on the next ensuing <hi>Sunday,</hi> let the Divine be our godly Father <hi>Hippothadee,</hi> the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian our honest Master <hi>Rondibilis,</hi> and the Legist our good Friend <hi>Bridlegoose:</hi> nor will it be (to my thinking) amiss, that we enter into the <hi>Pythagorick Field,</hi> and choose for an Assistant to the Three afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Doctors, our ancient faithful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, the Philosopher <hi>Trouillogan</hi>; especially seeing a perfect Philosopher, such as is <hi>Trouiilogan,</hi> is able positively to resolve all whatsoever Doubts you can propose. <hi>Carpalin,</hi> have you a care to have them here all Four on <hi>Sunday</hi> next at Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, without fail.</p>
                        <p>I believe (quoth <hi>Epistemon</hi>) that through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Country, in all the Corners thereof, you could not have pitched upon such other Four: which I speak not so much in regard of the most excellent Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications and Accomplishments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with all of them are endowed for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Discharge and Management of each his own Vocation and Calling, (wherein without all doubt or controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, they are the Paragons of the Land, and surpass all others) as for that <hi>Rondibilis</hi> is marrried now, who before was not: <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothadee</hi>
                           <pb n="246" facs="tcp:46180:448"/>
was not before, nor is yet: <hi>Bridle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goose</hi> was married once, but is not now: and <hi>Trouillogan</hi> is married now, who wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded was to another Wife before. Sir, if it may stand with your good liking, I will ease <hi>Carpalin</hi> of some parcel of his Labour, and invite <hi>Bridlegoose</hi> my self, with whom I of a long time have had a very intimate familiarity, and unto whom I am to speak on the behalf of a pretty hopeful Youth, who now studieth at <hi>Tholouse,</hi> under the most learned, vertuous Doctor <hi>Boissonnet.</hi> Do what you deem most expedient (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) and tell me, if my Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation can in any thing be steadable for the promoval of the good of that Youth, or otherways serve for bettering of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity and Office of the worthy <hi>Boissonet,</hi> whom I do so love and respect, for one of the ablest and most sufficient in his way, that any where are extant. Sir, I will use therein my best Endeavours, and heartily bestir my self about it.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. XXX. How the <hi>Theologue, Hippothadee,</hi> giv<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth Counsel to <hi>Panurge</hi> in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and business of his Nuptial En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize.</head>
                        <p>THE Dinner on the subsequent <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> was no sooner made ready, than that the afore-named invited Guests gave thereto their Appearance, all of them; <hi>Bridlegoose</hi> only excepted, who was the Deputy-Governor of the <hi>Fonspeton.</hi> At the ushering in of the Second Service, <hi>Panurge</hi> making a low Reverence, spake thus: Gentlemen, the Question I am to propound unto you shall be uttered in very few Words; <hi>Should I marry or no?</hi> If my Doubt herein be not resolved by you, I shall hold it altogether insolvable, as are the <hi>Insolubilia de Aliaco</hi>; for all of you are elected, chosen, and culled out from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst others, every one in his own Condition and Quality, like so many picked Peas on a Carpet.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="248" facs="tcp:46180:449"/>The Father <hi>Hippothada,</hi> in obedience to the bidding of <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> and with much Courtesie to the Company, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered exceeding modestly, after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: My Friend, you are pleased to ask Counsel of us; but first you must consult with your self. Do you find any trouble or disquiet in your Body by the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate stings and pricklings of the Flesh? That I do (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) in a hugely strong and almost irresistible mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: Be not offended, I beseech you, good Father, at the freedom of my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression. No truly, Friend, not I, (quoth <hi>Hippothadee</hi>) there is no reason why I should be displeased therewith: But in this Carnal Strife and Debate of yours, have you obtained from God the Gift and <hi>special Grace</hi> of Continency? In good Faith, not, (quoth <hi>Panurge.</hi>) My Counsel to you in that case (my Friend) is, that you marry, (quoth <hi>Hippothadee</hi>) for you should rather choose to marry once, than to burn still in Fires of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence. Then <hi>Panurge,</hi> with a jovial Heart and a loud Voice, cried out, That is spoke gallantly, without circumbiliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginating about and about, and never hit it in its centred Point. Grammercy, my good Father. In truth I am resolved now to marry, and without fail I shall do
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:46180:449"/>
it quickly. I invite you to my Wedding; by the Body of a Hen, we shall make good Cheer, and be as merry as Crickets: You shall wear the Bridegroom's Colours; and if we eat a Goose, my Wife shall not rost for me. I will intreat you to lead up the first Dance of the Brides Maids, if it may please you to do me so much Favour and Honour. There resteth yet a small Difficulty, a little Scruple, yea, even less than nothing, whereof I humbly crave your Resolution; Shall I be a Cuckold, Father, yea or no? By no means, (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered <hi>Hippothadee</hi>) will you be Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kolded, if it please God. O the Lord help us now, (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) whither are we driven to, good Folks? To the <hi>Conditionals,</hi> which according to the Rules and Precepts of the Dialectick Faculty, admit of all contradictions and impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities. <hi>If my Transalpine Mule had Wings, my Transalpine Mule would fly.</hi> If it please God I shall not be a Cockold, but I shall be a Cuckold if it please him. Good God, if this were a condition which I knew how to prevent, my Hopes should be as high as ever, nor would I despair: But you here send me to God's Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, to the Closet of his little Pleasures. You my <hi>French</hi> Countrymen, which is the way you take to go thither?</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="250" facs="tcp:46180:450"/>My honest Father, I believe it will be your best not to come to my Wedding: The clutter and dingle dangle noise of Marriage Guests will but disturb you, and break the serious Fancies of your Brain. You love Repose, with Solitude and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; I really believe you will not come. And then you Dance but indifferently, and would be out of Countenance at the first Entry. I will send you some good things to your Chamber, together with the <hi>Bride's Favour,</hi> and there you may drink our Health, if it may stand with your good liking. My Friend (quoth <hi>Hippothadee</hi>) take my Words in the Sence wherein I meaned them, and do not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpret me. When I tell you, <hi>if it please God,</hi> do I to you any wrong there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? Is it an ill Expression? Is it a Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming Clause or Reserve any way scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous unto the World? Do not we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by honour the Lord God Almighty, Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, Pretector and Conserver of all things? Is not that a mean, whereby we do acknowledge him to be the sole Giver of all whatsoever is good? Do not we in that manifest our Faith, that we believe all things to depend upon his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and incomprehensible Bounty? and that without him nothing can be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, nor after its Production be of any
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:46180:450"/>
value, force, or power, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring aid and favour of his assisting Grace? Is it not a canonical and authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Exception, worthy to be premised to all our Undertakings? Is it not expedient that what we propose unto our selves, be still referred to what shall be disposed of by the Sacred Will of God, unto which all things must acquiesce in the Heavens as well as on the Earth? Is not that verily a sanctifying of his Holy Name? My Friend, you shall not be a Cuckold, if it please God, nor shall we need to despair of the knowledge of his good Will and Pleasure herein, as if it were such an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse and mysteriously hidden Secret, that for the clear understanding thereof it were necessary to consult with those of his Celestial Privy Council, or expresly make a Voyage unto the <hi>Empyrean</hi> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where Order is given for the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuating of his most holy Pleasures.</p>
                        <p>The great God hath done us this good, that he hath declared and revealed them to us openly and plainly, and described them in the Holy Bible. There will you find that you shall never be a Cuckold, that is to say, your Wife shall never be a Strumpet, if you make choice of one of a commendable Extraction, descended of honest Parents, and instructed in all
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:46180:451"/>
Piety and Vertue: Such a one as hath not at any time hanted or frequented the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany or Conversation of those that are of corrupt and deprav'd Manners; one loving and fearing God, who taketh a singular delight in drawing near to him by Faith, and the cordial observing of his Sacred Commandments: And finally, one who standing in awe of the Divine Majesty, of the most High, will be loath to offend him, and lose the favourable kindness of his Grace through any defect of Faith, or transgression against the Ordinances of his Holy Law, wherein Adultery is most rigorously forbidden, and a close Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to her Husband alone most strictly and severely enjoyned; yea, in such sort, that she is to cherish, serve and love him above any thing, next to God, that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riteth to be beloved. In the interim, for the better schooling of her in these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, and that the wholsom Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of a Matrimonial Duty may take the deeper Root in her Mind, you must needs carry your self so on your part, and your behaviour is to be such, that you are to go before her in a good Example, by entertaining her unfeigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a Conjugal Amity, by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally approving your self in all your Words and Actions a faithful and discreet Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:46180:451"/>
and by living not only at home, and privately with your own Houshold and Family, but in the face also of all Men, and open view of the World, devotely, vertuously and chastly, as you would have her on her side to deport and demean her self towards you, as becomes a Godly, Loyal and Respectful Wife, who maketh Conscience to keep inviolable the Tie of a Matrimonial Oath.</p>
                        <p>For as that <hi>Looking-glass</hi> is not the best, which is most deck'd with Gold and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, but that which representeth to the Eye the liveliest shapes of Objects set before it: Even so that Wife should not be most esteemed who richest is, and of the noblest Race, but she who fearing God, conforms her self nearest unto the Humour of her Husband.</p>
                        <p>Consider how the <hi>Moon</hi> doth not bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row her Light from <hi>Iupiter, Mars, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> or any other of the Planets; nor yet from any of those Splendid Stars which are set in the spangled Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but from her Husband only, the bright <hi>Sun,</hi> which she receiveth from him more or less, according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his <hi>Aspect,</hi> and variously bestowed Eradiations. Just so should you be a Pattern to your Wife in Vertue, goodly Zeal and true Devotion, that by your
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:46180:452"/>
Radiance in darting on her the <hi>Aspect</hi> of an Exemplary Goodness, she, in your imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, may outshine the Luminaries of all other Women. To this effect you daily must implore God's Grace to the Protection of you both. You would have me then (quoth <hi>Panurge,</hi> twisting the Whiskers of his Beard on either side with the Thumb and Fore-finger of his Left Hand) to espouse and take to Wife the prudent frugal Woman described by <hi>Solomon</hi>: Without all doubt she is dead, and truly to my best remembrance I never saw her; the Lord forgive me. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless I thank you, Father; eat this slice of Marchpane, it will help your Disgestion; then shall you be presented with a Cup of Claret Hypocras, which is right healthful and stomached. Let us proceed.</p>

                           <hi>PAnurge</hi> continuing his Discourse, said, The first word which was spoken by him who guelded the Lubbardly quaffing Monks of <hi>Saussiniac,</hi> after that he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoned Friar <hi>Corcil,</hi> was this, <hi>To the rest.</hi> In like manner, I say, <hi>to the rest.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I beseech you, my good Master <hi>Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibilis,</hi> should <hi>I marry or not?</hi> By the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king pace of my Mule, quoth <hi>Rondibilis,</hi> I know not what Answer to make to this Problem of yours.</p>
                        <p>You say that you feel in you the <hi>prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stings</hi> of Sensuality, by which you are stirred up to Venery. I find in our Faculty of <hi>Medicine,</hi> and we have founded our Opinion therein upon the deliberate Resolution and final Decision of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Platonicks,</hi> that <hi>Carnal Concupiscence</hi> is cooled and quelled five several ways.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="256" facs="tcp:46180:453"/>
                           <hi>First,</hi> By the means of <hi>Wine.</hi> I shall easily believe that, (quoth Friar <hi>Ihon</hi>) for when I am well whitled with the Juyce of the Grape, I care for nothing else so I may sleep. When I say (quoth <hi>Rondi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis</hi>) that <hi>Wine</hi> abateth Lust, my meaning is, <hi>Wine</hi> immoderately taken; for by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperancy proceeding from the exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive drinking of Strong Liquor, there is brought upon the Body of such a Swill-down Bouser a chilness in the Blood, a slackening in the Sinews, a Dissipation of the Generative Seed, a numbness and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betation of the Senses, with a perversive wriness and Convulsion of the Muscles; all which are great Lets and Impediments to the Act of Generation. Hence it is that <hi>Bacchus,</hi> the God of Bibbers, Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Drunkards is most commonly painted Beardless, and clad in a Womans Habit, as a Person altogether Effeminate, or like a libbed Eunuch. <hi>Wine</hi> neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less taken moderately worketh quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Effects, as is implied by the old Proverb, which saith, That <hi>Venus</hi> takes cold when not accompanied with <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Bacchus.</hi> This Opinion is of great Antiquity, as appeareth by the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Diodorus</hi> the <hi>Sicilian,</hi> and confirmed by <hi>Pausanias,</hi> and universally held amongst
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:46180:453"/>
the <hi>Lampsacians,</hi> that <hi>Don Priapos</hi> was the Son of <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Venus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Fervency of Lust is aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by certain <hi>Drugs,</hi> Plants, Herbs and Roots, which make the Taker cold, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leficiated, unfit for, and unable to perform the Act of Generation; as hath been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten experimented in the Water-Lilly, <hi>Heraclea, Agnus Castus,</hi> Willow-twigs, Hemp-stalks, Woodbind, Honey suckle, Tamarisk, Chastree, Mandrake, Bennet, Kecbuglosse, the Skin of a <hi>Hippopatam,</hi> and many other such, which by conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Doses proportioned to the peccant Humour and Constitution of the Patient, being duly and seasonably received with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Body, what by their Elementary Vertues on the one side, and peculiar Properties on the other, do either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numb, mortifie and beclumpse with Cold the prolifick Semence; or scatter and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perse the Spirits, which ought to have gone along with, and conducted the Sperm to the places destinated and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for its reception. Or lastly, Shut up, stop and obstruct the ways, passages and conduits through which the Seed should have been expelled, evacuated and ejected. We have nevertheless of those Ingredients, which being of a contrary Operation, heat the Blood, bend the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:46180:454"/>
Nerves, unite the Spirits, quicken the Senses, strengthen the Muscles, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by rouze up, provoke, excite and inable a Man to the vigorous Accomplishment of the Feat of Amorous Dalliance. I have no need of those, (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) God be thanked, and you my good Master. Howsoever I pray you take no exception or offence at these my words; for what I have said was not out of any ill Will I did bear to you, the Lord he knows.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Ardour of Lechery is very much subdued and mated by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>Labour</hi> and continual Toiling: For by painful Exercises and laborious work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, so great a Dissolution is brought upon the whole Body, that the Blood which runneth alongst the Channels of the Veins thereof, for the Nourishment and Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of each of its Members, hath neither time, leisure nor power to afford the Seminal Resudation, or superfluity of the third Concoction, which Nature most carefully reserves for the conservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Individual, whose Preservation she more heedfully regardeth than the propagating of the Species, and the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication of Humane Kind. VVhence it is, that <hi>Diana</hi> is said to be chast, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she is never idle, but always busied about her Hunting, For the same reason
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:46180:454"/>
was a Camp, or Leaguer of old called <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strum,</hi> as if they would have said <hi>Castum:</hi> because the Soldiers, Wrestlers, Runners, Throwers of the Bar, and other such-like Athletick Champions, as are usually seen in a Military Circumvallation, do unces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly travel and turmoil, and are in a perpetual stir and agitation. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>Hippocrates</hi> also writeth in his Book, <hi>De Aere Aqua &amp; locis:</hi> That in his time there were People in <hi>Scythia</hi> as impotent as Eunuchs, in the discharge of a Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Exploit; because that without any cessation, pause, or respit, they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from off Horseback, or otherways as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siduously employed in some troublesome and molesting Drudgery.</p>
                        <p>On the other part, in opposition and repugnancy hereto, the Philosophers say, <hi>That Idleness is the Mother of Luxury.</hi> When it was asked <hi>Ovid,</hi> Why <hi>Egistus</hi> became an Adulterer? he made no other Answer but this: <hi>Because he was idle.</hi> Who were able to rid the World of Loytring and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziness, might easily frustrate and disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point <hi>Cupid</hi> of all his Designs, Aims, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, and Devices, and so disable and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall him, that his Bow, Quiver, and Darts should from thenceforth be a meer need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Load and Burthen to him: for that it could not then lie in his power to

Least you should think it is not so, be pleased but to contemplate a little the Form, Fashion, and Carriage of a Man exceeding earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set upon some Learned Meditation, and deeply plunged therein, and you shall see how all the Arteries of his Brains are stretched forth, and bent like the String of a Cross-bow, the more promptly, dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously, and copiously to suppeditate, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, and supply him with store of Spirits, sufficient to replenish, and fill up the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles, Seats, Tunnels, Mansions, Rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptacles, and Celluls of the common Sense; of the Imagination, Apprehension, and Fancy; of the Ratiocination, Arguing, and Resolution; as likewise of the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Recordation, and Remembrance; and with great alacrity, nimbleness, and agility to run, pass, and course from the one to the other, through those Pipes, Windings,

Nay, in such a studiously musing Person, you may espy so extravagant Raptures of one, as it were, out of himself, that all his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Faculties for that time will seem to be suspended from each their proper charge and office, and his exteriour Senses to be at a stand. In a word, you cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways choose then think, that he is by an extraordinary Extasie quite transported out of what he was, or should be; and that <hi>Socrates</hi> did not speak improperly, when he said, <hi>That Philosophy was nothing else but a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation upon Death.</hi> This possibly is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why <hi>Democritus</hi> deprived himself of the Sense of Seeing, prizing at a much lower rate the loss of his Sight, than the diminution of his Contemplations; which he frequently had found disturbed by the vagrant, flying-out strayings of his unset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and roving Eyes. Therefore is it, that <hi>Pallas,</hi> the Goddess of Wisdom, Tutress, and Guardianess of such as are diligently

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:46180:460"/>
Nitrosity, figging Itch, wrigling Mordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy, and smarting Salsitude, (for the said Member is altogether sinewy, and of a most quick and lively feeling) their whole Body is shaken and ebrangled, their Senses totally ravished and transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the operations of their Judgment and Understanding utterly confounded, and all disordinate Passions and Perturbations of the Mind thoroughly and absolutely allowed, admitted, and approved of; yea, in such sort, that if Nature had not been so favourable unto them, as to have sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled their Forehead with a little Tincture of Bashfulness and Modesty, you should see them in a so frantick mood run mad after Lechery, and hye apace up and down with hast and Lust, in quest of, and to fix some Chamber-Standard in their <hi>Paphian</hi> Ground, that never did the <hi>Pretides, Mimallonides,</hi> nor <hi>Lyaean Thyads</hi> deport themselves in the time of their <hi>Bacchanalian Festivals,</hi> more shamelesly, or with a so affronted and brazen-faced Impudency; because this terrible <hi>Animal</hi> is knit unto, and hath an Union with all the chief and most principal parts of the Body, as to Anatomists is evident<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let it not here be thought strange that I should call it an <hi>Animal,</hi> seeing therein I do no otherwise than follow and adhere

to the Doctrine of the <hi>Academick</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripatetick</hi> Philosophers. For if a proper Motion be a certain mark and infallible token of the Life and Animation of the Mover, (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> writeth) and that any such thing as <hi>moveth of its self</hi> ought to be held <hi>Animated,</hi> and of a <hi>Living Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>; then assuredly <hi>Plato</hi> with very good reason did give it the Denomination of an <hi>Animal</hi>; for that he perceived and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in it the proper and <hi>self-stirring mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of Suffocation, Precipitation, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rugation, and of Indignation, so extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly violent, that oftentimes by them is taken and removed from the Women all other sense and moving whatsoever, as if she were in a swounding <hi>Lipothymy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numming <hi>Sincop, Epileptick,</hi> Apoplectick Palsey, and true resemblance of a pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced Death.</p>

It is not unknown to me how <hi>Cl.

escaped my notice, how others of that Sect have laboured hardly, yea, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of their Abilities, to demonstrate that it is not a sensitive discerning or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in it of the difference of Wafts and Smells, but meerly a various manner of Vertue and Efficacy, passing forth and flowing from the diversity of odoriferous Substances applied near unto it. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, if you will studiously examine, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously ponder and weigh in <hi>Critolaus</hi>'s Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the strength of their Reasons and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, you shall find that they, not only in this, but in several other matters also of the like nature, have spoken at random, and rather out of an ambitious Envy to check and reprehend their Betters, than for any design to make enquiry into the solid Truth.</p>
                        <p>I will not launch my little Skif any further into the wide Ocean of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute, only will I tell you that the Praise and Commendation is not mean and slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which is due to those honest and good Women, who living chastly and without blame, have had the power and vertue to curb, range and subdue that unbridled, heady and wild <hi>Animal</hi> to an obedient, submissive and obsequious yielding unto Reason. Therefore here will I make an end of my Discourse thereon, when I

shall have told you, that the said <hi>Animal</hi> being once satiated (if it be possible that it can be contented or satisfied) by that Aliment, which Nature hath provided for it out of the Epididymal Store-house of Man, all its former and irregular and disordered Motions are at an end, laid and asswaged; all its vehement and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Longings lulled, pacified and quieted; and all the furious and raging Lusts, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites and Desires thereof appeased, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, calmed and extinguished.

                           <hi>Iupiter</hi> (said <hi>Rondibilis</hi>) forgot the poor Devil <hi>Cuckoldry,</hi> who was then in the Court at <hi>Paris,</hi> very eagerly solliciting a pedling Suit at Law for one of his Vassals and Tenants; within some few days there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, (I have forgot how many) when he got full notice of the Trick, which in his Absence was done unto him, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly desisted from prosecuting Legal Processes, in the behalf of others, full of Sollicitude to pursue after his own business, lest he should be fore-closed: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he appeared personally at the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of the great <hi>Iupiter,</hi> displayed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him the importance of his preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Merits; together with the acceptable Services, which in Obedience to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments he had formerly performed; and therefore, in all humility, begged of him, that he would be pleased not to
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:46180:464"/>
leave him alone amongst all the Sacred Potentates, destitute and void of Honour, Reverence, Sacrifices and festival Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. To this Petition <hi>Iupiter</hi>'s Answer was excusatory, That all the Places and Offices of his House were bestowed. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless so importuned was he by the continual Supplications of Monsieur <hi>Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koldry,</hi> that he, in fine, placed him in the Rank, List, Roll, Rubrick and Catalogue; and appointed Honours, Sacrifices and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stival Rites to be observed on Earth in great Devotion, and tendred to him with Solemnity.</p>
                        <p>The Feast, because there was no void, empty nor vacant place in all the Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, was to be celebrated jointly with, and on the same day that had been conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to the Goddess <hi>Iealousie</hi>: His Power and Dominion should be over Married Folks, especially such as had handsom Wives: His Sacrifices were to be Suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Diffidence, Mistrust, a lowring powt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sullenness, Watchings, Wardings, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchings, Plyings, Explorations, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Way-layings, Ambushes, narrow Observations, and malicious Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings of the Husband's Scouts and Espials of the most privy Actions of their Wives.

honour and worship him; to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate and solemnize his Festival with twice more respect than that of another Saint or Deity, and to immolate unto him with all Sincerity and Alacrity of Heart the above-mentioned Sacrifices and Oblations, under pain of severe Censures, Threatnings, and Comminations of these subsequent Fines, Mulcts, Amerciaments, Penalties and Punishments to be inflicted on the Delinquents; that Monsieur <hi>Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koldry</hi> should never be favourable nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious to them; that he should never help, aid, supply, succour nor grant them any subventitious Furtherance, auxiliary Suffrage, or adminiculary Assistance; that he should never hold in any Reckoning Account or Estimation; that he should never daign to enter within their Houses, neither at the Doors, Windows, nor any other place thereof; that he should never haunt nor frequent their Companies or Conversations; how frequently soever they should invocate him, and call upon his Name; and that not only he should leave and abandon them to rot alone with their Wives in a sempiternal Solitariness, without the benefit of the diversion of any Copesmate or Corrival at all; but should withal shun and eschew them, fly from them, and eternally forsake and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

them as impious Hereticks and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious Persons, according to the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom'd manner of other Gods, towards such as are too slack in offering up the Duties and Reverences which ought to be performed respectively to their Divinities: As is evidently apparent in <hi>Bacchus</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards negligent Vine-dressers; in <hi>Ceres</hi> against idle Plow-men and Tillers of the Ground; in <hi>Pomona</hi> to unworthy Fruite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and Custard-mongers; in <hi>Neptune</hi> towards dissolute Mariners and Sea-faring Men; in <hi>Vulcan</hi> towards loytering Smiths and Forge-men; and so throughout the rest.</p>
                        <p>Now, on the contrary, this infallible Promise was added, that unto all those who should make a <hi>Holy Day</hi> of the above-recited Festival, and cease from all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of worldly Work and Negotiation, lay aside all their own most important occasions, and to be so wretchless, heedless, and careless of what might concern the management of their proper Affairs, as to mind nothing else but a suspicious espying and prying into the secret Deportments of their Wives, and how to koop, shut up, hold at under, and deal cruelly and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steerly with them, by all the Harshness and Hardships that an implacable, and every way inexorable Jealousie can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise

and suggest, conform to the Sacred Ordinances of the afore-mentioned Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and Oblations, he should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually favourable to them, should love them, sociably converse with them, should be Day and Night in their Houses, and never leave them destitute of his Presence.

                        <p>WHEN I was (quoth <hi>Carpalin</hi>) a Whoremaster at <hi>Orleans,</hi> the whole Art of Rhetorick in all its Tropes and Figures, was not able to afford unto me a Colour or Flourish of greater force and
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:46180:467"/>
value; nor could I by any other form or manner of Elocution pitch upon a more perswasive Argument for bringing young beautiful married Ladies into the Snares of Adultery, through alluring and inticing them to tast with me of Amorous Delights, then with a lively Sprightfulness to tell them in down-right terms, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate to them, (with a great shew of Detestation of a Crime so horrid) how their Husbands were jealous. This was none of my Invention: It is written, and we have Laws, Examples, Reasons and daily Experiences confirmative of the same. If this Belief once enter into their Noddles, their Husbands will infallibly be <hi>Cuckolds</hi>; yea, by God, will they, (without swearing) although they should do like <hi>Semiramis, Pasiphae, Egesta,</hi> the Women of the <hi>Isle Mandez</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and other such like Queanish flurting Harlots, mentioned in the Writings of <hi>Herodotus, Strabo,</hi> and such like Puppies.</p>
                        <p>Truly (quoth <hi>Panocrates</hi>) I have heard it related, and it hath been told me for a Verity, that Pope <hi>Ihon</hi> 22. passing on a day through the Abby of <hi>Toucherome,</hi> was in all Humility required and besought by the Abbess, and other discreet Mothers of the said Convent, to grant them an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, by means whereof they might
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:46180:467"/>
confess themselves to one another, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That <hi>Religious</hi> Women were subject to some petty secret Slips and Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which would be a foul and burning shame for them to discover and to reveal to Men, how Sacerdotal soever their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction were: but that they would freelier, more familiarly, and with greater chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, open to each other their Offences, Faults, and Escapes, under the Seal of Confession. There is not any thing (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the Pope) fitting for you to impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate of me, which I would not most willingly condescend unto: but I find one inconvenience; you know, <hi>Confession should be kept secret:</hi> and Women are not able to do so. Exceeding well (quoth they) most Holy Father, and much more closely then the best of Men.</p>
                        <p>The said Pope on the very same day, gave them in keeping a pretty Box, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he purposely caused a little Linnet to be put, willing them very gently and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously to lock it up in some sure and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den place; and promising them, by the <hi>Faith of a Pope,</hi> that he should yield to their Request, if they would keep secret what was enclosed within that deposited Box: enjoyning them withal, not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume one way nor other, directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, to go about the opening thereof,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:46180:468"/>
under pain of the highest Ecclesiastical Censure, Eternal Excommunication. The Prohibition was no sooner made, but that they did all of them boyl with a most ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent desire to know, and see what kind of thing it was that was within it: they thought long already, that the Pope was not gone, to the end they might joyntly, with the more leisure and ease apply themselves to the Box-opening Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.</p>
                        <p>The Holy Father, after he had given them his Benediction, retired and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himself to the Pontifical Lodgings of his own Palace; but he was hardly gone three Steps from without the Gates of their <hi>Cloyster,</hi> when the good Ladies throngingly, and as in a hudled Crowd, pressing hard on the Backs of one another, ran thrusting and shoving who should be first at the setting open of the forbidden Box, and descrying of the <hi>Quod latitat</hi> within.</p>
                        <p>On the very next day thereafter, the Pope made them another Visit, of a full design, purpose, and intention (as they imagined) to dispatch the Grant of their sought and wished-for Indulgence: but before he would enter into any Chat or Communing with them, he commanded the Casket to be brought unto him: it
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:46180:468"/>
was done so accordingly; but by your leave, the Bird was no more there. Then was it, that the Pope did represent to their <hi>Maternities,</hi> how hard a matter and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult it was for them to keep Secrets reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them in <hi>Confession,</hi> unmanifested to the Ears of others; seeing for the space of Four and twenty hours they were not able to lay up in secret a Box, which he had highly recommended to their Discretion, Charge and Custody.</p>

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:46180:469"/>
spoke and spoke again; yea, within few hours she spoke so loud, so much, so fiercely, and so long, that her poor Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band returned to the same Physitian for a Recipe to make her hold her Peace: There are (quoth the <hi>Physician</hi>) many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Remedies in our Art, to make dumb Women speak, but there are none, that ever I could learn therein, to make them silent. The only Cure which I have found out, is their Husband's <hi>Deafness.</hi> The Wretch became within few Weeks there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, by Vertue of some Drugs, Charms or Enchantments, which the <hi>Physician</hi> had prescribed unto him, so <hi>deaf,</hi> that he could not have heard the Thundring of Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred Canons at a <hi>Salve.</hi> His Wife perceiving, that indeed he was as <hi>deaf</hi> as a Door-nail, and that her Scold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was but in vain, sith that he heard her not, she grew stark mad.</p>
                        <p>Some time after, the Doctor asked for his Fee of the Husband; who answered, That truly he was <hi>deaf,</hi> and so was not able to understand what the tenure of his Demand might be. Whereupon the Leech bedusted him with a little, I know not what, sort of Powder; which rendred him a Fool immediately: so great was the stultificating Vertue of that strange kind of pulverized Dose. Then did this

Fool of a Husband, and his mad Wife joyn together, falling on the Doctor and the Surgeon, did so scratch, bethwack, and bang them, that they were left half dead upon the place, so furious were the Blows which they received: I never in my Life-time laughed so much, as at the acting of that Buffoonry.</p>

Panurge</hi> exclaimeth, that those Answers are full of Repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Contradictions, protesting that he understands them not, nor what it is that can be meaned by them. If I be not mistaken, quoth <hi>Gargantua,</hi> I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it very well: The Answer is not unlike to that which was once made by a Philosopher in ancient times, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing interrogated, if he had a Woman,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:46180:472"/>
whom they named him, to his Wife; <hi>I have her,</hi> quoth he, but <hi>she hath not me</hi>; possessing her, by her I am not possest. Such another Answer, quoth <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> was once made by a certain bouncing Wench of <hi>Sparta,</hi> who being asked, if at any time she had had to do with a Man? <hi>No,</hi> (quoth she) <hi>but sometimes Men have to do with me.</hi> Well then (quoth <hi>Rondibilis</hi>) let it be a <hi>Neuter</hi> in Physick; as when we say a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is <hi>Neuter,</hi> when it is neither sick nor healthful; and a <hi>Mean</hi> in Philosophy; <hi>that</hi> by an Abnegation of both Extreams, and <hi>this</hi> by the Participation of the one and of the other: Even as when luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm Water is said to be both hot and cold; or rather, as when Time makes the Partition, and equally divides betwixt the two, a while in the one, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while, as long, in the other opposite extremity. The holy Apostle, (quoth <hi>Hippothadee</hi>) seemeth, as I conceive, to have more clearly explained this Point, when he said, <hi>Those that are married, let them be as if they were not married</hi>; and those that have Wives, let them be as if they had no Wives at all. I thus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) the having and not having of a Wife. To have a Wife, is to have the use of her in such a way as Nature hath ordained, which is for the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:46180:472"/>
Aid, Society and Solace of Man, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating of his Race: To have no Wife is not to be uxorious, play the Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, and be lazy about her, and not for her sake to distain the Lustre of that Affection which Man owes to God; or yet for her to leave those Offices and Duties which he owes unto his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, unto his Friends and Kindred; or for her to abandon and forsake his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Studies, and other businesses of Account, to wait still on her Will, her Beck, and her Buttocks. If we be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in this Sense to take having and not having of a Wife, we shall indeed find no Repugnancy nor Contradiction in the Terms at all.</p>

                        <p>YOU speak wisely, quoth <hi>Panurge,</hi> if the Moon were green Cheese; such a Tale once piss'd my Goose: I do not think but that I am let down into that dark Pit, in the lowermost bottom where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the truth was hid, according to the saying of <hi>Heraclitus.</hi> I see no whit at all, I hear nothing, understand as little, my Senses are altogether dull'd and blunted; truly I do very shrewdly suspect that I am enchanted. I will now alter the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer style of my Discourse, and talk to him in another Strain. Our trusty Friend, stir not, nor imburse any; but let us va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Chance, and speak without Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctives: I see already that these loose and ill-joined Members of an Eunuciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on do vex, trouble and perplex you.</p>

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:46180:480"/>
eating his Bread, after he had by Parcels kept it a while above the Reek and Steam of a fat Goose on the Spit, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a great Fire, and found it so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smoaked with the Vapour, to be savoury; which the Cook observing, took no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, till after having ravined his Penny Loaf, whereof no Morsel had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smoakified, he was about discamping and going away; but by your leave, as the Fellow thought to have departed thence shot-free, the Master-Cook laid hold upon him by the Gorget, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed payment for the Smoak of his Roast-meat. The Porter answered, that he had sustained no loss at all; that by what he had done there was no Diminution made of the Flesh, that he had taken nothing of his, and that therefore he was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to him in any thing: As for the Smoak in question, that, although he had not been there, it would howsoever have been evaporated: besides that, before that time it had never been seen nor heard, that Roast-meat Smoak was sold upon the Streets of <hi>Paris.</hi> The Cook hereto replied, That he was not obliged nor any way bound to feed and nourish for nought a Porter whom he had never seen before with the Smoak of his Roast-meat; and thereupon swore, that if he
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:46180:481"/>
would not forthwith content and satisfie him with present Payment for the Repast which he had thereby got, that he would take his crooked Staves from off his Back; which instead of having Loads thereafter laid upon them, should serve for Fuel to his Kitchin Fires. Whilst he was going about so to do, and to have pulled them to him by one of the bottom Rungs, which he had caught in his Hand, the sturdy Porter got out of his Gripes, drew forth the knotty Cudgel, and stood to his own Defence. The Altercation waxed hot in Words, which moved the gaping Hoydons of the sottish <hi>Parisians</hi> to run from all parts thereabouts to see what the issue would be of that babling Strife and Contention. In the interim of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute, to very good purpose <hi>Seiny Ihon</hi> the <hi>Fool</hi> and Citizen of <hi>Paris,</hi> hapned to be there, whom the Cook perceiving, said to the Porter, Wilt thou refer and submit unto the noble <hi>Seiny Ihon,</hi> the Decision of the Difference and Controversie which is betwixt us? Yes, by the Blood of a Goose, answered the Porter, I am content. <hi>Seiny Ihon</hi> the <hi>Fool,</hi> finding that the Cook and Porter had compromised the Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Variance and Debate to the Discretion of his Award and Arbitriment; after that the Reasons on either side

whereupon was grounded the mutual fierceness of their brawling Jar had been to the full displayed and laid open before him, commanded the Porter to draw out of the Fab of his Belt a piece of Money, if he had it. Whereupon the Porter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately without delay, in Reverence to the Authority of such a Judicious Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, put the tenth part of a Silver <hi>Phillip</hi> into his hand. This little <hi>Phillip Seiny Ihon</hi> took, then set it on his Left Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to try by feeling if it was of a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient weight; after that, laying it on the palm of his hand he made it ring and tingle, to understand by the Ear if it was of a good Alloy in the Metal where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it was composed: Thereafter he put it to the Ball or Apple of his Left Eye, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore by the sight if it was well stamped and marked; all which being done, in a profound Silence of the whole doltish People, who were there Spectators of this Pageantry, to the great Hope of the Cooks, and Despair of the Porters Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency in the Suit that was in agitation, he finally caused the Porter to make it sound several times upon the Stall of the Cooks Shop.

                        <p>ON the Day following, precisely at the Hour appointed, <hi>Pantagruel</hi> came to <hi>Merlingues:</hi> At his Arrival the Presidents, Senators, and Counsellors prayed him to do them the Honour to enter in with them, to hear the Decision of all the Causes, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and Reasons, which <hi>Bridlegoose</hi> in his own Defence would produce, why he had pronounced a certain Sentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Subsidy-Assessor, <hi>Toucheronde</hi>; which did not seem very equitable to that <hi>Centumviral Court. Pantagruel</hi> very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly condescended to their desire, and accordingly entring in, found <hi>Bridlegoose</hi> sitting within the middle of the Inclosure of the said Court of Justice; who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon the coming of <hi>Pantrgruel,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the Senatorian Members of that worshipful Judicatory, arose, went
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:46180:486"/>
to the Bar, had his Indictment read, and for all his Reasons, Defences, and Excuses, answered nothing else, but that he was become Old, and that his Sight of late was very much failed, and become dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then it was wont to be; instancing therewithal many Miseries and Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which Old Age bringeth along with it, and are concomitant to wrinkled Elders; which not, <hi>par Archi d'</hi> LXXVI.C. <hi>tanta:</hi> by reason of which Infirmity he was not able so distinctly and clearly to discern the <hi>Points</hi> and <hi>Blots</hi> of the <hi>Dice,</hi> as formerly he had been accustomed to do: whence it might very well have happened, said he, as old dim-sighted <hi>Isaac</hi> took <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> for <hi>Esau,</hi> that I after the same manner, at the Decision of Causes and Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies in Law, should have been mistaken in taking a <hi>Quatre</hi> for a <hi>Cinque,</hi> or <hi>Tre</hi> for a <hi>Deuce:</hi> This, I beseech your Worship (quoth he) to take into your serious Consideration, and to have the more favourable Opinion of my Uprightness, (notwithstanding the <hi>Prevarication</hi> whereof I am accused, in the matter of <hi>Toucherondy</hi>'s Sentence) that at the time of that Decrees pronouncing, I only had made use of my small <hi>Dice</hi>; and your Worships (said he) knew very well, how by the most Authentick Rules of the Law, it is provided, That <hi>the Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> They are useful and steadable to me, (even as unto your other Worships) in lieu of some other honest and healthful <hi>Exercise.</hi> The late Master <hi>Othoman Vadat,</hi> a prime Physician, as you would say, <hi>Cod. de Comit. &amp; Archi.

<pb n="335" facs="tcp:46180:492"/>
the Ground, fine Singer in a Church-Desk, of good Repute and Credit, and older than the most aged of all your Worships; who was wont to say, that he had seen the great and goodly Good Man the <hi>Council of Lateran,</hi> with his wide and broad brimmed Red Hat: As also, that he had beheld and looked upon the fair and beautiful <hi>Pragmatical Sanction,</hi> his Wife, with her huge Rosary or Pate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notrian Chapelet of Jeat-beads, hanging at a large Sky-coloured Ribbond.

Whereupon <hi>Trinquamelle</hi> bid them withdraw from the Court; which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly was done: and then directed his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse to <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> after this manner. It is fitting (most illustrious Prince) not only by reason of the deep Obligations, wherein this present <hi>Parliament,</hi> together with the whole Marquisate of <hi>Merlingues,</hi>

stand bound to your Royal Highness, for the innumerable Benefits, which as effects of <hi>meer Grace,</hi> they have received from your Incomperable Bounty; but for that excellent Wit also, prime Judgment, and admirable Learning wherewith Almighty God, the Giver of all Good Things, hath most richly qualified and endowed you, we tender and present unto you the Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of this new, strange, and Paradoxical Case of <hi>Bridlegoose</hi>; who in your presence, to your both hearing and seeing, hath plainly confessed his final judging and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminating of Suits of Law, by the meer Chance and Fortune of the <hi>Dice:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do we beseech you, that you may be pleased to give Sentence therein, as unto you shall seem most just and equitable. To this <hi>Pantagruel</hi> answered: <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> It is not unknown to you, how my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is somewhat remote from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of deciding Law-Controversies; yet seeing you are pleased to do me the Honour to put that Task upon me, instead of undergoing the Office of a <hi>Iudge,</hi> I will become your humble <hi>Supplicant:</hi> I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> in this <hi>Bridlegoose,</hi> several things, which induce me to represent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, that it is my Opinion he should be pardoned. In the <hi>First place,</hi> his <hi>Old Age. Secondly,</hi> His <hi>Simplicity:</hi> To both
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:46180:502"/>
which Qualities our Statute and Common Laws, Civil and Municipal together, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low many excuses for any slips or escapes, which through the invincible Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of either, have been inconsiderately stumbled upon by a Person so qualified. <hi>Thirdly, Gentlemen,</hi> I must needs display before you another Case, which in Equity and Justice maketh much for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of <hi>Bridlegoose:</hi> to wit, that this one, sole, and single fault of his, ought to be quite forgotten, abolished, and swallowed up, by that immense and vast Ocean of Just Dooms and Sentences, which hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath given and pronounced: his Demeanours for these Forty Years and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that he hath been a Judge, having been so evenly ballanced in the Scales of Uprightness, that Envy itself, till now, could not have been so impudent as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse and twit him with any Act worthy of a Check or Reprehension: As if a Drop of the Sea were thrown into the <hi>Loire,</hi> none could perceive, or say, that by this single Drop, the whole River should be salt and brackish.</p>
                        <p>Truly, it seemeth unto me, that in the whole Series of <hi>Bridlegoose</hi>'s Juridical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, there hath been, I know not what, of extraordinary savouring of the unspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Benignity of God, that all those his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:46180:502"/>
Sentences, Awards, and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, have been confirmed and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of by your selves, in this your own Venerable and <hi>Sovereign Court:</hi> for it is usual (as you know well) with him whose ways are inscrutable, to manifest his own ineffable Glory, in blunting the perspicacy of the Eyes of the Wise, in weakning the Strength of potent Oppressors, in depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Pride of rich Extortioners, and in erecting, comforting, protecting, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting, upholding, and shoaring up the poor, feeble, humble, silly, and foolish Ones of the Earth. But waving all these matters, I shall only beseech you, not by the Obligations which you pretend to owe to my Family, for which I thank you; but for that constant and unfeigned Love and Affection which you have always found in me, both on this and on the other side of <hi>Loire,</hi> for the Maintenance and Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of your Places, Offices, and Dignities, that for this one time, you would pardon and forgive him, upon these two Conditions: <hi>First,</hi> That he sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie, or put a sufficient Surety for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the Party wronged by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice of the Sentence in question: for the fulfilment of this Article, I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide sufficiently. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> That for his subsidiary Aid in the weighty Charge
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:46180:503"/>
of Administrating Justice, you would be pleased to appoint, and assign unto him some pretty, little, vertuous Counseller, younger, learneder, and wiser then he, by the Square and Rule of whose Advice he may regulate, guide, temper and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in times coming all his Judiciary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedures, or otherways, if you intend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally to depose him from his Office, and to deprive him altogether of the State and Dignity of a Judge, I shall cordially intreat you to make a Present and free Gift of him to me, who shall find in my Kingdoms Charges and Employments e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough wherewith to imbusie him, for the bettering of his own Fortunes, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of my Service. In the mean time, I implore the Creator, Saviour and Sanctifyer of all good things, in their Grace, Mercy and Kindness to preserve you all now and evermore, World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end.</p>
                        <p>These Words thus spoken, <hi>Pantagruel</hi> vayling his Cap, and making a Leg with such a Majestick Garb as became a Person of his paramount Degree and Eminency, farewell'd <hi>Trinquamelle</hi> the President, and Master Speaker of that <hi>Merlinguesian</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, took his leave of the whole Court, and went out of the Chamber; at the Door whereof finding <hi>Panurge, Epistemon,</hi>
                           <pb n="357" facs="tcp:46180:503"/>
Friar <hi>Ihon,</hi> and others, he forthwith at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by them, walked to the utter Gate, where all them immediately took Horse to return towards <hi>Gargantua. Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel</hi> by the way related to them from point to point, the manner of <hi>Bridlegoose</hi>'s sententiating Differences at Law. Friar <hi>Ihon</hi> said, that he had seen <hi>Peter Dandin,</hi> and was acquainted with him at that time when he sojourned in the Monastery of <hi>Fontaine le Conte,</hi> under the Noble Abbot <hi>Ardillon. Gymnast</hi> likeways affirmed, that he was in the Tent of the Grand <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> Cavallier <hi>de Cressie,</hi> when the <hi>Gascon,</hi> after his Sleep, made answer to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturer. <hi>Panurge</hi> was somewhat incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous in the matter of believing, that it was morally possible. <hi>Bridlegoose</hi> should have been for such a long space of time so continually fortunate in that <hi>Aleatory</hi> way of deciding Law Debates. <hi>Epistemon</hi> said to <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> Such another Story, not much unlike to that, in all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances thereof, is vulgarly reported of the <hi>Provost</hi> of <hi>Montlehery.</hi> In good sooth, such a Perpetuity of good Luck is to be wondred at. To have hit right twice or thrice in a Judgment so given by Hap-ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> might have fallen out well enough, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially in Controversies that were am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous, intricate, abstruse, perplexed and obscure.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. XLIV. How Pantagruel relateth a strange Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the Perplexity of Humane Iudgment.</head>
                        <p>SEeing you talk (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) of dark, difficult, hard and knotty De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, I will tell you of one controverted before <hi>Cneius Dolobella,</hi> Proconsul in <hi>Asia.</hi> The Case was this.</p>
                        <p>A Wife in <hi>Smyrna</hi> had of her first Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band a Child named <hi>Abece</hi>; he dying, she after the expiring of a Year and Day, married again, and to her Second Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band bore a Boy called <hi>Edege:</hi> A pretty long time thereafter it happened (as you know the Affection of Step-fathers and Step-dams is very rare, towards the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the first Fathers and Mothers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased) that this Husband, with the help of his Son <hi>Edege,</hi> secretly, wittingly, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and treacherously murthered <hi>Abece.</hi> The Woman came no sooner to get Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Fact, that it might not go unpunished, she caused kill them both,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:46180:504"/>
to revenge the Death of her first Son. She was Apprehended and carried before <hi>Cneius Dolobella,</hi> in whose Presence, she, without dissembling any thing, confessed all that was laid to her Charge; yet alledged that she had both Right and Reason on her side for the killing of them. Thus was the state of the Question. He found the business so dubious and intricate, that he knew not what to determin therein, nor which of the Parties to incline to. On the one hand, it was an execrable Crime to cut off at once both her Second Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and her Son. On the other hand, the Cause of the Murther seemed to be so natural, as to be grounded upon the Law of Nations, and the rational Instinct of all the People of the World; seeing they two together had feloniously and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therously destroyed her first Son. Not that they had been in any manner of way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wronged, outraged or injured by him, but out of an avaricious Intent to possess his Inheritance. In this doubtful Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary and Uncertainty what to pitch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he sent to the <hi>Areopagites</hi> then sitting at <hi>Athens,</hi> to learn and obtain their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Judgment. That Judicious Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate very sagely perpending the Reasons of his Perplexity, sent him word, to sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon her personally to compear before
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:46180:505"/>
him, a precise Hundred Years thereafter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to answer to some Interrogatories touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certain Points, which were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Verbal Defence: Which Resolution of theirs did import, that it was in their Opinion a so difficult and inextricable a matter, that they knew not what to say or judge therein. Who had decided that Plea by the Chance and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the <hi>Dice,</hi> could not have erred nor awarded amiss on which side soever he had past his casting and condemnatory Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: If against the Woman, she deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Punishment for usurping Sovereign Authority, by taking that Vengeance at her own hand, the inflicting whereof was only competent to the Supream Power, to administer Justice in Criminal Cases: If for her, the just Resentment of a so atrocious Injury done unto her, in mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering her innocent Son, did fully excuse and vindicate her of any Trespass or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence about that particular committed by her. But this continuation of <hi>Bridlegoose</hi> for so many years, still hitting the Nail on the Head, never missing the Mark, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways judging aright, by the meer throwing of the <hi>Dice,</hi> and the Chance thereof, is that which most astonisheth and amazeth me. To answer (quoth <hi>Epistemon</hi>) categorically to that which you wonder at, I must ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously confess and avow that I cannot; yet
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:46180:505"/>
conjecturally to guess at the reason of it, I would refer the Cause of that marvelously long continued happy Success in the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary Results of his Definitive Sentences to the favourable <hi>Aspect</hi> of the Heavens, and Benignity of the <hi>Intelligences</hi>; who, out of their love to Goodness, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving contemplated the pure Simplicity and sincere Unfeignedness of Judge <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlegoose</hi> in the acknowledgment of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abilities, did regulate that for him by Chance, which by the profoundest Act of his maturest Deliberation he was not able to reach unto. That likeways which possibly made him to diffide in his own Skill and Capacity, notwithstanding his being an expert and understanding Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, for any thing that I know to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, was the Knowledge and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which he had of the Antenomies, Contrarieties, Antilogies, Contradictions, Traversings and Thwartings of Laws, Customs, Edicts, Statutes, Orders and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, in which dangerous Oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Equity and Justice being structured and founded on either of the opposite Terms, and a Gap being thereby opened for the ushering in of Injustice and Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, through the various Interpretations of Self ended Lawyers, being assuredly perswaded that the Infernal Calumniator,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:46180:506"/>
who frequently transformeth himself into the likeness of a Messenger or Angel of Light, maketh use of these cross Glosses and Expositions in the Mouths and Pens of his Ministers and Servants, the perverse Advocates, bribing Judges, Law-monging Attorneys, prevaricating Counsellors, and other such like Law-wrestling Members of a Court of Justice, to turn by those means Black to White, Green to Grey, and what is Streight to a Crooked ply; for the more expedient doing whereof these <hi>Diabolical</hi> Ministers make both the Pleading Parties believe that their Cause is just and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; for it is well known that there is no Cause how bad soever, which doth not find an Advocate to patrocinate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it, else would there be no Process in the World, no Suits at Law, nor Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at the Bar. He did in these Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, as I conceive, most humbly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the Direction of his Judicial Proceedings to the upright Judge of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, God Almighty; did submit himself to the Conduct and Guideship of the blessed Spirit, in the Hazard and Perplexity of the Definitive Sentence; and by this <hi>Alea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> Lot, did as it were implore and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the Divine Decree of his <hi>Good Will</hi> and Pleasure, in stead of that which we call the <hi>Final Iudgment of a Court.</hi> To
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:46180:506"/>
this effect, to the better attaining to his purpose, which was to judge righteously, he did in my Opinion throw and turn the <hi>Dice,</hi> to the end, that by the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence aforesaid, the best <hi>Chance</hi> might fall to him whose Action was uprightest, and backed with greatest Reason; in doing whereof he did not stray from the Sence of <hi>Talmudists,</hi> who say that there is so little harm in that manner of searching the Truth, that in the Anxiety and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexedness of Humane Wits, God often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times manifesteth the Secret Pleasure of his Divine Will.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, I will neither think nor say, nor can I believe, that the unstreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is so irregular, or the Corruption so evident, of those of the Parliament of <hi>Mirlingois</hi> in <hi>Mirlingues,</hi> before whom <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlegoose</hi> was Arraigned for Prevarication, that they will maintain it to be a worse Practice to have the Decision of a Suit at Law referred to the Chance and Hazard of a Throw of the <hi>Dice,</hi> hab nab, or luck as it will, than to have it remitted to, and past by the Determination of those whose <hi>Hands</hi> are full of <hi>Blood,</hi> and Hearts of wry Affections. Besides that, their principal Direction in all Law-matters comes to their Hands from one <hi>Tribonian,</hi> a wicked, miscreant, barbarous, faithless
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:46180:507"/>
and perfidious Knave, so pernicious, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, avaricious and perverse in his ways, that it was his ordinary custom to sell Laws, Edicts, Declarations, Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Ordinances, as at an Outroop or Putsale, to him who offered most for them. Thus did he shape Measures for the Pleaders, and cut their Morsels to them by and out of these little Parcels, Fragments, Bits, Scantlings and Shreds of the Law now in use, altogether conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, suppressing, disannulling and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing the remainder, which did make for the total Law; fearing that if the whole Law were made manifest and laid open to the knowledge of such as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed in it, and the Learned Books of the Ancient <hi>Doctors</hi> of the Law, upon the Exposition of the <hi>Twelve Tables</hi> and <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian</hi> Edicts, his villanous Pranks, Naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness and vile Impiety should come to the publick notice of the World. Therefore were it better in my Conceit, that is to say, less inconvenient, that Parties at Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance in any Juridicial Case, should in the dark march upon Caltropes, then to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Determination of what is their Right to such unhallowed Sentences and horrible Decrees: As <hi>Cato</hi> in his time wished and advised, that every Judiciary Court should be paved with Caltropes.</p>

Panurge</hi> at his Arrival gave him a Hogs Bladder, puffed up with Wind, and resounding, because of the hard Pease that were within it: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over he did present him with a guilt Wooden Sword, a hollow Budget made of a Tortoise shell, an Osier Watled Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-Bottle full of <hi>Briton</hi> Wine, and Five and Twenty Apples of the Orchard of <hi>Blanduc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>side, took the Bladder in his Hand, ate some few of the Apples, and drunk up all the Wine <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi> very wistly and heedfully looking upon him, said, I never yet saw a Fool,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:46180:508"/>
(and I have seen ten thousand Franks worth of that kind of Cattle) who did not love to drink heartily, and by good long Draughts. When <hi>Triboulet</hi> had done with his Drinking, <hi>Panurge</hi> laid out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and exposed the Sum of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, wherein he was to require his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in eloquent and choicely-sorted Terms, adorned with Flourishes of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick. But before he had altogether done, <hi>Triboulet</hi> with his Fist gave him a bouncing Whirret between the Shoulders, rendred back into his Hand again the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty Bottle, filipped and flirted him on the Nose with the Hogs Bladder; and lastly, for a final resolution, shaking and wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his Head strongly and disorderly, he answered nothing else but this, <hi>By God, God; mad Fool, beware the Monk: Buzan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say, Hornepipe.</hi> These Words thus finished, he slipped himself out of the Company, went aside, and ratling the Bladder, took a huge Delight in the Melody of the rickling, crackling noise of the Pease; after which time it lay not in the power of them all to draw out of his Chaps the Articulate Sound of one Syllable; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that when <hi>Panurge</hi> went about to interrogate him further, <hi>Triboulet</hi> drew his Wooden Sword, and would have stuck him therewith. I have fished fair now,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:46180:508"/>
(quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) and brought my Pigs to a fine Market. Have I not got a brave Determination of all my Doubts, and a Responce in all things agreeable to the Oracle that gave it? He is a great <hi>Fool</hi> that is not to be denied; yet is he a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Fool</hi> who brought him hither to me. That Bolt, quoth <hi>Carpalin,</hi> levels point blank at me; but of the three I am the greatest <hi>Fool,</hi> who did impart the Secret of my Thoughts to such an Idiot Ass and Native Ninny.</p>
                        <p>Without putting our selves to any stir or trouble in the least, (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) let us maturely and seriously consider and perpend the Gestures and Speech which he hath made and uttered: In them veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably (quoth he) have I remarked and observed some excellent and notable My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries; yea, of such important and worth and weight, that I shall never henceforth be astonished, nor think strange, why the <hi>Turks</hi> with a great deal of Worship and Reverence, Honour and Respect Natural Fools, equally with their Primest Doctors, Mufties, Divines and Prophets. Did not you take heed (quoth he) a little before he opened his Mouth to speak, what a shog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shaking and wagging his Head did keep? By the approved Doctrine of the ancient Philosophers, the customary Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:46180:509"/>
of the most expert Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and the received Opinions of the learnedest Lawyers, such a brangling A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation and Moving should by us all be judged to proceed from, and be quickned and suscitated by the coming and Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prophetizing and Fatielical Spirit, which entring briskly, and on a sudden, into a shallow Receptacle of a debil Substance (for as you know, and as the Proverb shews it, <hi>a little Head containeth not much Brains</hi>) was the cause of that Commotion. This is conform to what is avouched by the most skilful Physicians, when they affirm, that Shakings and Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings fall upon the Members of a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Body, partly because of the Heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and violent Impetuosity of the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and Load that is carried, and other part, by reason of the Weakness and Imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillity that is in the vertue of the bearing Organ: A manifest Example whereof ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in those, who fasting, are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to carry to their Head a great Goblet full of Wine without a trembling and a shaking in the Hand that holds it.

                           <hi>Lampridius</hi> also testifieth, that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Heliogabulus,</hi> to acquire unto himself the Reputation of a <hi>Sooth-sayer,</hi> did, on several Holy Days of prime Solemnity, in the Presence of the Fanatick Rabble, make the Head of his <hi>Idol,</hi> by some slight within the Body thereof, publickly to shake. <hi>Plautus,</hi> in his <hi>Asserie,</hi> declareth likeways, that <hi>Saurius,</hi> whithersoever he walked like one quite distracted of his Wits, keepeth such a furious lolling and mad-like shaking of his Head, that he commonly affrighted those who casually met with him in his Way. The said Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in another place shewing a Reason why <hi>Charmides</hi> shook and brangled his Head, assevered that he was transported, and in an Extasie. <hi>Catullus</hi> after the same manner maketh mention in his <hi>Berecyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia</hi> and <hi>Atys,</hi> of the place wherein the <hi>Menades, Bacchical</hi> Women, She Priests of the <hi>Lyaean</hi> God, and demented Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesses, carrying Ivy Boughs in their hands, did shake their Heads. As in the like case amongst the <hi>Gauls,</hi> the guelded Priests of <hi>Cybele</hi> were wont to do in the celebrating of some Festivals, which according to the sense of the ancient Theologues, have from thence had their Denomination; for <gap reason="foreign">

about, shake the Head, and play the part of one that is wry-necked.</p>
                        <p>Semblably <hi>Titus Livius</hi> writeth, that in the Solemnization time of the <hi>Bacchana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Fobedayes at <hi>Rome,</hi> both Men and Women seemed to Prophetize and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticinate, because of an affected kind of wagging of the Head, shrugging of the Shoulders, and Jectigation of the whole Body, which they used then most pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually. For the common Voice of the Philosophers, together with the Opinion of the People, asserteth for an irrefraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Truth, that Vaticination is seldom by the Heavens bestowed on any, without the Concomitancy of a little Phrensie, and a Head shaking, not only when the said presaging Vertue is infused, but when the Person also therewith inspired declareth and manifesteth it unto others. The Learned Lawyer <hi>Iulien,</hi> being asked on a time, if that Slave might be truly esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be healthful and in a good plight, who had not only convers'd with some fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, maniack and enraged People, but in their Company had also prophesied, yet without a Noddle-shaking Concussion, answered, That seeing there was no Head-wagging at the time of his Predictions, he might be held for sound and compotent enough. Is it not daily seen how School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:46180:510"/>
Teachers, Tutors and Instructors of Children, shake the Heads of their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, (as one would do a Pot in holding it by the Lugs) that by this Erection, Vellication, stretching and pulling their Ears, (which according to the Doctrine of the sage <hi>Egyptians,</hi> is a Member consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Memory</hi>) they may stir them up to recollect their scatter'd Thoughts, bring home those Fancies of theirs, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have been extravagantly roaming abroad upon strange and uncouth Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and totally range their Judgments, which possibly by disordinate Affections have been made wild, to the Rule and Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tean of a wise, discreet, vertuous and Philosophical Discipline: All which <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> acknowledgeth to be true, in the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glement of <hi>Apollo Cynthius.</hi>

                        <p>HE says you are a <hi>Fool</hi>; and what kind of <hi>Fool?</hi> A <hi>mad</hi> Fool, who in your old Age would enslave your self to the Bondage of Matrimony, and shut your Pleasures up within a Wedlock, whose Key some Ruffian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> carries in his Codpiece. He says furthermore, <hi>beware</hi> of the <hi>Monk.</hi> Upon mine Honour, it gives me in my mind, that you will be cuckold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a <hi>Monk.</hi> Nay, I will engage mine Honour, which is the most precious Pawn I could have in my Possession, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I were sole and peaceable Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator over all <hi>Europe, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> that if you marry, you will surely be one of the Horned Brotherhood of <hi>Vulcan.</hi> Hereby may you perceive how much I do attribute to the wise <hi>Foolery</hi> of our Morosoph <hi>Triboulet.</hi> The other Oracles and Responses did in the general prognosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate you a Cuckold, without descending
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:46180:511"/>
so near to the point of a particular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, as to pitch upon what Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, amongst the several sorts of Men, he should profess who is to be the Copes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of your Wife, and Hornifyer of your proper self. Thus noble <hi>Triboulet</hi> tells it us plainly, from whose Words we may gather with all ease imaginary, that your Cuckoldry is to be infamous, and so much the more scandalous, that your Conjugal Bed will be incestuously conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated with the Filthiness of a <hi>Monkery</hi> Lecher. Moreover he says, that you will be the <hi>Hornepipe of Buzansay.</hi> That is to say, well horned, hornified and cornuted: And as <hi>Triboulet</hi>'s Unkle asked from <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth, for a younger Brother of his own who lived at <hi>Blois,</hi> the <hi>Hornepipes</hi> of <hi>Buzansay,</hi> for the Organ Pipes, through the mistake of one Word for another: Even so, whilst you think to marry a wise, humble, calm, discreet and honest Wife, you shall unhappily stumble upon one witless, proud, lowd, obstreperous, bawling, clamourous, and more unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant than any <hi>Buzansay-hornepipe.</hi> Consider withal, how he flirted you on the Nose with the <hi>Bladder,</hi> and gave you a sound thumping Blow with his Fist upon the ridge of the Back. This denotates and presageth, that you shall be banged, beaten
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:46180:512"/>
and filipped by her; and that also she will steal of your Goods from you, as you stole the Hogs Bladder from the little Boys of <hi>Vaubreton.</hi> Plat contrary (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) not that I would impudently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt my self from being a Vassal in the Territory of <hi>Folly</hi>; I hold of that Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and am subject thereto, I confess it; and why should I not? for the whole World is <hi>foolish.</hi> In the old <hi>Lorrain</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage <hi>(fou</hi> for <hi>oou) All</hi> and <hi>Fool</hi> were the same thing. Besides it is avouched by <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> that infinite is the number of <hi>Fools</hi>: From an Infinity nothing can be deducted or abated; nor yet by the Testimony of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> can any thing thereto be added or subjoyned. Therefore were I a <hi>mad Fool,</hi> if being a <hi>Fool</hi> I should not hold my self a Fool. After the same manner of speaking, we may averr the number of the mad and enraged Folks to be infinite. <hi>Avicenne</hi> maketh no Bones to assert, that the several kinds of <hi>Madness</hi> are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite.</p>
                        <p>Though this much of <hi>Triboulet</hi>'s words tend little to my Advantage, how be it the Prejudice which I sustain thereby be common with me to all other Men, yet the rest of his Talk and Gesture maketh altogether for me. He said to my Wife, <hi>Be weary of the Monky</hi>; that is as much,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:46180:512"/>
as if he should be chery, and take as much delight in a Monky as ever did the <hi>Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia</hi> of <hi>Catullus</hi> in her Sparrow; who will for his Recreation pass his time no less joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully at the exercise of snatching Flies, then heretofore did the merciless Fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catcher <hi>Domitian.</hi> Withal he meant by another part of his Discourse, that she should be of a Jovial Country-like Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, as gay and pleasing as a harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Hornepipe</hi> of <hi>Saulian</hi> or <hi>Buzansy.</hi> The veridical <hi>Triboulet</hi> did therein hint at what I liked well, as perfectly knowing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and Propensions of my Mind, my natural Disposition, and the Biass of my Interior Passions and Affections: For you may be assured, that my Humour is much better satisfied and contented with the pretty frolick rural discheveled Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardesses, whose Bums through their course Canvas Smocks smell of the Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-grass of the Field, than with those great Ladies in Magnifick Courts, with their Flandan, Top-knots and Sultana's, their Polvil, Postillo's and Cosmeticks. The homely sound likeways of a Rustical <hi>Hornepipe,</hi> is more agreeable to my Ears, than the curious Warbling and musical Quavering of Lutes, Teorbes, Viols, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becks and Violins. He gave me a lusty rapping thwack on my Back. What then?
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:46180:513"/>
Let it pass in the Name and for the Love of God, as an Abatement of, and Dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from so much of my future Pains in <hi>Purgatory.</hi> He did it not out of any evil intent: He thought belike to have hit some of the Pages: He is an honest <hi>Fool,</hi> and an innocent Changeling. It is a Sin to harbour in the Heart any bad Conceit of him. As for my self, I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily pardon him. He flirted me on the Nose: In that there is no harm; for it importeth nothing else, but that betwixt my <hi>Wife</hi> and me there will occur some toyish wanton Tricks, which usually hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to all new married Folks.</p>

                        <p>THere is as yet another Point (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) which you have not at all considered on, although it be the chief and principal Head of the matter. He put the <hi>Bottle</hi> in my hand, and restored it

me again. How interpret you that Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage? What is the meaning of that? He possibly (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) signifieth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that your <hi>Wife</hi> will be such a Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, as shall daily take in her Liquor kindly, and ply the Pots and <hi>Bottles</hi> apace.

Let us go thither, I beseech you: Deny me not, and say not, Nay; reject not the Suit I make unto you, I intreat you. I
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:46180:514"/>
will be to you an <hi>Achates,</hi> a <hi>Damis,</hi> and heartily accompany you all along in the whole Voyage, both in your going forth and coming back. I have of a long time known you to be a great Lover of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrination, desirous still to learn new things, and still to see what you had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver seen before.</p>
                        <p>Very willingly (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend to your Request. But before we enter in upon our Progress towards the Accomplishment of so far a Journey, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished and fraught with eminent Perils, full of innumerable Hazards, and every way stored with evident and manifest Dangers. What Dangers (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) interrupting him? Dangers fly back, run from, and shun me whither soever I go seven Leagues around: As in the Presence of the Soveraign a subordinate Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is eclipsed; or as Clouds and Darkness quite evanish at the bright coming of a Radiant Sun; or as all Sores and Sicknes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses did suddenly depart, at the approach of the Body of St. <hi>Martin Aquande</hi>: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) before we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to set forwards on the Road of our projected and intended Voyage, some few Points are to be discussed, expedited and dispatched. <hi>First,</hi> Let us send back <hi>Triboulet</hi> to <hi>Blois,</hi> (which was instantly
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:46180:514"/>
done, after that <hi>Pantagruel</hi> had given him a Frize Coat.) <hi>Secondly,</hi> Our Design must be backed with the Advice and Counsel of the King my Father. And <hi>Lastly,</hi> It is most needful and expedient for us, that we search for, and find out some <hi>Sybille</hi> to serve us for a Guide, Truchman and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter. To this <hi>Panurge</hi> made answer, That his Friend <hi>Xenomanes</hi> would abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly suffice for the plenary Discharge and Performance of the <hi>Sybil</hi>'s Office; and that furthermore, in passing through the <hi>Lanternatory</hi> Revelling Country, they should take along with them a Learned and profitable <hi>Lanterne,</hi> which would be no less useful to them in their Voyage, than was that of the <hi>Sybil</hi> to <hi>Aeneas</hi> in his Descent to the <hi>Elysian</hi> Fields. <hi>Carpalin</hi> in the interim, as he was upon the conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of <hi>Triboulet,</hi> in his passing by, hearkened a little to the Discourse they were upon, then spoke out, saying, Ho, <hi>Panurge,</hi> Master Freeman, take my Lord <hi>Debitis</hi> at <hi>Calais</hi> alongst with you, for he is <hi>Goud-fallot,</hi> a good Fellow: He will not forget those who have been <hi>Debitors</hi>: These are <hi>Lanternes:</hi> Thus shall you not lack for both <hi>Fallot</hi> and <hi>Lanterne.</hi> I may safely with the little Skill I have (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) prognosticate, that by the way we shall engender no Melancholy;
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:46180:515"/>
I clearly perceive it already: The only thing that vexeth me is, that I cannot speak the <hi>Lanternatorie</hi> Language. I shall (answered <hi>Panurge</hi>) speak for you all; I understand it every whit as well as I do mine own Maternal Tongue, I have been no less used to it than to the Vulgar <hi>French.</hi>

Businesses quite contrary, and diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically opposite to the Quality, State and Condition of their Callings, Professions and Vocations; or the superstitious Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity and senceless Scrupulousness of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Folks, who have yielded Obedience, and submitted their Bodies, Fortunes and Estates to the Discretion and Authority of such odious, perverse, barbarous, and unreasonable Laws. Nor do they see that which is clearer than the Light and Splendour of the Morning Star, how all these Nuptial and Connubial Sanctions, Statutes and Ordinances have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, made and instituted, for the sole Benefit, Profit and Advantage of the <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Mists,</hi> and mysterious <hi>Flamens,</hi> and nothing at all for the good Utility or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molument of the silly hood-winked mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried People; which administreth unto others a sufficient Cause for rendring these Church-men suspicious of Iniquity, and of an unjust and fraudulent manner of dealing, no more to be connived at nor countenanced, after that it be well weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Scales of Reason, than if with a reciprocal Temerity the <hi>Laicks</hi> by way of Compensation would impose Laws to be followed and observed by those <hi>Mysts</hi> and <hi>Flamens</hi>; how they should behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the making and Performance of
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:46180:518"/>
their Rites and Ceremonies, and after what manner they ought to proceed in the offering up, and immolating of their various Oblations, Victims and Sacrifices; seeing that besides the Edecimation and Tith-haling of their Goods, they cut off and take Parings, Shreddings and Clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings of the Gain proceeding from the Labour of their Hands, and Sweat of their Brows, therewith to entertain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the better. Upon which Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in my Opinion; their Injunctions and Commands would not prove so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious and impertinent as those of the Ecclesiastick Power, unto which they had tendred their blind Obedience.</p>
                        <p>For as you have very well said, there is no place in the World where legally a Licence is granted to the Children to marry without the Advice and Consent of their Parents and Kindred. Nevertheless by those wicked Laws and <hi>Mole-catching</hi> Customs, whereat there is a little hinted in what I have already spoken to you, there is no scurvy, mezely, leprous or pocky Ruffian, Pander, Knave, Rogue, Skelm, Robber or Thief, pilloried, whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and burn-marked in his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try for his Crimes and Felonies, who may not violently snatch away and ravish what Maid soever he had a mind to pitch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:46180:518"/>
how noble, how fair, how rich, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and chaste soever she be, and that out of the House of her own Father, in his own Presence, from the Bosom of her Mother, and in the sight and despight of her Friends and Kindred looking on a so woful Spectacle, provided that the Rascal Villain be so cunning as to associate unto himself some <hi>Mystical Flamen,</hi> who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Covenant made betwixt them two, shall be in hope some day to participate of the Prey.</p>
                        <p>Could the <hi>Goths,</hi> the <hi>Scyths,</hi> or <hi>Messa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets</hi> do a worse or more cruel Act to any of the Inhabitants of a Hostile City, when after the loss of many of their most consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Commanders, the expence of a great deal of Money, and a long Siege, they shall have stormed and taken it by a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent and impetuous Assault? May not these Fathers and Mothers (think you) be sorrowful and heavy-hearted, when they see an unknown Fellow, a Vagabond Stranger, a barbarous Lowt, a rude Curr, rotten, fleshless, putrified, scraggy, boily, botchy, poor, a forlorn Caitif and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Snake, by an open Rapt, snatcht a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way before their own Eyes their so fair, delicate, neat, well-behavioured, richly provided for, and healthful Daughters, on whose Breeding and Education they had
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:46180:519"/>
spared no Cost nor Charges, by bringing them up in an honest Discipline to all the honourable and vertuous Employments becoming one of their Sex, descended of a noble Parentage, hoping by those com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable and industrious means in an opportune and convenient time to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow them on the worthy Sons of their well-deserving Neighbours and ancient Friends, who had nourished, entertained, taught, instructed and schooled their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with the same Care and Sollicitude, to make them Matches fit to attain to the Felicity of a so happy Marriage; that from them might issue an Off-spring and Progeny no less Heirs to the laudable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments and exquisite Qualifications of their Parents whom they every way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble, than to their Personal and Real Estates, Moveables and Inheritances? How doleful, trist and plangorous would such a Sight and Pageantry prove unto them? You shall not need to think that the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachrymation of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and their Confederates, at the Decease of <hi>Germani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Drusus,</hi> was comparable to this Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of theirs?

                        <p>Notwithstanding all this, the greater part of so vilely abused Parents, are so timerous and afraid of Devils and Hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goblins, and so deeply plunged in Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, that they dare not gainsay nor contradict, much less oppose and resist those unnatural and impious Actions, when the <hi>Mole-catcher</hi> hath been present at the perpetrating of the Fact, and a Party Contracter and Covenanter in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable Bargain. What do they do then? They wretchedly stay at their own mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:46180:520"/>
Homes, destitute of their well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Daughters; the Fathers cursing the days and the hours wherein they were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; and the Mothers howling and crying that it was not their fortune to have brought forth Abortive Issues, when they hapned to be delivered of such unfortunate Girls; and in this pitiful plight spend at best the remainder of their Time with Tears and Weeping for those their Children of, and from whom they expected (and with good reason should have obtained and reaped) in these latter days of theirs, Joy and Comfort. Other Parents there have been, so impatient of that Affront and Indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty put upon them and their Families, that, transported with the Extremity of Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in a mad and frantick mood, through the Vehemency of a grievous Fury and raging Sorrow, have drowned, hanged, killed, and otherways put violent hands on themselves. Others again of that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental Relation, have upon the reception of the like Injury, been of a more mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous and heroick Spirit, who (in imitation, and at the Example of the Children of <hi>Iacob,</hi> revenging upon the <hi>Sichemits</hi> the Rapt of their Sister <hi>Dina</hi>) having found the Rascally Ruffian in the Association of his mystical <hi>Mole-catcher</hi> closely and in hugger-mugger, conferring,

Upon the chivalrous, bold and couragious Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a so valiant, stout and man-like Act, the other <hi>Mole catching Symmists</hi> have been so highly incensed, and have so chaffed, fretted and fumed thereat, that Bills of Complaint and Accusations ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been in a most odious and detestible manner put in before the competent Judges, the <hi>Arm of Secular Authority</hi> hath with much Importunity and Impetuosity been by them implored and required, they proudly contending, that the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God</hi> would become contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if exemplary Punishment were not speedily taken upon the Persons of the Perpetrators of such an enormous, horrid, sacrilegious, crying, heinous, and execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Crime.</p>
                        <p>Yet neither by Natural Equity, by the Law of Nations, nor by any Imperial Law whatsoever, hath there been found
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:46180:521"/>
so much as one Rubrick, Paragraph, Point or Tittle, by the which any kind of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement or Correction hath been adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed due to be inflicted upon any for their Delinquency in that kind. Reason op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth, and Nature is repugnant: For there is no vertuous Man in the World, who, both naturally and with good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, will not be more hugely troubled in Mind, hearing of the News of the Rapt, Disgrace, Ignominy and Dishonour of his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Daughter, than of her Death.

He likewise picked out for his use so many Mariners, Pilots, Sailors, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, Artificers, Officers and Soldiers, as he thought fitting; and therewithal made Provision of so much Victuals of all sorts, Artillery, Munition of divers kinds, Cloaths, Moneys, and other such Lug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, Stuff, Baggage, Chaffer and Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, as he deemed needful for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the Design of a so tedious, long and perillous Voyage. Amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, it was observed, how he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed some of his Vessels to be fraught and loaded with a great quantity of an Herb of his called <hi>Pantagruelion,</hi> not only of the green and raw sort of it, but of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected also, and of that which was nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly well befitted for present use after the fashion of Conserves. The Herb <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruelion</hi> hath a little Root somewhat hard and ruff, roundish, terminating in an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuse and very blunt Point, and having some of its Veins, Strings or Filaments coloured with some spots of white, never

<pb n="397" facs="tcp:46180:523"/>
every year perisheth; the Tree, neither in the Trunk, Root, Bark or Boughs, being durable.</p>
                        <p>From the Stalk of this <hi>Pantagruelian</hi> Plant there issue forth several large and great Branches, whose Leaves have thrice as much length as breadth, always green, roughish and rugged like the Alcanet, or <hi>Spanish</hi> Buglose, hardish, slit round about like unto a Sickle, or as the Saxifragum, Betony, and finally ending as it were in the Points of a <hi>Macedonian</hi> Spear, or of such a Lancet as Surgeons commonly make use of in their Phlebotomizing Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. The Figure and shape of the Leaves thereof is not much different from that of those of the Ash-tree, or of <hi>Egrimony</hi>; the Herb it self so being like the <hi>Eupato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Plant, that many skilful <hi>Herbalists</hi> have called it the <hi>Domestick Eupator,</hi> and the <hi>Eupator</hi> the wild <hi>Pantagruelion.</hi> These Leaves are in equal and parallel Distances spread around the Stalk, by the number in every Rank either of Five or Seven, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture having so highly favoured and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd this Plant, that she hath richly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned it with these two <hi>odd, divine</hi> and <hi>mysterious</hi> Numbers. The Smell thereof is somewhat strong, and not very pleasing to nice, tender and delicate Noses: The Seed inclosed therein mounteth up to the
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:46180:524"/>
very top of its Stalk, and a little above it.</p>
                        <p>This is a numerous Herb; for there is no less abundance of it than of any other whatsoever. Some of these Plants are Spherical, some Romboid, and some of an oblong shape, and all of those either black, bright-coloured or tawny, rude to the touch, and mantled with a quickly-blasted-away Coat, yet such a one as is of a delicious Taste and Savour to all shrill and sweetly singing Birds, such as Linnets, Goldfinches, Larks, Canary Birds, Yellow-hammers, and others of that Airy chir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Quire; but it would quite extinguish the Natural Heat and Procreative Vertue of the Semence of any Man, who would eat much, and often of it. And although, that, of old, amongst the <hi>Greeks</hi> there was certain kinds of Fritters and Pancakes, Buns and Tarts made thereof, which commonly for a lickorish Daintiness were presented the Table after Supper, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the Palat, and make the Wine relish the better. Yet is it of a difficult Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and offensive to the Stomach; for it engendreth bad and unwholsom Blood, and with its exorbitant Heat woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them with grievous, hurtful, smart and noysom Vapours. And as in divers Plants and Trees there are two Sexes,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:46180:524"/>
Male and Female, which is perceptible in Lawrels, Palms, Cypresses, Oaks, Holmes, the Daffadil, Mandrake, Fearn, the Agarick, Mushrum, Birthwort, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine, Penny-royal, Peony, Rose of the Mount, and many other such like. Even so, in this Herb there is a <hi>Male</hi> which beareth no Flower at all, yet it is very copious of, and abundant in Seed. There is likeways in it a <hi>Female,</hi> which hath great store and plenty of whitish Flowers, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to little or no purpose; nor doth it carry in it Seed of any worth at all, at least comparable to that of the Male. It hath also a larger Leaf, and much softer than that of the Male; nor doth it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together grow to so great a height. This <hi>Pantagruelion</hi> is to be sown at the first coming of the Swallows, and is to be plucked out of the Ground when the Grashoppers begin to be a little hoarse.</p>

                        <p>THE Herb <hi>Pantagruelion</hi> in <hi>September,</hi> under the Autumnal Equinox, is dressed and prepared several ways, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the various Fancies of the People, and Diversity of the Climates wherein it groweth. The first Instruction which <hi>Pantagruel</hi> gave concerning it, was, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest and dispoil the Stalk and Stem there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of of all its Flowers and Seeds, to mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and mortifie it in Pond, Pool, or Lake-water, which is to be made run a little for five days together, if the Season be dry, and the Water hot; or for full nine or twelve days, if the weather be cloudish, and the Water cold: Then must it be parched before the Sun, till it be drained of its Moisture: After this it is in the Shadow, where the Sun shines not, to be peeled, and its Rind pulled off: Then are the Fibres and Strings thereof to be parted, (wherein, as we have already
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:46180:525"/>
said, consisteth its prime Vertue, Price, and Efficacy) and severed from the woody part thereof, which is improfitable, and serveth hardly to any other use, than to make a clear and glistering Blaze, to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the Fire, and for the Play, Pastime and Disport of little Children, to blow up Hogs Bladders, and make them rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. Many times some use is made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by tipling, sweet-lipped Bibbers, who out of it frame Quills and Pipes, through which they with their Liquor-attractive Breath suck up the new dainty Wine from the Bung of the Barrel. Some modern <hi>Pantagruelists,</hi> to shun and avoid that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Labour, which such a separating and partitional Work would of necessity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, employ certain <hi>Catarractick</hi> Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, oomposed and formed after the same manner that the froward, pettish and angry <hi>Iuno</hi> did hold the Fingers of both her hands interwovenly clenched together, when she would have hindred the Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth Delivery of <hi>Alcmena,</hi> at the Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Hercules</hi>; and athwart those Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racts they break and bruise to very Trash the woody parcels, thereby to preserve the better the Fibres, which are the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and excellent parts. In, and with this sole Operation do these acquiesce and are contented, who, contrary to the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:46180:526"/>
Opinion of the whole Earth, and in in a manner paradoxical to all Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, gain their Livelihoods backwards, and by recoiling. But those that love to hold it at a higher rate, and prize it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its Value, for their own great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Profit, do the very same which is told us of the recreation of the three fatal Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Parques,</hi> or of the nocturnal Exercise of the noble <hi>Circe</hi>; or yet of the Excuse which <hi>Penelope</hi> made to her fond wooing Youngsters and effeminate Courtiers, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the long Absence of her Husband <hi>Ulysses.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>By these means is this Herb put into a way to display its inestimable Vertues, whereof I will discover a part: (for to relate all is a thing impossible to do) I have already interpreted and exposed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you the Denomination thereof. I find that Plants have their Names given and bestowed upon them after several ways: Some got the Name of him who first found them out, knew them, sowed them, improved them by Culture, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them to a tractability, and appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated them to the uses and subserviences they were fit for: As the <hi>Mercuriale</hi> from <hi>Mercury, Panacee</hi> from <hi>Panace</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Esculapius,</hi> in <hi>Armois</hi> from <hi>Artemis,</hi> who is <hi>Diana; Eupatorie</hi> from the King

                           <hi>Eupator; Telephion</hi> from <hi>Telephus; Euphor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium</hi> from <hi>Euphorbus,</hi> King <hi>Iuba</hi>'s Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; <hi>Clymenos</hi> from <hi>Clymenus; Alchibiadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> from <hi>Alcibiades; Gentiane</hi> from <hi>Gentius</hi> King of <hi>Sclavonia,</hi> and so forth, through a great many other Herbs or Plants. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in ancient Times, this Prerogative of imposing the Inventors Name upon an Herb found out by him, was held in a so great account and estimation, that as a Controversie arose betwixt <hi>Neptune</hi> and <hi>Pallas,</hi> from which of them two that Land should receive its Denomination, which had been equally found out by them both together, though thereafter it was called and had the Apellation of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> from <hi>Athene,</hi> which is <hi>Minerva</hi>: Just so would <hi>Lynceus</hi> King of <hi>Scythia</hi> have treacherously slain the young <hi>Trip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolemus,</hi> whom <hi>Ceres</hi> had sent to shew unto Mankind the Invention of Corn, which until then had been utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, to the end, that after the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Messenger (whose Death he made account to have kept secret) he might, by imposing with the less suspicion of false dealing, his own Name upon the said found out Seed, acquire unto himself an immortal Honour and Glory, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been the Inventor of a Grain so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and necessary to, and for the use of
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:46180:527"/>
Humane Life. For the wickedness of which Treasonable Attempt he was by <hi>Ceres</hi> transformed into that wild Beast, which by some is called a <hi>Lynx,</hi> and by others an <hi>Oince.</hi> Such also was the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of others upon the like occasion, as appeareth by that, very sharp Wars, and of a long continuance, have been made of old betwixt some Residentary Kings in <hi>Capadocia,</hi> upon this only De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, of whose Name a certain <hi>Herb</hi> should have the Appellation; by reason of which difference, so troublesom and expensive to them all, it was by them cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Polemonion,</hi> and by us for the same Cause termed <hi>Make-bate.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Other Herbs and Plants there are, which retain the Names of the Countries from whence they were transported: As the <hi>Median</hi> Apples from <hi>Media,</hi> where they first grew; <hi>Punick</hi> Apples from <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicia,</hi> (that is to say, <hi>Carthage;) Ligusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi> (which we call <hi>Louage</hi>) from <hi>Liguria</hi> the Coast of <hi>Genoua; Rubarb</hi> from a Flood in <hi>Barbary</hi> (as <hi>Ammianus</hi> attesteth) called <hi>Ru; Sautonica</hi> from a Region of that Name; <hi>Fenugreek</hi> from <hi>Greece; Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanes</hi> from a Country so called; <hi>Persicarie</hi> from <hi>Persia; Sabine</hi> from a Territory of that Appellation; <hi>Staechas</hi> from the <hi>Stae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chad</hi> Islands; <hi>Spica Celtica</hi> from the Land
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:46180:527"/>
of the <hi>Celtick Gauls</hi>; and so throughout a great many other, which were tedious to enumerate. Some others again have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their Denominations by way of Antiphrasis, or Contrariety; as, <hi>Absinth,</hi> because it is contrary to <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>; for it is bitter to the taste in drinking; <hi>Holosteon,</hi> as if it were all Bones, whilst on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, there is no frailer, tenderer nor britler Herb in the whole Production of Nature than it.</p>
                        <p>There are some other sorts of Herbs, which have got their Names from their Vertues and Operatious; as <hi>Aristolochie,</hi> because it helpeth Women in Child-birth; <hi>Lichen,</hi> for that it cureth the Disease of that name; <hi>Mallow,</hi> because it mollifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; <hi>Callithricum,</hi> because it maketh the Hair of a bright Colour; <hi>Alyssum, Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merum, Bechium, Nasturtium, Aneban,</hi> and so forth through many more.</p>
                        <p>Other some there are which have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their Names from the admirable Qualities that are found to be in them; as <hi>Heliotropium</hi> (which is the Marigold) because it followeth the Sun; so that at the Sun rising it displayeth and spreads it self out, at his ascending it mounteth, at his declining it waineth; and when he is set it is close shut; <hi>Adianton,</hi> because al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it grow near unto watry places,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:46180:528"/>
and albeit you should let it lie in Water a long time, it will nevertheless retain no Moisture nor Humidity; <hi>Hierachia, Erin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium,</hi> and so throughout a great many more. There are also a great many Herbs, and Plants, which have retained the very same Names of the Men and Women who have been metamorphosed and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in them; as from <hi>Daphne</hi> the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel is called also <hi>Daphne; Myrrhe</hi> from <hi>Myrrha</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Cinarus; Pythis</hi> from <hi>Pythis; Cinara</hi> (which is the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chock) from one of that name; <hi>Narcis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> with <hi>Saffran, Similax,</hi> and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                        <p>Many Herbs likewise have got their Names of those things which they seem to have some Resemblance; as <hi>Hippuris,</hi> because it hath the likeness of a Horses Tail; <hi>Alopecuris,</hi> because it representeth in similitude the Tail of a Fox; <hi>Psyllion,</hi> from a Flea which it resembleth; <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinium,</hi> for that it is like a <hi>Dolphin</hi> Fish; <hi>Buglosse</hi> is so called, because it is an Herb like an Oxes Tongue; <hi>Iris,</hi> so called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in its Flowers it hath some resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the Rain-bow; <hi>Myosata,</hi> because it is like the Ear of a Mouse; <hi>Coronopus,</hi> for that it is of the likeness of a Crows Foot: A great many other such there are, which here to recite were needless. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:46180:528"/>
as there are Herbs and Plants which have had their Names from those of Men, so by a reciprocal Denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have the Surnames of many Families taken their Origin from them; as the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bii, à fabis,</hi> Beans; the <hi>Pisons, à pisis,</hi> Pease; the <hi>Lentuli</hi> from <hi>Lentils</hi>; the <hi>Cicerons, à Ciceribus, vel Ciceris,</hi> a sort of Pulse called <hi>Cichepeason,</hi> and so forth. In some Plants and Herbs the resemblance or likeness hath been taken from a higher Mark or Object, as when we say <hi>Venus</hi> Navil, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> Hair, <hi>Venus</hi> Tub, <hi>Iupiter</hi>'s Beard, <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>'s Eye, <hi>Mars</hi>'s Blood, the <hi>Hermodactyl</hi> or <hi>Mercury</hi>'s Fingers, which are all of them Names of Herbs, as there are a great many more of the like Appellation. Others again have received their Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination from their Forms; such as the <hi>Trefoil,</hi> because it is three-leaved; <hi>Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylon,</hi> for having five Leaves; <hi>Serpolet,</hi> because it creepeth along the ground; <hi>Helixine, Petast, Myrobalon,</hi> which the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> call <hi>Been,</hi> as if you would say an <hi>Ackorne</hi>; for it hath a kind of resemblance thereto, and withal is very oily.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. LI. Why is it called <hi>Pantagruelion,</hi> and of the admirable Vertues thereof.</head>
                        <p>BY such like means of attaining to a Denomination (the fabulous ways being only from thence excepted; for the Lord forbid that we should make use of any Fables in this a so venerable Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story) is this <hi>Herb</hi> called <hi>Pantagruelion</hi>; for <hi>Pantagruel</hi> was the Inventor thereof: I do not say of the Plant it self, but of a certain use which it serves for, exceeding odious and hateful to Thieves and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, unto whom it is more contrarious and hurtful than the <hi>Strangle-weed, Choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitch</hi> is to the Flax, the Cats-tail to the Brakes, the Sheavgrass to the Mowers of Hay, the Fitches to the Chickny Pease, the Darnel to Barley, the Hatchet Fitch to the Lentil Pulse, the <hi>Antramium</hi> to the Beans, Tares to Wheat, Ivy to Walls, the Water Lilly to lecherous Monks, the Birchen Rod to the Scholars of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Navarre</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> Colewort to
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:46180:529"/>
the Vine-tree, Garlick to the Load-stone, Onyons to the sight, Fearn-seed to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with Child, Willow Grain to vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Nuns, the Yew-tree shade to those that sleep under it, Wolfsbane to Wolves and Libbards, the Smell of Fig-tree to mad Bulls, Hemlock to Goslings, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slane to the Teeth, or Oil to Trees: For we have seen many of those Rogues by vertue and right application of this Herb finish their Lives, <hi>short</hi> and <hi>long,</hi> after the manner of <hi>Phillis</hi> Queen of <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> of <hi>Benosus</hi> Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> King <hi>Latinus</hi>'s Wife, of <hi>Iphus, Autolicus, Lycambe, Arachne, Phaedra, Leda, Achius</hi> King of <hi>Lydia,</hi> and many thousands more; who were chiefly angry and vexed at this Disaster therein, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being otherways sick, evil dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in their Bodies, by a touch only of the <hi>Pantagruelian,</hi> they came on a suddain to have the passage obstructed, and their Pipes (through which were wont to bolt so many jolly Sayings, and to enter so many luscious Morsels) stopped, more cleaverly, than ever could have done the Squinancy.</p>
                        <p>Others have been heard most wofully to lament, at the very instant when <hi>Atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos</hi> was about to cut the thred of their Life, that <hi>Pantagruel held them by the Gorge.</hi>
                           <pb n="410" facs="tcp:46180:530"/>
But (well-a-day) it was not <hi>Pantagruel;</hi> he never was an Executioner: It was the <hi>Pantagruelian,</hi> manufactured and fashioned into an Halter, and serving in the place and Office of a Cravat. In that verily they <hi>solaecized,</hi> and spoke improperly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less you would excuse them by a <hi>Trope,</hi> which alloweth us to posit the <hi>Inventor</hi> in the place of the thing <hi>invented;</hi> as when <hi>Ceres</hi> is taken for <hi>Bread,</hi> and <hi>Bacchus</hi> put instead of <hi>Wine.</hi> I swear to you here, by the good and frolick Words which are to issue out of that Wine-bottle which is a cooling below in the Copper Vessel full of Fountain Water, that the noble <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel</hi> never snatch'd any Man by the Throat, unless it was such a one as was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together careless and neglective of those obviating Remedies, which were preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the Thirst to come.</p>
                        <p>It is also termed <hi>Pantagruelion</hi> by a Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude: For <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> at the very first minute of his Birth, was no less tall than this Herb is long, whereof I speak unto you, his measure having been then taken the more easie, that he was born in the Season of the great Drowth, when they were busiest in the gathering of the said <hi>Herb,</hi> to wit, at that time when <hi>Ica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>'s Dog, with his fiery bawling and barking at the Sun, maketh the whole
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:46180:530"/>
World <hi>Troglodytick,</hi> and enforceth People every where to hide themselves in Dens and subterranean Caves. It is likeways called <hi>Pantagruelion,</hi> because of the nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and singular Qualities, Vertues and Properties thereof: For as <hi>Pantagruel</hi> hath been the <hi>Idea,</hi> Pattern, Prototype and Exemplary of all <hi>Iovial</hi> Perfection and Accomplishment (in the truth whereof I believe there is none of you, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Drinkers, that putteth any Question) so in this <hi>Pantagruelion</hi> have I found so much Efficacy and Energy, so much Compleatness and Excellency, so much Exquisiteness and Ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Shall I yet say more? If <hi>Oxilus</hi> the Son of <hi>Orius</hi> had begotten this Plant upon his Sister <hi>Hamadryas,</hi> he had taken more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the Value and Perfection of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, then in all his Eight Children, so highly renowned by our ablest <hi>Mythologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that they have sedulously recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:46180:531"/>
their Names to the never-failing Tui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an eternal Remembrance. The eldest Child was a Daughter, whose Name was <hi>Vine;</hi> the next born was a Boy, and his Name was <hi>Fig-tree;</hi> the third was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Walnut-tree;</hi> the fourth <hi>Oak;</hi> the fifth <hi>Sorbaple-tree;</hi> the sixth <hi>Ash;</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth <hi>Poplar;</hi> and the last had the Name of <hi>Elm,</hi> who was the greatest <hi>Surgeon</hi> in his time. I shall forbear to tell you, how the Juyce or Sap thereof, being pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and distilled within the Ears, killeth every kind of Vermin, that by any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Putrefaction cometh to be bred and engendred there; and destroyeth also any whatsoever other Animal that shall have entred in thereat. If likewise you put a little of the said Juyce within a Pale or Bucket full of Water, you shall see the Water instantly turn and grow thick therewith, as if it were Milk-Curds, whereof the Vertue is so great, that the Water thus curded is a present Remedy for Horses subject to the Cholick, and such as strike at their own Flanks. The Root thereof well boiled, mollifieth the Joynts, softneth the hardness of shrunk in Sinews, is every way comfortable to the Nerves, and good against all Cramps and Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, as likeways all cold and knotty Gouts. If you would speedily heal a
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:46180:531"/>
Burning, whether occasioned by Water or Fire, apply thereto a little raw <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruelion,</hi> that is to say, take it so as it cometh out of the Ground, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing any other Preparation or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position upon it; but have a special Care to change it for some fresher, in lieu there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as soon as you shall find it waxing dry upon the Sore.</p>
                        <p>Without this <hi>Herb</hi> Kitchins would be detested, the Tables of Dining-Rooms abhorred, although there were great Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Variety of most dainty and sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous Dishes of Meat set down upon them; and the choicest Beds also, how richly soever adorned with Gold, Silver, Amber, Ivory, Porphyr, and the mixture of most precious Metals, would without it yield no Delight or Pleasure to the Reposers in them: Without it Millers could neither carry Wheat, nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of Corn, to the Mill; nor would they be able to bring back from thence Flour, or any other sort of Meal whatsoever. Without it, how could the Papers and Writs of Lawyers Clients be brought to the Bar? Seldom is the Mortar, Lime or Plaister brought to the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house without it. Without it how should the Water be got out of a Draw-Well? In what case would Tabellions, Notaries,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:46180:532"/>
Copists, Makers of Counterpanes, Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Clerks, Secretaries, Scriveners, and such like Persons be without it? Were it not for it, what would become of the Toll-rates and Rent-rolls? Would not the noble Art of Printing perish without it? Whereof could the Chassis or Paper-Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows be made? How should the Bells be rung? The Altars of <hi>Isis</hi> are adorned therewith; the <hi>Pastophorian</hi> Priests are therewith clad and accoutred; and whole Humane Nature covered and wrapped therein, at its first position and producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in, and into this World: All the Luni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Trees of <hi>Seres,</hi> the Bumbast and Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Bushes in the Territories near the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> Sea and Gulph of <hi>Bengala;</hi> the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi> Swans, together with the Plants of <hi>Maltha,</hi> do not all of them cloath, attire, and apparel so many Persons as this one <hi>Herb</hi> alone. Soldiers are now-a-days much better sheltered under it, than they were in former times, when they lay in Tents covered with Skins. It overshadows the Theaters and Amphitheaters from the heat of a scorching Sun: It begirdeth and encompasseth Forests, Chases, Parks, Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Groves, for the pleasure of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: It descendeth into the Salt and Fresh of both Sea and River-Waters, for the profit of Fishers: By it are Boots of
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:46180:532"/>
all sizes, Buskins, Gamashes, Brodkins, Gambados, Shooes, Pumps, Slippers, and every cobled Ware wrought and made steddable for the use of Man: By it the Butt and Rover-bows are strong, the Cross-bows bended, and the Slings made fixed: And, as if it were an <hi>Herb</hi> every whit as <hi>holy</hi> as the <hi>Verveine,</hi> and reverenced by Ghosts, Spirits, Hobgoblins, Fiends and Phantoms, the Bodies of deceased Men are never buried without it.</p>
                        <p>I will proceed yet further, by the means of this fine <hi>Herb,</hi> the invisible Substances are visibly stopped, arrested, taken, detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Prisoner-like committed to their receptive Goals. Heavy and ponderous Weights are by it heaved, lifted up, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, veered, drawn, carried, and every way moved quickly, nimbly and easily, to the great Profit and Emolument of Humane Kind. When I perpend with my self these and such like marvellous Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of this wonderful <hi>Herb,</hi> it seemeth strange unto me, how the Invention of so useful a Practice did escape, through so many by-past Ages, the Knowledge of the Ancient <hi>Philosophers,</hi> considering the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable Utility which from thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; and the immense Labour, which without it, they did undergo in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine Elucubrations. By vertue thereof,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:46180:533"/>
through the retention of some Aerial Gusts, are the huge Rambarges, mighty Gallioons, the large Floyts, the <hi>Chiliander,</hi> the <hi>Myriander</hi> Ships launched from their Stations, and set a going at the Pleasure and Arbitriment of their Rulers, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Steersmen. By the help thereof those remote Nations, whom Nature seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so unwilling to have discovered to us, and so desirous to have kept them still <hi>in abscondito,</hi> and hidden from us, that the ways through which their Countries were to be reached unto, were not only totally unknown, but judged also to be altogether impermeable and inaccessible, are now ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to us, and we to them.</p>
                        <p>Those Voyages outreached Flights of Birds, and far surpass'd the Scope of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd Fowls, how swift soever they had been on the Wing, and notwithstanding that advantage which they have of us in swimming through the Air. <hi>Taproban</hi> hath seen the Heaths of <hi>Lapland,</hi> and both the <hi>Iava's</hi> the <hi>Riphaean</hi> Mountains, wide distant <hi>Phebol</hi> shall see <hi>Theleme,</hi> and the <hi>Islanders</hi> drink of the Flood <hi>Euphrates</hi>: By it the chill-mouthed <hi>Boreas</hi> hath sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed the parched Mansions of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid <hi>Auster,</hi> and <hi>Eurus</hi> visited the Regions which <hi>Zephirus</hi> hath under his Command; yea, in such sort have Interviews been
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:46180:533"/>
made, by the assistance of this <hi>Sacred Herb,</hi> that maugre Longitudes and Latitudes, and all the Variations of the Zones. The <hi>Periae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> People, and <hi>Antoecian, Amphiscian, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teroscian,</hi> and <hi>Periscian</hi> had oft tendred and received mutual Visits to, and from other, upon all the Climates. These strange Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits bred such Astonishment to the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial <hi>Intelligences,</hi> to all the <hi>Marine</hi> and <hi>Terrestrial</hi> Gods, that they were on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den all afraid: From which Amazement, when they saw how, by means of this blest <hi>Pantagruelion,</hi> the <hi>Arctick</hi> People lookt upon the <hi>Antarctick,</hi> scowred the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean, passed the <hi>Tropicks,</hi> pushed through the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> measured all the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> sported under the <hi>Equinoctial,</hi> having both <hi>Poles</hi> level with their <hi>Horizon;</hi> they judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it high time to call a Council, for their own Safety and Preservation.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Olympick</hi> Gods being all and each of them affrighted at the sight of such At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements, said, <hi>Pantagruel</hi> hath shapen Work enough for us, and put us more to a plunge, and nearer our Wits end, by this sole <hi>Herb</hi> of his, then did of old the <hi>Aloids,</hi> by overturning Mountains. He very speedily is to be married, and shall have many Children by his Wife: It lies not in our Power to oppose this Destiny; for it hath passed through the Hands and
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:46180:534"/>
Spindles of the <hi>Fatal Sisters,</hi> Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties inexorable Daughters.

                        <head>CHAP. LII. How a certain kind of <hi>Pantagruelion</hi> is of that nature, that the Fire is not able to consume it.</head>
                        <p>I Have already related to you great and admirable things; but if you might be induced to adventure upon the hazard of believing some other Divinity of this Sacred <hi>Pantagruelion,</hi> I very willingly would tell it you. Believe it if you will, or otherways believe it not, I care not which of them you do, they are both alike to me, it shall be sufficient for my purpose to have told you the Truth, and the Truth I will tell you: But to enter in thereat, because it is of a knaggy, difficult and rugged access, this is the Question which I ask of you, If I had put within this Bottle two Pints, the one of Wine and the other of Water, throughly and exactly mingled together, how would you unmix them? After what manner would you go about to sever them, and separate the one Liquor from
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:46180:536"/>
the other, in such sort, that you render me the Water apart, free from the Wine, and the Wine also pure, without the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixture of one drop of Water; and both of them in the same measure, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and taste that I had embottled them? Or to state the Question otherways, If your Carr-men and Mariners, entrusted for the Provision of your Houses, with the bringing of a certain considerable number of Tuns, Punchions, Pipes, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and Hogsheads of <hi>Graves</hi> Wine, or of the Wine of <hi>Orleans, Beanne</hi> and <hi>Mire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaux,</hi> should drink out the half, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards with Water fill up the other empty halves of the Vessels as full as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; as the <hi>Limosins</hi> use to do in their Carriages by Wains and Carts of the Wines of <hi>Argenton</hi> and <hi>Sangaultier.</hi> After that, how would you part the Water from the Wine, and purifie them both in such a case. I understand you well enough; your meaning is, that I must do it with an <hi>Ivy</hi> Funnel: That is written, it is true, and the Verity thereof explored by a thousand Experiments; you have learned to do this Feat before I see it: But those that have never known it, nor at any time have seen the like, would hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that it were possible. Let us never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless proceed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="423" facs="tcp:46180:536"/>But put the case we were now living in the Age of <hi>Silla, Marius, Caesar,</hi> and other such <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors; or that we were in the time of our ancient <hi>Druids,</hi> whose custom was to burn and calcine the dead Bodies of their Parents and Lords, and that you had a mind to drink the Ashes or Cinders of your Wives or Fathers in the infused Liquor of some good White-wine, as <hi>Artemisia</hi> drunk the Dust and Ashes of her Husband <hi>Mansolus</hi>; or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways, that you did determine to have them reserved in some fine Urn or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary Pot, how would you save the Ashes apart, and separate them from those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cinders and Ashes into which the Fuel of the Funeral and bustuary Fire hath been converted? Answer if you can; by my Figgins, I believe it will trouble you so to do.</p>
                        <p>Well, I will dispatch, and tell you, that if you take of this Celestial <hi>Pantagruelion</hi> so much as is needful to cover the Body of the Defunct, and after that you shall have inwrapped and bound therein as hard and closely as you can the Corps of the said deceased Persons, and sowed up the Folding-sheet with thred of the same stuff, throw it into the Fire, how great or ardent soever it be it matters not a Straw, the Fire through this <hi>Pantagruelion</hi>
                           <pb n="424" facs="tcp:46180:537"/>
will burn the Body, and reduce to Ashes the Bones thereof, and the <hi>Pantagruelion</hi> shall be not only not consumed nor burnt, but also shall neither lose one Atom of the Ashes inclos'd within it, nor receive one Atom of the huge bustuary heap of Ashes resulting from the blazing Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration of things combustible laid round about it, but shall at last, when taken out of the Fire, be fairer, whiter, and much cleaner than when you did put it in at first: Therefore it is called <hi>Asbeston,</hi> which is as much to say as <hi>incombustible.</hi> Great plenty is to be found thereof in <hi>Carpasia,</hi> as likeways in the Climate <hi>Diasienes,</hi> at ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry easie rates. O how rare and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a thing it is, that the Fire which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth, consumeth and destroyeth all such things else, should cleanse, purge and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten this sole <hi>Pantagruelion Carpasian Asbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi>! If you mistrust the Verity of this Relation, and demand for further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of my Assertion a Visible Sign, as the <hi>Iews,</hi> and such incredulous Infidels use to do; take a fresh Egg, and orbicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly (or rather ovally) infold it within this Divine <hi>Pantagruelion</hi>; when it is so wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up, put it in the hot Embers of a Fire, how great or ardent soever it be, and having left it there as long as you will, you shall at last, at your taking it
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:46180:537"/>
out of the Fire, find the Egg roasted hard, and as it were burnt, without any Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Change, Mutation, or so much as a Calefaction of the Sacred <hi>Pantagruelion</hi>: For less than a Million of Pounds <hi>Sterling,</hi> modified, taken down and amoderated to the twelfth part of one Four Pence Half-penny Farthing, you are able to put it to a trial, and make Proof thereof.</p>
                        <p>Do not think to overmatch me here, by <hi>paragoning</hi> with it, in the way of a more eminent Comparison, the <hi>Salaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> That is a Fib; for albeit a little or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Fire, such as is used in Dining-Rooms and Chambers, gladden, chear up, exhilerate and quicken it, yet may I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably enough assure, that in the flaming Fire of a Furnace, it will, like any other animated Creature, be quickly suffocated, choaked, consumed and destroyed. We have seen the Experiment thereof, and <hi>Galen</hi> many ages ago hath clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated and confirmed it, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>De tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra mentis.</hi> And <hi>Dioscorides</hi> maintaineth the same Doctrine, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. Do not here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in competition with this Sacred <hi>Herb</hi> the <hi>Feather Allum,</hi> or the wooden Tower of <hi>Pyrce,</hi> which <hi>Lucius Sylla</hi> was never able to get burnt; for that <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus,</hi> Governour of the Town for <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi> King of <hi>Pontus,</hi> had plaistered it all
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:46180:538"/>
over on the out-side with the said <hi>Allum.</hi> Nor would I have you to compare there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the <hi>Herb,</hi> which <hi>Alexander Cornelius</hi> called <hi>Fonem,</hi> and said that it had some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance with that <hi>Oak</hi> which bears the <hi>Misselto</hi>; and that it could neither be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, nor receive any manner of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice by Fire, nor by Water, no more than the <hi>Misselto,</hi> of which was built (said he) the so renowned Ship <hi>Argos.</hi> Search where you please for those that will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, I in that Point desire to be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Neither would I wish you to paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel therewith (although I cannot deny but that it is of a very marvellous Nature) that sort of Tree which groweth alongst the Mountains of <hi>Brianson</hi> and <hi>Ambrun,</hi> which produceth out of his <hi>Root</hi> the good <hi>Agarick</hi>; from its <hi>Body</hi> it yieldeth unto us a so excellent <hi>Rosin,</hi> that <hi>Galen</hi> hath been bold to equal it to the <hi>Turpentine</hi>: Upon the delicate Leaves thereof it retaineth for our use that sweet Heavenly Honey, which is called the <hi>Manna</hi>: And although it be of a gummy, oily, fat and greasie Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, it is notwithstanding unconsuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by any Fire. It is in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> called <hi>Larix.</hi> The <hi>Alpinesi</hi> name it <hi>Melze.</hi> The <hi>Antenotides</hi> and <hi>Venetians</hi> term it <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rege</hi>; which gave occasion to that Castle in <hi>Piedmont</hi> to receive the Denomination
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:46180:538"/>
of <hi>Larignum,</hi> by putting <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> to a stand at his return from amongst the <hi>Gauls.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> commanded all the Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens, Boors, Hinds, and other Inhabitants in, near unto, and about the <hi>Alps</hi> and <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edmont,</hi> to bring all manner of Victuals and Provision for an Army to those places, which on the Military Road he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to receive them for the use of his marching Soldiery; to which Ordinance all of them were obedient, save only those as were within the Garrison of <hi>Larignum</hi>; who, trusting in the natural Strength of the place, would not pay their Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Emperor purposing to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise them for their refusal, caused his whole Army to march streight towards that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, before the Gate whereof was erected a <hi>Tower,</hi> built of huge big Sparrs and Rafters of the <hi>Larch</hi> Tree, fast bound to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Pins and Pegs of the same Wood, and interchangeably laid on one another, after the fashion of a Pile or Stack of Timber, set up in the Fabrick thereof to such an apt and convenient heighth, that from the Parapet above the Portcullis they thought with Stones and Leavers to beat off and drive away such as should approach thereto.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="428" facs="tcp:46180:539"/>When <hi>Caesar</hi> had understood that the chief Defence of those within the Castle did consist in Stones and Clubs, and that it was not an easie matter to sling, hurl, dart, throw, or cast them so far as to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Approaches, he forthwith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Men to throw great store of Bavins, Faggots and Fascines round about the Castle; and when they had made the Heap of a competent height to put them all in a fair Fire, which was thereupon incontinently done; the Fire put amidst the Faggots was so great and so high, that it covered the whole Castle, that they might well imagine the Tower would thereby be altogether burnt to Dust, and demolished. Nevertheless, contrary to all their Hopes and Expectations, when the Flame ceased, and that the Faggots were quite burnt and consumed, the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er appeared as whole, sound and entire as ever. <hi>Caesar,</hi> after a serious Consideration had thereof, commanded a Compass to be taken, without the distance of a Stone Cast from the Castle round about it there, with Ditches and Entrenchments to form a Blockade; which when the <hi>Loringians</hi> understood, they rendred themselves upon Terms: And then, by a Relation from them it was that <hi>Caesar</hi> learned the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Nature and Vertue of this <hi>Wood</hi>;
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:46180:539"/>
which, of it self, produceth neither Fire, Flame nor Coal; and would therefore in regard of that rare Quality of <hi>Incombu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stibility,</hi> have been admitted into this Rank and Degree of a true <hi>Pantagruelional</hi> Plant; and that so much the rather, for that <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel</hi> directed that all the Gates, Doors, Angiports, Windows, Gutters, frettized and embowed Seelings, Cans, and other whatsoever wooden Furniture in the Abby of <hi>Theleme</hi> should be all materiated of this kind of Timber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He likeways caused to cover therewith the Sterns, Stems, Cook-rooms or Laps, Hatches, Decks, Coursies, Bends and Walls of his Carricks, Ships, Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oons, Galays, Brigantins, Foysts, Frigates, Crears, Barks, Floyts, Pinks, Pinnaces, Huys, Catches, Capers, and other Vessels of his <hi>Thalassian</hi> Arcenal; were it not that the Wood or Timber of the <hi>Larch-tree,</hi> being put within a large and ample Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace full of huge vehemently flaming Fire, proceeding from the Fuel of other sorts and kinds of Wood, cometh at last to be corrupted, consumed, dissipated and destroyed, as are Stones in a Lime-kill: But this <hi>Pantagruelion Asbestin</hi> is rather by the Fire renewed and cleansed, than by the Flames thereof consumed or changed. Therefore,
