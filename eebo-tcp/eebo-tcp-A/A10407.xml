            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

'Tis no opinion of the worth that wrought me to it; if I finde thee charitable, I acknowledge my self beholding to thee: if thou condemne it of weaknesse, I cannot be angry to see another of my minde. I do not aim at the name of a Poet, I have alwaies admired the free raptures of poetrie; but it is too unthrifty a science for my fortunes, and is crept into the number of the seven, to undo the other six. That I make so many dedications, think not that I value it as a present rich enough to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided; but know whom I am in pietie bound to honour. That I admit so many of my friends approbations, is not that I itch'd for praise and love—rubbing, but that I was willing thou shouldest have something worth thy reading. Be to me as kinde as my audience, who when they might have us'd their censures, made choice of their mercies: and so I must acknowledge my self indebted to thy clemencie. I confesse no heights here, no strong conceits; I speak the language of the people.

            <head>¶ To that compleat and noble Knight, <hi>Sir</hi> KENELLAN DIGBIE.</head>

            <l>To the full height, how perfect man may be.</l>
            <l>Sure all the Arts did court you, and you were</l>
            <l>So courteous as to give to each their share,</l>

            <l>Perchance for skill in Grammar, and to know</l>
            <l>Whether this word be thus declin'd or no.</l>
            <l>Another cheats himself, perchance to be</l>
            <l>A prety youth, forsooth, in fallacie:</l>
            <l>This on Arithmetick doth hourely lie,</l>
            <l>To learn the first great blessing, —Multiply.</l>
            <l>That travels in Geometry, and tires,</l>
            <l>And he above the world a map admires.</l>
            <l>This dotes on Musicks most harmonious chime,</l>
            <l>And studying how to keep it, loses time.</l>
            <l>One turns o're histories, and he can show</l>
            <l>All that has been, but knows not what is now.</l>
            <l>Many in Physick labour, most of these</l>
            <l>Lose health, to know the name of a disease.</l>
            <l>Some (too high wise) are gazing at a starre,</l>
            <l>And if they call it by his name, they are</l>

            <l>That cries Melpomene, and drinks Helicon,</l>
            <l>At Poetrie throws wit and wealth away,</l>
            <l>And makes it all his work to write a play.</l>
            <l>Nay, on Divinity many spend their powres,</l>
            <l>That scarce learn any thing, but to stand two houres.</l>
            <l>How must we, Sir, admire you then, that know</l>

            <l>But I have seen a Proteus, that can take</l>

            <l>Himself to any thing; be that, or this,</l>
            <l>By voluntary metamorphosis.</l>
            <l>When thou dost act, men think it not a play;</l>
            <l>But all they see is reall: O that day,</l>
            <l>(When I had cause to blush that this poore thing</l>
            <l>Did kisse a queens hand, and salute a king)</l>
            <l>How often had I lost thee? I could finde</l>
            <l>One of thy stature, but in every kinde</l>
            <l>Alter'd from him I knew; nay, I in thee</l>

            <l>Turn'd Lover, thou dost that so lively too,</l>

            <l>Whose learning is all face: as 'twere thy fate</l>
            <l>There not to act, where most do personate.</l>
            <l>All this in one so small; nature made thee</l>

            <l>Such as have stronger limbes, but weaker parts)</l>
            <l>Are like a volume, that contains lesse in't,</l>
            <l>And yet looks big, 'cause 'tis a larger print.</l>

            <l>'Tis true; but then Calliope disdains,</l>

                     <p>Truely, husband, I have had such fearfull dreams to night, that I am perswaded (though I think I shall never turn truely honest again) to rob the dead no more. For, me thought, as you and I were robbing the dead, the dead took heart, and rob'd us.</p>

                     <p>Tush, dreams are idle things. There is no felonie warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able but ours, for it is grounded on rules of charity. Is it fitting the dead should be cloath'd, and the living go naked? Besides, what is it to them whether they lie in sheets or no? Did you ever heare of any that caught cold in his coffin? Moreover, there is safety and security in these attempts: What inhabitant of the grave that had his house broke open, accus'd the thief of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glarie? Look here: This is a Lawyers skull. There was a tongue in't once, a damnable eloquent tongue, that would almost have perswaded any man to the gallows. This was a turbulent busie fellow, till death gave him his <hi>Quietus est.</hi> And yet I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to rob him of his gown, and the rest of his habillements, to the very buckrum-bag, not leaving him so much as a poore half-peny to pay for his wafrage: and yet the good man ne're re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin'd at it. Had he been alive, and were to have pleaded against
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:16040:40"/>
me, how would he have thundred it? —Behold (most grave Judges) a fact of that horrour and height in sinne, so abominable, so detestable in the eyes of heaven and earth, that never any but this dayes cause presented to the admiration of your eares. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not speak it without trembling, 'tis so new, so unus'd, so unheard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a villanie! But that I know your Lordships confident of the honestie of your poore Oratour, I should not hope by all my reasons, grounds, testimonies, arguments, and perswasions to gain your belief. This man, said I man? this monster rather: but monster is too easie a name: this devil, this incarnate devil, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lost all honesty, and abjur'd the profession of vertue, Rob'd, (a sinne in the action.) But who? The dead. What need I aggravate the fault? the naming the action is sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne him. I say, he rob'd the dead. The dead! Had he rob'd the living, it had been more pardonable: but to rob the dead of their clothes, the poore impotent dead, that can neither card, nor spin, nor make new ones, O 'tis most audacious and intolerable! —Now you have well spoke, why do you not after all this Rhetorick, put your hand behinde you, to receive some more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions backward? Now a man may clappe you o'th' cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combe with his spade, and never stand in fear of an action of batterie.</p>
