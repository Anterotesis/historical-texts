            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> William Wheelers Case from
his own Relation.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving been imployed in <hi>Norfolke, Suffolke,</hi> and some
other Countreys, as Engineer for Sea-breaches,
drayning of Fennes, Architecture, Plantations,
&amp;c. I found that the Name of a Traveller, and
the forrein acquisition of skill did adde that cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
and repute to Artists, which no Native is allowed in his
own Countrey amongst his own kindred, and acquaintance:
whereupon I took the resolution to imbarke for <hi>Holland,</hi> and
there either to improve my abilities, or the value of my abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
by conversing with strangers.</p>
            <p>Being arriv'd there about Christmas, 1638. I spent some
time in passing from place to place, viewing the Mills and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-works
of that Countrey, and it soon appear'd to me, that
there were great defects therein, which I (God assisting me) by
my own inventions was able to alter, and amend to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
benefit, and profit of the States. By the advise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and assistance of Sir <hi>William Boswell</hi> (to whom I addressed
my self first, as being His Majesties Resident in those parts) I
made Propositions to the States Generall with some overtures
of my particular Inventions, and did refer the same to ocular
demonstrations, and publick experiments. The Propositions
were entertained, and proofs by Plots, and Models were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded;
but because the benefit of my undertakings would
arise to so vast a revenue, if I could accomplish them (as was
obvious to every common understanding <hi>primâ facie)</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I was the more distrusted. The heads of my Propositions
were: To Draine; or to Drowne Lands; to raise great waters
to reasonable heights, from three Foot to six, &amp;c. to raise rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
quantities of water to great heights, and both these,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51820:2"/>
cheaper by one half then before, and double in quantities, if
not more. Likewise to bore Timber with a wooden Augur,
bigger and cheaper: to put and drive great piles into the
ground without beetles, or the usuall moliminous Instruments
of contusion. And lastly, to raise, and carrie from place to
place all ponderous weights more easie, and cheap, then had
ever been yet discovered.</p>
            <p>Within the space of half a yeer some small Models were
perfected, and view'd by three of the States Generall at the L.
<hi>Rippedays</hi> House (He being one of the said 3 Commissioners
appointed for that purpose) and publick approbation was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
thereunto. In <hi>June,</hi> 1639. I had a Patent granted by the
States Generall for the putting in execution, and for the sole
usage of those my Inventions for twelve yeers: and in <hi>July</hi>
following I obtained an other speciall grant of the same from
the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>West-Freisland.</hi> After this I began to
frame bigger and larger Engines, and in <hi>September</hi> following, I
gave proofs of their efficacie, and operation in publick, at the
<hi>Hague;</hi> and then it was manifest, that as the Models did more
then answer my promises, so the Engines did more then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
that which was expected from the Models.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Aurange</hi> upon a sight of my Models graced me
with a present of 20 guilders to buy me a payre of gloves; and
afterwards when the force of my Engines was openly tryed at
the <hi>Hague,</hi> the States Generall gave me 400 guilders as a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of their liking, and allowance. My Engines were vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
of severall fashions, and for severall uses, so framed that
they were easily portable, and removable from place to place,
readily to be erected any where in a little time. One of these
Engines tryed its efficacy upon a Graft or Mote at the <hi>Hague</hi> in
the presence of divers of the States Generall, as also of <hi>Holland</hi>
and <hi>West-Freisland,</hi> and the Lords of <hi>Leydon</hi> having severall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists
with them out of severall other Towns, and at that time
it carried a thousand barrels an houre being moved onely by
the hand of one or 2 men raising the water to 2 foot or more,
and greatly satisfying all spectators.</p>
            <p>For my further encouragement also in <hi>Jan.</hi> 1641, my Patents
were renewed from 12 yeers, and a prolongation to 18 was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51820:2"/>
granted; and the words did mention that the Inventions were
new, never before practised by any, and that they were of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
benefit, and therupon a greater penalty was added against
all such as should trespasse upon me by imitating, or using the
same to my prejudice without my leave. But presently upon
this the seene began to change with me; for whilest I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credited,
I was below envy, and so I found offices of friendship
from many, and no ill offices from any; but as soon as I had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to any belief, and so to eminencie, by abiding the test,
both my skill, and the incredible advantages which seemed to
attend the same, drew upon me infinite enmities, and opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
This neverthelesse I must observe, that my chiefest adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
were such, as were my own Countreymen, such as I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
most friendship from, such as I had most intrusted, or
most ingaged (as I thought) by my service, and credence, and
so by consequence had most power and opportunitie to undo
me. And that I may not asperse any unjustly, this shall be a
particular account to the world, what Sir <hi>Rob. Honywood,</hi> Sir
<hi>Will. Boswell,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gwyn</hi> his Secretary (and some others his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants)
what <hi>Palmer</hi> my Sollicitor, <hi>Robinson</hi> my man, one <hi>Horne</hi>
the Fabrick of Leydon, but of English extraction; as also one
<hi>Sasse</hi> a game-keeper to the Prince of Aurange, with divers other
under-instruments have done to ruine me, hoping to wrest out
of my hands thereby either the Honor, or the profit of my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances.</p>
            <p>The first mischief which encountred me in the heat of action,
whilest I was industriously pursuing my infant contrivances
was this: As I was one Evening going home to my lodging in
the company of Cap. <hi>Lucas,</hi> upon the Spie-bridge I was assault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by two of the Prince of <hi>Auranges</hi> servants (and some others
of his guards) and others about 20 in all, and in this unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
fray Cap. <hi>Lucas</hi> had two deep cuts in the head, I had one
stob in my body, and by the same lost the use of my left arme,
never to be recover'd, both of us were left for dead upon the
place, and for nine dayes after, there was no hopes of life in
me. The assaylants fled presently to <hi>Colenbury</hi> for sanctuary,
and those of them which were the Princes servants, as soon as
his Highnesse had notice thereof by the beating of a Drumme
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51820:3"/>
were sommon'd home, and very nobly satisfaction was orderd
to us; but after 18 moneths suite in that cause (though the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents
were condemned both in the <hi>Hagues</hi> Court, and the
Court of <hi>Holland)</hi> and 3000 guilders were particularly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
for my dammage, yet I could recover nothing, but lost
my time, spent my money, and became daily further intangled
in more and more troubles, and contestations. Whilest I lay in
the greatest extremitie of my hurts, not able to take any order
for my affairs, the afore-named <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sse,</hi> of whom I had rented
some roomes for my Engines, and Works, sent to me for such
an exacted summe of money, or else to throw my Engines, and
Works out of doore. I was not able at that time to procure the
money, Sir <hi>Will. Boswell</hi> denied me the loan of 5. li. to prevent
this mischief, though formerly upon my Bond He had done
greater courtesies, and so my Works were broken, thrown out,
and exposed to the view of all men.</p>
            <p>These troubles also brought me into the acquaintance of
<hi>Sylvester,</hi> and one <hi>Palmer,</hi> who undertook as my Sollicitor, but
secretly were Traytors to my proceedings, and such as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
wrought my over-throw many severall wayes long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I began to suspect them.</p>
            <p>The next potent adversary I had to grapple withall, was
<hi>Horn</hi> the Surveyor or Fabrick of <hi>Leydon;</hi> and He being present
at the <hi>Hague</hi> with my Engines were first proved before the
Lords of <hi>Leydon,</hi> and many other of the States, and by some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
which I had communicated to Him, and by the help of
some of my workmen, whom He had inveigled to his service
had most opportunitie to stand in competition with me; for I
was not onely overcome by his insinuations at first, and won
to some confidence in his friendship, but also I was necessitated
to lay my Art the more open to him, and some other Fabricks,
upon whose judgements the States relied, that by satisfying
them, I might convay satisfaction to those which imployed
them. I was now therefore put to a vexatious, and expencefull
triall before the Lords of <hi>Leydon,</hi> after all my former experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in publick, and my severall Octroys granted thereupon,
to evince again the noveltie, raritie, and commoditie of my
Frames, and Mils: and by this means I was forced to send to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51820:3"/>
divers places for attestation, and for some Forms, and Works,
which at last by a double operation visibly disproved <hi>Hornes</hi>
pretences, and in the judgement of all gave me the victory.</p>
            <p>Neverthelesse <hi>Horne</hi> would not so desist at <hi>Leydon,</hi> but in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to my Patents, did make use of my Inventions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I brought my Action upon my Octroyes, and at last
though with much difficulty, did overthrow him, and get for
damages 1500 li. which <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>binson</hi> my man compounded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
my privity and consent for 300 guilders in part. This pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
me above all open attempts, or controversies in Law, but
the more I was secured by publick Justice, the more I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied,
and made the mark of treacherous conspiracies.</p>
            <p>In all places I had quarrels urged upon me, at all times I
found snares spread for me; eleven severall bargains I had
made for the erecting of my Mills in eleven severall places, but
all were frustrated by letters sent from the <hi>Hague,</hi> directed by I
know not whom: and now as these disasters had brought me
into great wants, so my extreme wants ingaged me still further
into many worse disasters.</p>
            <p>One maine disadvantage that my indigence brought me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
was the acquaintance of <hi>Robinson<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> who by accommodating
me with some moneys (yet payed after) in my necessities, and
making himself officious to me when my fortunes were lowe,
got into my service, and good opinion, and by that means af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
proved a fatall traytor both to me, and all my designes.
This fellow held correspondence with <hi>Palmer,</hi> &amp; both of them
incited Sir <hi>William Boswell</hi> against me, and by the correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
which they both held with Sir <hi>Will. Boswell,</hi> and all the
rest of my enemies I found my self every way surrounded, and
cut off from all escape.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robinsons</hi> part was, to discover my Art, to practise it himself,
to reveal it to others, to grant Licences without my knowledge
to my prejudice, to compound with defaulters without my
leave to my losse, to impute his own failings to the imperfection
of my Works, to combine with my greatest Adversaries.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Palmers</hi> part was, to confound me in matters of Law, to cast
me in all Courts of Justice, and particularly to create new ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
as Sir <hi>Will. Boswell</hi> amongst the States, and Sir <hi>Reb. Hony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:51820:4"/>
at the Queen of <hi>Bohemias</hi> Court. He had failed in <hi>England</hi>
of a monopolizing Patent for steele, and therefore he depended
now upon his shifts beyond the Seas, and was a profest Enemy
to all men more ingenious then himself.</p>
            <p>One Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> (to my knowledge) made a new Proposition
in <hi>Holland</hi> for brewing, baking, &amp;c. without smoke, and with
lesse expence of fuell, &amp;c. and had prospered in his fair, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall
designe had not this <hi>Palmer</hi> enviously quash't his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.
With the same impudence also He came to me, and told
me, that I sought to ingrosse too vast a revenue: and that if I
would admit Him to partake, I should prevail: otherwise not.
His jeer was this, Mr. <hi>Wheeler;</hi> I can stop your wheels at my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion:
if I say to Sir <hi>Will. Boswell</hi> they shall move on, they
shall: if I say, He shall forbid them to move, they shall not dare
to stir.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Ro. Honywoods</hi> part was, to exclude me of all favour at
Court, and therefore divers times He commanded me to avoid
the presence, and once He set 2 Irish Halberdeers of the Queens
guard to fall upon me, who accordingly did not onely deny
me accesse, but also tore me by the haire of the head, and this
they confest they did by Sir <hi>Rob. Honywoods</hi> command. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
also an adventurer with <hi>Robinson</hi> and <hi>Palmer,</hi> and did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burse
(as I have heard) 140 li. in assayes, and trying to bring
some Works (begun by me) to perfection, but all proved fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
and successelesse.</p>
            <p>But the most powerfull of all those aspects which boded ill
to my fortunes was Sir <hi>Will. Boswell;</hi> and as (I am confident)
without his concurrence all my other opposites could not have
so far opprest me; so without their instigations, He would not
(I perswade my self) have entertained any thoughts of ill to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
me. Howsoever long it was before I could be induced to
think, that Sir <hi>Will. Boswell</hi> had ends upon me, much lesse such
extreamly avaritious ends, such as nothing but my utter ruine
could satisfie. But my eyes were by degrees opened; for first I
perceived He gave too much care ta my worst enemies, and
then in the Patent for <hi>England</hi> which He procured for me I saw
He had put in his servant <hi>Cropleys</hi> name, and that device (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
other competent rewards) cost me 50 li. to compound. A
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51820:4"/>
Patent likewise for <hi>Ireland</hi> was promist me, but I have it not,
and I hear tis granted in Sir <hi>Williams</hi> own Name, and reserved
for his own use: lastly, my Patent for <hi>Holstein,</hi> and <hi>Denmarke,</hi> is
still deteined in his own hands. I found moreover that by some
dangerous questions put to me at some times about my pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
He was not without some aymes of having my life at his
mercy by the stroke of the Law, if need were. My necessities
made me upon an occasion become a suiter to Him for the loan
of some moneys, but the conditions proposed by Him were
strangely rigorous, insomuch that in a jesting manner I askt
Him, if He were good at drilling. Hereupon He grew much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
and causing His servants to lay violent hands upon me,
He disarm'd me first, and then broke my head to the skull, spur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
me with his foot, and offered divers other ignoble indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to me in his own House. About that time also I was redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to so pinching extremities, that for 25 dayes (besides Gods
infinite mercy) I had no more then 10 Stivers to preserve me
from famishing: and which way soever I turned my self for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
I found my way blockt up with difficulties, so evill an eye
there was over me, that I was prevented of Trust, nay my very
pawns were refused, and could not be taken. Farre was I now
from proceeding in my Fabricks; those Mils and Frames, which
I had begun, and perfected with great trouble, and expence, I
could not keep: after my goods and materials had been part
broken, part stome, part thrown into the streets by the exaction
of <hi>Sasse,</hi> when Sir <hi>Wil. Boswell</hi> refused me 5 li. to save them, I had
built a place my self in a peece of ground belonging to one of
the Lords in the Town, thinking to secure my Engins, &amp; Uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sils
from further violence, but the place was soon broken open,
the boards were taken away, the Mils were spoiled, and no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie
could be procured. My fortune was also to take two of
the theeves in the manner, whereupon with my sword in the
scabbord I strooke them, not knowing how to bring them to
condigne punishment: but they presently escaped from me, and
scarce any thing ever proved more mischievous in the event
then this revenge of mine so taken upon them: for not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as I was walking in the backside of the Town, by the Moat
that runs by the Princes garden, being alone and unarm'd, I
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51820:5"/>
was incountred by the same two Theeves (as I conceive) and
about 8 more, who with spades and shovels and other weapons
fell upon me and cruelly wounded me, so that to save my life
I was inforced to take the Moat and to dive to the bottome for
brickbats to defend my self.</p>
            <p>At my rising out of the water one of the Princes Fishermen
(who had been a ring-leader before in the other fray upon the
Spie-bridge at that time when I was wounded with Cap. <hi>Lucas)</hi>
took hold of my haire and kept me down in the water, under
his boat untill I was almost spent; and then pluckt me out half
dead, as if He had been courteous in saving me. Being drawn
out so wet in a cold season, and so hurt, by the help of <hi>Robinson,</hi>
who then appear'd, I got ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e to his house not farre distant
from the place, and there shifted my cloths. But the said <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binson</hi>
and his wife by that opportunitie got my keyes out of
my pockets, went to my lodging, ransackt there my trunks,
took away divers Models, and secrets of value, together with
some attestations concerning my businesse, as also other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and an ancient pedigree of my Grandfathers, out of
which they eraced divers names. Some of these they carried to
Sir <hi>Wil. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>swell</hi> (for I have my self seen them since at his house)
the rest they kept, or dispersed into divers parts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s knowing that they were proofs to difference my works
from other mens, and to manifest the noveltie, and rarity of
my Inventions. For about a fortnight also during my abode in
<hi>Robinsons</hi> house, whilest I was weak the house was much visited
by some of the Queen of <hi>Englands</hi> Trayne, who were very desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
often to converse and drink with me, and I accordingly
did severall times gratifie them with my company.</p>
            <p>Amongst other conference they invited me to undertake the
charge of an Engineer in the warre against the English Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
making me beleeve they did expect great and eminent
service from me, if I would accept of imployment: and when
I was not inclining thereunto, they endeavoured to divert me
some other way, offering me imployment in <hi>Brabant,</hi> and solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing
me also much to turn my Religion. These propositions
taking no effect with me, I found cause to suspect that the cups
wherin I had drunk in their company had been secretly mixed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51820:5"/>
with some veneficall or magicall ingredients, for I found my
self strangely driven into fits of Lunacie, and not onely distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered,
but also tortured both in body, and mind. My under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
neverthelesse did not wholly depart from me, and
therefore I demanded my keyes of <hi>Rohinson,</hi> but could get no
other answer, but that they were delivered to Sir <hi>Wil. Boswell.</hi>
I desired then that a new lodging might be taken for me in
some place more convenient, quiet, and neerer to my Works
then my former was: wherein <hi>Robinson</hi> promist presently to
accommodate me.</p>
            <p>Upon this pretence He went forth, and at his return in the
Evening He undertook to wait on me (having an other in his
company) to my new taken chamber: but I suspecting no plot
or treachery in Him was led into a Dulhouse or Bedlam. As
soon as I had entred the chamber <hi>Robinson</hi> and the other stept
suddenly out, and the doore was lockt, and bolted upon me,
and I was there left alone inclosed to be treated as a man utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mad, and raving. The place was solitary, and far from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
of people, and as I had no hopes of any help but by calling
out a loud, so my loud calling or hollowing was interpreted as
the symptome of my distraction. Seeing my self remedilesly thus
lost to all the world, but such as had conspired my destruction,
I betook my self to God, and submitted my self to be removed
from roome to roome, and to be ordered in my diet, and other
things as they pleased, and for nine moneths space the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of my martyrdome was exceeding sharp, and exquisite.
Mr. <hi>Gwyn</hi> with other of Sir <hi>Wil. Boswels</hi> servants, and my man
<hi>Robinson</hi> came upon visits often to me pretending to pitie my
Lunacie, and to do charitable offices; but their common pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
was to force potions upon me which my nature abhorr'd;
and when I could not chuse but be reluctant to them, five or six
at a time of them fell upon me with clubs, and staves, using in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressible
cruelties till I had drunk them off. After I had
drunk their compositions I was possest after an unheard of
manner, but these reasons make me think that what I did and
suffered in my fits were not the effects of meer phrenzie, but
some diabolicall art, and sorcerie: for first, My senses remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so with me, that I my self sensibly condoled my own condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and held my self as a slave under those commands, which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51820:6"/>
I would fain have disobeyed, but could not.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I was never subject to the like ravings before that
time, or since.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, my yard did begin to be drawn up into my belly,
my hands, limbes, and whole body was contracted, or benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
or some way tortured, till I did act, and speak according
to the commands which were upon me: the force thereof broke out
of my flesh, brought my nails from my fingers, and almost
my eyes out of my head, and this is not the operation of that,
which Physitions call <hi>laesa Phantasia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, divers odious sents almost poysoned the roome to
the taking away of my breath, and leaving me neer suffocated;
as also divers spirits in antick forms appear'd to me in dances,
and one in the likenesse of a Cat kept neer my roome, and for
divers moneths removed not till I had acted all those parts
over, as they thought fit. Some things I did as a Playstrer; some
as a Bricklayer, some as an other Artist or Tradesman, doing
all things in all Arts whatsoever: sometimes I was constrained
to declare my Religion, sometimes my affection to that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and I could enjoy no quiet at all till I did obey in all.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, these charms most especially inforced me either to
discover the secrets of my Profession, and that ability and
knowledge which was requisite to the finishing of my Works:
or else to use violence to my self, by running my head against
the wall, or otherwise. But in these two the mercy of God most
admirably fortified me: so that I did conceal my chief skill, as
knowing that then they would no longer let me live: and
whereas they had fixed nayls in the wall purposely for me to
beat my head against, I did knowingly avoid the same.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, some things were done by my hand at that time
which no mortall man naturally could do, much lesse could I
being under lunacie, for when they had set paper and pen and
inke beside me, I wrought half a quire of paper in an houre,
and drew some Mathematicall lines without Instruments as
exactly as if I had had Instruments.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, whereas I was inforced to eat my own dung, and
drink my own water, to sit stark naked in the bitterest frosty
nights of Winter, and to take some purgations when my body
was empty, and so could void nothing but blood upwards, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51820:6"/>
downwards, I yet overcame all these things, and came off with
life which (I think) none could have done, that was not mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously
preserved, as well as diabolically tortured.</p>
            <p>Nine wofull Moneths of Martyrdome were now run out, and
yet the faculties of my memory and intellect were not wholly
broken, though much weakned; and now <hi>Robinson</hi> and <hi>Palmer</hi>
who during my imprisonment had conspired with Sir <hi>Robert
Honywood</hi> to imitate my Works, and usurp them as their own,
saw their skill failed, and their hopes frustrated therein. 140 li.
or thereabouts had been disbursed by them in new assayes,
and in trials to perfect some Works begun by me, and operate
without me, but all would not do: and therefore t'was thought
fit that I should be again inlarged, and incouraged to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
those things, which they could not. Some things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
upon my release I did bring to expedition, and some En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
of my own which were of 100 guilders in their hands, I
did make serviceable, and sold for a thousand guilders to an
understanding Engineer, one Captain <hi>Flood,</hi> but I would not
be induced to assist <hi>Robinson</hi> the Traytor in any of his Works,
or such as belonged to his confederates. Being at liberty also I
travell'd about in the Countrey to observe what imitations of
my Works had been made, and I found that in divers places
they had attempted, but not perfected the same, yet at <hi>Leydon</hi>
and some other places by my Inventions, and the advantage
of some of my Models taken out of my Trunks (as aforesaid)
they had brought some Works to a good perfection, even to a
double improvement of what they had been before. I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
therefore by one addresse more to Sir <hi>Will. Boswell</hi> to
make one further attempt in the reviving of my businesse, and
in order thereunto about <hi>March</hi> 1643. I put my self upon his
friendly assistance as my utmost refuge, and desired his favour
to procure 10000 guilders for me, but his conditions proposed
were extreame, and rigorous, and no lesse then a totall forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of all my fortunes was inwrapped in them. Hereupon I
plainly perceived, it was absolutely impossible for me to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with so many disasters, conspiracies, injuries, necessities in
a strange Countrey, having at Court, in the City, in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
every where malicious, subtle, perfidious Enemies to crush
my hopes: and so in <hi>April</hi> following I set sail for <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:51820:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Since my arrivall here, I understand vast debts are in my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
charged upon me in <hi>Holland,</hi> the greatest part whereof
were incurred by my sicknesses, or wrongfull imprisonment, or
by <hi>Robinsons</hi> false accounts, (skores which He has wrongfully
set upon my head) or by other mens unjust pretences, wherein
I am condemned without being able to make defence, or wage
Law. And now for these debts my Patent (taken from me when
I was in the Dulhouse) &amp; all my right is by publick Order sold,
and disposed of as I hear. For a further prosecution also of so
dejected a helples a man, lest I should hereafter recover breath,
or strength to rise again, I am still pressed by Sir <hi>Wil. Boswell</hi> in
his letters to Mr. <hi>Bullen</hi> here in Tower-street, and to others of
his correspondoes: He still cuts me off from all hopes of future
recrutes by disabling my credit, vilifying my Works, dispara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
my abilities, and depraving my intentions.</p>
            <p>This being my hard Case truly stated, and faithfully repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
and since it appears hereby, that as my past sufferings
have been beyond the strength of such a man as I am, so my fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
oppositions are likely to transcend all ordinary resistance:
I make it my most humble submissive Request to the High and
Mighty States, That they will by a publick, extraordinarie
hand of Justice afford me a redresse, and support suitable to
the nature of my unequall'd grievances. Two things I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to make sensibly demonstrable: 1. That the Water-works
in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> have been exceedingly improved to the great
publick advantage of the united Provinces by my discoveries,
since the publishing of my Inventions in 1640. 2. That for the
time to come, if due incouragement and means may be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me, I will (by Gods assistance) yet bring to further perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and doubly advance the same Water-works as they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
improved, and for a further addition also make a new
discovery of some other Works, and Engines which shall be of
rare use and service to the publick in experiments of an other
nature. If these Overtures be thought worthy to be taken into
consideration, I desire the Conditions and proceedings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
may be managed with sufficient caution on both parts:
if these things seem of light credit, yet thus far I have strived
to be true to my own honor, and to do right to a most honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and faire Cause.</p>
