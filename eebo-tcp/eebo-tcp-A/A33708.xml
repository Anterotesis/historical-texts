            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>ON the <hi>18</hi>th day of this Inſtant <hi>April,</hi> there came to my Hands a little Libel ſet forth by my old Friends the <hi>Surgeons.</hi> At firſt I thought it would not be worth my ſpending any time in Writing an Anſwer to it; Till at laſt I concluded, That if I ſhould be altogether Silent till the end of the Campaign, they might in my Abſence triumph
<pb facs="tcp:103614:6"/>
amongſt themſelves, and make the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nthinking Part of the World believe, that I had given up my Cauſe, and yielded all for loſt. To prevent which, I have (in the midſt of my Multiplicity of Buſineſs) ſpent a few Hours in compoſing the following little Tract. The which I muſt own to be full of many Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet contains nothing but truth; and therefore for Truths ſake, I doubt not but the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Reader</hi> will paſs over thoſe other Failings that he may meet with.</p>
            <p>The Charges laid againſt me are very numerous; and were they but as true, I muſt
<pb facs="tcp:103614:6"/>
of conſequence be the moſt vile Creature alive. But I having been uſed ſo much to the Scurrility of ſome of that Fraternity, there is nothing but I can bear from them; and indeed I ſhould be to blame if I ſhould not be content to give Loſers leave to ſpeak. And ſo much the more, by reaſon that their <hi>Diana</hi> (I mean their ill Practices being detected, the World will be ſo wary, as to have a Care of them) is falling into Diſgrace; to keep up whoſe Reputation, (tho to the great Prejudice of Mankind) they will not fail to make their utmoſt Efforts. <hi>A drowning Man will lay
<pb facs="tcp:103614:7"/>
hold on every Twig.</hi> To be ſure, if making a Noiſe, and uſing ill Language, will do any thing towards the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of their ſinking Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, that ſhall not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>As I have before ſaid, ſo I repeat it again, That both the City of <hi>London,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, afford a great many Surgeons, who are Men of extraordinary Worth, from whom I have received many Civilities; and inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcouraged by them, I have been to the utmoſt of their Powers aſſiſted, in carrying on my Deſigns.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103614:7"/>I have had an occaſion once to mention Mr. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>'s Name, the which I could not poſſibly avoid. But I am ſo far from charging him with any thing that is unfair, that there is nothing more. For I cannot hear of any one who hath at any time heard him ſay, That the Man at the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital bled again after my Powder was applied, and had ſtopt the Flux of Blood. Nay, I have been informed, That he was altogether againſt the Publiſhing of that Scandalous Libel, telling the <hi>Authors,</hi> that it was in vain to write againſt Matter of Fact. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Relation be true, or
<pb facs="tcp:103614:8"/>
not, I am not certain. But this I am ſure of, that he is a very great Man, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Profeſſion. And I verily believe he ſcorns a mean Action. I heartily wiſh I could ſay the ſame of Mr. <hi>Cooper,</hi> and others, from whom I never deſerved ill.</p>
            <p>There was ſcarce an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment I made laſt Year in <hi>Flanders,</hi> but there were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Officers Spectators; ſo that if I had not performed what I pretended to, I muſt quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have been detected. But I thank God my Succeſs was ſuch, that I have gained the good Will of moſt Officers of the Army, whoſe Words will
<pb facs="tcp:103614:8"/>
(I ſuppoſe) go further, with all conſiderate Men, than the Scandalous, Malicious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of ſome intereſted Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons.</p>

            <p>THERE having lately ſtoln out into the World, a Scandalous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, Entituled, <hi>Novum Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Chyrurgicum Extinctum,</hi> wherein the Author, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Authors, (I being very well aſſured, that it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by a Club or Cabal of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103614:10"/>
Surgeons) pretend to ridicule notorious and known Matter of Fact. He or they pretend to detect Impoſture, and to vindicate the Cauſe of Truth. If ſo, I leave it to the impartial Judgment of any rational ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Perſon, whether the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor or Authors had any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to have concealed their Names. I confeſs there are the two initial Letters of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's Name prefixed to the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Page, which if they anſwer to the Perſon, whom I have ſome reaſon to ſuſpect, if his Name had been written at length, his Life and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is ſo very Scandalous (he having, laſt Year, been
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103614:10"/>
caſhier'd the Regiment to which he belonged, for his Scandalous way of Living, as I have been credibly inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome of the Officers of the ſaid Regiment) that it had been ſufficient to have deterred any one from read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any more than the Title Page alone.</p>
            <p>The Authors have taken care to ſend this Libel into the World at a time, when I am full of buſineſs in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king my Preparation for <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and juſt upon the point of going away, and ſo not capable of writing ſo full an Anſwer as otherwiſe I would have done, and which may
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103614:11"/>
be expected at the end of the Campaign; and alſo when the Officers of the Army, who would have been my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgators, are gone out of Town.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Hall,</hi> Surgeon to the Honourable Collonel <hi>Fitz-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick</hi>'s Regiment of Fuſileers, who had a conſiderable Hand in writing this Piece, brings in the Major, and two Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the ſaid Regiment to juſtify a moſt notorious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth. The which, when it ſhall come to their knowledg, I ſuppoſe, he will have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe to repent of.</p>
            <p>As for what is ſaid by them concerning the Dogs
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103614:11"/>
wounded before the Right Honourable the Lord <hi>Cuts,</hi> and the Soldier that was wounded upon <hi>Tower-Hill</hi>; if I had time, I could ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make appear the Truth of every tittle I have ſaid in my <hi>Preface</hi> upon that Subject; and whoever will give himſelf the trouble of going to Mr. <hi>Sterkey,</hi> Surgeon, upon <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Tower-Hill,</hi> he will ſatisfy them that the man's caſe was moſt deplorable, and quite contrary to what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</p>
            <p>They ſay I have deſerved ill of moſt Surgeons; which is no otherwiſe true than if to be Civil, and ſhew Reſpect
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103614:12"/>
in the higheſt degree, be to deſerve ill. For I defy any one of that Fraternity to ſay, that I ever once denied them to ſhew what Experiments they deſired, and to let them ſee my Patients dreſſed upon all occaſions. And ſince Mr. <hi>Cooper</hi> is by them trumped up in relation to the Experiments made at St. <hi>Batholomew</hi>'s Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital; I ſhall repreſent that whole Buſineſs to the World, and then leave it to any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Perſon to judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I was fairly dealt with, or not.</p>
            <p>Having made ſome Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before Mr. <hi>Cooper,</hi> &amp;c. upon a Dog firſt of all, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

an Aperture in his <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen,</hi> then taking out one of his Small Guts, and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, of which he was in three or four days well. Then we cut off one of his hinder Legs as cloſe as poſſibly we could to his Body, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſtopped the Flux of Blood, without any hard Bandage, to the great ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of all the Byſtanders. I was then deſired by one of the Maſter-Surgeons of the Hoſpital, to try my Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines upon two Perſons, who were to have the one a Leg, and the other an Arm cut off, which I readily granted. The Day before theſe Operations

were to be performed, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a Letter from the ſaid Maſter-Surgeon of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital, requeſting me that I would come alone, and bring no one with me, that a Croud might be avoided, and his Brethren not diſpleaſed (which I leave to any ones Judgment, whether it did not look as if there were ſome deſign, and as the Sequel will demonſtrate). Accordingly I went to the Hoſpital, with no one with me but my Boy, of about Fourteen years of Age. But (to my great ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize) when I came there, I found at leaſt Twenty of their Fraternity. However know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103614:13"/>
the juſtice of my Cauſe, I ſtaid to perform the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I came about. I confeſs my Powder was two or three times applied, before the Fluxes of Blood were ſtopp'd, which was occaſion'd only by the irregular Application of it by one of themſelves. But after the Fluxes were ſtopp'd, there was no other than mere retentive Bandage uſed, which is more than what any of them can pretend to, with any of their moſt celebrated Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> After our Patients were dreſſed up, and laid to Bed, we went all to the Tavern, where every one ſeemed to expreſs very great ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103614:14"/>
in what had been done. On the Morrow Morning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Tom</hi>'s Coffee-houſe in St. <hi>Martins Lane,</hi> with one Mr. <hi>Clarke,</hi> I met with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Phyſitian, who told me that all was undone, for that one of the People had Bled afreſh, and if Mr. <hi>Bernard</hi> had not been at hand to have taken off mine, and applied his own Medicines, he had Bled to Death. The truth of which I had no reaſon to believe, having ſent one the Night before, and another that Morning, to make ſtrict enquiry how they both did, who brought me word, that they were very well, but
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103614:14"/>
mentioned nothing of any ſuch Accident. However, that I might be ſatisfied ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly in the truth of the ſaid Report, I immediately went to the ſaid Hoſpital, taking Mr. <hi>Clarke</hi> with me. In our way we met Mr. <hi>Blackſtone,</hi> Apothecary to the Hoſpital, who told me the ſame Story the Phyſitian had done. When we came to the Bed where the Man lay, whom they ſaid had Bled again; before I was capable of ſpeaking to him, he roſe up in his Bed, and prayed for me moſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, telling me that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that no Man whoever had an Arm cut off, was ſo
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103614:15"/>
well as he was; upon which I asked him, whether he had not Bled again after I left him: He reaching out his Stump to me, did ſolemnly proteſt, that thoſe very dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings were the ſame that had been put on in my preſence, and that they had never in the leaſt been touched from the time I ſaw him. I likewiſe asked him how he had been for Pain: To which he repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That for four or five Hours after the Amputation, he had ſome Pains occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an Inflamation juſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Stump; but that he had ſlept very well all Night, and was then perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103614:15"/>
at eaſe. We afterwards went up to the Boy, who told us the ſame that the Man had done, ſaying, he was perfectly at eaſe, and had ſlept well all Night. Some other Surgeons having ſaid the ſame thing in relation to the Man's bleeding; I deſired Mr. <hi>Colbatch,</hi> a Stationer in <hi>Cornhill</hi>; and Mr. <hi>Fiſher,</hi> a Surgeon in <hi>Alderſgate-ſtreet,</hi> to go to the Hoſpital, and they being Strangers, the People would relate the whole truth to them; but inſtead of either of them owning that they had Bled, they decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red they were infinitely obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the Perſon who made
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103614:16"/>
the new Experiment upon them, for that they were well to admiration. Theſe Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations were performed (to the beſt of my remembrance) on a <hi>Tueſday</hi>; and the <hi>Friday</hi> following I was deſired to be again at the ſame place to perform the ſame Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon another Perſon; but finding this ill uſuage, I ſent Mr. <hi>Baker,</hi> a Surgeon in <hi>Suffolk-ſtreet,</hi> who was wont to make my Experiments for me, with ſome other Friends, to be as Witneſſes, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Letter, that Mr. <hi>Baker</hi> might make the Application of my Medicines; but there being ſo many (about ſix Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons)
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103614:16"/>
witneſſes of what might be done, they refuſed to let Mr. <hi>Baker</hi> do it, and deferred it to another time. I likewiſe in the ſame Letter, requeſted that I might have notice gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me, when the two before mentioned ſhould be opened, that I might be preſent, to ſee how the Stumps looked, which every body will own, was but fair: But to be ſhort, I was put off from time to time, and never was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſee them at all. Now, if what I have ſaid upon this Subject, does not argue a Combination, I do not know what can; and for the truth of all, when I have leiſure,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103614:17"/>
I will have it ſufficiently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted before a Magiſtrate; nay, the Man and Boy (tho reported to be Dead) will both aſſiſt me in the confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth of this my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p>As for the Caſe of poor Capt. <hi>Rogers,</hi> I know nothing of it, but was told by one Capt. <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                  <desc> _____ </desc>
               </gap>, of Sir <hi>James Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s Regiment, at Mr. <hi>Man</hi>'s Coffee-houſe, before Mr. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> and others, that Capt. <hi>Rogers</hi> being opened after he was Dead, his Heart was found to be pierced. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſaw this himſelf, or had it related to him by ſome body elſe, I am not
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103614:17"/>
certain; but he declared that to his certain knowledg my 7th Experiment was true to a tittle, it being made upon a Soldier of the Regiment to which he belonged.</p>
            <p>As for Mr. <hi>Dun,</hi> I know nothing more than this, That he being in a Publick Coffee-houſe, where there were at leaſt twelve People, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of two or three Wounds he had received by a Cock's Spur, and that there had been ſomething applied by another Surgeon; his Hand was much ſwelled and inflamed, and he in great Pain, and in great fear of ſome further ill Conſequence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:103614:18"/>
ſo he requeſted me to apply my external Medicine, which I did, and gave him ſome of the Tincture in Ale; and in about a quarter of an hours time he declared before all the Company, that his Pain was altogether abated. On the Morrow he came to me again, and deſired me to make a freſh dreſſing, which I finding his Hand in a good way of being well, refuſed; telling him that one dreſſing was ſufficient. Now he being unaccuſtomed to ſuch ſorts of Methods, thought I had ſlighted him, ſo he applied himſelf to Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi>; who every body will allow advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103614:18"/>
him to take off my dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and make uſe of his; ſo what became of him after, I know not.</p>
            <p>My time will not permit me at preſent, to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon the whole, which however I ſhall take a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient time for. And the World may expect a full Vindication of my ſelf. For it is Truth and its Cauſe I am contending for, and therefore am not aſhamed to fix my Name to it. I confeſs (uſing the Words of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Dr. <hi>Lock</hi>) the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Novelty is a terrible Charge amongſt thoſe who judge of mens Heads, as they
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103614:19"/>
do of their Perukes, by the faſhion; and can allow none to be right but the received Doctrines. Truth ſcarce e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver carried it by Vote any where at its firſt appearance: New Opinions are always ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, and uſually oppoſed, without any other reaſon, but becauſe they are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready common. But Truth, like Gold, is not the leſs ſo, for being newly brought out of the Mine. 'Tis Trial and Examination muſt give it price, and not any Antick Faſhion: And tho it be not yet Currant by the Publick Stamp, yet it may for all that be as old as Nature, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103614:19"/>
is certainly not the leſs Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine.</p>
            <p>I did expect my Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis would have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, and a better erected in its place, for which I ſhould have thanked them; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of that, I find they have neither overthrown mine, nor erected a new one of their own, but have ſtood at a diſtance and barked at me, ſhewd their Teeth, but either durſt not or could not come near enough to bite me in that place where I lay open to them. For in laying down an Hypotheſis, it is as in building a Houſe, no Man can be certain, that he which
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103614:20"/>
comes after, cannot erect a better Fabrick.</p>
            <p>But for my Experiments, I relating them as Matter of Fact, am obliged to ſtand by them, and I defy all their united Force in the leaſt to overthrow.</p>
            <p>To the number of my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, I ſhall add two or three made in <hi>England</hi>; the one made whilſt I was in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and the other ſince I came home.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103614:21"/>
ſome ſuch thing) was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the length of an Inch or more. The Man was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently brought into the ſaid Mr. <hi>Norris</hi>'s Houſe, who ſays, That he was the moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Spectacle that he ever ſaw; but having ſome of my Medicines by him, he gave a Maid-ſervant of his Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons how to uſe it. She made a Solution of my Powder in Water, and with the ſaid So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution ſhe waſhed the Scalp and Scull, to free them from Dirt and Sand that were lodged upon them. Then ſhe laid the divided Scalp upon its proper place, and bound it up. Then ſhe ſtitched up the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103614:21"/>
Lip, and made an Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Mr. <hi>Norris</hi> has ſeveral times publickly declared in the <hi>Grecian</hi> Coffee-houſe, in <hi>Eſſex-Buildings</hi> that in four days time, both the Man's Head and Lip were perfectly well.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:103614:22"/>
exactly of the Wounds, and the manner of Cure, who all declared, That they did not believe there had been any ſuch thing in nature; and that if they had been ſent for, they could not have told what to have done.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103614:23"/>
Regiment of Coll. <hi>Tiffany.</hi> There was one Mr. <hi>M.</hi> a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon in <hi>Bloomsbury</hi> with him at the ſame time, who had dreſſed him from the firſt time the Wound had been received, which was about eleven Days before, it being given with a large Bagonet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſword. It entred about the middle of the Leg, between both Focils, glancing upon the <hi>Tibia,</hi> and ſo paſſed on, that it went almoſt through: For the Point of the Sword made a ſort of a Tumour in the Calf; it wounded the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but the Artery lying ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deep, the Flux of Blood was not very violent. He
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103614:23"/>
dreſſed it that time, and ſo on for about five Days, it bleeding now and then, but not much, in which time the Wound was much enlarged, for at firſt he could not have put in above four or five Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils; but then twenty perhaps or more, as both Mr. <hi>Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong,</hi> and all the Family, told me. On the fifth Day it bled with that impetuoſity, that it frighted the whole Family: He ſtopt, or rather pent in the Blood with good ſtore of Doſils and tite Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. It continued bleeding thus at times for many Days; in which time (as the Family told me) he loſt about twelve
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103614:24"/>
or fourteen Pints of Blood, even ſo much that he look'd like a perfect Cadaver; his Hands were ſhrivelled, and as yellow as a Hawk's foot. But on the eleventh Day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Wound was inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he Bled again with the greateſt Violence imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which was the reaſon I was ſent for. When I came, Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ask'd me, whether or no I thought I could ſtop the Flux of Blood. I anſwered, I hope I can: For he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before, that nothing but Amputation could ſave his Life. He then opened the Wound, pulling out moſt of his Dreſſings, the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103614:24"/>
Wound was ſo big, that four or five Fingers would eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have gone into it. The Dreſſings were not all pulled away with Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s Forceps, but the Blood roſe in a moſt violent manner. I can liken it to nothing, but to a hole dug in the Ground (of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two foot Diameter) o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Water-pipe, in which, if you bore a large Hole, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Ditch is full to the Brims, and runs over, the Water boils up in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſomewhat high; juſt ſo did the Blood. I put my Fore-finger into the Wound, could feel both Bones very plain (but not the bottom of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103614:25"/>
the Wound) with the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent pulſation of the Artery; I really believe that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery was almoſt, if not total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divided. The Leg was ſwelled to the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, the Blood being extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſated, and filling up the Interſtices of the Muſcles, (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been ſo often, both by too tite Bandage and Doſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels pent in, as it were, by main force, till the greater force overpowred, and made its way through all;) ſo that beſides the often Bleeding, nothing leſs than a Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was to be feared But having made my Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ready, I injected ſome of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103614:25"/>
the Solution of the Powder into the Wound, but it was waſhed away before by the impetuoſity of the Flux, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it could arrive to the wounded Artery: However, with ſoft Pledgets dipt in the Solution, I dreſt it up for that time, and the Flux ſeemed to be ſtopped; yet it bled ſomewhat that Night, but with no great violence, and ſoon ſtopt again. It did ſo twice or thrice, ſo that I was ſatisfied, that unleſs I could empty the Wound of the Blood, and come to apply the Medicine to the Artery it ſelf (the caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103614:26"/>
quite different from what it had been, had the Wound been a freſh one, the Parts being all perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rotten, as will appear by the Sequel) I had little hopes of ſtaying the Flux; upon which I made uſe of the Turnicat, compreſſing the Veſſels in the Ham, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded the Impetuous courſe of the Blood; ſo I emptied the Wound as much as I could, and applied the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution with a Pledget to the very Artery, and filling the reſt with ſoft Tow, uſing no Compreſs, only reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Bandage. He had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103614:26"/>
or no Pain from the firſt time theſe Medicines were applied, except a little Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, Pulſifick Pain, before the Flux was totally ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. After this Application, not one drop of Blood ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, nor did it ever Bleed afterwards, tho I dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him not in five or ſix Days; but in the mean time the Swelling abated, and from the Wound was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged a quantity of coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated, corrupted Blood. I continued dreſſing him with the ſame Solution only, four or five times, in which time he was removed from his
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103614:27"/>
Maſter's Houſe in <hi>Southamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-ſtreet, Bloomsbury,</hi> to a Nurſes near <hi>So-ho-Square.</hi> The day after his removal I dreſt him, and with the Cloath that was applied o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Wound, there came away a large Core, made up of the contuſed, rotten Fibres, coagulated Blood, and ſome Doſils which Mr. <hi>M.</hi> had left in the Wound. This was about three Weeks after I had firſt ſeen it. The Wound within looked very ruddy and well, but the ſide of the <hi>Tibia,</hi> or thin Bone (by which the <hi>Muſculus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus</hi> lies) was bare, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103614:27"/>
any <hi>Perioſtium,</hi> about two Fingers in length. There was an extraordinary Cavity after the Core was diſcharged, and much Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a very ill ſmell, which obliged me to dreſs him oftner than uſual; this Matter was the extravaſated Blood, pent up long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Muſcles, that in this time had formed for it ſelf ſome Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. Yet in three days the whole contained Matter was all come away, the Leg fallen to its wonted Bigneſs, ſo that you might preſs every Part without
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103614:28"/>
any pain; all this while I never put in a Pledget, only ſqueezed in the Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſpread the Pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get over, covering it with a clean Linnen Rag, and the former retentive Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage only. All this while I never uſed any thing elſe but the ſaid Solution to the diſcover'd Bone, which were it a Cauſtick, what pretty work would it have made? Afterwards I dreſſed him not above once in five, ſix, or ſeven days; he daily recovered Strength, ſo that he roſe, and by degrees walked with a Stick. The
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103614:28"/>
great Cavity very faſt, full of Fleſh, the Bone hid, and by the 20th of <hi>April</hi> he was quite well. But this is very remarkable, that in the beginning of the Cure by me, he took every day the Tincture in <hi>White-Wine</hi> or <hi>Claret,</hi> a Quart or Three Pints a day, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was in the leaſt Fever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, altho at the ſame time he never had a Stool for eleven Days, but always ſlept well, and gained Strength.</p>

Within an hour after the Wound was given, I was ſent for, it had bled much, but what with Napkins kept cloſe on, together with the coagulated Blood, the great Flux was in ſome meaſure checked. When I came in, I found a <hi>Dutch</hi> Phyſitian there, who when I propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſtitch up the Wound, would by no means have it done; ſo I dreſſed it only with the Medicines common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed by us Surgeons, and bound it up: But at Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night I was alarmed, that he was bleeding to Death. I made all the haſte I could
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:103614:30"/>

I found two Chamber-pots of Blood that he had loſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I could come to him, beſides what was loſt on the Ground, Sheets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently put my Thumb on the Artery, which beat and bled with that Violence, that it almoſt threw off my Thumb. And altho I made made ſeveral Applications of the beſt common Reſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, I could not in the leaſt ſtop the Flux, ſo I ſent the Man's Wife for ſome of Dr. <hi>Colbatch</hi>'s Powder I had

When ſhe came, I having no Water by me, mixt it with the White of an Egg, and with a Pledget of Lint, applied it to the bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Artery, and another the whole length of the Wound, uſing only ſuch moderate Bandage, as was juſt enough to keep on the Applications. In a moment the Flux of Blood was intirely ſtopped, and he ſlept well all Night; but on the next day he was a little in pain: ſo I took off the Rouler, and juſt lifted up one of the Pledgets, from
