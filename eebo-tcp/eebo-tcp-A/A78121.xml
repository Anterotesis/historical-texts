            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Kings moſt Excellent Maieſty, and the Honourable Court of Parliament.</head>
            <head type="sub">The humble Petition of many his Maieſties loyall and faithfull ſubjects, ſome of which having beene miſerably perſecured by the Prelates and their Adherents, by all rigorous courſes, for their Conſciences, practiſing nothing but what was inſtituted by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who was Lord of all <hi>Adminiſtrations,</hi> Math. 28.19. <hi>and practiſed by the Primitive Christians; ſubmitting to his Maieſtie and his Lawes, ſo farre as concernes our Eſtates, Libertie, and Lives; and ſo, as we conceive, give to</hi> Caeſar <hi>the things that are</hi> Caeſars, <hi>and to God thoſe things that are his.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>FIrſt, then were our Religion as falſe as our Adverſaries pretend, yet were that no ground to take away our Lives or Eſtates: for Securitie being had, for our Loyaltie to our Prince and Countrey (which when wee refuſe to give, wee deſire no longer to live) wee ſay, our Errors in Judgement were it proved againſt us (as wee are ſure by the Word of God it can never be) were no ground for Perſecution; as is cleare by the Parable of the Tares and Wheat, <hi>Math.</hi> 13. By the Tares, muſt needs be underſtood men profeſſing a falſe Religion: which when ſome deſired to have pluckt up, the Lord declared his mind to the contrary, and gave command they ſhould be let alone,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 18.17.1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. <hi>John</hi> 16.2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.7, 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.8, 9, 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1.1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13, 14.</note> and grow with the Wheat unto the Harveſt in the World, not in the Church, leſt men undertaking to pluck up the Tares, wanting wiſedome to diſtinguiſh, ſhould pluck up the Wheat in ſtead thereof, as it hath and ſhall come to paſſe: according to the words of Chriſt, which ſheweth, that ſome ſhall be ſo blindly devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as to kill the Saints, thinking they doe God ſervice; and therefore Chriſt will have the Tares let alone with the Wheat untill the Harveſt: Then who, without ſinne, can attempt to pluck them up, before that time? And this doth no way contradict Gods Word, which ſaith, That the Magiſtrates are Gods Miniſters, to take vengeance on them that doe evill: the Tares being ſinners againſt God in falſe Religion, whom he hath reſerved to be puniſhed with flaming fire at the day of Chriſt; the other being treſpaſſers againſt men, and are juſtly to be puniſhed by the Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 15.14.</note> the ſame Chriſt our Lord commandeth, That thoſe that are blindly led on in a falſe Religion, and are offended at him for Teaching his, ſhould be let alone; and referreth their puniſhment, to the falling into the Ditch.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Lord Chriſt reproveth thoſe Diſciples, that would have had Fire come downe from Heaven, and devoure thoſe <hi>Samaritans</hi> that would not receive him,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.54, 55, 56.</note> in theſe words; Ye know not of what ſpirit ye are, for the Sonne of man is not come to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them. Which ſheweth plainely, that Chriſt would have no man hurt for Religion, yea, though they were refuſers of himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, when the Lord Chriſt ſent forth the Twelve to preach the Goſpel of the Kingdome, this is the utmoſt that he directed them unto concerning thoſe that ſhould refuſe to heare their words,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 10.14, 15.</note> namely, to ſhake off the duſt of their feet for a Teſtimonie againſt them, leaving their further puniſhment to the Day of Judgement. This was cleare under the Law, where none was compelled to the worſhip of God by the Authoritie of the Magiſtrate, but as the Lord did perſwade the heart by his Word. And as this was ſo under the Law, much more in the time of the Goſpel,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.27. <hi>Exo.</hi> 35.5.21, 22, 29. <hi>Levit.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.44. &amp; 110.3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5.2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24.</note> the Body being of Chriſt: as firſt, by the Commiſſion of Chriſt given to the Apoſtles; where Chriſt ſheweth, though all power in Heaven and Earth was his, yet hee onely appoints Preaching the Goſpel for the gathering his Churches throughout the world: according to <hi>Pauls</hi> words, where hee ſaith, The Weapons of our Warfare are not carnall, but mightie through God, to the pulling downe of ſtrong Holds, caſting downe Imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it ſelfe againſt the knowledge of God.</p>
            <p>Againe, the ſame Apoſtle commandeth, That the ſervant of the Lord ſtrive not, but be gentle towards all men, ſuffering the evill, inſtructing with meekeneſſe the contrarie-minded, proving if God at any time will give them repentance, that they may acknowledge the Truth, and come to amendment, out of the ſnare of the Devill. Which plainely ſheweth, that Repentance muſt be continually waited for, and not conſtrained by violence or perſecution;
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.5.</note> and that becauſe Repentance is the gift of God, and cannot be given by man: and therefore Religion not to be forced or compelled.</p>
            <p>According to theſe Commands, the holy Prophets fore-told, That when the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould ceaſe in matters of worſhip, and the Law of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould be ſet up in ſtead thereof, that then the carnall Weapons ſhould ceaſe,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Micha</hi> 4.3, 4. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.9. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1, 2, 3. <hi>Math.</hi> 12.18, 19, 20.2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24.25, 26.2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4.</note> They ſhall breake their Swords into Mattocks, and their Speares into Sythes, Nation ſhall not riſe againſt Nation, neither ſhall they learne Warre any more; They ſhall ſit every man under his Vine, and under his owne Fig-tree, and none ſhall make them afraid, for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it; There ſhall none hurt nor deſtroy in all my holy Mountaine, for the Earth ſhall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord, as the Waters cover the Seas. Which when Chriſt came, he taught and practiſed, and ſo did his Apoſtles and ſervant: Behold my ſervant whom I have choſen, my beloved in whom my Soule is well pleaſed; I will put my Spirit upon him, and he ſhall ſhew Judgement to the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> he ſhall not ſtrive nor crie, neither ſhall any man heare his voice in the ſtreets; a bruiſed Reed ſhall he not breake, and ſmoking Flax ſhall he not quench, till he ſend forth Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto Victorie.

            <p>The reaſon of all is, They who are now blind, may ſee; They who now reject the Truth, may receive it; They who are now Tares,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 8.3. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.5, 6.1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9.1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.10.</note> may become wheat; They who are now in the ſnare of the Devill, through wicked workes, and Adverſaries to the Truth, may hereafter come to Repentance; They that are now Blaſphemers and Perſecutors, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was, may in time become moſt glorious aod faithfull Witneſſes, as he did; They that are now Idolaters, as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſometimes were, may hereafter, as they, become true worſhippers of God; They who for the preſent are no people of God in viſible appearance, nor under mercie, may hereafter become the people of God, obtaining mercie as the Saints have done:

            <p>It is affirmed by King <hi>James</hi> of famous memorie, in his Speech at the Seſſions of Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 1609. That it is a ſure Rule in Divinitie, That God never loves to plant his Church with violence &amp; Bloudſhed.</p>
            <p>Againe, in his Apologie for the Oath of Allegeance, <hi>Pag.</hi> 4. ſpeaking of thoſe Papiſts that tooke the ſaid Oath, ſaith; I gave a good proofe for it, that I never intended perſecution for Conſcience cauſe, but onely deſired to be ſecured of them for Civill obedience. It was uſually the condition of the Chriſtians to be perſecuted, but not to perſecute. And lamentable it is to ſee the folly of late times, and we cannot but grieve at the folly of men, who thinke by humane Inventions, and carnall aide of Lawes and Statutes, to helpe God, and with worldly power and pompe to defend the Churches of Chriſt;
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 26.52, 53, 54.</note> as if he by his owne power were not able to doe it, and to performe his owne will.</p>
            <p>The Church of Chriſt hath formerly beene knowne, by enduring Miſerie and Impriſonment;
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 15.18, 19. <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.3.</note> but it is the marke of the Church of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Chriſt, to terrifie others by Impriſonments, Baniſhments, and Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, boaſting her ſelfe, that ſhe is highly eſteemed in the world, whereas the true Church cannot but be hated of the ſame.</p>
            <p>It was commanded by the Law,

            <p>The example of many Nations, both in Scripture, and at this day knowne, may ſuffice to ſuffer the Conſcience free:

               <hi>Abraham</hi> lived in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in <hi>Gerar,</hi> among the <hi>Philiſtines;</hi> after, with the <hi>Hittites: Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom; Iſaac,</hi> in <hi>Gerar; Iſrael,</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> 430 yeeres; after, in <hi>Babylon</hi> 30 yeeres; yet never conſtrained in their Religion. Alſo in the dayes of our Saviour, how many Religions were there in that Empire of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars,</hi> yet not by him perſecuted, or conſtrained to his Religion.</p>
            <p>It was the judgement of <hi>Luther,</hi>

                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.27. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.22. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9.2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>James</hi> 4.12. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18, 19.</note> That the Lawes of the Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate extended no farther then over the bodies and goods, and that which is externall; for over the Soule, God will have none to rule but himſelfe. And therefore, where-ever the Civill Magiſtrate undertaketh to ſet Lawes for the Soules and Conſciences of men, he uſurpeth that Government and Authoritie to himſelfe, which appertaineth onely to God.</p>
            <p>And therefore wee conceive it the higheſt of Antichriſts impierie, ſitting in the Temple of God as God, ſhewing himſelfe that he is God, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.4. in giving Lawes to the Conſcience, which is Gods Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative.</p>

            <p>Againe, the Churches of Chriſt muſt looke for ſuffering,

            <p>Therefore Chriſtians are to be exhorted, not compelled: for he that will not doe that whereunto he is exhorted and perſwaded, the Goſpel injoyning, is no true Chriſtian as yet;

            <p>For conſider, if an earthly King will take it ſo ill, as ſurely he may at his ſubjects hands, to have any equalize themſelves with him, or to make Lawes for his ſubjects to be guided and ruled by;

            <p>Thus wee conceive it is cleare, That no man ought to be forced in matter of Religion, the Goſpel being ſpirituall, and requireth onely ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall worſhippers, like to it ſelfe: which cannot be made ſo, but by the Word and Spirit of God, which breatheth where and when it liſteth, and not where and when mens Lawes and Statutes pleaſeth; which may make hypocrites, but not true Chriſtians.</p>
