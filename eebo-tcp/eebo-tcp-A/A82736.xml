            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas the Parliament of this Commonwealth having, through the eminent favour and mercy of God, ſate many years in the performance of the Truſt repoſed in them by the people, whoſe Repreſentatives they are; and being in the proſecution of that duty aſſembled in Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> upon the <hi>20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               </hi> day of <hi>April 1653.</hi> were then interrupted and forced out of the Houſe from that time until this preſent day.</p>
            <p>And whereas the Officers of the Army raiſed by this Parliament, calling to minde that the ſame Parliament, conſiſting of the Members which continued to ſit until the <hi>20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               </hi> of <hi>April 1653.</hi> were Aſſertors of the good Old Cauſe, and had a ſpecial preſence of God with them, and were ſignally bleſſed in that Work, did adjudge it their duty (the deſires of many good people concurring with them therein) to invite the aforeſaid Members to return to the exerciſe and diſcharge of their Truſt, as before the ſaid <hi>20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               </hi> of <hi>April 1653.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the effecting thereof, the Lord <hi>Lambert,</hi> with divers other Officers of the Army, in the name of the Lord <hi>Fleetwood</hi> and Councel of Officers of the Army, did upon the <hi>6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               </hi> day of <hi>May 1659.</hi> reſort unto the Speaker of the ſaid Parliament, and in the preſence of many of the ſaid Members of Parliament preſented a Declaration, containing their earneſt deſire, that the Parliament, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe Members who continued to ſit ſince the year 1648. until the <hi>20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               </hi> of <hi>April 1653.</hi> would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the exerciſe and diſcharge of their Truſt, promiſing their readineſs in their places, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came them, to yield their utmoſt aſſiſtance to them to ſit in ſafety, for improving the preſent oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for ſetling and ſecuring the Peace and Freedom of this Commonwealth, Praying for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and bleſſing of God upon their endeavours.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the Speaker, with the aforeſaid Members of Parliament, reſolved to meet at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> the next morning, giving notice to others of their fellow-Members of ſuch their intention: And accordingly the Speaker, with the ſaid Members, being aſſembled at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> the <hi>7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               </hi> of <hi>May 1659.</hi> found it a duty incumbent on them, not to neglect this opportunity, which the wonderful and (as they hope) the gracious Providence of God hath held forth unto them, for the proſecution of what yet remains of their great Truſt. All which the Parliament taking into their conſideration, do Declare, That they are reſolved (through the gracious aſſiſtance of Almighty God) to apply themſelves to the faithful diſcharge of the Truſt repoſed in them, and to endeavour the Settlement of this Commonwealth upon ſuch a Foundation, as may Aſſert, Eſtabliſh and Secure the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Liberties of the People in reference unto all, both as Men and as Chriſtians, and that without a ſingle Perſon, Kingſhip or Houſe of Peers: And ſhall vigorouſly endeavour the carrying on of Reformation ſo much deſired, and ſo often declared for, to the end there may be a Godly and faithful Magiſtracy and Miniſtry upheld and maintained in theſe Nations, to the glory and praiſe of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and to the reviving and making glad the hearts of the upright in the Land.</p>
