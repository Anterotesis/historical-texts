            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Nature of the <hi>calling of the Holy Ghost</hi> is a Subject that would bear a full discourse.

            <p>The Gifts of <hi>these Apostles</hi> by which they were enabled for their <hi>Office,</hi> and which made up their <hi>call,</hi> are set down: those of <hi>Barnabas</hi> in the fore-cited 11 <hi>Act. He was a good man, full of faith, and of the Holy Ghost;</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>call</hi> was a little <hi>Extraordinary.</hi> If we look into times, we shall finde reason to believe those revelations in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. were given to <hi>Paul</hi> a little before this <hi>Consecration</hi> of him in the Text. That Epistle was writ, saith <hi>Baronius,</hi> in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond year of <hi>Nero,</hi> and this separation was in the second of <hi>Claudius,</hi> as may be gathered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in some measure from the <hi>famine</hi> mention'd in the 28. verse of the 11. chap: betwixt these two were <hi>fourteen yeares:</hi> now saith Saint <hi>Paul</hi> when he wrote that, <hi>he had his revelation some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what above</hi>

call'd up to the <hi>third heaven</hi> to receive instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for his office, and for ought he did know, call'd out of his own body too, that he might be the fitter for it; <hi>whether in the body or out of the body, I cannot tell, God knows,</hi> verse 2. and that again, verse 3. They whom <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> qualifies for <hi>Consecration</hi> to <hi>separate</hi> to these diviner offices may be stil'd <hi>Angels</hi> well, when they are call'd from all regards or noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of any body that belongs to them; their gifts and graces set them above the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of flesh: In the entertainment of these qualifications the Soul is swallowed up so, that it cannot take cognizance whether it have a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of its own, and is not sensible of that deer partner of it self, it is so onely sensible of this Employment. 'Tis not for an <hi>Apostle</hi> (or for his <hi>Successor)</hi> to think of things below with much complacency: When these have all their Uses, all their glories on, they but make pomp to dress the body; which an <hi>Apostle</hi> does not designe for, nor knowes whether he be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd at all in. He becomes something <hi>without a body,</hi> and <hi>above the Earth,</hi> who for a preparative must be <hi>taken up</hi> to <hi>Paradise,</hi> and <hi>call'd</hi> from all <hi>commerce</hi> and all <hi>intelligence with his own body.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>call'd from heaven</hi> to preach the Gospel; but he was call'd <hi>to heaven</hi> to qualifie him for this <hi>higher separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> to an <hi>Apostle</hi> and <hi>Church-Governour.</hi>

            <p>And now <hi>you see your calling,</hi> Holy Fathers: and to pass by such obvious unconcerning obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations as at first sight follow, that those who

are not qualified are not call'd; I shall onely take notice hence of the <hi>counter-part</hi> of this call, the <hi>charge God</hi> takes upon him, when he cals to this charge; and that is, he <hi>owns</hi> and will <hi>protect</hi> whom himself <hi>cals.</hi> 'Twas that he promised to the <hi>Founder</hi> and <hi>God</hi> of your <hi>Order; I the Lord have call'd thee, and I will hold thine hand, and I will keep thee, Isai.</hi> 42. 6.

There was Experience of all this in one of the <hi>chief Princes</hi> of your Order; when the <hi>Apostles</hi> were scarce safe <hi>within their ship,</hi> they were so toss'd with waves and fears, yet if our <hi>Lord</hi> will <hi>call</hi> him, <hi>Peter</hi> is confident he shall be safe even <hi>in the sea; Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the Water,</hi> saith he; and the <hi>Lord</hi> did <note place="margin">Matth. 14. 28.</note> but call him, and he went down and <hi>walked on the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">29.</note> 
               <hi>water</hi> safely: as if the swelling billows did onely lift themselves to meet his steps, and raise him up from sinking. And when his own doubts, which alone could, were neer drowning him, and he but <hi>call'd the Lord; immediately he stretch'd</hi>
