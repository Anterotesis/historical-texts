         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Upon the
ANSWER
To the PAPIST
Miſ-repreſented, &amp;c.
Directed to the
ANSWERER.</head>
            <p>SIR, I have perus'd your <hi>Anſwer,</hi> and am glad
to find it ſo moderate and calm: You make
here and there ſome <hi>Perſonal</hi> reflections in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;
but this being done ſoberly, without
heat and paſſion, I am ſtill bound to thank
you, if not on my particular, yet on the Publick
ſcore; For having by this convinc'd the world, that
men of different judgments may now treat of matters
of Controverſie, without making uſe of Satyr and
Scurrility, or letting Cavil fill up the place of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Reaſon. This method I cannot but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
as moſt agreeable to Chriſtianity; And if I
purſue the ſame, in giving a farther explication of ſome
moſt material Points, you have been pleas'd to queſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion
in my ſmall Treatiſe, as alſo in letting you
know my farther ſence of Yours; I hope it may be
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103672:2"/>
done without offence, and that the ſhortneſs I ſhall
uſe, will be eaſily pardon'd, if it be but to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>Sir, You let me know, my Firſt Character of a
<hi>Papiſt Miſ-repreſented</hi> is not ſatisfactory, as not foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on the ſenſe of a Party, and the quotations of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
but being rather my own <hi>Falſe Apprehenſions,
my ignorant, my childiſh, or wilful miſtakes.</hi> Indeed
had I been bred up in a Wood, and jumpt forth into
the world, with <hi>this Character</hi> in my head, I ſhould
have had reaſon to ſubſcribe to you:<note place="margin">Anſwer pag. 10, 11.</note> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
upon examination, I find I was educated in a
well-peopled Town, at the foot of the Pulpit, and
liv'd always in Company and Converſation, I cannot
imagin this Character <hi>ſo my own,</hi> as you ſeem to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
it, but rather <hi>my own, as I receiv'd it.</hi> And
you need not wonder that I did not heretofore, by the
help of <hi>Books</hi> or <hi>Friends,</hi> receive better information,
and correct my <hi>falſe Apprehenſions</hi> of <hi>Popery.</hi> For
indeed, were I even at <hi>this time</hi> to be rul'd by the
greateſt number of theſe, the Character of a <hi>Papiſt</hi>
would be with me much blacker yet,<note place="margin">pag. 11.</note> than I have
there drawn it. There would be, but few ſtrokes of
reaſon or Chriſtianity in it, but <hi>Beaſt</hi> and <hi>Barbarous</hi>
all over. And pray do you ſee Sir, what weighty
proofs are urg'd againſt me, to ſhew how <hi>foul</hi> and <hi>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous</hi>
a Religion I have choſen. They ſhew me the
<hi>Book of Homilies</hi> laying a good foundation, Mr.
<hi>Fox</hi>'s Book of Martyrs, Biſhop <hi>Ridley'</hi>s Writings,
The Publick <hi>Teſt,</hi> A Manual of three ſmall Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes,
by <hi>John</hi> late Arch-Biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> for the
uſe of a Lady,<note place="margin">To. 2. p. 46. 54. 213. &amp;c. Vol. 3. p. 515.</note> to preſerve her from the danger of
Popery. Printed <hi>London</hi> 1672. Then a large Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription
given by Mr. <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> in his <hi>Survey of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103672:2"/>
Popery,</hi> where he undertakes to draw its ſeveral fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
as (<hi>chap.</hi> 10.) <hi>That Popery is a ſink of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh
Idolatry. (chap.</hi> 27.) <hi>That tis a moſt abſurd
and fooliſh Religion. (chap.</hi> 32.) <hi>That it is a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Devils. (chap.</hi> 47.) <hi>That in many points 'tis
more abſurd and abominable than the Doctrine of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet.</hi>
Then the <hi>Anatomy of Popery</hi> printed at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
1673.<note place="margin">pag. 181.</note> in which an Agreement is ſhown between
<hi>Paganiſm</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi> in ſix and twenty Points; and
with the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> in other <hi>ten.</hi> Then Mr.
<hi>Julian Johnſon</hi> who has again ſet forth This Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Paganiſm,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 99.</note> eſpecially as to <hi>Politheiſm</hi>
and <hi>Idolatry;</hi> With the approbation of his <hi>Anſwerer
Jovian,</hi> who aſſures him that <hi>He, with all the reſt
that have ſo thundred of late with the Thebean Legion,</hi>
like it well, and <hi>are as well ſatisfied with it,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jov. Introd. pag. 4.</note> 
               <hi>as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
is, bating ſome irreverent Phraſes.</hi> Now Sir,
amidſt theſe <hi>Authentick</hi> proofs, beſides a great number
of other <hi>Authors,</hi> who undertake to draw <hi>Popery</hi> in
its <hi>own Colours;</hi> what convenience or even poſſibility
had I, of framing any better apprehenſion of <hi>this
Religion,</hi> than was here laid before me: Eſpecially
ſince my Friends were not wanting to vouch the truth
of all this, and to aſſure me; they had heard all this
over and over from Men of <hi>Character,</hi> and in <hi>Places,</hi>
which gave it reputation beyond all queſtion? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
does it appear to me, had it been my fortune to
have conſulted you in this affair, that I ſhould have
been much rectified as to theſe my <hi>Childiſh</hi> or <hi>Wilful
Miſtakes</hi> concerning <hi>Popery;</hi> as is evident from the
Character you give of it throughout your <hi>Anſwer,</hi>
and eſpecially at the end (<hi>pag.</hi> 161.) <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That it is
that you can never yield to, without betraying the
truth, renouncing your ſenſes and Reaſon, wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103672:3"/>
your Conſcience, diſhonouring God, and his
Holy Word and Sacraments; perverting the doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
of the Goſpel, as to Chriſt's ſatisfaction, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
and Remiſſion of ſins; depriving the People
of the means of Salvation, which God himſelf hath
appointed, and the Primitive Church obſerv'd, and
damning thoſe for whom Chriſt died.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But however I will not inſiſt upon this point; He
rather yeild, than be contentious: And becauſe you
ſay, that my Character of a <hi>Papiſt Miſ-repreſented,</hi>
is made up of <hi>Falſe Apprehenſions, Ignorant, Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
and Wilful Miſtakes,</hi> He own it to be no better:
But then, Sir, you muſt give me leave to make uſe of
your <hi>Authority</hi> with my Friends and Acquaintance,
in aſſuring them, that whereſoever they ſhall for the
future either <hi>hear,</hi> or <hi>read</hi> ſuch things charg'd upon
the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> they muſt give it no credit, and eſteem
it no better, than the <hi>Falſe Apprehenſions, Ignorant,
Childiſh and Wilful Miſtakes</hi> of the Relatours. Upon
this condition I cloſe this point; only adding, that
in laying down the Colours of a <hi>Papiſt Miſ-repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,</hi>
I never thought of declaring the Articles of
<hi>your Church;</hi> or by <hi>Miſ-repreſenting</hi> the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> to
<hi>repreſent you;</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 9.</note> as you ſeem to miſtake me: But only
to ſhew the many <hi>Miſtakes</hi> and <hi>Errours</hi> to be found
amongſt <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of what kind ſoever, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the notion of <hi>Popery,</hi> for <hi>Debitor ſum ſapientibus
&amp; Inſipientibus.</hi> And tho you ſeem willing in your
<hi>Introduction,</hi> that your Reader ſhould eſteem this our
complaint of being baſely <hi>Miſ-repreſented,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> no better
than a meer <hi>Pretence,</hi> or <hi>a Deſign of ſuch who go about
to deceive,</hi> by comparing it with the Complaints of
the <hi>Arians, Pelagians, Neſtorians,</hi> &amp;c, Yet we are
beholding to you ſoon after;<note place="margin">pag. 9.</note> when finding ſome of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103672:3"/>
the <hi>dirt</hi> thrown at us, to fall upon <hi>your own Face,</hi> by
your ſtanding ſo <hi>near us,</hi> you then own it to be <hi>groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi>
and <hi>Real, pitying the Weakneſs and Folly of</hi> thoſe
who Caſt it pag. 10. And therefore I believe you will
cloſe with me in this Point, that Miſ-repreſenting is
Miſ-repreſenting, tho from thoſe who diſſent from
your Church. But we go on to the other Character
of the <hi>Papiſt repreſented.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this too, it ſeems, affords you as little ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
as the former, on ſeveral accounts. And
Firſt you move a Scruple by the by, (<hi>pag.</hi> 9.) by
your having no mind to ask, <hi>How the Council of Trent
ſhould come to be the Rule and Meaſure of Doctrine to
any here, where it was never received?</hi> As if in <hi>this
Character</hi> I had obſerv'd a <hi>Rule,</hi> which ought to be
none <hi>Here,</hi> nor is own'd as <hi>Such.</hi> And as to this, I
need only Inform you; that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> is
receiv'd here and all the Catholick World over, as to
all its <hi>Definitions of Faith;</hi> althò it be not wholly
receiv'd in ſome places, as to its other <hi>Decrees,</hi> which
relate only to <hi>Diſcpline.</hi> And therefore in appealing
to <hi>this Council,</hi> for the vindicating all I have <hi>there</hi>
aſſerted, to be the Doctrine of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> I have
done nothing but what I was oblig'd, and is juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
before the whole World: and on the truth of
what I have ſaid concerning the <hi>Councils</hi> being
univerſally receiv'd as to Doctrines of Faith, I'le
allow the whole Cauſe between us to depend. But
this only as to your <hi>miſtake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now ſuppoſing this to be the <hi>Rule</hi> of ſuch Points
of Faith, as are there ſet down for the Belief of the
<hi>Papiſts,</hi> you raiſe your Difficulty (<hi>pag.</hi> 11.) becauſe
<hi>I ſhew no Authority I have to Interpret that Rule in
my own ſence:</hi> it being a thing expreſly forbidden by
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103672:4"/>
               <hi>Pius</hi> 4th. And becauſe ſeveral of my <hi>Repreſentations
depend upon my own private Sence and Opinion.</hi> Truly
Sir, had I, in undertaking to ſtate the Belief of our
Church, Interpreted the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> in my
own private Sence, or Obtruded any Opinion of mine
for an Article of our Faith, you might juſtly have
Arraigned me at that Barr. But you muſt give me
leave here to tell you, that you Wrong me, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
upon your Reader. For ſo far was I from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
this Fault of Interpreting the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>
in my <hi>own Sence:</hi> That I have only deliver'd it, as
it is Interpreted to me and to all our <hi>Church,</hi> in the
<hi>Catechiſm ad Parochos,</hi> compoſed and ſet forth by
Order of the <hi>ſaid Council</hi> and <hi>Pius</hi> 5th. for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the <hi>Faithful</hi> in their Chriſtian Duty
touching <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Good Manners,</hi> in conformity to
the Senſe of the <hi>Council.</hi> And for this reaſon in my
<hi>Concluſion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 172.</note> I appeal'd to this <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> for the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of what I have repreſented to be the <hi>Faith</hi> of
the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> to be <hi>really ſo.</hi> And that you may ſee,
how vainly you have charged me with the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
of <hi>Pope Pius</hi>'s <hi>Bull:</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 10.</note> remember I appeal'd
again in <hi>my Concluſion to</hi> Veron<hi>'s Rule of Faith,</hi> and
to that ſet forth by the <hi>Biſhop of Condom,</hi> for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Character of the <hi>Papiſt Repreſented,</hi> to
be <hi>juſt.</hi> Now you muſt know the Latter of theſe,
drew up a like Character in <hi>Paris,</hi> of the <hi>Belief</hi> of
a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and it being conform to the Principles of
<hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> it quite overthrew the foul
charge of its Adverſaries <hi>There,</hi> from their Books
and Pulpits; and this ſo home, that they had no
other way of preſerving their Credit with their
Flock, than to declare to them, that the <hi>Character</hi> ſet
forth by the <hi>Biſhop</hi> was not <hi>Exact</hi> and <hi>True;</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

another Edition with ſeveral diſtinct atteſtations of
many <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Cardinals,</hi> and of the preſent <hi>Pope</hi>
himſelf, wherein they at large approve the Doctrine
contain'd in that Treatiſe, for the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi>
of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and conform to the Council
of <hi>Trent.</hi> And now Sir, in propoſing the <hi>Faith</hi> of
our Church, as I found it deliver'd by this Reverend
<hi>Prelate,</hi> and ſupported by ſuch Authentick approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
wherein have I Entrenched upon the Priviledge
of the <hi>Apoſtolick See,</hi> of Interpreting the Council
of <hi>Trent?</hi> Or what neceſſity of relying upon a <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Mans Judgment,</hi> as you Phraſe it, <hi>of no Name,
and no Authority,</hi> inſtead of that of the Pope and
Council? The Faith of a Papiſt I have deliver'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Catechiſm Publiſh'd by Order of the
<hi>Council,</hi> or as Explicated by a <hi>Prelate,</hi> who brings
along with him the Authority of the <hi>See Apoſtolick;</hi>
and which part of all this is my <hi>private Senſe or Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you offer to make good this charge in ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.<note place="margin">pag. 27.</note>
As in the <hi>Invocation of Saints,</hi> I ſeem to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
their Power of helping us to <hi>Prayers only,</hi> which
<hi>Limitation</hi> is not to be found in the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
I cannot but acknowledge Sir, that the <hi>Council</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
their <hi>Aid</hi> and <hi>Aſſiſtance,</hi> which we may reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
expect. But there being no other means, of their
Aiding and Aſſiſting us expreſs'd in the Council, or
in the <hi>Catechiſm ad Parochos,</hi> beſides that of their
<hi>Prayers</hi> to God to obtain benefits for us, through
our only Saviour and Redeemer Jeſus Chriſt. And it
being thus <hi>limited</hi> by the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> on this
Subject (pag. 33. Edit. <hi>Pa.</hi> 1681.) with the <hi>Pope</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:103672:5"/>
and <hi>Cardinal's</hi> approbation; I think I need no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vindication to ſhew, that in the propoſal of that
Point, I follow'd not my own <hi>private ſenſe</hi> or <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi>
as you endeavour to prove.</p>
            <p>In the Point of <hi>Merit</hi> you urge this again (pag. 56.)
as if I had <hi>qualified this Doctrine with the dependance on
Grace, on God's goodneſs and Promiſe,</hi> without the
Authority of the <hi>Council;</hi> there being no ſuch qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
expreſs'd in <hi>Can.</hi> 32. read and cited by you.
'Tis true, 'tis not in this <hi>Canon.</hi> But if you pleaſe to
look back to <hi>Can. 26. Sex.</hi> 6. you'l find it there clear
enough to aquit me from the ſcandal of publiſhing my
own <hi>private ſenſe</hi> or <hi>Opinion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You inſtance again (pag. 11.) in the Point of the
<hi>Popes perſonal Infallibility,</hi> which I repreſent to be
<hi>no matter of Faith:</hi> (pag. 42.) and what reaſon have
you, you ſay, to adhere to my repreſentation, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than to that of many others, who aſſert the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary?
But this difficulty is nothing but your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake:
for I do not in the leaſt deliver here my own
private ſentiment or opinion touching this point, in
oppoſition to other Authors: But I only by way of
Narative relate, that whereas ſome Divines endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
in their School debates to prove and maintain
this <hi>Perſonal Infallibility,</hi> yet it is not receiv'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<hi>Catholicks</hi> as any <hi>matter of Faith,</hi> becauſe not
poſitively determin'd by any <hi>General Council,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to the Faithful to be embrac'd as <hi>ſuch.</hi> And this
Sir again is not my private ſenſe or Opinion, but a
bare Narative of matter of <hi>Fact.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I am now to encounter your <hi>Goliath</hi>-Argument,
which ſhews it ſelf throughout your <hi>Anſwer,</hi> and
ſeems to defy all the Hoſts of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> If I can find ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a Stone to fling at it, I muſt e'en lie at its mercy.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103672:5"/>
And it appears thus.<note place="margin">pag. 12. 143.</note> In my Character of a <hi>Papiſt
Repreſented</hi> I pretend to declare the <hi>Faith</hi> of a Roman
Catholick, as 'tis defin'd and deliver'd in allow'd
<hi>General Councils;</hi> and yet tho the <hi>Depoſing Doctrine</hi>
has been as evidently declar'd in ſuch Councils,
as ever <hi>Purgatory</hi> and <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> were in that
of <hi>Trent,</hi> yet ſtill <hi>with me 'tis no Article of our Faith.</hi>
This is the main ſtrength of it, as urg'd by you on
ſeveral occaſions.</p>
            <p>I anſwer it in ſhort; that tho all <hi>Doctrinal Points</hi>
defin'd in any <hi>approv'd General Council,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to the Faithful to be receiv'd under an <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
are with us ſo many <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> and are
obligatory to all of our Communion: Yet not ſo of
every <hi>other matter</hi> declar'd in ſuch a Council: There
being many things treated of, and reſolv'd on in ſuch
an Aſſembly, which concern not the Faith of the
Church, but only ſome matter of <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or other more particular Affair. And <hi>theſe
Conſtitutions</hi> or <hi>Decrees</hi> are not abſolutely Obligato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as is evident even in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> as is
before hinted; whoſe Decrees of <hi>Doctrine</hi> are as much
acknowledg'd here by Catholicks in <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Germany,</hi> as within the Walls of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, or the
<hi>Vatican:</hi> And yet it's <hi>other Conſtitutions</hi> and <hi>Decrees</hi>
are not univerſally receiv'd, and it may be never will.
Now Sir, altho we allow ſome Councils have made
decrees for depoſing in <hi>particular Caſes,</hi> yet the <hi>Power</hi>
it ſelf not being <hi>declar'd</hi> as a <hi>Doctrinal Point;</hi> and the
<hi>Decrees</hi> relating only to matter of <hi>Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
it comes ſhort of being an <hi>Article</hi> of our
<hi>Faith,</hi> and all that in your <hi>Anſwer</hi> depends on it, falls
to the Ground. I have no place here to give you a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103672:6"/>
diſtinct account of the ſeveral matters treated of in
<hi>Councils,</hi> and of the difference between Decrees of
<hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>others</hi> which are not ſo; yet becauſe you
ſeem to require ſome ſatisfaction in theſe Points, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
you to ſuch Authors, who treat of them at large
and moſt particularly the <hi>Conſiderations upon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of Trent, Canus, Bellarmine</hi> and others. This
that I have here ſaid may be ſufficient to evince, that
in my declaring the <hi>depoſing Power</hi> to be <hi>no Article of
Faith,</hi> I have not follow'd my own Private Opinion
or meerly the <hi>number</hi> of Authors, but rather the ſenſe
of the <hi>whole Church, Councils, and Popes</hi> themſelves,
who plainly enough own this, in letting ſo many open
and Poſitive Aſſertors of the <hi>no-depoſing Power,</hi> to
paſs without any Cenſure of <hi>Hereſie:</hi> It being certain
that, were this Doctrine any <hi>Article</hi> of our <hi>Faith,</hi> as
likewiſe that mention'd in the preceeding Paragraph,
of the <hi>Popes Perſonal Infallibility,</hi> the obſtinate Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers
of them would no more eſcape without <hi>that
brand,</hi> than thoſe that deny <hi>other Articles</hi> of our
<hi>Faith,</hi> as <hi>Purgatory</hi> and <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Inſtances I look upon as the moſt Principal
throughout your whole <hi>Reply,</hi> becauſe in them you
have made uſe of a <hi>Medium</hi> directly oppoſit to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi>
of my Book, and which if it had been effectual,
would have ſhew'd, that I have not Repreſented the
<hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Papiſt</hi> according to the <hi>Rule</hi> of approv'd
General Councils, as I pretend; but rather according
to my own private apprehenſion or Opinion; which
I confeſs would have been a <hi>full Anſwer</hi> to it as to ſuch
particulars. But how far you have fail'd of your
endeavours even in this Point, I leave now to the
Prudent Conſiderer to judge. But the way you take
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103672:6"/>
in all other Parts of your Book, ſeems to me not to
anſwer your deſign, nor to agree with the <hi>Title</hi> of it.
For whereas I undertake to propoſe the <hi>Faith</hi> of a
<hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> as he is really taught to believe in
Conformity to the Definitions of Oecumenical Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils:
Bating thoſe Points I have already ſpoke to, in
your <hi>Anſwer,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You either own the Doctrine, to be the eſtabliſh'd
Belief of <hi>your Church,</hi> as in part that of the <hi>Power</hi> of
<hi>Prieſtly Abſolution, Confeſſion,</hi> of due veneration to the
<hi>Relicks</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> of <hi>Merit,</hi> of <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> of the
<hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> of <hi>General Councils,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Or you ſhew the Doctrine I have deliver'd, not to
be the Faith of our Church, by appealing from the
Definitions of our <hi>Councils,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 34, 35.</note> and <hi>ſenſe</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi>
to ſome expreſſions found in Old <hi>Maſs books, Rituals</hi>
&amp;c. as if this were a ſerious way of <hi>truly Repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
the Doctrines of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> Can any
<hi>Religion</hi> ſtand this <hi>Teſt?</hi> Will not many Expreſſions
in all ſorts of <hi>Prayers, Preaching,</hi> and <hi>Devotions,</hi> if ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> prove unjuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and Ridiculous? Let but an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> take this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
even with the <hi>Scripture</hi> it ſelf, and <hi>thus</hi> ſeparate
infinite number of expreſſions there, and ſee what will
be preſently the colour of <hi>all Religion,</hi> and whether
<hi>Chriſtianity</hi> will be better than <hi>Turciſm:</hi> And eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
whether the <hi>allow'd Pſalms</hi> in <hi>Meeter</hi> will prove
the devotion of men of <hi>ſence</hi> and <hi>reaſon;</hi> tho all may
be reconcileable to Piety and Religion, if taken in
the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or you appeal again from the Declarations of our
Councils, and ſenſe of our Church to ſome <hi>external
Action,</hi> as in caſe of reſpect ſhewn to <hi>Images</hi> and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103672:7"/>
               <hi>Saints,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 21.</note> upon which from our <hi>external</hi> Adoration, by
<hi>conſtruction of the Fact,</hi> viz <hi>kneeling, bowing,</hi> &amp;c. you
are willing to conclude us guilty of Idolatry: As if a
true judgment could be made of <hi>theſe Actions,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reſpect to the <hi>Intention</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> that directs
them, and of the <hi>Perſon,</hi> that does them. As if
they were not in themſelves <hi>Indifferent,</hi> and capable
of being paid to <hi>God,</hi> or to <hi>Men.</hi> Or as if your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
being follow'd, <hi>Abigail</hi> ought not to come in,
and ſhare with us in our <hi>conſtructive Idolatry,</hi> becauſe
<hi>ſhe fell before</hi> David <hi>on her face,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 25. 24.</note> 
               <hi>and bow'd her ſelf to
the ground, and fell at his feet. Joſhua</hi> likewiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he <hi>fell on his face to the earth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joſ. 5. 14.</note> 
               <hi>and did worſhip
the Angel.</hi> And as many who on their knees pay
their reſpects to the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>bow</hi> before him: As
likewiſe all the Beggers in <hi>Lincolns-Inn</hi> fields, who
on their knees, with their hands lifted up, ask an
alms of Paſſers-by: Muſt not all theſe by <hi>conſtruction
of Fact</hi> come into the liſt of your <hi>Idolaters?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or finally, not being willing the Doctrine ſhould
paſs for <hi>ours,</hi> in the form I have ſtated it, you appeal
again from our <hi>Councils</hi> and <hi>Senſe</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi>
which I follow, to the Sentimetns of ſome of our
own <hi>Private Authors,</hi> and ſo you come often with,
this <hi>French Author</hi> ſays this, <hi>Vives</hi> ſays that, <hi>Wicelius</hi>
ſays another thing, and <hi>Leſſius</hi> another; by this
method endeavouring to convince your Reader, that
the <hi>Belief</hi> of a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> is much different from what
I ahve repreſented it. But Sir, this way may do
well enough with the unwary; but it ill ſuits with
what you pretend. The Frontis piece of your Book
puts us upon expecting <hi>The Doctrines and Practices of
the Church of Rome truly Repreſented.</hi> And when
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103672:7"/>
we come to peruſe it, we find ſeveral Doctrines pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
but without any Authority of <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi>
but <hi>this Author ſays this,</hi> and <hi>that Author ſays
that;</hi> as if the Senſe of every <hi>Author,</hi> were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
the Doctrine; of our <hi>Church.</hi> The <hi>Church</hi>
ſpeaks to us in her <hi>approv'd General Councils,</hi> and
from them you might have <hi>truly Repreſented</hi> her <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi>
and <hi>Doctrine</hi> but from <hi>particular Authors,</hi> ſome
of which may Write upon a Pique, others upon a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
others upon ſome other Biaſs, nothing more
can be Collected beſides their <hi>own Opinion,</hi> and with
underſtanding Men it paſſes for no more. So that
nothing can be more unjuſtifiable, than to make a
Collection of <hi>private</hi> Mens ſentiments, and obtrude
them for the <hi>truly Repreſenting</hi> the Doctrine of the
<hi>Church</hi> in whoſe Communion they are. And this is
not the Caſe of <hi>our Church</hi> alone, there's no <hi>Church</hi>
or Congregation in the World will ſtand this Teſt.
And if it come a little home to you, it may be you
will be more ſenſible of this truth. For althô you ſeem
to maintain in your <hi>Anſwer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p, 57.</note> that <hi>good works of juſtified
Perſons are not Free;</hi> yet tis not juſt, <hi>this Doctrine</hi>
ſhould be immediately charg'd for the <hi>Belief</hi> of <hi>your
Church.</hi> Althô Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> ſeems to allow <hi>Prayers for
the Dead,</hi> yet neither from him are we to take a <hi>true
repreſentation</hi> of the <hi>Doctrin</hi> of <hi>his Church.</hi> Thô a worthy
Divine declares,<note place="margin">pag. 152.</note> 
               <hi>that in caſe a Popiſh</hi> Julian <hi>indeed ſhould
Reign over us, he ſhould Believe him uncapable of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and upon that ſuppoſition ſhould be tempted to pray
for his Deſtruction;</hi> yet would it not be honeſt hence to
blacken <hi>his Church</hi> with this Diſ-loyal Principle, as if
ſhe allowed her <hi>Members,</hi> thô not to Fight againſt, yet
to <hi>Pray for the Deſtruction</hi> of <hi>ſuch a Prince.</hi> The like
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103672:8"/>
may be ſaid of <hi>King James</hi> the <hi>Firſt</hi> his holding Chriſt
to be <hi>truly preſent</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and there alſo to
be truly ador'd, maintaining in his Epiſtle to Cardinal
<hi>Perron</hi> the Doctrine of the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> to be the
Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> and again what
the aforeſaid Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> delivers of the ſame <hi>Real
Preſence</hi> and <hi>Adoration</hi> of Chriſt in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epil. 1. 3. c. 5.</note>
practis'd in the Antient Church from the beginning;
and thereupon owning the <hi>Euchariſtical Sacrifice</hi> to
be truely the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of Chriſt upon the <hi>Croſs,</hi> in as
much as the Body and Blood of Chriſt are contain'd
in them; and then farther adding, that the Sacrifice
of the Croſs being neceſſarily Propitiatory and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petratory
both, it cannot be denied, that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> in as much as it is the ſame
Sacrifice of Chriſt upon the Croſs, is alſo both Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory
and Impetratory. Will you give me leave
from hence to inferr; that becauſe theſe are the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
of ſuch Eminent Perſons in the Communion
of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that therefore they are the
Doctrine of that Church, I ſuppoſe you will not; and
therefore in the <hi>true Repreſentation</hi> of the Doctrine of
<hi>yours</hi> or <hi>our</hi> Church, I ſuppoſe, you will eaſily grant,
that no appeal ought to be made to ſuch <hi>Private Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors;</hi>
but the Undertaker is oblig'd to keep cloſe to
the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of either <hi>Church,</hi> declar'd in their <hi>Councils</hi>
and <hi>Decrees,</hi> and as explicated by their Authority:
And as far as you have effectually prov'd this againſt
what I have repreſented for the Faith of a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> ſo
ſo far will I allow you have given me a <hi>juſt Anſwer;</hi>
And as much as you fail of this, ſo much you come
ſhort of what you undertake, which I recommend to
your own peruſal to examine.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:103672:8"/>
            <p>But for any of theſe ways they are inſignificant to
your deſign, and deſerve not to ſtand under the Title
of an <hi>Anſwer.</hi> For how does your acknowledging
our Doctrine to be yours: your producing ſome bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Expreſſions out of <hi>Maſs-Books,</hi> your putting Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
from <hi>external Actions,</hi> from <hi>private Authors,</hi>
or your <hi>own Opinion,</hi> any ways prove, that the Faith
of a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> as I have repreſented it, is not according
to the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and what really he is bound,
as a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> to <hi>Believe?</hi> And yet this is the thing
you ought to have prov'd, to make good your <hi>Title.</hi>
But inſtead of this, you generally let your Reader
underſtand, that I have indeed ſtated the matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
and only tell him, that you have ſomething to
ſay againſt the Doctrine, and do not like it. But
your ſaying I hope (or if it could be proving) that
Catholicks do not do well to Believe, as I <hi>Repreſent,</hi>
is no Argument to prove that I do not <hi>Repreſent well.</hi>
This as to the Repreſenting the Doctrine of our
Church.</p>
            <p>I ſhould ſay ſomething to your concluding Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which comes ſo home (<hi>p.</hi> 14.) I allow it ſeems,
the <hi>Orders of the Supream Paſtor are to be obey'd,
whether he be Infallible or no.</hi> I confeſs likewiſe in
another place, that <hi>ſome Popes have own'd the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Doctrine, and Acted according to it.</hi> And here
you infer, Therefore the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are bound by the
Doctrine of their Church to Act, when the Popes ſhall
require it, according to the Depoſing Power. And
does this <hi>bring the matter home?</hi> Why then Sir, you
muſt ee'n give me leave to make another inference:
That, What brings the matter home is nothing but
an ordinary piece of Sophiſtry, and let the Reader
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103672:9"/>
judge. The Repreſenter (<hi>p.</hi> 42.) ſpeaking of the
Popes Authority, ſays, that as in any Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Sentence of the Supream Judge or Higheſt
Tribunal is to be Obey'd, thô there be no aſſurance
of Infallibility or Divine Protection from Error or
Miſtake: So is he taught ſhould be done to the Orders
of the Supream Paſtor, whether he be Infallible or no.</p>
            <p>Where a Parallel is made between the Orders of
<hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Civil Powers,</hi> as to the <hi>Obedience</hi> due to
them from their <hi>Subjects.</hi> Now Sir, if it be your Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that this Authority and Power in <hi>theſe Supream</hi>
Governours is ſo <hi>Abſolute</hi> and <hi>Vnconfin'd,</hi> that like
to <hi>God</hi> himſelf there can be no juſt exception made to
any of their <hi>Actions</hi> or <hi>Decrees,</hi> whatſoever they be:
then indeed your reaſoning Anſwers your intent. But
if the Caſe be poſſible, that theſe may <hi>ſo</hi> Act or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
that the <hi>not-following</hi> or <hi>not-obeying</hi> in Inferiors
may be <hi>no Crime;</hi> then you come but ſhort of home,
and prove juſt nothing. Now change but the <hi>matter</hi>
of your Argument, and ſee how far it goes. The Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of a <hi>Prince,</hi> being Supream Governour, are to
be Obey'd, whether he be Infallible or no: But <hi>ſome</hi>
Princes have done <hi>thus</hi> and <hi>thus;</hi> therefore the People
by the Law are bound to Act <hi>ſo</hi> and <hi>ſo:</hi> Does this
hold in <hi>every</hi> Action or Order of a Prince, without
<hi>Limit</hi> or <hi>Exception?</hi> Tho a Prince be to be obey'd,
yet it follows uot that his Word is the Law? So that
whoſoever takes this for a concluding Argument,
muſt neither underſtand <hi>Law</hi> nor <hi>Logick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not put the Reader in mind, how often you
make your digreſſions amongſt the <hi>School-men,</hi> and
leave not ſcouting among them, till you have loſt the
matter in hand: And diſpute about their <hi>Opinions,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103672:9"/>
of matter of <hi>Faith;</hi> how in the Point of <hi>diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations,</hi>
where we ſpeak of the <hi>Moral Law;</hi> and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
the <hi>Pope</hi> cannot diſpenſe with it, as give leave to
break the <hi>Commandments,</hi> to <hi>lye or for-ſwear:</hi> You
ſhew your learning, in proving he can diſpenſe
with <hi>other Laws</hi> and <hi>Poſitive Inſtitutions,</hi> a thing
ſcarce to be doubted of, and nothing to our purpoſe.
Ile ſay nothing of the admirable cloſe of Your Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Diſpenſations,</hi> in which tho you have not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
one proof of <hi>Diſpenſations,</hi> for <hi>lying</hi> or <hi>for
ſwearing</hi> being allow'd in our Church on any account
whatſoever, you yet give this aſſurance to your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
<hi>We know this Diſpenſing Power is to be kept up as a
great Myſtery, and not to be made uſe of, but upon weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and urgent Cauſes—as their Doctrines declare.</hi>
Where certainly one proof of the <hi>Who,</hi> the <hi>Where</hi>
and the <hi>When,</hi> had been much more Satisfactory, than
the Poſitive <hi>We know,</hi> and <hi>Their Doctrines declare:</hi>
For tho many are willing to take this upon truſt, yet
it would have gone farther,<note place="margin">pag. 117.</note> if you had prov'd it down
right, without taking Sanctuary in a <hi>Myſtery.</hi> Ile
paſs by your dexterity wherewith you have manag'd
the Hiſtory of St. <hi>Perpetua</hi> in the Chap. of <hi>Purgatory:</hi>
Where after you have diſguis'd it to your purpoſe in
the Relation, and drol'd the <hi>Viſion</hi> of a <hi>Martyr,</hi> and
ſo eſteem'd by St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> into a young Ladies
<hi>Dream,</hi> you at laſt ſet it forth for the <hi>Foundation</hi> of
our Churches Doctrine, and would perſwade your
Reader, that Our Tenent of <hi>Purgatory</hi> is <hi>built</hi> upon
it; when 'tis us'd by me for no more, than a <hi>Margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Citation,</hi> amongſt ſeveral others: And yet this is
our <hi>Foundation,</hi> and our Doctrine is <hi>built</hi> on it:
Here I fear, you had forgot your promiſe made in the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103672:10"/>
beginning of being <hi>ſincere,</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 9.</note> and uſing no <hi>Tricks.</hi> But I
forbear,</p>
            <p>And will only conclude, that if you have <hi>truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
the Doctrines of the Church of Rome,</hi> I
would as ſoon be a <hi>Turk</hi> as <hi>your Papiſt;</hi> whoſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
you have drawn at large throughout your
Book, and <hi>in little</hi> in pag. 161. which, however
you may call <hi>truly Repreſenting,</hi> I can look upon no
better than <hi>truly Miſ-repreſenting.</hi> And by what I
ſee, I think I might with as good reaſon go to a <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee,</hi>
to be inform'd of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and receive the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> from a <hi>Mahometan;</hi> as come to
<hi>you,</hi> to know what a <hi>Papiſt</hi> is, what his <hi>Belief</hi> and
<hi>Doctrine.</hi> Neither do I wonder, that you come thus
wide of what you pretend to: The method you take,
would bring a Scandal even upon the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and render the <hi>Church</hi> of thoſe purer times,
of the ſame colour with <hi>ours.</hi> Obſerve but the <hi>ſame,</hi>
in drawing the Features of <hi>your own Chuch,</hi> and then
tell me whether this be the way of <hi>truely repreſenting.</hi>
If a man were but to bring into publick your <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debates,</hi>
the <hi>differing Opinions</hi> of your own Authors,
concerning the <hi>Scriptures, Predeſtination, Freewill,</hi>
the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Reformation, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,</hi>
&amp;c. all expreſſions of <hi>Sermons, Prayers,</hi> &amp;c.
and out of theſe, and all others of this kind, pick out
and patch up a <hi>Religion</hi> according to the beſt contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of the Undertaker, and then ſhew it forth to
the world, do you think, this would be <hi>yours truly
repreſented?</hi> Why then muſt ſuch another <hi>Jumble</hi>
as this be exposed to the World for <hi>ours?</hi> If
you'l let your Flock ſee what our Religion is,
ſend them to the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> the <hi>Catechiſm
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103672:10"/>
ad Parochos,</hi> this wee'l own and ſtand by:
But for you to pick here a bit and there a bit, to patch
as you pleaſe, to make your Inferences and Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
at pleaſure, and then to tell your Reader, theſe
are the Doctrines of the <hi>Church of Rome truly Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented;</hi>
this is to abuſe the World and your ſelves,
and to render us Infamous for principles which are
nothing of <hi>our Religion.</hi> And in Caſe you do not
judge what I have here ſaid ſufficient to convince you,
that the <hi>Faith,</hi> as I have <hi>Repreſented</hi> it, is really the
Faith of a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> I'le be content all theſe Reaſons at
preſent paſs for nought; and that the deciſion of this
whole affair depend upon an <hi>Experience.</hi> Do but
you, or any Friend for you) give your Aſſent to thoſe
Articles of Faith, in the very form and manner, as
I have ſtated them, in the Character of the <hi>Papiſt
Repreſented;</hi> and if upon requeſt, you are not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into the Communion of the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi>
and own'd to Believe <hi>aright</hi> in all thoſe Points, I'le
then Confeſs, that I have abus'd the World, that my
<hi>Repreſenting</hi> is <hi>Miſ-repreſenting</hi> the Faith of a <hi>Papiſt,</hi>
and that my deſign has been not to undeceive, but to
deceive the People. But if on the contrary it ſhall
appear, that the Faith, as I have Repreſented it, is
the approv'd Doctrine of that Church, and ſufficient
for any one to be receiv'd a Member of it, I may
then juſtly renew my Complaint of its being <hi>Miſ-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented,</hi>
that the Religion of the Papiſt is nothing
like what 'tis commonly render'd; and that 'tis a hard
fate, that the Profeſſors of it ſhould be ſo injur'd in
their Reputation, and by this means become ſo <hi>Odious,</hi>
that even amongſt Fellow-Chriſtians, <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> and
<hi>Jews,</hi> ſhall be tolerated with leſs regret than they.</p>
