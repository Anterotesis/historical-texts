            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE TO THE <hi>ENCHANTED ISLAND.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe writing of Prefaces to Plays was probably invented by some very ambitious Poet, who never thought he had done enough: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps by some Ape of the French Eloquence, which uses to make a business of a Letter of gallantry, an examen of a Farce; and in short, a great pomp and osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of words on every trifle. This is certainly the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of that Nation, and ought not to be invaded by any other. They do that out of gayety which would be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position upon us.</p>
            <p>We may satisfie our selves with surmounting them in the Scene, and safely leave them those trappings of writing, and flourishes of the Pen, with which they adorn the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of their Plays, and which are indeed no more than good Landskips to a very indifferent Picture. I must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no farther in this argument, lest I run my self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my excuse for writing this. Give me leave there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to tell you, Reader, that I do it not to set a value on any thing I have written in this Play, but out of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to the memory of Sir <hi>William Davenant,</hi> who did
<pb facs="tcp:62017:3"/>
me the honour to joyn me with him in the alteration of it.</p>
            <p>It was originally <hi>Shakespear's:</hi> a Poet for whom he had particularly a high veneration, and whom he first taught me to admire. The Play it self had formerly been acted with success in the <hi>Black-Fryers:</hi> and our excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Fletcher</hi> had so great a value for it, that he thought fit to make use of the same Design, not much varied, a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time. Those who have seen his <hi>Sea-Voyage,</hi> may easily discern that it was a Copy of <hi>Shakespear's Tempest:</hi> the Storm, the desart Island, and the Woman who had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver seen a Man, are all sufficient testimonies of it. But <hi>Fletcher</hi> was not the only Poet who made use of <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spear's</hi> Plot: Sir <hi>John Suckling,</hi> a profess'd admirer of our Author, has follow'd his footsteps in his <hi>Goblins;</hi> his <hi>Regmella</hi> being an open imitation of <hi>Shakespear's Miranda;</hi> and his Spirits, though counterfeit, yet are copied from <hi>Ariel.</hi> But Sir <hi>William Davenant,</hi> as he was a man of quick and piercing imagination, soon found that somewhat might be added to the Design of <hi>Shakespear,</hi> of which neither <hi>Fletcher</hi> nor <hi>Suckling</hi> had ever thought: and therefore to put the last hand to it, he design'd the Counterpart to <hi>Shakespear's</hi> Plot, namely that of a Man who had never seen a Woman; that by this means those two Characters of Innocence and Love might the more il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrate and commend each other. This excellent contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance he was pleas'd to communicate to me, and to desire my assistance in it. I confess that from the very first moment it so pleas'd me, that I never writ any thing with more
<pb facs="tcp:62017:3"/>
delight. I must likewise do him that justice to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that my writing received daily his amendments, and that is the reason why it is not so faulty, as the rest which I have done without the help or correction of so judicious a friend. The Comical parts of the Saylors were also his invention, and for the most part his writing, as you will easily discover by the style. In the time I writ with him I had the opportunity to observe somewhat more neerly of him than I had formerly done, when I had only a bare acquaintance with him: I found him then of so quick a faney, that nothing was propos'd to him, on which he could not suddenly produce a thought extreamly pleasant and surprizing: and those first thoughts of his, contrary to the old Latine Proverb, were not alwaies the least happy. And as his fancy was quick, so likewise were the products of it remote and new. He borrowed not of any other; and his imaginations were such as could not easily enter into any other man. His corrections were sober and judicious: and he corrected his own writings much more severely than those of another man, bestowing twice the time and labour in polishing which he us'd in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. It had perhaps been easie enough for me to have arrogated more to my self than was my due in the writing of this Play, and to have pass'd by his name with silence in the publication of it, with the same ingratitude which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have us'd to him, whose Writings he hath not only corrected, as he has done this, but has had a greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection over them, and sometimes added whole Scenes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which may as easily be distinguish'd from the rest,
<pb facs="tcp:62017:4"/>
as true Gold from counterfeit by the weight. But besides the unworthiness of the action which deterred me from it (there being nothing so base as to rob the dead of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation) I am satisfi'd I could never have receiv'd so much honour in being thought the Author of any Poem how excellent soever, as I shall from the joining my imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections with the merit and name of <hi>Shakespear</hi> and Sir <hi>William Davenant.</hi>

            <lg>
               <l>As when a Tree's cut down the secret root</l>
               <l>Lives under ground, and thence new Branches shoot</l>
               <l>So, from old <hi>Shakespear's</hi> honour'd dust, this day</l>
               <l>Springs up and buds a new reviving Play.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Shakespear,</hi> who (taught by none) did first impart</l>
               <l>To <hi>Fletcher</hi> Wit, to labouring <hi>Johnson</hi> Art.</l>
               <l>He Monarch-like gave those his subjects law,</l>
               <l>And is that Nature which they paint and draw.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Fletcher</hi> reach'd that which on his heights did grow,</l>
               <l>Whilst <hi>Johnson</hi> crept and gather'd all below.</l>
               <l>This did his Love, and this his Mirth digest:</l>
               <l>One imitates him most, the other best.</l>
               <l>If they have since out-writ all other men,</l>
               <l>'Tis with the drops which fell from <hi>Shakespear's</hi> Pen.</l>
               <l>The Storm which vanish'd on the Neighb'ring shore,</l>
               <l>Was taught by <hi>Shakespear's</hi> Tempest first to roar.</l>
               <l>That innocence and beauty which did smile</l>
               <l>In <hi>Fletcher,</hi> grew on this <hi>Enchanted Isle.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But <hi>Shakespear's</hi> Magick could not copy'd be,</l>
               <l>Within that Circle none durst walk but he.</l>
               <l>I must confess 'twas bold, nor would you now,</l>
               <l>That liberty to vulgar Wits allow,</l>
               <l>Which works by Magick supernatural things:</l>
               <l>But <hi>Shakespear's</hi> pow'r is sacred as a King's.</l>
               <l>Those Legends from old Priest-hood were receiv'd,</l>
               <l>And he then writ, as people then believ'd.</l>
               <l>But, if for <hi>Shakespear</hi> we your grace implore,</l>
               <l>We for our Theatre shall want it more:</l>
               <l>Who by our dearth of Youths are forc'd t'employ</l>
               <l>One of our Women to present a Boy.</l>
               <l>And that's a transformation you will say</l>
               <l>Exceeding all the Magick in the Play.</l>
               <l>Let none expect in the last Act to find,</l>
               <l>Her Sex transform'd from man to Woman-kind.</l>
               <l>Whate're she was before the Play began,</l>
               <l>All you shall see of her is perfect man.</l>
               <l>Or if your fancy will be further led,</l>
               <l>To find her Woman, it must be abed.</l>

               <l>GAllants, by all good signs it does appear,</l>
               <l>That Sixty Seven's a very damning year,</l>
               <l>For Knaves abroad, and for ill Poets here.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Among the Muses there's a gen'ral rot,</l>
               <l>The Rhyming Mounsieur and the Spanish Plot:</l>
               <l>Defie or Court, all's one, they go to Pot.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Ghosts of Poets walk within this place,</l>
               <l>And haunt us Actors wheresoe're we pass,</l>
               <l>In Visions bloodier than King <hi>Richard's</hi> was.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For this poor wretch he has not much to say,</l>
               <l>But quietly brings in his part o'th' Play,</l>
               <l>And begs the favour to be damn'd to day.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He sends me only like a Sh'riffs man here</l>
               <l>To let you know the Malefactor's neer;</l>
               <l>And that he means to dye, <hi>en Cavalier.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For if you shou'd be gracious to his Pen,</l>
               <l>Th' Example will prove ill to other men,</l>
               <l>And you'll be troubled with 'em all agen.</l>
