            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THe Jews at the firſt agreed with us in all, or moſt points, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Meſſiah for to come, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying only the fulfilling or applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof in our Saviour, but ſince the latter Jews finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not able to ſtand in that iſſue againſt us, they have deviſed a new
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170262:21"/>
plea, ſaying, that we attribute ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things unto Jeſus, that were not foretold of the Meſſiah to come, namely, that he ſhould be God, and the Son of God, the ſecond perſon in Trinity, which we will prove both by Scriptures, as alſo by the writings of their own forefathers. For Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it is evident by all (or the moſt) alledged before, that the Meſſiah muſt be God, even the Son of God, indued with mans nature, that is, both God and man. <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where he is called <hi>the ſeed of the woman,</hi> it is apparent he muſt be man, and in the ſame place, where it is ſaid, <hi>he ſhall break the Serpents head,</hi> who can do this but only God?

(as Herolds to great Kings and Princes uſe to do) <q>He ſhall call his name Wonderful, Councellor,<note place="margin">Iſa. 9.6.</note> the mighty God, the everlaſting Father, the Prince of peace, &amp;c.</q> In vaine therefore is that objection of the Jewes, that <hi>El,</hi> or <hi>Elohim,</hi> ſignifying God, is ſometimes a ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a creature, here it cannot be ſo, nor in the next place following, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 45.6. <q>Thy Throne O God is for ever and ever. &amp;c. Wherefore God even thy God hath annoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thee with the oyl of gladneſs above thy fellows:</q> Which cannot, be applyed to <hi>Solomon,</hi> but as a type of the Meſſiah.

                  <q>And this is the name whereby they ſhal cal him, <hi>Jehovah</hi> our righteouſneſſe.</q> So likewiſe Chap. 33.16. over again is he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

by the ſame name <hi>Jehovah our rightouſneſs.</hi> And ſo do the ancient Jews themſelves expound this place, namely, <hi>Rabbi Abba,</hi> who asketh the queſtion what the Meſſiah ſhal be called, and anſwereth out of this place, he ſhall be called the Eternal <hi>Jehovah.</hi> The like doth <hi>Miſdraſch,</hi> upon the firſt verſe of the 20.

And ſo did one of the Jews at unawares acknowledge to me, alledging that place out of the Pſalmes, <hi>The Lord doth build up Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, &amp;c.</hi> that their Meſſiah at his comming ſhould build a new City and Sanctuary, much more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious then the former.

               <p>Firſt that he ſhould be the Son of God, they prove out of <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10. <q>The Scepter ſhal not depart &amp;c. til <hi>Shiloh</hi> come.</q> Which <hi>Rabbi Kimhi</hi> proveth to ſignifie his Son, that is the Son of God Oat of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>

I ſay this Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> being altogether Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, and peculiar to that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it was neceſſary at the coming of the Meſſiah, the ſame ſhould be aboliſhed, and a more general and perfect Law given and eſtabliſhed, a Law that ſhould be common to all men, ſerve for all countries, times, places, and perſons, otherwiſe how could the Gentiles be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Covenant, as well as the Jews, how could all theſe nations ſo far diſtant from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> repair thrice every year thither, how ſhould every woman dwelling in the Eaſt or weſt India's repair thither for her purification, after every Childbirth, as by the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhe was commanded, <hi>Levit.</hi> 12.

was given to continue but for a time even till the comming of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, and then another to come in place to continue, till the worlds end.

ſhall the Altar of the Lord be in the midſt of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and a pillar by the border thereof, unto the Lord.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170262:28"/>
of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which dependeth principally thereupon. Secondly, that among the Gentiles there ſhould be a pure manner of Sacrifice, more grateful unto God then the other, not limitted either in reſpect of time or place, as the Moſaical Law and Sacrifice was. For ſo ſaith God in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> 
                  <q>I gave them ſtatutes which were not good,<note place="margin">Ezek. 20.25</note> and judgements, wherein they ſhal not live, that is not good to continue perpetually, nor ſhal they live in them any longer, but til the time by me appointed.</q> Of which time he determineth more particularly by <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in theſe word, <q>Behold the days come, ſaith the Lord,<note place="margin">Ier. 31.31</note> that I will make a new Covenant with the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> not according to that Covenant which I made with their Fathers, &amp;c.</q> Where you ſee a new Covenant or Teſtament promiſed different from the old, Whereupon I conclude, the old Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> by the Meſſiah muſt be changed into a New.</p>

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170262:29"/>
Earth, forſooth, did move, and the Heavens ſtand ſtill: and how far they are degenerate, not only from all true light and underſtanding in heavenly matters, but alſo even from common ſenſe and reaſon it ſelf in things of that nature tending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>And firſt for the time. <hi>Daniel</hi> who lived in the firſt Monarchy, foretold that there ſhould be three Monarchies more, the laſt the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of all, to wit, the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and then the Eternal King or Meſſiah ſhould come, his words are theſe. <hi>In the days of theſe Kings, ſhall the God of Heaven ſer up a Kingdom which ſhall I never be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,</hi> Dan. 2.44. And juſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this time was the Meſſiah born, namely in the days of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus Ceſar, Luk.</hi> 2. (as both we Chriſtians account and the Jews ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge) even in thoſe Halcyon days of peace, when the Temple gates of <hi>Janus</hi> were commanded to be ſhut, and upon that very day when <hi>Auguſtus</hi> commanded that no man ſhould cal him Lord, was this
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170262:29"/>
Prince of Peace born. Therefore to him agreeth this circumſtance of time very fitly, moſt vainly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do the Jews after this time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect another.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Jacob</hi> who lived many yeares before,<note place="margin">Gen. 49.10.</note> propheſied of this time very preciſely, as already hath been alledged, that the Meſſiah whom he there called <hi>Shiloh,</hi> ſhould come at that time, when the Scepter or Government Regal was departed from the houſe of <hi>Judah,</hi> which was in the days of <hi>Herod,</hi> and never till then, who firſt uſurped that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his Father-in-Law King <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus</hi> with all his off-ſpring of the blood Royal of <hi>Judah,</hi> together with the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> put to death.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170262:30"/>
moſt vainly therefore do the Jews after this time expect any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, God himſelfe ſaith by his Prophet <hi>Haggai,</hi> that the Meſſiah whom he there calleth <hi>The deſired of all Nations:</hi> ſhall come in the time of the ſecond Temple, which was then but new built, far inferiour in ſtatelineſs and glory to the former built by <hi>Solomon,</hi> which the old men in the book of <hi>Ezra</hi> teſtifie by their weeping when they ſaw this ſecond Temple,<note place="margin">Ezr. 3.12.</note> and remembred the glory of the firſt. The words of the Lord by his Prophet <hi>Haggai,</hi> are theſe. <q>Speak unto <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> who is left among you that ſaw this houſe in her firſt glory, and how do you ſee it now?</q> it is not in your eyes in compariſon of it as nothing? yet now <q>be of good cheer O <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> for thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, yet a little while and I will ſhake the Heavens and the Earth, and the Sea, and the dry Land. And I will move all Nations, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of all Nations ſhal come, and I wil fil this houſe with glory, ſaith
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170262:30"/>
the Lord of Hoſts.</q> The glory of <q>this laſt houſe ſhal be greater then the firſt, &amp;c.</q> which muſt needs be underſtood of the comming of the Meſſiah, to wit, his perſonal preſence in this ſecond Temple, in whom is the fulneſs of glory, and therefore could he and none other, fil it with glory, being himſelf indeed the <hi>King of glory.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 24.7</note> 
                  <q>Lift up your heads O ye gates, and be ye lift up ye e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting doors, and the King of glory ſhal come in.</q> So doth <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachy</hi> propheſie in theſe words. <q>The Lord whom ye ſeek ſhal ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily come to his Temple,<note place="margin">Mal. 3.1.</note> even the Meſſenger of the Covenant whom ye deſire, behold he ſhal come, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, &amp;c.</q> And ſo indeed he did, for Chriſt Jeſus came into the world during this ſecond Temple, and did himſelf likewiſe foretel the deſtruction thereof, which came to paſs even in that age. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to him agreeth this Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time very fitly, moſt vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therefore do the Jews after this time, to wit, the deſtruction of the ſecond Temple expect any further.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:170262:31"/>Fourthly, the Meſſiah by the true computation of <hi>Daniels</hi> Propheſie, accounting his Hebdomades or Weeks for ſo many years to be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed by ſeven: that is to ſay, Weeks of Years (as they muſt needs be underſtood) was to come juſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the time before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his words are theſe: <q>Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people, and upon thine holy City: know therefore, and underſtand, that from the going forth of the Commandement to bring again the people, and to build <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Meſſiah the Prince, ſhal be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven weeks, and threeſcore and two weeks. And after threeſcore and two weeks ſhal the Meſſiah be ſlain and not for himſelf. And the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Prince that ſhal come, ſhal deſtroy the City and Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, and he ſhal confirm the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with many for one week, and in the midſt of the week he ſhal cauſe the ſacrifice and obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to ceaſe.</q> Which Hebdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mades, or weeks of years, whether we account from the firſt year of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170262:31"/>
                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> who firſt determined the Jews reduction, or from the ſecond of <hi>Darius,</hi> who confirmed, and put the ſame in execution, or from the twentieth year of <hi>Darius,</hi> for that he then made a new Edict in the favour of <hi>Nehemias,</hi> and ſent him into <hi>Jury:</hi> every way they will end in the reign of <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> under whom Chriſt was born, or in the reign of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> under whom he ſuffered. And by no interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can it be avoided, but that this time is now our, above one thouſand five hundred years. Beſides this being a clear propheſie of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah (howſoever ſomewhat more intricate and obſcure, in reſpect of the years, wherein the Prophet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludeth to the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> as ſome think) muſt needs be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted according to the former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies alſo of the Meſſiah. And ſo doth the Prophet expound himſelf in the former words, namely, That the Meſſiah ſhould be ſlain, before the deſtruction of the City and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary. Yet is there one week more to make up the number of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170262:32"/>
in the midſt of which week the Meſſiah ſhould be ſlain, which came to paſs accordingly, for in the midſt of that week, that is, about three years and an half after his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſt Jeſus the true Meſſiah was ſlain, <hi>and not for himſelf,</hi> for <hi>Pilate</hi> could find no fault in him: <hi>I finde no fault in the man, I find no cauſe of death in him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 23.14.22. Mat. 27. Iſa. 53.5.</note> 
                  <hi>I am innocent of the blood of this juſt man, look ye to it.</hi> Not for himſelf, but for us was he wounded (as ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah</hi>) <hi>He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions.</hi> Therefore to him doth this circumſtance of time bear witneſs, and conſequently the Jews after theſe times by God himſelf ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Meſſiah, expecting yet for another, beſides the vanity of this their expectation, they make God himſelf a lyar, yea and all their forefathers, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 8.56. Act. 3.21.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170262:32"/>
glad.</hi> All theſe make they Lyars with themſelves whereby they ſhew themſelves, rather to be the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Devil, <hi>who is the Father of lyes,</hi> then of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who is the Father of the Faithful only. For ſo did that vile Serpent at the firſt, even dare to give God himſelf the lye (as it is in <hi>Geneſis</hi>) God ſaith there to <hi>Adam: In the day that thou eateſt of ſuch a tree thou ſhalt dye the death:</hi>

and ſo forth, with whatſoever elſe their malicious hearts can imagine, their blaſphemous tongues being ſet on fire of hell, are ready to utter to his diſgrace.

Moreover that ſome of the <hi>Moores,</hi> forſooth had brought them word of a People or Nation of the Jewes, inhabiting in a far Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he could not tell me the place where, but firſt there is a River to be paſſed, two Trees growing on either ſide directly one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which two trees every ſaturday, and no day elſe, do of their own accord bow one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, making, as it were, a bridg for men to go over.
