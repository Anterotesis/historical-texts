         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I will ride as eaſily as you, for I deſire to have ſome talk with you about your brother <hi>Scotten,</hi> what think you? had it not been better for him to have been quiet, and have let his fellow ſequeſtrators alone? I beleeve he repents it now.</p>

               <p>Then it ſeems you think the old proverb is true, as good be a knave, as amongſt knaves, I grant you, that if my brother <hi>Scotten</hi> had not reproved them, and complained of their miſdemeanors concerning the ſequeſtration, they had not complained of him to the commiſſioners of the exciſe, nor ſequeſtred his goods, as they have done: my brother heard before that ſome of them did threaten him, that if he complained of them about the ſequeſtration, they would out him of the exciſe office: but not knowing wherein he had offended, was no whit deterred, but being bound by a double band to diſcloſe their naughty doings, did proceed to complain againſt them, what though he did expoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to their rage, he thought it better to do ſo, then worſe.</p>

               <p>You ſeem to charge ſome Committee men, and other officers (I know who you mean) to be knaves, I think you do very ill, for there be many deceived if they be not honeſt men, and very forward for the Parliament: but I am not of opinion it is as good be a knave, as amongſt knaves, but that a man ſhould rather ſuffer any thing in his name, perſon, and eſtate, then joyn with knaves in their knavery, but it will be a hard task to prove them to be knaves.</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>My bro <hi>Scotten</hi> was once of your mind, he being in a manner a ſtranger to them, yet their ſeeming forwardnes for the Parliament, and their cunning carriage, made him beleeve they were men converted, inſomuch, that when they, or any of them ſuffered, he was bound to ſuffer with them, ſpake, writ, and ſpent much money and time in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfs, yea loſt the favour of many great and good men in pleading their cauſe, for my br. bearing an honeſt mind, did think they had done ſo too; and whereas you ſay I ſeem to charg them to be knaves, I do not love foul language, but when you have heard but ſome of their carriages, which are known to many, and may be proved againſt them, then <hi>I</hi> ſhall leave it to you, and to all men, to judge what they be.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>I am ſure ſome of them have fouly ſcandalized him already, but they neither have, nor can prove the leaſt tittle againſt him in his offices, that was in his power to help, and when it is known how their tongues are accuſtomed to ſlander, not only good men, but alſo great men, not ſparing the Parliament, nor the aſſembly of Divines, and other orthodox Miniſters, then it will be thought no marvell if they ſhall deal ſo with my brother: but I ſhall paſſe by many of their miſdemeanors, both in their words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which although they are true, cannot be proved ſo clearly, an inſtance againſt them, and in the behalf of my brother <hi>Scotten,</hi> in ſuch things as are well known to many, and may be fully proved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>If you will do ſo, Ile tell you after, what I have heard them and others affirm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your brother <hi>Scotten,</hi> I would gladly know how you or he can anſwer them, for <hi>I</hi> deſire to be rightly informed, if he be an honeſt man, he is much wronged.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>It is very true what the Scriptures ſay, <hi>Prov</hi> 4. <hi>he that reproveth a ſcorner, purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to himſelf ſhame, and he that rebuketh a wicked man, getteth himſelf a blot</hi>: for I am well aſſured, my brother is exceedingly wronged by them, and by many others that ſide with them, ſince he began to reproove them, and complain againſt them: but I ſhall begin, and firſt I ſhall inſtance <hi>Downham</hi> houſe, they ſelling the beſt of thoſe houſhold goods that were the Biſhops, to themſelves, and to one another, at undervalues, inſomuch that it is grown into a proverb in Cambridgeſhire, and the Iſle of Elie, that <hi>Luke Voyce</hi> ſold to <hi>L. Voyce,</hi> &amp;c. to make ſhort, it is moſt certain, that <hi>L. Voyce</hi> ſold to himſelf, and to his ſons, the richeſt, and the beſt of that houſhold ſtuffe, except one room ready furniſhed and hanged with tapeſtry, for 20. l. to <hi>Jam Whinnell,</hi> which ſome ſay was worth 60. l. I never ſaw it to take any notice of it, and they made my brother beleeve they gave to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113373:2"/>
the full value of them, untill every one cryed ſhame of their doings.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſhall inſtance in <hi>Downham</hi> parke, with the lands adjoyning, worth 120.l. <hi>per annum, L. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>oyce</hi> having a ſhare therein, let it be examined what it hath yeelded to the State, I am ſure it had not yeelded 1.d. when my brother complained in <hi>June</hi> 1645.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Mr. <hi>Pigs</hi> goods ſold, and part of his lands, let between <hi>Ia. Whinnell</hi> and his father, and <hi>W. Nichols</hi> at undervalues.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, ſome of them combine with <hi>Th Wilſon</hi> of <hi>Emneth,</hi> a notorious Malignant to conceal about 120.l. from the ſtate, which the ſaid <hi>Wilſon</hi> was in arrears to Mr. <hi>Dove</hi> a delinquent.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, the better to colour their naughty doings, after my brother had complained of them, they draw on 2. others, and give this <hi>Th. Wilſon</hi> 4. months longer time, under a pretence it was poſſible he might cleare himſelfe of the concealment of the ſaid 120. l. when he had had to long time given him before, which they have done in favour to the ſaid <hi>Wilſon,</hi> and in wrong to the State, and contrary to a former order conſented to by the ſaid <hi>Wilſon</hi>: and yet this <hi>Wilſon</hi> known unto them to be a bitter perſecutor of my brother <hi>Scotten</hi> in the Biſhops times, and a wicked reviler of the preſent Parliament.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, they under colour of their office, joyn with this <hi>Thom Wilſon</hi> againſt a godly painfull preacher, approved of by the aſſembly, and put in by the honourable Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee for plundred miniſters, and made it coſt him above 60.l, before he could enjoy the profits given him by the ſaid Committee, ſuch is their hatred to godly preachers.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, after my brother began to ſuſpect them, he looked into their accounts, and found them to be defective, imperfect, and falſe, wronging the State for their owne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, not regarding their oaths.</p>
               <p>Eightly, my brother complained ſeverall times to ſome of them, that there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, that gathered up ſome hundreds of pounds, and paid it not into the treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers appointed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beſides 160. l. one of them was in arrear to the late Arch-deacon of Ely, which was alſo the Parliaments money: yet although my brother waited long, he could get no juſtice done amongſt them.</p>

               <p>Is it poſſible they ſhould refuſe to let him have his milch cowes, plow and cart hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and mares, thoſe neceſſary cattle upon ſecurity, and that but for 8. weeks, this makes them more and more odious, and I think if theſe things be proved, they will be judged to be unfit men to be imployed in any office under the Parliament.

               <p>My brother ſaith he is bound to honour that Committee for their juſtice, for after they had examined 5. or 6. witneſſes on his behalf, they perceived that malice was the cauſe they ſequeſtred his goods, but becauſe <hi>I.

               <p>The ſame man, I'le warrant you he is no changeling, but <hi>I</hi>'le proceed. As for my brothers ſtanding out 4. years againſt that illegall taxe of ſhip-money, and ſuffered 17.l. to be taken from him by violence in that time, this hath been ſince counted for a good work in others that did the like, and I hope it will not now be taken by the wiſe, for contention in him: for his arreſting <hi>I. Whinnell</hi> in <hi>Iune</hi> laſt at <hi>London,</hi> needs no other anſwer but this, that he knew not otherwaies how to get his money; and for ſpeaking of his debts, and complaining of his fellow ſequeſtrators, I gave you a hint of that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, after many of his debts came to my brothers knowledge, he was forced to reveale them to ſave himſelf, in giving a reaſon to Capt. <hi>Cole, L.

Nichols</hi> lived, and they 20. miles of, if he did not make it known, and diſallow of their doings: beſides, my brother had taken an oath to do all things to the beſt advantage of the Common-wealth, ſo that as I told you in the beginning, he was bound in a double band to reveal them, and could he have had juſt proceedings at home amongſt his partners, when he made ſeverall journies to Ely for it, he had not been forced to have complained further off for his own ſafety: and for my brothers pains and coſt in getting out the former Vicar of <hi>Wiſbeech,</hi> put in by the Biſhop, and was judged to be ſo unfit for the place, that there was not one that voted for him, but when he offered to ſhew ſome hundreds of hands in his behalfe, it was ſaid they needed no other evidence of the ignorance and blindnes of thoſe people that would ſet their hands in the behalf of ſo unfit a man to be their teacher, and that they had need of an able miniſter to teach them better, and commended Mr. <hi>Barthol. Edwards,</hi> and my brother for their good paines, where ſo few joyned with them: and I hope thoſe that ſet their hands for him, will one day (when they are better inſtructed) ſay it was a good work, and help my brother to ſome of the money again he is out of his purſe about it. And as for framing a falſe petition, and agreeing before hand with a Miniſter, that if he could procure him the parſonage, it being worth 200. l. yearly, he ſhould farme it for 100.l. <hi>per An.</hi> this is utterly falſe, in every particular: and that my brother was in debt 60.l to Mr. Nichols, or 60.d. either, is utterly falſe, he owed my brother above 60. l. which if he would have ſet but a part of it off when he received his rent (according as he had promiſed in his letters,) there had been no

more ado<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it is well known; my brother at that time (which was about the beginning of this Parliament) had ſtore of money lying by him, and did lend to poore men at their needs, but owed no money to Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> nor any other man; except that debt for treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe to <hi>Tho.

And the letter he ſent to Mr. <hi>Nichols,</hi> hath no ſuch thing in it, as is falſly ſaid to be; and it is to be ſeene and (the cauſe of it rightly conſidered) deſerveth praiſe: And I hope my brother hath not ſought revenge, againſt <hi>James Whinnell</hi> and the reſt, his complaining at the Committee of Examinations, and accompts being in <hi>Iune,</hi> which was before they ſequeſtred his goods, and ſo could not be in revenge of that: But the revenge will fall upon them, for after my brother had reproved and complained of them, then they to be revenged of him, ſequeſter him: Again to ſeeke to the Magiſtrate for Iuſtice, is not revenge: and ſo did my brother: But they to fall upon him themſelves (who was a Sequeſtrator with them) and ſpoile him as they did, this is revenge in them: Neither was my Brother the firſt moover of thoſe Articles againſt them, but being at a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans houſe in <hi>London,</hi> he heard two letters read, which came from about <hi>Wiſbeech,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the outrages and uncivill carriages of <hi>Iames Whinnell,</hi> and others that fided with him, aleadging that if the Parliament knew what a man they imployed they would not owne him: hereupon my brother ſpake of ſome things that hee and others could prove againſt them.

Secondly to ſhew my Brothers faithfulneſſe and readineſſe at that time which the Parliament muſt needs take as an acceptable ſervice, what though it reſemble the two Mites caſt in by the poore Widdow, in compariſon of what others did. Thirdly to ſhew the evill diſpoſition of thoſe that derive their power from the Parliament, and have ſo ill requited him, as to take away his Cattle and goods without cauſe. After this my Brother had only two ſonnes, men growne, both which hee ſet forth to beare Armes for the Parliament, who have voluntarily Jepordide their lives in the high places of the fielde, have beene in the greateſt fights, (and though I ſay it) they are men that have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved themſelves ſo as they have had praiſe.

               <p>This was a cunning plot indeed, it hath more in it then I underſtood at firſt, for by this one act of ſequeſtring his goods, they did not onely ſo far forth revenge themſelves of him, as to take away his preſent maintenance, and all manner of relief from himſelfe and his family, and diſgrace him, &amp; ſo diſable him from proſecuting and proving his juſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints againſt them, but alſo to force him from the exciſe office, that they might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to the Commiſſioners of his abſence from thence, and ſo to deprive him of that place, as an unfaithful man in the truſt repoſed in him, yet methinks if the Commiſſioners were rightly informed of theſe things, they would not be offended with your brother, he having another in his abſence, for what loſſe can it be to the State if a ſub-commiſſioner be abſent ſometimes, if he be at charge of a ſufficient man in his room?</p>
