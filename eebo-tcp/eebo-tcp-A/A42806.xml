            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Never thought of having an occasion to make this <hi>Sermon</hi> more <hi>publick</hi> than it was in the <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of it: But some of my Hearers chanced to be so <hi>sagacious,</hi> as to spy a <hi>Design</hi> in it, which my <hi>dulness</hi> never thought of; and to report several Passages to the purpose of their Phansy; which I either never said, or not so as they represented: Upon the occasion of which <hi>mistakes</hi> chiefly (I suppose) I have been frequently soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by others, who had kinder apprehensions of that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, to let it go abroad. <hi>This</hi> I now do for <hi>that</hi> reason; for I find that without it, neither the one, or other will be satisfied. I have added some things towards the Conclusion, which I should have said, if the time allotted to these Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Exercises would have permitted. In the whole, I assure the Reader, I intended nothing, but to recommend, and press one of the <hi>greatest,</hi> and yet one of the most <hi>neglected</hi> Duties of <hi>Christianity:</hi> And I am very sorry that our <hi>Divisions</hi> have brought things to such a pass, that men take it ill to hear of <hi>Charity.</hi> And whether it be <hi>seasonable</hi> in our times to exhort men to such a Duty, or no; let those that kn<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>w the temper of the Age judge. If it should need an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology</hi> (and methinks it should not) that I have chosen so <hi>plain,</hi> and <hi>ordinary</hi> a <hi>Text;</hi> I would let those, that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

it, know, That I intend no <hi>subtilties</hi> of <hi>Wit,</hi> or <hi>Tricks</hi> of <hi>various phansie,</hi> no <hi>Wire-drawn Interpretations,</hi> or <hi>nice Divisions,</hi> to ostenate <hi>quaintness,</hi> or <hi>pedantick Learning</hi>; but seriously to mind the <hi>contentious</hi> world of an important part of Christianity, which it seems to have forgotten; and to recommend a Vertue, which nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns all the Affairs of Religion, and all the great interests of men: For which purposes the plainest words are most proper. And I chose such the rather that I might not need to spend any of my <hi>short</hi> time in <hi>Divisions, Coherences,</hi> and <hi>Explications;</hi> which ordinarily signifie very little, and would have hindred my doing any tolerable right to the main Subject.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>OW many, and how great <hi>have</hi> been the Feuds, and <hi>still are,</hi> of this <hi>tottering,</hi> and <hi>broken</hi> Age, there is no man here so <hi>happy</hi> as to be <hi>ignorant.</hi> That such Strifes among Brethren are Unnatural, and Diabolical; and that 'tis a <hi>lovely</hi> thing to see Christians live together in <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi>; there is no <hi>Christian</hi> but will grant: but how the <hi>fatal Evil</hi> is to be cur'd, and the <hi>lovely thing</hi> is to be compast; here's the <hi>Knot,</hi> here's the <hi>Difficulty.</hi> To endeavour the reconciling Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams that are <hi>so</hi> divided, may look like a design to perswade a friendship between the Winds and Waves. 'Tis very strange that <hi>Christians</hi> should be so at odds, whose <hi>Religion</hi> is <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi>; and the <hi>reasons</hi> of whose <hi>differences</hi> are so <hi>small,</hi> in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the <hi>degree</hi> of their <hi>Animosities.</hi> Our GOD is <hi>One,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:102100:4"/>
and we have the same common SAVIOUR; we profess <hi>one</hi> GOSPEL, and believe the same <hi>Creeds</hi>; we have the same SACRAMENTS, and the same <hi>fundamental</hi> ORDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NANCES: And since we are agreed in <hi>These,</hi> what is there left, that is worth the <hi>heat</hi> of a <hi>Dispute? what,</hi> that can justifie a <hi>Division</hi>? Certainly, it is not mens <hi>Pinciples</hi> that keep them so at odds, there is somewhat more in the matter; there is something wanting that would <hi>heal</hi> our <hi>Breaches,</hi> and <hi>compose</hi> our <hi>Divisions. Love</hi> would <hi>heal us,</hi> if we <hi>would</hi> be healed.</p>
            <p>NOW in a <hi>general</hi> Combustion, 'tis every Christians Duty to bring what Water he can, to throw upon the Flames; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, it is the office of the <hi>Ministers</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> to endeavour to promote <hi>it.</hi> 'Tis a plain subject; but such are most <hi>necessary,</hi> and this is most <hi>seasonable</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> seasonable at all times, but principally in <hi>these,</hi> wherein 'tis hard to discern by the <hi>practice</hi> of <hi>Christians</hi> that the Duty called <hi>Love</hi> hath any thing to do with <hi>Christianity.</hi> And yet <hi>this</hi> is a <hi>vital grace</hi> of our Religion: 'Tis the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Gospel</hi> in a word; for <hi>Love</hi> is the <hi>fulfilling of the Law,</hi> and the <hi>Gospel</hi> is a <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Love.</hi> And 'tis very <hi>strange,</hi> and very <hi>sad,</hi> that an Age, which hath so <hi>much</hi> of <hi>light</hi> and <hi>faith</hi> in the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense,</hi> should have so <hi>little</hi> of <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>love</hi> in the <hi>practice</hi>; especially, since <hi>that light,</hi> which is from <hi>above,</hi> is full of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity,</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi>; and <hi>that faith,</hi> which is truly <hi>Divine,</hi> worketh by <hi>love.</hi> This is the Duty which our Apostle recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends in the words, and I have chosen it for my present subject: In Discoursing it, I shall shew you.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) The <hi>Necessity</hi> of the Duty, (2.) It's <hi>Extent,</hi> (3.) The <hi>Excellency</hi> of it; and propose (4.) some <hi>Means</hi> to assist us towards the attainment of this <hi>Generous,</hi> and <hi>Catholick</hi> Spirit.</p>
            <p>For the (1.) The <hi>Necessity</hi> of the Duty; the whole Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is so full, and so express in enjoyning it, that methinks I might be excused from a labour, that would seem superfluous to one, that <hi>knows</hi> the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and not the <hi>practice</hi> of those that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess it: But because the <hi>Christianity</hi> of most <hi>Christians,</hi> is, (if I
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102100:4"/>
may so speak) quite another thing from the <hi>Christianity</hi> of CHRIST; it will be necessary to mind them what HIS was, that they may be perswaded to conform <hi>theirs</hi> unto it: and though mens <hi>understandings</hi> are convinced already that <hi>Charity</hi> is their <hi>Duty,</hi> yet there is but too much need to represent some of the vast heap of injunctions that make it <hi>so,</hi> to incline their <hi>Wills.</hi> I shall therefore briefly lay together a few of the chief instances of this kind; that you may have the distincter sense of the <hi>reasons</hi> of your <hi>Duty,</hi> and from <hi>them,</hi> the most powerful <hi>motives</hi> to enforce it. In order to <hi>this,</hi> let us consider in short, the <hi>Injunctions</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>teachings</hi> of his <hi>Apostles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OUR SAVIOUR urgeth it as his <hi>New Commandment; Iohn</hi> 13.34. and inculcates it again under the obliging form of <hi>his Command, Iohn</hi> 15.12. He makes it a <hi>distinguishing note</hi> of his <hi>Disciples, Iohn</hi> 13.35. and enjoyns them to <hi>love</hi> their <hi>Enemies, Mat.</hi> 5.24 He mentions it as the <hi>great qualification</hi> of those on his Right hand, that shall be received into his Kingdom, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.34.35. and the want of it, as the reason of the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Curse pronounced upon those miserable ones on the Left, at the solemn Judgement, <hi>ver.</hi> 41, 42. St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>Love,</hi> the <hi>fulfilling of the Law, Rom.</hi> 13.8, 9, 10. and sets it in the first place among the <hi>fruits</hi> of the <hi>Spirit, Gal.</hi> 5.22. yea, reckons it <hi>five</hi> times over under other Names in the Catalogue. <hi>viz.</hi> those of <hi>Peace, Long-suffering, Gentleness, Goodness, Meekness, ver.</hi> 22.23. He advanceth it above all Gifts and graces, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. above the <hi>Tongues</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Angels, ver.</hi> 1. and above <hi>Prophesy,</hi> and <hi>Mysteries,</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>Faith, ver.</hi> 2. And the beloved Disciple St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> who lay in the <hi>Bosom</hi> of his <hi>Dear Lord,</hi> and seems to partake most of his Spirit, is <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported</hi> in the commendation of this Grace. He tells us, that <hi>God is Love,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.7. and repeats it again, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. He makes it an Argument of our being <hi>born</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Knowing Him, ver.</hi> 7. and the want of <hi>this</hi> an evidence of not <hi>Knowing</hi> God, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. He counts it the <hi>mark</hi> of <hi>Discipleship</hi>; and the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102100:5"/>
contrary, a <hi>sign</hi> of one that <hi>abideth</hi> in <hi>Death,</hi> 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.14. He calls him a <hi>Murtherer</hi> that hates another, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. and a <hi>Lyar,</hi> if he pretends to <hi>Love God,</hi> and <hi>loveth</hi> not his <hi>Brother,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.20. In fine, he out-speaks the greatest heights of Praise, when he saith <hi>God is Love,</hi> and <hi>he that loveth dwelleth in God, and God in him,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.16. I might represent fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that we are commanded to <hi>Love without dissimulation, Rom.</hi> 12.9. to be <hi>kindly affectioned one towards another, ver.</hi> 10. to <hi>put on the Breast-plate of Faith, and Love,</hi> 1 <hi>Thess</hi> 5.8. to be <hi>pittiful,</hi> and <hi>courteous.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.8. to <hi>provoke one another to love, and to good works, Heb.</hi> 10.24. to <hi>serve one another, Gal.</hi> 5.13. to <hi>love as Brethren,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 3.8. We are minded of Christ's <hi>New</hi> Commandment, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.23. and of the <hi>Message</hi> which was from the beginning, <hi>That we should Love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ver.</hi> 11. and are urged by the consideration of Gods love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.1. Thus the Apostles <hi>exhort,</hi> and <hi>teach</hi>: and they <hi>Pray,</hi> that <hi>our Love may abound. Phil.</hi> 1.9. and 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.12. and give solemn <hi>Thanks</hi> for it, when they have found it, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.3.</p>
            <p>And now considering the <hi>expresness</hi> of all these places, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see, but that any Duty of Religion may be more easily eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded than <hi>this</hi>; and those who can phansie themselves <hi>Christians,</hi> and yet continue in the <hi>contrary Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit themselves <hi>Religious,</hi> though they live in the constant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of the sins of <hi>Drunkenness,</hi> and <hi>Theft.</hi> And if <hi>such</hi> can quite their Consciences, and shuffle from the edge of all these <hi>plain</hi> Recommends, and Injunctions; they have found a way to escape <hi>all the Laws</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and may, when they please, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Christians, without Christianity.</hi> For the evidence, I have suggested to prove the <hi>necessity</hi> of <hi>this</hi> Duty, doth not consist in <hi>half Sentences,</hi> and <hi>doubtful Phrases,</hi> in <hi>phansied Analogies,</hi> and <hi>far-fetcht Interpretations;</hi> but in <hi>plain Commands,</hi> and <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Inculcations</hi>; in <hi>earnest Entreaties,</hi> and <hi>pressing Importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>; in <hi>repeated Advices,</hi> and <hi>passionate Commendations:</hi> And
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102100:5"/>
those whom all <hi>these</hi> will not move, are Incapable of being perswaded, against their <hi>humour,</hi> or their <hi>interest,</hi> to any Duty of Religion. So that, though I see never so much <hi>eagerness</hi> for an <hi>Opinion,</hi> or <hi>Heat</hi> for an <hi>indifferent Circumstance</hi> without the conscience of <hi>Christian Love</hi>; I shall never call that <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness</hi> for those <hi>little</hi> things, <hi>Zeal,</hi> or <hi>Religion</hi>: Yea, though those <hi>warm</hi> men should <hi>sacrifice</hi> their <hi>Lives</hi> to their <hi>beloved Trifles,</hi> I should not think them <hi>Martyrs;</hi> but fear rather, that they went from one <hi>Fire</hi> to another, and a <hi>Worse.</hi> And in this I have the great Apostle to warrant me, who saith: <hi>Though I give my body to be burned, and have not Charity, it profiteth me nothing,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 13.3.</p>
            <p>Thus of the <hi>first</hi> Head, the <hi>Necessity</hi> of <hi>this Duty</hi>; I come to the <hi>second,</hi> the <hi>Extent</hi> of it. Our <hi>Love</hi> ought,</p>
            <p>I. To be <hi>extended</hi> to <hi>all Mankind.</hi> The more <hi>general</hi> it is, the more <hi>Christian,</hi> and the more like unto the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> who causeth <hi>his Sun to shine, and his Rain to fall upon the Good, and upon the Evil.</hi> And though our <hi>Armes</hi> be very <hi>short,</hi> and the <hi>ordinary influence</hi> of our <hi>kindness,</hi> and <hi>good will,</hi> can reach but to a very <hi>few,</hi> yet we may <hi>pray</hi> for <hi>all men,</hi> and desire the good of <hi>all</hi> the <hi>world</hi>; and in <hi>these</hi> we may be charitable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bounds: But <hi>these</hi> are not all. <hi>Love</hi> obligeth us to relieve the <hi>Needy,</hi> and help the <hi>Distressed,</hi> to visit the <hi>Sick,</hi> and succour the <hi>Fatherless</hi> and <hi>Widows,</hi> to strengthen the <hi>Weak,</hi> and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the <hi>Staggering</hi> and <hi>Doubting,</hi> to encourage the <hi>Vertuous,</hi> and to reprove the <hi>Faulty</hi>; and in short, to be ready in all the offices of Kindness, that may promote the good of any man Spiritual, or Temporal, according to the utmost of our power, and capacity. <hi>The good man is Merciful to his Beast,</hi> and the <hi>Christian</hi> ought to be <hi>Charitable</hi> to his <hi>Brother,</hi> and his <hi>Neighbour</hi>; and <hi>every man</hi> is <hi>our Brother,</hi> and <hi>every one</hi> that <hi>Needs</hi> us, is our <hi>Neighbour</hi>: And so our <hi>Love</hi> ought to extend to all men <hi>universally,</hi> without limitation; though with this distinction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:102100:6"/>II. That the more <hi>especial Objects</hi> of our <hi>Love</hi> ought to be those that <hi>agree</hi> with us in <hi>a common Faith Gal.</hi> 6.10, that is, <hi>All Christians,</hi> as <hi>Christians,</hi> and because <hi>such.</hi> What ever makes our Brother a Member of the <hi>Church Catholick, that</hi> gives him a title to our <hi>nearer affections,</hi> which ought to be as <hi>large</hi> as <hi>that.</hi> Our <hi>Love</hi> must not be <hi>confin'd</hi> by <hi>names,</hi> and <hi>petty agreements,</hi> and the <hi>interests</hi> of <hi>Parties,</hi> to the <hi>corners</hi> of a <hi>Sect</hi>: but ought to reach as far as <hi>Christianity</hi> it self, in the <hi>largest</hi> notion of it. To love those that are of <hi>our Way, Humour,</hi> and <hi>Opinion,</hi> is not <hi>Charity,</hi> but <hi>Self-love</hi>; 'tis not for <hi>Christ's sake,</hi> but <hi>our own.</hi> To Love like <hi>Christians,</hi> is to Love <hi>his Image</hi> from whom we are call'd <hi>so</hi>: And <hi>that</hi> consists not in <hi>demure Looks</hi> and <hi>affected Phrases,</hi> in <hi>melting Tones</hi> and <hi>mimick Gestures,</hi> in <hi>Heats</hi> and <hi>Vehemence,</hi> in <hi>Rapture</hi> and <hi>Extasie,</hi> in <hi>systemes</hi> of <hi>Opinion,</hi> and <hi>scrupulosity</hi> about <hi>Nothing</hi>; But in <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience, Innocence,</hi> and <hi>Integrity</hi>; in <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> to <hi>all the World</hi>; in a <hi>modest sweetness,</hi> and <hi>humble Deportment</hi>; in a <hi>peaceable Spirit,</hi> and <hi>readiness</hi> to <hi>obey God,</hi> and <hi>Those</hi> He hath set <hi>over</hi> Us. Where ever <hi>These</hi> are, <hi>there</hi> is the <hi>Image</hi> of our <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>There</hi> ought to be our <hi>Love</hi>; though the persons thus affected, are <hi>Ignorant</hi> of <hi>many things,</hi> and <hi>erre</hi> in <hi>many</hi>; though they <hi>differ</hi> from us in some <hi>Opinions</hi> we count <hi>Orthodox,</hi> and walk not in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>ways</hi> or <hi>Circumstances</hi> which <hi>We</hi> esteem <hi>Best.</hi> And thus briefly of the <hi>Extent</hi> of the Duty, we ought to Love ALL MEN, but especially ALL Christians, I descend to the <hi>Third</hi> general, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(III.) The <hi>Excellency</hi> of <hi>Christian Love,</hi> which I represent in the following particulars.</p>
            <p>(I.) IT is the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and of all the graces renders us most <hi>like</hi> our <hi>Maker</hi>: For <hi>God is Love,</hi> and the <hi>Lover of Men</hi>; and his <hi>tender Mercies are over all his Works</hi>: And the most sutable apprehension we can form of his Being, is, to look on him as an <hi>Omnipotent, Omniscient, Immutable Goodness.</hi> And is it not a glorious <hi>Excellency,</hi> that makes Men <hi>like</hi> the fountain
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102100:6"/>
all persection? Our unhappy First Parents lost <hi>Paradise,</hi> by aspiring to be like <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Knowledge</hi>: and if we endeavour to be <hi>like</hi> him in <hi>Love,</hi> we shall be in the way of gaining a <hi>better Paradise</hi> than they lost.</p>
            <p n="2">(II.) LOVE is the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Angels, Glorified Souls,</hi> and the <hi>best</hi> of <hi>Men.</hi> There is nothing by which <hi>the Angelical</hi> nature is so Much <hi>distinguish'd</hi> from the <hi>Diabolical,</hi> as <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>; for the <hi>Devils</hi> have <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and <hi>Immortal</hi> natures, and great degrees of Power and Knowledge; and <hi>those</hi> perhaps not much inferiour to what is to be found in some of the better Spirits: so that the great difference is not in the excess of <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> perfections, which the <hi>Angels</hi> of <hi>Light</hi> have above <hi>those</hi> of <hi>Darkness</hi>; but in <hi>this,</hi> that the <hi>former</hi> abound in <hi>Love, Sweetness,</hi> and <hi>Benignity;</hi> and the <hi>latter,</hi> in <hi>Malice, Cruelty,</hi> and <hi>Revenge; these</hi> are the very <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>Sathan,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Hell.</hi> Whereas all the <hi>Celestial Inhabitants</hi> live in the joyful exercise of uninterrupted Love and endearments: Nor is that Love confined to the blessed, and glorified Company, but it sheds it self abroad upon the neather world; and they are <hi>Ministring Spirits for our good, Heb.</hi> 1.14. They so far Love us, that they can stoop from Heaven to serve us. There is Joy <hi>there</hi> at the <hi>Conversion</hi> of a <hi>Sinner</hi>; and no doubt there is <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>converted</hi> Saints, and <hi>care</hi> and <hi>pitty</hi> for all the rest of Men. For the <hi>spirits</hi> of the <hi>Iust made perfect</hi> are freed from their <hi>fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward humours,</hi> and <hi>pettish natures</hi>; their <hi>mistaken Zeal,</hi> and sondness of <hi>Opinions</hi>; which straightned their Affections while they were on Earth: and now they are inlarged by the vast improvements of their <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and accomplishment of their <hi>Vertue</hi>; by a fuller sense of <hi>Divine Love,</hi> and of their <hi>Duty</hi>; by the <hi>genius</hi> of <hi>their company,</hi> and the imployment of the <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Place.</hi> So that in <hi>Heaven all</hi> are <hi>Chatholicks</hi> in their <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the <hi>better</hi> any man is, the more he is <hi>so</hi> upon Earth: The <hi>good</hi> man makes not himself his <hi>center,</hi> not are his thoughts
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102100:7"/>
wholly engrost about his own concernments; but he is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully solicitous for the <hi>general benefit,</hi> and never so much pleased as when he is made an instrument of <hi>Divine Goodness,</hi> to promote the interests of his <hi>Christian</hi> brethren. 'Twas an high strain of <hi>Love</hi> in <hi>Moses,</hi> exprest towards the <hi>Transgressing Israelites,</hi> when he was content to be <hi>blotted out of Gods Book,</hi> rather than that their <hi>Sin</hi> should not be <hi>blotted out. Exod.</hi> 32.32. and St. <hi>Paul</hi> was no less Zealously affectionate towards the <hi>Iewes,</hi> when he said, he could <hi>wish himself accursed from Christ,</hi> viz. separated from Christian communion as a most vile and abject person, for their sakes. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.3. <hi>These</hi> were spirits whom <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> Love had enlarged: and the more any man advanceth in <hi>Christianity,</hi> the nearer he approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to this <hi>generous, heroick</hi> temper.</p>
            <p>(III.) LOVE is an eminent branch of the <hi>Divine Life,</hi> and <hi>Nature. Love is of God,</hi> and <hi>every one that Loveth, is born of God,</hi> saith the Apostle, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.7, 8. The <hi>Divine Nature</hi> in us, is the <hi>Image</hi> of God <hi>Pourtraid,</hi> and lively drawn upon the <hi>regenerated</hi> Soul; and we have remark't above, that Love is the <hi>vital Image</hi> of our <hi>Maker</hi>; 'tis <hi>His spirit infused</hi> into us, and <hi>growing</hi> in us; and upon that account to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all <hi>Gifts,</hi> and <hi>natural Perfections:</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath done it in the mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. And the <hi>common Gifts</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> differ from <hi>this special Grace,</hi> as the Painters <hi>Picture</hi> doth from his <hi>Son:</hi> His Counterfeit may indeed, in a superficial ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance to the Eye, resemble him <hi>more</hi> than his <hi>Child;</hi> but yet it is but an <hi>empty shadow,</hi> destitute, and incapable of his <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Nature:</hi> So there are a sort of <hi>Gifts,</hi> that have a <hi>spiritual appearance,</hi> and <hi>may,</hi> to those that see things at <hi>distance,</hi> or have not their senses exercised, seem more like the divine nature, than this <hi>modest vertue:</hi> But those that come near them, and are better able to discern, perceive that in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves they are without the <hi>Divine Life,</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> and are meer <hi>Liveless Pictures.</hi> And here I dare say, that the happiest
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102100:7"/>
faculty to <hi>Preach Plausibly,</hi> and <hi>Pray with Fluency,</hi> and <hi>Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi>; to <hi>Discourse Devoutly,</hi> and <hi>readily</hi> to <hi>Interpret Sripture,</hi> if it be not joyned with a <hi>benigne</hi> and <hi>charitable</hi> spirit, is no <hi>participation</hi> of the <hi>God-like life</hi> and <hi>nature</hi>; nor indeed any more <hi>Divine,</hi> than those <hi>common</hi> gifts, and <hi>natural</hi> parts, which <hi>those</hi> that think highly of themselves upon these accounts, <hi>despise.</hi> For very <hi>Evil</hi> men have been eminent in these accomplishments, and <hi>Wicked Spirits</hi> are without question endowed with <hi>them;</hi> and they are of themselves arguments of nothing but a <hi>faculty</hi> of <hi>Imitation,</hi> a <hi>devotional Complexion,</hi> and <hi>warm Imagination:</hi> Whereas on the other hand, <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>Christian Love</hi> are good Evidence of a <hi>Renewed state,</hi> and <hi>nature.</hi> Our <hi>Saviour</hi> made it a <hi>Character, Ioh.</hi> 13. and the <hi>Catholick</hi> Apostle <hi>concludes</hi> from it, 1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.14. By <hi>this we know that we are passed from death to life, because we love the Brethren.</hi> And if this be a <hi>Mark,</hi> and St. <hi>Iohn</hi> be not <hi>mistaken,</hi> I doubt that some who are very <hi>gracious,</hi> by many <hi>Signes</hi> of their <hi>own,</hi> will want one of <hi>Christs,</hi> to prove their <hi>comfortable</hi> presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>
            <p>(IV.) LOVE is the <hi>bond</hi> and tye of <hi>Christian Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; How can two walk together except they are agreed?</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> is a Body consisting of many <hi>Members,</hi> which unless they <hi>Vnite,</hi> and send their mutual supplies one to another, the <hi>Whole</hi> is distempered, and in the ready way to <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.</hi> Now Charity is that <hi>vital Cement</hi> whereby they are <hi>Vnited,</hi> and the <hi>Soul</hi> by which the common body lives; <hi>that</hi> whereby the League between the members is preserved, and health with it. When <hi>this</hi> decays, <hi>sad symptoms,</hi> and <hi>mortal evils</hi> follow. We see in <hi>Nature,</hi> the great <hi>Fabrick</hi> of the World is maintained by the <hi>mutual Friendship,</hi> and <hi>conspiracy</hi> of its <hi>parts; which</hi> should they universally fall out, and break the bond of Amity that is between them; should they act their <hi>Antipathies</hi> upon each other; yea, should they but cease to serve one another for the general <hi>good</hi>; the whole <hi>frame</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:102100:8"/>
would quickly be dissolved, and all things <hi>shuffled</hi> into their old <hi>Chaos,</hi> and <hi>Abyss.</hi> And the greatest evils that <hi>have,</hi> or <hi>can</hi> happen to the <hi>Church,</hi> have been the effects of the <hi>Decay</hi> of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> and those <hi>intestine Divisions</hi> that have grown up in it. From these she hath always suffered <hi>more,</hi> than from <hi>external persecutions:</hi> The <hi>flames within</hi> have <hi>consumed</hi> her, when <hi>those</hi> from <hi>without,</hi> have only <hi>sing'd</hi> her garments.</p>
            <p>(V.) LOVE is the most <hi>Catholick</hi> grace, and upon <hi>that</hi> account the most <hi>excellent</hi>; since that which promotes the good of the <hi>whole,</hi> is <hi>better</hi> than any <hi>private perfection</hi>: for which reason, things in nature will quit their <hi>particular</hi> inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests, when the <hi>common</hi> good so requireth; as <hi>heavy bodies</hi> will <hi>ascend,</hi> and <hi>light bodies descend,</hi> to prevent a <hi>chasm,</hi> and <hi>breach</hi> in Nature. Now of all the <hi>divine</hi> vertues, there is none of so large an <hi>influence,</hi> as <hi>Love</hi>; 'tis a grace designed for the <hi>good</hi> of the <hi>community,</hi> as the principle of <hi>self-Love</hi> is for rhe <hi>preservation</hi> of <hi>particular</hi> beings. <hi>This</hi> stirs up our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for the <hi>good</hi> of others, and especially for the <hi>general good.</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> receives no <hi>wound,</hi> but <hi>Love</hi> feels the smart of it; nor is any <hi>member</hi> of it afflicted, but <hi>Love</hi> is <hi>grieved.</hi> This is the very Spirit of our dear Lord, who was <hi>touched with a feeling of our Infirmities.</hi> And to <hi>these</hi> I add this last.</p>
            <p>(VI) LOVE commends <hi>Christianity</hi> to those <hi>without,</hi> and <hi>cleanseth</hi> the Profession of it from many Spots it hath contracted. The generality of men are not able to judge of Religions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but usually reckon of <hi>them,</hi> as they do of <hi>their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours.</hi> What ever is <hi>excellent,</hi> or else <hi>unworthy,</hi> in a votary of <hi>Religion,</hi> redounds to the <hi>credit,</hi> or <hi>disparagement,</hi> of the <hi>Religion</hi> he hath adopted: So that, were the <hi>charity</hi> and <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> transcribed into the lives of <hi>Christians,</hi> it would ravish the eyes of all Beholders, and out-shine all other Professions. Men would more easily be perswaded to believe <hi>that Religion</hi> to be <hi>from God,</hi> whose <hi>Professours</hi> they saw to be so <hi>God-like. Love</hi> and <hi>goodness prevail</hi> where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102100:8"/>
else will; these win and <hi>captivate</hi> the <hi>Soul:</hi> And such conquests are <hi>better,</hi> and <hi>more noble</hi> than either <hi>those</hi> of <hi>Arts</hi> or <hi>Arms,</hi> which only bring the <hi>body</hi> under. 'Tis but small credit to any Religion to cut it's way by the <hi>Sword,</hi> or gain upon the world by <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Policy; That</hi> which opens it self a passage by its <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive loveliness,</hi> and <hi>beauty,</hi> is the most <hi>Illustrious,</hi> and makes the <hi>surest,</hi> and most <hi>generous Conquests.</hi> And were <hi>Christendom</hi> but <hi>Christian</hi> in this regard, and the Professours of the <hi>true</hi> Religion, <hi>truly</hi> Religious, that is, abounding in that <hi>charity,</hi> and <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> which <hi>Christianity</hi> enjoyns; our Religion would spread its wings through the World, and all <hi>contrary Professions</hi> would lie in the dust before it: Whereas the <hi>Divisions,</hi> and <hi>fatal feuds</hi> of <hi>Paganized, degenerated Christendom,</hi> are now the great partition-Wall between <hi>Vs,</hi> and the <hi>Heathen-World;</hi> yea, they are more <hi>particularly</hi> the great scandal of the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and make us the scorn of <hi>Those</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O that <hi>They</hi> that <hi>speak</hi> and <hi>pray</hi> much against the <hi>Beast,</hi> would not prove instrumental to uphold his <hi>Throne!</hi> We ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and hope for <hi>glorious times</hi> when the <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> is faln; and doubtless there shall be <hi>such:</hi> But then the <hi>glory</hi> of those <hi>times</hi> consists not in <hi>external rule,</hi> or <hi>dominion</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> but in the <hi>Vniversal Restauration</hi> of <hi>it</hi> to it's <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Simplicity,</hi> and <hi>Purity.</hi> Then will the <hi>Church</hi> be <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> indeed, when <hi>all Christians</hi> shall <hi>unite</hi> upon the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> of an <hi>Holy Life,</hi> and the <hi>joynt Profession</hi> of the <hi>few, plain, Fundamentals</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi>: When they shall make <hi>real Goodness</hi> the Object of their affections towards each other; and all <hi>Differences</hi> in <hi>Opinions</hi> and <hi>dispensible</hi> Practices, the Objects of their <hi>mutual Forbearance:</hi> When such times as <hi>these</hi> shall <hi>come,</hi> then doth the <hi>Reign of Christ</hi> begin: And <hi>this</hi> is the <hi>true,</hi> and <hi>wish't Millennium.</hi> Now we cannot expect those <hi>glorious days</hi> which are to Commence upon the Fall of <hi>Anti-christ,</hi> till we see all <hi>Christians</hi> sincerely set upon Destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is <hi>Anti-christian</hi> in themselves. <hi>Anti-christ</hi> will
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102100:9"/>
not be overthrown by our <hi>declaiming</hi> against <hi>Him,</hi> and spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>fire</hi> of <hi>Rage</hi> at the <hi>Infallible Chair.</hi> It will be to better purpose for <hi>us</hi> to examine what of <hi>Anti-christianism</hi> remains in <hi>our selves:</hi> And while <hi>Rancour,</hi> and <hi>Bitterness, Rage,</hi> and <hi>Animosities</hi> upon the Account of <hi>Difference</hi> in smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler <hi>Opinions</hi> are in our Borders, <hi>Anti-christ</hi> hath a <hi>Throne</hi> among us; and there is nothing could be so Effectual a <hi>Blow</hi> at the <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Anti-christianism,</hi> as the exercise of <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick-Goodness.</hi> And when we see <hi>these</hi> take place, then may we Triumphantly sing forth, BABYLON IS FALN.</p>
            <p>I come now <hi>Fourthly</hi> to the <hi>Means</hi> of attaining this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and <hi>Catholick</hi> Temper; And I propose them by way of DIRECTION, CONSIDERATION, and CAU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION. The DIRECTIONS are these:
<list>

                  <item>And (II.) I recommend this as another; <hi>Be much in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the Love of God.</hi> He that knows how much God hath Loved him, hath a mighty Reason to Love his Brother; The Apostle urgeth the Argument, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.11. <hi>If God so Loved us, we ought also to Love one another:</hi> and he that <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders,</hi> cannot choose; for he must needs find himself sweetly Ingaged to <hi>Love God,</hi> of whose <hi>Love</hi> he is <hi>sensible</hi>; and he that loves <hi>Him,</hi> loves <hi>all</hi> things in him: For all things are <hi>his,</hi> and he tenders every thing he hath made. The Love of God doth not Confine us to his single abstracted Essence, but <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires</hi> our Kindness to all that bear his <hi>Image,</hi> and <hi>produce</hi> it. <hi>Seraphick Love</hi> will be <hi>Catholick;</hi> It doth not burn like a Lamp in a Sepulcher, but 'tis like the <hi>Stars</hi> of Heaven, that impart themselves to all things. And as the <hi>Planets,</hi> that receive their <hi>Light</hi> from the <hi>Sun,</hi> do not <hi>suck</hi> it in, and <hi>ingross</hi> it, but <hi>disperse,</hi> and <hi>shed</hi> it abroad upon the most distant Bodies; in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, a <hi>Christian Soul</hi> that is <hi>warmed</hi> and <hi>lightned</hi> by Divine Love doth not keep it within it self, but communicates it's <hi>benigne Influences</hi> to all the Objects that are within it's reach. The <hi>Love of God</hi> in it's proper Nature is <hi>diffusive,</hi> and very opposite to <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Animosity;</hi> It Dispels the <hi>Clouds,</hi> and Allays the <hi>Tempests</hi> that arise from the Body, and it's Appetites; and Composeth the Soul to the <hi>Sweetest,</hi> and most <hi>even</hi> Temper; It <hi>Inlarges</hi> our <hi>Minds,</hi> and <hi>Softens</hi> our <hi>Affections,</hi> and <hi>Calms</hi> our <hi>Passions,</hi> and <hi>Smooths</hi> the <hi>Ruggedness</hi> of our <hi>Natures</hi>; It destroys our <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Selfishness,</hi> and so strikes up the Roots of <hi>Enmity,</hi> and <hi>Divisions</hi>; and thus disposeth us to the most <hi>Generous</hi> and <hi>Comprehensive Charity.</hi> In order to which <hi>Blessed Issue,</hi> I Advise further.</item>

to teach us <hi>Systems</hi> of <hi>Opinion</hi>; to resolve us a <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Difficult</hi> Points, or to Inable us to talk <hi>plausibly</hi> for lesser Truths; But to furnish our minds with <hi>incouragements</hi> of <hi>Vertue,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> of <hi>Duty</hi>; to <hi>direct</hi> us to <hi>govern</hi> our <hi>Passions,</hi> and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due our <hi>appetites</hi> and <hi>self-wills,</hi> in order to the <hi>glory</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>good</hi> of <hi>Societies,</hi> and our <hi>own present</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> Interests. And if Christians would take <hi>this</hi> to be their <hi>business,</hi> and conscienciously apply themselves unto it; they would find work enough in their own hearts to imploy them, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have <hi>time,</hi> nor <hi>occasion</hi> to pry into the <hi>Infirmities</hi> of others, nor <hi>inclination</hi> to <hi>quarrel</hi> with them: they would see how <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise</hi> it is to be <hi>seeking,</hi> and <hi>making Enemies,</hi> when they have so <hi>many</hi> within themselves; and how <hi>dangerous,</hi> to be diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a <hi>needless,</hi> and <hi>unjust forein War,</hi> while a <hi>deadly do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick Foe</hi> is strenghtned by it. And methinks 'tis wonderful, and 'tis sad, that we should be so <hi>mild,</hi> and <hi>indulgent</hi> to the <hi>enemies,</hi> that we are bound to engage against by our <hi>Duty</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and to <hi>our selves,</hi> by <hi>his Laws,</hi> and our <hi>own Reasons,</hi> by the <hi>precepts</hi> and <hi>examples</hi> of his <hi>Son</hi> our <hi>Saviour,</hi> by his <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and by his <hi>Bloud,</hi> by <hi>all things</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>all things</hi> in <hi>Interest;</hi> and at the same time, be so <hi>eager</hi> against <hi>those,</hi> whom we ought to consider as <hi>Friends,</hi> upon the account of our <hi>relation</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>tie</hi> of <hi>common</hi> nature, and the obligations of <hi>Divine Commands,</hi> and the <hi>interests</hi> of <hi>Societies,</hi> and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the <hi>best</hi> times past, and the <hi>hopes</hi> of a <hi>future happiness.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is <hi>lamentable</hi> in it self, and yet the more <hi>so,</hi> for being <hi>common.</hi> And it seems to me such a kind of <hi>madness,</hi> as if a man should be picking causless quarrels with his Neighbours about a chip of Wood, or a broken Hedge, when a Fire in his house is consuming his Goods, and Children: Such <hi>Frenzies,</hi> and much <hi>greater,</hi> are our <hi>mutual enmities</hi> and <hi>oppositions,</hi> while we <hi>quietly</hi> sit down in our <hi>unmortified Affections.</hi> And we should <hi>know</hi> them to be <hi>so,</hi> did we understand our <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> or our <hi>Duty,</hi> and seriously mind either the one, or other:

We should find then that a Christian hath <hi>no such enemies</hi> as the <hi>Flesh,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> and the <hi>Devil;</hi> that these will require <hi>all</hi> our <hi>care,</hi> and imploy <hi>all</hi> our <hi>strength,</hi> and <hi>diligence:</hi> and he that knows <hi>this,</hi> and <hi>considers,</hi> and <hi>acts suitably,</hi> will find <hi>too much</hi> in himself to <hi>censure,</hi> and oppose, and <hi>too little</hi> to <hi>admire</hi> himself for above others; He will see sufficient reason to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline him to <hi>pardon</hi> his <hi>erring</hi> brother, and be the more easily induced to exercise <hi>charity,</hi> which himself so many ways needs.

            <p>Thus of my DIRECTIONS. For CONSIDE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RATIONS I'le propose <hi>such</hi> as shew the <hi>Vnreasonable</hi> of our Enmities, and Disagreements upon the account of <hi>different Opinions</hi>; which will prove that our <hi>Affections</hi> ought to meet,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102100:11"/>
though our <hi>Iudgments</hi> cannot. My first is this,
<list>
                  <item>(I.) <hi>Love is part of Religion; but Opinions for the sake of which we loose Charity, are none.</hi> The <hi>First,</hi> I have proved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready: and for the other, we may <hi>consider,</hi> That <hi>Religion</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists not in <hi>knowing many things,</hi> but in <hi>practising</hi> the <hi>few plain things</hi> we <hi>know.</hi> THE NECESSARY PRINCIPLES OF FAITH LYE IN A LITTLE ROOM. <hi>This is Life Eternal to know thee the only true God, and Iesus Christ whom thou hast sent;</hi> Saith <hi>he</hi> that best knew what was <hi>Eternal</hi> Life, and what <hi>necessary</hi> unto it, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.3. and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle St. <hi>Paul</hi> draws up all into the same <hi>two Principles. He that cometh unto God must know that he is, and that he is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of them that diligently seek him; Heb.</hi> 11.6. St. <hi>Peter</hi> was pronounced <hi>blessed</hi> upon the <hi>single</hi> Profession, that <hi>Iesus</hi> was <hi>Christ the Son of the Living God, Mat.</hi> 16.16. and the <hi>Eunuch</hi> was baptised upon the same. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.37. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> reckons <hi>these</hi> as the only <hi>Necessaries</hi> to <hi>Salvation. Rom.</hi> 10.9. <hi>If thou confess with thy Mouth the Lord Iesus, and believe in thy heart that God hath raised him from the Dead, thou shalt be saved.</hi> And St. <hi>Iohn</hi> to the same purpose, <hi>Whosoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves that Iesus is the Christ, is born of God. This Faith</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed must suppose the <hi>general Principles</hi> of <hi>natural Religion,</hi> and <hi>produce</hi> the <hi>Real Fruits</hi> of <hi>Righteousness</hi> to make it effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to it's end; and <hi>these supposed,</hi> the Apostles speak as if it contain'd <hi>all</hi> that is <hi>essentially necessary</hi> to be <hi>believed,</hi> and <hi>known,</hi> in order to our <hi>Happiness.</hi> Thus the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of <hi>belief</hi> are <hi>few,</hi> and <hi>plain:</hi> For certainly the <hi>Divine</hi> Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness would not lay our <hi>Eternal Interests</hi> in <hi>Difficulties,</hi> and <hi>multitudes;</hi> things <hi>hard</hi> to be <hi>understood,</hi> and <hi>retained. The difficult work of Religion is not in the Vnderstanding, but in the Affections, and Will.</hi> So that the <hi>Principles,</hi> in which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion consists, are the <hi>clearly revealed</hi> Articles in which we are <hi>agreed.</hi> For the <hi>others</hi> about which we <hi>differ,</hi> and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,</hi> though some of them may be <hi>consequences</hi> of <hi>those,</hi> and

good <hi>helps</hi> to the <hi>practice</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> yet I should be loath to make them a <hi>necessary</hi> and <hi>essential part</hi> of it: For he that saith they <hi>are,</hi> concludes all men under a state of <hi>Ruine</hi> and <hi>Damnation,</hi> who either do not <hi>know,</hi> or are not <hi>able</hi> to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> them: An <hi>uncharitableness,</hi> that is as <hi>bad</hi> as <hi>Heresie,</hi> if it be not one <hi>it self.</hi> The sum is, <hi>Religion</hi> lies in <hi>few Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> I mean as to the <hi>Essence</hi> of it; and that principally consists in <hi>Practice.</hi> So the Prophet reckons, <hi>Mich.</hi> 6.8. <hi>He hath shewed thee O man what is good: and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do Iustice, and love Mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</hi> and St. <hi>Iames</hi> gives an Account of Religion like it. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.17. <hi>True Religion, and Vndefiled before God and the Father is this, to Visit the Widow, and Fatherless in their Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and to keep himself unspotted from the World. Religion</hi> is an <hi>Holy Life,</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> is a main <hi>branch</hi> of <hi>that;</hi> But <hi>Opinions</hi> are no <hi>vital part,</hi> nor do they appertain to the <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of it. And shall we loose a <hi>Limb</hi> for an Excrescence, or an Ornament; An <hi>Essential</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> for <hi>that</hi> which is but <hi>accessary,</hi> and <hi>extrinsick; Charity,</hi> for an <hi>Opinion</hi>? I think 'tis not reasonable, and I hope you think so likewise. But I offer to your <hi>Consideration:</hi>

The Foundation of God standeth sure,</hi> but men often build upon it what is very <hi>Tottering,</hi> and <hi>uncertain.</hi> The great <hi>Truths</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> are easily discernable, but the <hi>smaller,</hi> and <hi>remoter</hi> ones requite more <hi>sagacity</hi> and <hi>acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> to descry them; and the <hi>best Light</hi> may be <hi>deceived</hi> about

such <hi>obscure,</hi> and <hi>distant</hi> Objects.

                     <p>For let us consider, That the Scripture hath not been so <hi>clear,</hi> and <hi>express</hi> in <hi>defining lesser</hi> Points; and the words, in which they are thought to be Lodged, are many times <hi>figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative,</hi> and <hi>obscure,</hi> and of <hi>various meaning,</hi> spoken only <hi>by the by,</hi> or <hi>agreeable</hi> to <hi>forms</hi> of <hi>speech,</hi> or <hi>customs,</hi> that we do not know, of by the way of <hi>condescension</hi> to <hi>common Apprehension:</hi> And therefore we see that <hi>Interpretations</hi> are <hi>infinite,</hi> and there is no sort of men less agreed, than <hi>Commentators.</hi> All <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi> plead <hi>Scripture,</hi> and many pretend to <hi>reason,</hi> and most to <hi>Antiquity.</hi> The <hi>Learned,</hi> and the <hi>Prudent, Churches,</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, Confessors,</hi> and <hi>Fathers,</hi> the <hi>former</hi> and the <hi>latter</hi> Ages, the <hi>Vertuous,</hi> and the <hi>Devout,</hi> the <hi>Credulous,</hi> and the <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive,</hi> they have all <hi>differ'd</hi> in the <hi>lesser</hi> matters of Belief.

                  <p n="2">(II.) <hi>That you avoid eager, and passionate Disputes</hi>; in <hi>these, Charity</hi> is always <hi>lost,</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> seldom, or never <hi>found.</hi> When the <hi>Passion</hi> is raised, the <hi>Iudgement</hi> is gone; and there is no seeing to the <hi>bottom</hi> in <hi>disturbed,</hi> and <hi>mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died</hi> waters. 'Tis the <hi>calm,</hi> and <hi>quiet considerer</hi> that finds <hi>Truth,</hi> while the <hi>hot,</hi> and <hi>confident disputer</hi> looseth both himself, and it; when his passion is once kindled, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not speak any thing pertinently himself, nor understand what is spoken to purpose, by another; and so can neither <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,</hi> nor be <hi>convinced.</hi> If thou <hi>differ</hi> with thy brother then, do not <hi>ruffle</hi> with him in <hi>vehement disputes,</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the <hi>Apologue.</hi> The <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Wind</hi> contended for the Travellers Cloak; the <hi>Wind</hi> blustered about him, and endeavoured to prevail by rudeness, and violence; but with this bad success, that the man held his Garment the faster for it: At length, the <hi>Sun</hi> shines forth with a <hi>calm</hi>

and <hi>insinuating</hi> beam, which warmed him gently, and by degrees; and then the Traveller put his Cloak from him. If thou art desirous to prevail with thy friend to lay down his Opinion, <hi>assault</hi> him not by the <hi>fierceness</hi> of <hi>disputes</hi>; For such attempts will but <hi>raise</hi> his <hi>passion,</hi> and <hi>that will</hi> make him stick the closer to his Errour; but <hi>shine</hi> upon him with a <hi>calm</hi> light, <hi>insinuate</hi> thy better principle by <hi>modest,</hi> and <hi>gentle</hi> suggestions. He that hath wedded any falshood, hath many <hi>prejudices</hi> against the <hi>contrary</hi> Truth; and these are not to be <hi>torn</hi> off all at once, but <hi>softly,</hi> and by <hi>degrees</hi> to be <hi>unwound.</hi> This is the likeliest way to <hi>prevail</hi> upon <hi>Dissenters;</hi> or, if at any time it fails of its success, there is however <hi>no hurt</hi> done: <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> are preserved, which are much <hi>better,</hi> than most Opinions for which we contend. Whereas by <hi>Disputes</hi> men are mutually provoked, and tempted to pour forth many <hi>Idle,</hi> and many <hi>bitter</hi> words; the <hi>quiet</hi> and <hi>temper</hi> of their minds is <hi>disturbed,</hi> and likely the <hi>Peace</hi> of others also: They are brought <hi>no whit nearer</hi> each other, in their <hi>Iudgments,</hi> but put at a much <hi>greater distance,</hi> in their <hi>Affections:</hi> Whereas by the <hi>other</hi> method of <hi>calm</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all these evils are avoided.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, we are commanded to <hi>contend earnestly for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints, Iude</hi> 3. But the <hi>Faith</hi> there meant, doth not consist in points of <hi>doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful disputation,</hi> but in the <hi>Fundamental</hi> Article of <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> being the <hi>Messias,</hi> joyn'd with a <hi>vertuous</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> conversation; and the persons against whom those <hi>primitive</hi> Christians were to <hi>contend,</hi> were <hi>Ungodly Men</hi> that deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>the only Lord God,</hi> and <hi>our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> ver. 5. For these <hi>Essential</hi> matters, we <hi>may,</hi> and we <hi>ought</hi> to be <hi>earnest;</hi> but <hi>Contention</hi> about <hi>lesser</hi> things, is called by the Apostle, <hi>Perverse Disputing,</hi> and reckoned as the <hi>effect</hi> of <hi>pride,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>There is nothing hath done the world more mischief, than <hi>indiscreet, unseasonable Zeal</hi> for <hi>Truths,</hi> while men have not made a difference between <hi>those,</hi> that are <hi>necessary</hi> to be <hi>believed,</hi> and <hi>known;</hi> and <hi>those</hi> others, which may <hi>safely</hi> be <hi>doubted,</hi> and <hi>denyed.</hi> 'Tis a great and dangerous mistake to think, <hi>that we ought to publish, and propagate all the Truth we know</hi>; For every man thinks his <hi>own Opinions</hi> about Religion, <hi>Gods Truth;</hi> and nature inclines men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to beget their <hi>own image</hi> upon other mens minds; and if this be made a Duty too, every man will be a Teacher of all the rest; and no man will let his brother be at quiet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This man is ready to <hi>burst</hi> till he hath given himself <hi>vent</hi>; and the other is as <hi>impatient,</hi> till he hath <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted</hi> what he hath said: <hi>Both</hi> are zealous to <hi>Proselyte</hi> each other, and <hi>neither</hi> can be <hi>contented</hi> with a <hi>single</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, till the <hi>publick</hi> be disturbed. These are some of the <hi>effects</hi> of <hi>opinionative zeal,</hi> and we know it by a dear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. Here is the source of all <hi>Divisions,</hi> and <hi>Sects.

are scorched, and <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> are consumed.</p>
                  <p>If therefore we are friends to Christian Love, let us avoid, and oppose, this its most <hi>fatal</hi> enemy; and <hi>consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> That we <hi>need</hi> not be <hi>zealous</hi> for <hi>more</hi> truth, than what God hath made <hi>necessary,</hi> and <hi>ought</hi> not to be <hi>zealous</hi> for <hi>more,</hi> than what <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> have made <hi>certain;</hi> That the <hi>Necessary,</hi> and <hi>certain</hi> things are very <hi>few,</hi> and the <hi>remo<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

Both <hi>these</hi> are very <hi>common,</hi> and the <hi>Spight,</hi> and <hi>Injustice</hi> of them do exceedingly <hi>exasperate</hi> our <hi>Spirits,</hi> and <hi>enflame</hi> our <hi>Disagreements.</hi> By <hi>this</hi> way, <hi>Truth</hi> is exposed to contempt, and scorn, as well as Falshood; and there is <hi>none</hi> so <hi>Sacred,</hi> but its Adversaries have made it a <hi>deformed Vizard,</hi> to bring it under the <hi>Hatred</hi> and <hi>Reproaches</hi> of the Ignorant; and that which hath an <hi>Vgly Face,</hi> is <hi>more</hi> than <hi>half condemned</hi> among the generality of men, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not distinguish the <hi>true</hi> complexion, from the <hi>dirt</hi> that is thrown upon it.

Thus apt are men to <hi>frighted,</hi> by <hi>Bugbear Names,</hi> form <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi> And this is <hi>Superstition</hi> in the true sense, <hi>to be afraid of things in which there is no hurt;</hi> and it is promoted by the Unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

            <p>If then we have any kindness for <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Christian Love,</hi> let us take care of such <hi>dis-ingenuous</hi> practices.

            <p>IF any now should ask me, Whether this Doctrine, of <hi>Vniversal Love,</hi> do not tend to <hi>Vniversal Toleration</hi>? I should answer, that thus far it doth, <hi>viz.</hi> that all <hi>private</hi> persons should <hi>Tolerate</hi> each other, and bear with their brother's <hi>Infirmities</hi>; That every man should allow ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that <hi>Liberty,</hi> which he desires himself in things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Land,</hi> have Left him <hi>Free</hi>; and permit him his own <hi>Opinion</hi> without <hi>Censure,</hi> or <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure</hi>: Such a <hi>Toleration,</hi> I think, <hi>Christianity</hi> requires in <hi>Private</hi> men; But as to the <hi>Publick,</hi> I do by no means think it <hi>Modest</hi> for <hi>Vs</hi> to determine what the <hi>Government should</hi> do: And in <hi>This</hi> case, 'tis as unfit as in <hi>Any</hi> whatsoever; since this matter depends upon the Consideration of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Things, that 'tis very Difficult to state the <hi>Bounds</hi> of <hi>Iust Permission,</hi> and <hi>Restraint</hi>: Leaving <hi>That</hi> therefore to

               <hi>Their</hi> Prudence, whom Providence hath called to determine in <hi>It</hi>; I shall only say, that so much <hi>Toleration,</hi> as may consist with the <hi>Interests</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Publick Safety, may</hi> be <hi>Granted:</hi> But <hi>such</hi> a <hi>Liberty</hi> as is prejudicial to any of <hi>These,</hi> should <hi>not be expected:</hi> For <hi>Christianity,</hi> and all other Considerations, oblige the <hi>Government</hi> to provide for the Common Good. And were the Duty of <hi>Catholick Charity</hi> duly practised, and <hi>Private</hi> Christians once perswaded to <hi>Tolerate</hi> one another; it might then perhaps be safer for the Government to give a <hi>Larger</hi> publick <hi>Toleration</hi> than pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly <hi>now</hi> is <hi>fit.</hi> In the mean while, without troubling our selves with phansies about the <hi>Duty</hi> of our <hi>Governours,</hi> Let us mind our <hi>Own</hi>; especially this great one, of Charity and Christian Love.
