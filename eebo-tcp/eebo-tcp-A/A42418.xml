            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Whence 'twas, Physicians were so frugal grown</l>
               <l>Of others Lives, and lavish of their own;</l>
               <l>How by a Journey to th' <hi>Elysian</hi> Plain</l>
               <l>Peace triumph'd, and old Time return'd again.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Not far from that most celebrated Place,</l>
               <l>Where angry Justice shews her awful Face;</l>
               <l>Where little Villains must submit to Fate,</l>
               <l>That great ones may enjoy the World in state;</l>
               <l>There stands a Dome, majestick to the sight</l>
               <l>And sumptuous Arches bear its oval height;</l>
               <l>A golden Globe plac'd high with artful skill,</l>
               <l>Seems, to the distant sight, a gilded Pill:</l>

               <l>In all her mazes Nature's Face they view'd,</l>

How the same Nerves are fashion'd to sustain</l>

               <l>Th' Ascent thus conquer'd, now They towr on high,</l>
               <l>And tast th' indulgence of a milder Sky.</l>
               <l>Loose <hi>Breezes</hi> on their airy Pinions play,</l>
               <l>And with refreshing Sweets perfume the way.</l>
               <l>Cool streams thro flowry Meadows gently glide,</l>
               <l>And as They pass, their painted Banks they chide.</l>
               <l>These blissful Plains no Blites, nor Mildews fear,</l>
               <l>The Flowers ne'er fade, and Shrubs are Myrtles there.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>The <hi>Delegate</hi> observes with wondring Eyes</l>
               <l>Ambrosial Dews descend, and Incense rise.</l>
               <l>Then hastens onward to the pensive Grove,</l>
               <l>The silent Mansion of disastrous Love.</l>
               <l>No Winds but Sighs are there, no Floods but Tears,</l>
               <l>Each conscious Tree a tragick Signal bears.</l>
               <l>Their wounded Bark records some broken Vow,</l>
               <l>And Willow Garlands hang on ev'ry Bough.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>His Mistress here in solitude he found,</l>
               <l>Her down-cast Eyes fix'd on the silent ground:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:97464:41"/>
Her Dress neglected, and unbound her Hair,</l>
               <l>She seem'd the mournful image of Despair.</l>
               <l>How lately did this celebrated <hi>Thing</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Blaze in the Box, and sparkle in the Ring,</l>
               <l>Till the Green-sickness and Love's force betray'd</l>
               <l>To Death's remorsless arms th' unhappy Maid.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Cold and confus'd the guilty Lover stood,</l>
               <l>The light forsook his Eyes, his Cheeks the Blood;</l>
               <l>An icy horrour shiver'd in his Look,</l>
               <l>Then softly in these gentle words, He spoke:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Tell me, dear Shade, from whence such anxious care</l>
               <l>Your Looks disorder'd and your Bosom bare?</l>
               <l>Why thus you languish like a drooping Flow'r</l>
               <l>Crush'd by the weight of some unfriendly shower.</l>
               <l>Your pale Complexion your late Conduct tell,</l>

Then as he strove to clasp the fleeting <hi>Fair,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>His empty Arms confess'd th' impassive Air.</l>
               <l>From his Embrace the unbody'd Spectre flies,</l>
               <l>And as she mov'd, she chid him with her Eyes.</l>

               <l>Immortal Youth on Hero's Shades below.</l>
               <l>Soon as the bright <hi>Higeia</hi> was in view</l>
               <l>The venerable Sage her Presence knew.</l>

               <l>Hail blooming Goddess, Thou propitious Pow'r,</l>

               <l>Mankind, as you vouchsafe to smile or frown,</l>

With just resentments and contempt you see</l>
               <l>The mean dissentions of the Faculty;</l>
               <l>How sick'ning Physick hangs her pensive head,</l>
               <l>And what was once a Science, now's a Trade.</l>
               <l>Her Sons ne'er rifle her mysterious Store,</l>
               <l>But study Nature less, and Lucre more.</l>

               <l>Then, <hi>Willis,</hi> why spontaneous Actions here,</l>
               <l>And whence involuntary Motions, there:</l>
               <l>And how the Spirits by mechanick Laws,</l>
               <l>In wild Cariers, tumultuous Riots cause.</l>
               <l>Nor wou'd our <hi>Wharton, Bates</hi> and <hi>Glisson</hi> lye</l>
               <l>In the Abyss of blind Obscurity.</l>
               <l>But now such wondrous Searches are forborn,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Paean</hi>'s Art is by divisions torn.</l>
               <l>Then let your <hi>Charge</hi> attend, and I'll explain</l>
               <l>How Physick her lost Lustre may regain.</l>
