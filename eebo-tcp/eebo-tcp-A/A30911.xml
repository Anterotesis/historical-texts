            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have heard that it hath been the Imployment of ſome days among the Exiles of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to frame a Proclamation for Pardoning the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels.</p>
            <p>Both the Subject and Authors, I confeſs, to me ſeem Novel, I hardly thought thoſe men that are up to the Elbows in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Blood ſhould be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like Children, who pettiſhly quarrel at each others Intereſt in their Father, whoſe Emulous Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons deſerve a ſmaller Chaſtiſement. Nor did I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to ſee ſo great Condeſcention in a <hi>Prince,</hi> as to adviſe with every individual man of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, how he may ſecure him; both is demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what we all believed.</p>
            <p>God hath ſent him to do his own work, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him his own Spirit, wonderful in Power, yet ſhadowed with Mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:49255:3"/>Which however the <hi>Iriſh</hi> can little either eſteem, or deſerve, is well enough known to the <hi>Britiſh Proteſtants</hi> of that Kingdom, as perhaps it would be to thoſe of <hi>England,</hi> if conſidered by them.</p>
            <p>I will here in ſome few Inſtances, give my thoughts, why it is ſo, as briefly as the ſubject will admit, reſerving what more ſhould be ſaid, to a larger Diſcourſe, which I deſign on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>The innate Averſion the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ever had to the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> even when Religion and Intereſt were the ſame, Hiſtory witneſſeth.</p>
            <p>That when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were called over by their own Kings, and fought their Battles; yet at the ſame time were they murdered by thoſe whom they had delivered.</p>
            <p>And no Indulgence could ever prevail with them, to be true to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> no not Titles of Honour, Marriages with <hi>Engliſh,</hi> Grants, and Imployments from the Crown: all was (upon the leaſt opportunity) trampled under foot by them, whoſe Venom covered all the Antidotes of Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Honour, and Profit.</p>
            <p>Luſt ſometimes prevailed ſo with them, as to oblige their Grandees, when they could not by indirect means obtain their ſatisfaction, to gain it by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with the <hi>Engliſh</hi>; and though their delight in the Beauty and Humour of their Loves was great, yet could it not reſtrain their Inhumane Barbarity to the Parents of the Child they had in their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom. It becomes not the eyes of a Chriſtian to ſee the Character of their Beſtiality; but they who are inquiſitive may read ſome of it in the Hiſtory of <hi>Ireland</hi>; but greater Examples were in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of Forty One.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49255:3"/>I need not mention their Legends in that War, they are ſo freſh in the memories of all, who are concerned in that Kingdom; but I ſhall come near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the ſcope of my deſign, which is to ſhew, <hi>That Pardon and Lenity to them, however it carries the face of mercy, is really the contrary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then, that it will not attain the end deſigned, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the more eaſie reduction of that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, Mercy in its proper ſignification and intent, is a work of deliverance, and preſervation, and muſt at leaſt bear the majority whereever it extends, in preſerving the Rights of men.</p>
            <p>Now the giving pardon to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> is not ſo, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be granted, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> have been Uſurpers of their Rights.</p>
            <p>It is obvious to every Eye, that by the preſent Rebellion of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the whole Kingdom is ruined, Thouſands of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> murdered, ſtarved, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe deſtroyed. The Queſtion then is by whom hath all this been done? Was it by the <hi>Iriſh?</hi> That is Indubitable. But was not there provocation from the <hi>Engliſh?</hi> That may be a queſtion from Strangers to that Kingdom, and therefore I will anſwer it by a ſhort Narrative of the condition that Kingdom ſtood in, when this laſt ravage was committed by the <hi>Iriſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> was in the Government a bitter Enemy to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Brittiſh Proteſtants,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Militia had been two years before diſarmed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army Disbanded, and an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army in the room.</p>
            <p>The Corporations new modell'd, the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> turned out, and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> put in the Government of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:49255:4"/>
               <hi>Popiſh</hi> Judges Juſtices of the Peace, Sheriffs, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roners, and Conſtables, through the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>This ſhews they could be under no hardſhips from the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And far from fear of them, that were indeed little better than Priſoners, ever ſince the Acceſſion of King <hi>James</hi> to the Crown.</p>
            <p>But it may be ſaid, the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were for King <hi>William,</hi> then Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> No doubt all good men were for him that would reſtore the Kingdoms to their Laws, and Religion; but yet the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were under too ſtrict a Guard, and had no power in their hands to ſecure themſelves; ſo that there was not (I may ſay) a Man in the Kingdom, declared for the Prince until <hi>February,</hi> and moſt of their Rapin and Devaſtation was committed before.</p>
            <p>This I preſume, is enough to ſatisfie any indifferent man, that without the leaſt provocation or pretence of right, the <hi>Iriſh Papiſts</hi> have committed theſe late Maſſacres, Burnings, and Devaſtations on the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now had theſe miſchiefs been reciprocal injuries done on both ſides, though they that were in the right had been ſufferers for the King's Service; yet there might have been room for the <hi>King's Mercy</hi>: But where all the fury of a malicious enemy, fell upon an innocent and quiet people, for no reaſon that they can pretend unto, but that they believed they were for <hi>King William</hi> in their hearts: This ſeems a ſtrange warrant for them, as it is happily without precedent, if in all its Circumſtances it be conſidered, that ſuch monſters of men ſhould have pardon; the impunity of whom as the <hi>Latin</hi> Phraſe hath it, is an injury to all good and honeſt men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:49255:4"/>And now I come to ſhew, that this Proclamation of Pardon cannot be thought mercy; I muſt remember that I am confined to a Letter, and therefore bounded in my Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>I preſume then, that ſeems not an act of mercy, which protects Offenders in their invading the Lives and Properties of Honeſt men.</p>
            <p>Becauſe, according to my firſt Poſition, mercy muſt be circumſcribed within the limits of common right; otherwiſe the peaceable man would have no ſecurity; Government would become an Out-law, and Bandit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, our <hi>Miniſters of State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to come nearer the matter, it is the Maxim of Princes to carry an equal hand in Government; and a General Pardon is a mutual good; now at leaſt may the King's Friends (pardon the familiarneſs of the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) put in for as great a <hi>ſhare</hi> in his <hi>mercy,</hi> as his <hi>enemies?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> pray, let us be included in your Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for our Eſtates: It would be thought impoſſible that the <hi>Champion of the Reformation,</hi> and <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> ſhould return: <hi>No,</hi> I have given them to your, and my Enemies.</p>
            <p>This would ſeem ſeverer, than that haſty judgment of <hi>David, Let</hi> Ziba <hi>and thou divide</hi>; for here the <hi>Iriſh</hi> have all, without the pretence of that Sycophant who met the King on the way.</p>
            <p>I would not reſtrain the Fountain of our King's mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but if the Stream be turned from his Incloſures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Common, I think we may complain of thoſe Avaritious hands that do it.</p>
            <p>We have Invincible Evidence, that his Royal Thoughts are for us; in that he lets us, nay, bids us, ſpeak; and ſince we ſee his mercy, like the Divinity that guides him, is over all his actions: His bleeding Subjects, that have ſuffered ſo much in the Cauſe he
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49255:5"/>
owns, only pray they may not be excluded from the benefit of his Grace and Favour: they deſire not the property of their Enemies, but pray for their own; not for Loſſes in War, which our pretended Friends, but ſecret Enemies would inſinuate; but for Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and Outrages committed in time of Peace; and ſuch as had their own Government and King been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to aſſert but part of the Laws, I verily believe would have, in a great meaſure, been recovered.</p>
            <p>I have heard ſome bring his Majeſty's Proclamation of Pardon in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as an Argument againſt us: I confeſs, to me ſuch inſtances, eſpecially from men of underſtanding, only confirm the apprehenſions many have, which is not my buſineſs here to mention; this I will ſay, in my Inquiries, I find it not in our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of State, but a ſmall Fry that hope to fat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the troubled Waters of <hi>Ireland.</hi> They have heard the <hi>Iriſh</hi> can bribe, and they are loth to ſee the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Treaſure they have got, taken from them; but that it may be left to be offered at their Altars.</p>
            <p>But to return, it ſeems eaſie to anſwer that of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which is in no point Parallel with that of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>: They of <hi>Scotland,</hi> a few miſled People that run on, under pretence of their Religion, and under their Lords: theſe of <hi>Ireland</hi> had no ſuch pretence, for they were under their own Government, had no reſtraint in their Religion.</p>
            <p>They of <hi>Scotland</hi> committed no <hi>Murders,</hi> or <hi>Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> at their firſt going out, but were in their own defence.</p>
            <p>They of <hi>Ireland,</hi> began with both, when no man op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed them.</p>
            <p>They of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſuch as it is, had a pretence, at leaſt perſwaded to it by their Leaders, for King <hi>James</hi> and his Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:49255:5"/>But they of <hi>Ireland,</hi> had not ſo much as that, when they committed their Barbarity in <hi>Ireland.</hi> And to make them more evidently notorious, their own Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment made Proclamation againſt it, though no doubt their chief Men ſet them under hand upon it, though it was too ſavage, and cruel to own.</p>
            <p>But to end this Argument, relating to <hi>Scotland,</hi> they are of one Nation, and <hi>Intereſt</hi>; and his Majeſtie's Mercy when given to ſuch, may be ſaid to extend to all: For their Religion, Friends and Relations are in a great meaſure univerſal among them, and what thoſe <hi>Rebels</hi> do, is under a pretended <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> and may ſo be under the Conſtruction of War, and then more proper for pardon.</p>
            <p>But they of <hi>Ireland,</hi> not to enumerate particulars, are in every one of theſe circumſtances foreign to the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Proteſtants there.</p>
            <p>I will now trouble you with the reaſons that are perſwaſive with one, that this General and Free Pardon will not prevail, to the end deſigned, that is, for the ſpeedy reduction of <hi>Ireland.</hi> We that know the <hi>genius</hi> of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> are not ignorant, that they were never prevailed with by Civilities, and Indulgence; they are like their Boggs, never to be truſted to by going gently over, nor ſafely but by cutting your way to the bottom.</p>
            <p>If you offer to them either, in War, or Peace, terms of Accommodation, they think themſelves of the ſtronger ſide, and will never ſubmit.</p>
            <p>I could give ſeveral Inſtances in this preſent <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi> where Gentlemen have ſent to ſome of their <hi>Grandees</hi> upon the aſſurance of former Friendſhip, and promiſes, of returning whatever kindneſs was ſhewn, at this time: but their return was nothing but inſultings, and commanding their Horſes away;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49255:6"/>
when in two or three days after upon a Meſſage from the ſame <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman, threatning the <hi>Iriſh Don,</hi> he had them ſent back.</p>
            <p>I cannot ſee how it will affect them to the general laying down of Arms, but to the contrary incourage them, in their Rebellion for theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> If it be an Argument on our ſide to haſten the Conqueſt, for fear of the <hi>French</hi> aſſiſtance, or our other imbroyls, it is the ſame on theirs. For incouragement to hold out, in expectation of it. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Underſtanding and Courage is obſerved to be by themſelves underſtood, and depended upon, by negatives: the Enemy ſay they are afraid of us, therefore they know we are wiſe in Council and ſtrong in Arms; if not, they would never offer us ſuch terms, they have a Proverb, <hi>Never bid firſt</hi>; and they conclude he is in <hi>want</hi> that doth.</p>
            <p>The next ground for my opinion, is, That the giving pardon to all that lay down Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will be a means to enlarge the War. For no doubt, moſt of the men of Eſtates will come in, and be thereby the more ſerviceable to their Party, both as to giving them Advice, and Intelligence, and alſo Mony which they may receive out of their Eſtates, in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Quarters, and their Friends of that in the <hi>Iriſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeems a great miſtake to believe, that by taking away the Men of Eſtates from the <hi>Iriſh</hi>; will oblige the reſt to lay down Arms: it will have the quite contrary effect, and I verily believe that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> deſire no better than to have them in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Quarters.</p>
            <p>It makes them conſiderable in the Opinion of their own Party, that they ſhould be ſo courted, and gives
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49255:6"/>
aſſurance to the common People, that when the worſt is upon them, they have them to go to.</p>
            <p>It may be thought a Maxim of War, from the <hi>World of the Moon,</hi> that upon a Rebellion the men of Eſtates, and Leaders into it, as ſoon as they have form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Army and headed them, until they had got all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Eſtates, ſhould then be invited to Pardon, and ſo wait not only the preſent ſucceſs of this, but for another Rebellion.</p>
            <p>And this hath been too much the practice of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Conqueſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which proving ſo often fatal to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> 'tis wonderful the ſame meaſures ſhould be taken again: It really ſeems a Licence for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to rebel, thus to pardon them that are only able to call them to it.</p>
            <p>The Populace could never make a head, but by the aſſiſtance of their Grandees; but when they are once in a body, then they are better commanded without them; and it is a favour to their common intereſt, to receive them into protection, and preſervation againſt another attempt.</p>
            <p>To me it ſeems more reaſonable to believe the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning the Populace, and excluding their Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, would be a readier way to have the Kingdom gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up: for though the <hi>Iriſh</hi> heads of <hi>Clanns</hi> influence the common people, whilſt the Lands and Herds fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them; yet that ceaſeth when they are ſtript of both. It was a true Aphoriſm of the Bell wether, <hi>Neagle,</hi> in his Letter from <hi>Coventry,</hi> That <hi>the Natives of</hi> Ireland <hi>followed the Lords:</hi> you, and I know it in our own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, how careleſs, and unnatural the common <hi>Iriſh</hi> of our Province are to their old Lords, when they often refuſed a days labour to them; and however the common Vogue runs of the command of the old <hi>Iriſh</hi> Proprietors have over the <hi>Scholagues,</hi> I never ſaw it but
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49255:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
where they had ſome immediate dependance upon them as under-Tenants.</p>
            <p>And it would be ſoon found in this caſe, if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation only extend to their private men, or at leaſt none exceeding the degree of a Captain.</p>
            <p>The ordinary people affect not travelling, no not ſo much as out of one Province into another, let them have but liberty to return to their own Cabins, and be protected there, and they will account <hi>themſelves happy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not trouble you farther with my thoughts on this matter, only conclude with this, that beſides the miſtake of bringing the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to lay down their Arms by this General Pardon; this way would put a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in their hands (if they ſhould at any time) to aſſume the ſame Rebellion again; which God avert.</p>
