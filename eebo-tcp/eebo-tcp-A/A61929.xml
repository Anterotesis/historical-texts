            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS to the ſcandalous Paper put forth by that wicked, lewd, lying Woman, who by our means is detected for her wickedneſs, and is now your Priſoner: we ſay we know little of it to be true, nor doth it at all reach us, for we have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but do rather reprove them, and we are as deſirous the wickedneſs and rottenneſs of others that have gone under the diſguiſe of <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſhould be made manifeſt, detected and diſcovered as hers. But we deſire alſo you would not very readily yield and proſtrate your belief to one that hath ſo egregiouſly forfeited her credit and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with you, by being found before you in ſo many notorious lies and falſhoods, eſpecially when her accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others is but to excuſe herſelf, and to extenuate her own vileneſs, and to divert you from further ſearching and prying into her miſcarriages; and alſo the perſons whom ſhe ſo accuſes are at a diſtance from her and not here to ſpeak for themſelves, and all of them except two or three as well unknown to us as to your ſelves. But had ſhe known ſuch <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>vils by them it had been far more honeſt and honourable for her (before her apprehenſion, and then it would not have ſavoured of revenge and malice) to have declared thoſe things to the Nation, to have made the guilty manifeſt, rather then to have gone about deluding and cheating of ſimple people, or ſo to have cauſed the

way of truth and righteouſneſs to have been the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, by her evil practices and leud Converſation; and if any that have paſſed under the name of <hi>Quakers</hi> have faln from the power of truth which ſhould have preſerved them from ſin and evil, or others profeſſed a name with us only in deceit and hypocriſie, yet was that no ground or warrant for her to run into evil alſo; we deſire ſhe may receive a juſt recompence of reward for the wickedneſs ſhe is found guilty of, and we doubt not but the ſame hand of juſtice hath or will find out others, to puniſh them for their faults alſo, (if any ſuch hath been) in the ſeveral places of their abodes. As for our parts we can truly ſay our attaching of her was not the effect of any paſſion or enmity we had to her perſon, but to her leud wicked practices, which we have heard of for above three years paſt. <note n="*" place="margin">As in many places borrowing Money, and pretending ſhe would bring it or ſend it again in a few days but never did.

And yet if ye conſult with Scripture ye will in all ages and generations find there hath been ſuch as hath turned from the way of Righteouſneſs into crooked and by paths; for in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family, there was an <hi>Iſmael</hi> as well as an <hi>Iſaac,</hi> in <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Family an <hi>Eſau</hi> as well as a <hi>Jacob;</hi> among the Twelve a <hi>Judas;</hi> in the Church of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> thoſe that ſaid they were <hi>Jewes,</hi> and were not,

but did lie, and were of the Synagogue of Satan; and in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> an <hi>inceſtious perſon,</hi> and in ſeveral other Churches of the Gentiles, thoſe that drew back unto perdition, that went out from them being not truly of them, for had they been of them they would have continu'd with them as the Apoſtle teſtifies: But, ſuppoſing the matter to be true, which we believe is much of it lies and falſhood, if twenty perſons or more in 16. years experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence have turned aſide and drawn back unto perdition, in whoſe ſoul the Lord will take no pleaſure. As that is no new or ſtrange thing, ſo it ſhall not afright or deter us from walking in the way of truth and righteouſneſs, in which we have found peace and ſatisfaction to our ſoules; but rather invite and exci<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44336:3"/>
are not obedient to it, but receive it in vain, <hi>that turns the Grace of God into laſciviouſneſs.</hi> And as to her accuſations we ſay in general, they touch us not, we challenge the worſt of our adverſaries to declare and make manifeſt what evil they have found by us, and we hope through Grace to make it manifeſt to all men that we are not of thoſe that draw back unto perdition, but of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to the ſaving of the ſoul, and we alſo hope through the ſame Grace to <hi>hold faſt our profesſion without wavering,</hi> and to put to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh men which watch for our halting by our good Converſation.</p>
            <p>And whereas ſhe challenges us to accuſe her if we can of any incivility ſhe acted among us while ſhe walked with us, we anſwer, had ſhe lived in the truth unto this day, which ſhe ſaith ſhe once lived in, (though we have none but her own words for it) there had been no cauſe for the ſeveral accuſations which are brought againſt her at this day, and many more will be brought againſt her as ſhe well knowes, which is the true reaſon why ſhe conceales her right name and hath paſſed under ſeveral names, and alſo the place of her abode, which we deſire ſhe may be detained until ſhe doth reveal, and alſo till a teſtimonial do come from the ſaid place, that her report therein is true, (being ſhe hath told you that her dwelling houſe is againſt the white Lyon in Southwark, and it hath not been found ſo) and this we hope you will judge reaſonable, and ſo let it be manifeſt, you are a <hi>terror to evil werks and workers and bear not the Sword in vain.</hi> And whereas ſhe ſaith ſhe once walked innocently and unblameable, we anſwer, we know not that, but were it ſo—that will no more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe her, then it will excuſe the fallen Angels, of whom <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaks, who keeping not their firſt eſtate, but loſt their priſtine habitation, and are now reſerved in everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
