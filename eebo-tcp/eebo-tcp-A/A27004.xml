            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecauſe there are ſome, who judging of others by themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will ſay what need this labour among Chriſtians, to prove a God, a Life to come, and the Truth of the Goſpel? Or at leaſt what need is there of it, after ſo much already written? I take my ſelf obliged to give you an account of this attempt: For my own Reaſon is much againſt <hi>over-doing,</hi> and waſting our little time in things <hi>ſuperfluous;</hi> which is but enough for neceſſary things: But it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded this among the <hi>indubitata; Boni rarò ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis; optimi nunquam; indifferentes ſaepiſſimè mali ſemper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The true Reaſons of this work, are no fewer than theſe following. <hi>1. Quod cogitamus, loquimur:</hi> That which is <hi>moſt</hi> and <hi>deepeſt</hi> in my <hi>thoughts,</hi> is apteſt to break forth to others. Man is a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative Creature. Though it be to my ſhame, I muſt confeſſe, that <hi>neceſſity,</hi> through perplexed thoughts, hath made this Subject much of my Meditations: It is the Subject which I have found moſt <hi>neceſſary</hi> and moſt <hi>uſefull</hi> to my ſelf. And I have reaſon enough to think, that many others may be as weak as I. And I
<pb facs="tcp:59459:3"/>
would fain have thoſe partake of my ſatisfaction, who have partaked of my difficulties.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I perceive, that becauſe it is taken for a ſhame, to doubt of our Chriſtianity and the Life to come, this hindereth many from uttering their doubts, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver get them well reſolved, but remain half Infidels within, whileſt the Enſigns of Chriſt are hanged with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; and need much help, though they are aſhamed to tell their needs: And prudent Charity will relieve thoſe who are aſhamed to beg.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As the true knowledge of God, is the beginning and maintainer of all holineſſe and honeſty of Heart and Life; ſo latent Atheiſme and Infidelity in the mindes of Hypocrites in the Church, is the root of their prophaneneſſe, diſhoneſty and wickedneſſe. Did they ſeriouſly Believe as Chriſtians, they would not live as the Enemies of Chriſtianity! I take it therefore to be the ſureſt and moſt expeditious Cure of the ſecurity, preſumption, pride, perfidiouſneſſe, ſenſuality, and wickedneſſe of theſe Hypocrites, to convince them that there is a God, and a Life to come, and that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is true.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And this <hi>prophaneneſs</hi> and <hi>ſenſuality</hi> tendeth to <hi>greater Infidelity.</hi> They that will not <hi>live</hi> as they <hi>profeſs</hi> to <hi>Believe,</hi> may moſt eaſily be drawn to <hi>Believe</hi> and <hi>profeſs,</hi> as they are willing to <hi>live.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Prognoſtick commandeth me to endeavour, to prevent mens open profeſſion of Infidelity, lest the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent torrent of ungodlineſſe, ſelfiſhneſſe, malice, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſſe, perjury, treachery, faction, whoredom, and other ſenſualities, ſhould fall into this gulf, or one that is not much unlike it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The best complain of the imperfection of their Faith: And too many good Chriſtians, eſpecially if
<pb facs="tcp:59459:3"/>
Melancholy ſurpriſe them, are haunted with ſuch temptations, to Atheiſme, blaſphemy and unbelief, as make their lives a burden to them! And one that hath heard ſo many of their complaints as I have done, is excuſable for deſiring to relieve them. It hath many a time been matter of wonder to me to obſerve, that there is ſcarce one deep melancholy perſon among ten (religious or not religious before) but is followed with violent ſuggeſtions to doubt of the God-head, and of the truth of the Goſpel, or to utter ſome word of Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy againſt God. And he that muſt pray, <hi>[Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe my Faith, and help my Unbelief,]</hi> muſt uſe other means as well as pray.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The imperfection of our Faith (even about the Goſpel, and the Life to come) is the ſecret root of all our faults; of the weakneſſe of every other grace, of our yielding to temptations; and of the careleſneſſe, badneſſe, and barrenneſse of our Lives. So Tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent are the Concernments of the Life to come, that a <hi>certain, clear,</hi> and <hi>firm belief</hi> of them, would even deride temptations, and bear down all the trifles of this World, by what names or titles ſoever dignified, as things not worthy of a look or thought! <hi>What manner of perſon will that man be, in all holy Converſation and Godlineſs,</hi> who believing that <hi>all theſe things muſt be diſſolved,</hi> doth look for the coming of Chriſt, and for the Bleſſed Conſequents! <hi>2 Pet. 3.11, 12, 14. 2 Theſſ. 1.10.</hi> O what a life would that man live! what Prayers, what Prayſes! what holy diſcourſe would employ his tongue! with what abhorrence would he reject the baits of ſin! who did <hi>but ſee,</hi> but <hi>once ſee,</hi> thoſe unſeen and future things, which every Chriſtian profeſſeth to believe? How con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptibly would he think and ſpeak both of the <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59459:4"/>
and the ſufferings of this dreaming life, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the everlaſting things? What ſerious deſires, and labours, and joyes, and patience, would ſuch a ſight procure? How much more holy and <hi>Heavenly</hi> would it make even thoſe that by the purblind World are thought to exceed herein already? And if we took our <hi>Belief</hi> to be as certain as <hi>our ſight,</hi> Believing would do greater matters than it doth. I oft think what one told me, that an Infidel anſwered him, when he asked him, <hi>How he could quiet his Conſcience in ſuch a deſperate ſtate?</hi> ſaith he, <hi>[I rather won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how you can quiet your Conſcience in ſuch a common careleſs courſe of life, believing as you do? If I believed ſuch things as you do, I ſhould think no care, and diligence, and holineſs could be enough.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>The Soul in fleſh</hi> is ſo much deſirous of a <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive way</hi> of apprehenſion, and <hi>ſenſible</hi> things being ſtill before us, do ſo increaſe this Malady, and divert the minde from ſpiritual things, that we have all great need of the <hi>cleareſt evidence,</hi> and the moſt ſuitable, and frequent, and taking explication of them, that poſſibly can be given us, not only to make us <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> things unſeen, but to make us <hi>ſerious,</hi> and <hi>practical,</hi> and <hi>affectionate</hi> about the things which in a ſort we do believe; to keep drowſie hearts awaken.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The way of taking Religion upon truſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out riſing up to make it our own, hath filled the Church ſo full of Hypocrites who have no better than an <hi>humane</hi> Faith, that thereby the <hi>complexion</hi> of it is much changed, from its primitive beauty: And thouſands do periſh by felf-deceit: And though ſome of their Gifts be ſerviceable to the Goſpel, others of
<pb facs="tcp:59459:4"/>
them do more effectually ſerve the Devil, againſt the Cauſe and Servants of Chriſt, than they could have done if they were profeſſed Infidels.</p>
            <p n="9">9. It makes me bluſh, and ſtirrs my Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to read and hear abundance of hot and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Diſputes, and tedious or Critical diſcourſes about many ſmall leſſe needfull things, by thoſe men that never ſtudyed the Foundation, nor can with Senſe and Reaſon defend their Chriſtianity againſt an Infidel. Such prepoſterous methods are perverſe and nauſeous.</p>
            <p n="10">10. I am much afraid leſt many of thoſe ignorant zealous Chriſtians, who now turn to that Sectary whom they cannot anſwer, would turn to the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del at laſt, when they finde themſelves unable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute them, through their own inſufficiency and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groundedneſse in the Truth.</p>
            <p n="11">11. But if they do not Apoſtatize, what a ſhame will it be to the Church of God, to have our Religion thus betrayed, by ſuch as are not able to defend it? And how many others may it tempt to Infidelity, to hear an Ignorant Chriſtian baffled.</p>
            <p n="12">12. I am too ſure, that too many Teachers, that ſhould be Champions for the Truth, are lamentably unfurniſhed for ſuch a Conflict, by neglecting the ſtudy of the Foundation, and beſtowing all their thoughts on the Superſtructure.</p>
            <p n="13">13. I know that it is Gods method, to cauſe the growth of <hi>Faith</hi> at the root, in proportion to its growth in tallneſſe and in fruit: It is his merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Providence, to keep thoſe whoſe Faith hath weaker roots, from the ſtrong temptations which others undergoe. As the Plant that is <hi>little,</hi> doth

bear but little of the ſtroke of the windes; which elſe would quickly overturn it: but the root grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downward, as the top groweth upward, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication and the aſſaults are ſtill proportioned: So Faith muſt grow equally in its Roots and <hi>Branches</hi> while we live. Had I felt as ſtrong aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults againſt my Faith while I was young, as I have done ſince, I am not ſure it would have ſcap'd an overthrow.</p>
            <p n="14">14. I have in the anatomizing of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies which moſt hazard the Church of Chriſt, found ſo much latent Atheiſme and Infidelity, that I think among many (that do not obſerve it) the true root of all the difference is, Whether there be a God, and a Life to come? And whether the Scriptures be true.

We have had hot and ſcandalous Diſputes among Chriſtians, <hi>de Reſolutione Fidei;</hi> each Party invalidating the others Foundations, as if it had been our work to perſwade the Infidel World, that <hi>they</hi> are in the right. And I thought it the only way to end that Controverſie, to open all the Cauſes of our Faith. The <hi>Roman</hi> Party may here perceive our Grounds, and better know into what we reſolve our Faith, than if we named only one ſort of Cauſe, and ſaid, I reſolve it into this: As if all the Frame had but one Wheel?

And it is a work which requireth the greateſt judgement and zeal in them that muſt perform it. It is a dolefull thought, that five parts of the World are ſtill Heathens and Mahometans; And that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes and Preachers do no more to their Recovery; but are taken up with ſad Contentions among themſelves: And that the few that have attempted it, have hitherto had ſo ſmall ſucceſſe. The opening of the true method for ſuch a Work, is the higheſt part of my deſign: In which though many others have excellently laboured, [eſpecially <hi>Savonarola, Campanella, Ficinus, Vives, Micrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, Dupleſsis, Grotius,</hi> and our <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi>] my Zeal for the ſaving of Mens Souls hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked me to try, whether I might adde any thing to their more worthy Labours, in point of <hi>Method</hi> and perſpicuity of Proof.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE natural love to knowledge and to my ſelf, which belong to me as I am a Man, have commanded me to look beyond <hi>this life,</hi> and diligently to enquire, whether there be any certainty of a <hi>better?</hi> and which is the <hi>way</hi> to it, and to whom it doth of right belong. And what I have certainly diſcovered in this ſearch, the love of Mankind, and of Truth, and of God, oblige me to communicate. But it was not a curſory glance at Truth, nor a look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it afar off, in my ſtate of ignorance and diverſion, which brought the ſatisfying light into my mind: nor can you reaſonably expect it ſhould do ſo by you. I ſaw <hi>that</hi> in one <hi>Savonarola, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panella, Ficinus, Vives, Mornay, Grotius, Cameron, Micraelius,</hi> which I now ſee might ſatisfie all the world, if it were duly received. But it was not a bare reading of one or all of theſe and others, which was a due reception: I found that truth muſt be ſo long retained, and faithfully elaborated by a diligent and willing mind, till it be concocted into a clear methodical underſtanding, and the Scheme or Analyſis of it have left upon the ſoul its proper
<pb facs="tcp:59459:8"/>
image, by an orderly and deep impreſſion; yea, till the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of the matter become as nutriment, bloud and ſpirits to the Will, before it is truly made our own. It expecteth (I ſay not greater courtſhip, but) more cordial friendſhip, than a tranſient ſalute, before it will unveil its glory, and illuſtrate, beautifie and bleſs the ſoul. It is food and Phyſick: it will nouriſh and heal: but not by a bare look or hear-ſay, nor by the reading of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript. Could I procure the Reader to do <hi>his part,</hi> I doubt not but this Treatiſe will ſuffice on <hi>its part,</hi> to bring in that light, which the <hi>Sagae,</hi> the <hi>Lemures</hi> and <hi>Daemones</hi> of <hi>Atheiſm, Infidelity</hi> and <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs</hi> will not be able to endure.</p>
            <p>But I am far from expecting univerſal ſucceſs; no not if I brought a Book from Heaven. The far greateſt part have unprepared minds, and will not come up to the price of truth. And nothing is more ſure than that <hi>recipitur ad modum recipientis; &amp; Pro captu lectoris habent ſua fata libelli.</hi> Theſe drones imagine, that they are fit to judge of a Scripture-difficulty, or of an argument concerning the myſteries of Religion, before they know what it is to be a Man, or underſtand the Alphabet of Nature, even thoſe points which ſupernatural Revelations preſuppoſe: ſuch uncapableneſs in the Reader is as a great hinderance, as the want of ſolid proof and evidence in the Writer. Moſt men are drowned in filthy ſenſuality, or worldly cares; and their reliſh is vitiated by luſcious vanities; their reaſon is debaſed by ſubjection to the fleſh, and darkned and debilitated by long alienation from its proper work: and yet they are ſo conſtituted of <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>pride,</hi> that they can neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand

If God will be converſed with in the midſt of their feaſting, cups and oaths, in their pride, and revelling, and with their whores; if he will be found of them that hate his holineſs, and all that love it, and ſeriouſly obey him, then God ſhall be their God, and Chriſt ſhall be their Saviour, and if this be the way, they may become good Chriſtians: But if retired ſerious thoughts be neceſſary, and an honeſt faithfulneſs to what they know, they muſt be excuſed: They that know that it is not an hours peruſal of a book of Aſtronomy, Geometry, Muſick, Phyſick, &amp;c. which will ſerve to make them skilful in theſe Arts, do expect to attain far higher wiſdom, by inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable induſtry and ſearch; and will not be wiſe unleſs they can be taught by viſion in their dreams,
<pb facs="tcp:59459:9"/>
or in the crowd and noiſe of worldly buſineſs, and of fleſhly luſts.</p>
            <p>I find that it is a difficult task which I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, to be the inſtructer of ſuch men: if I be large and copious, their lazineſs will not ſuffer them to read it: if I be conciſe, I cannot ſatisfie their expectations; for they think nothing well proved, if every objection be not anſwered, which idle ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villing brains can bring: Neither have they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient <hi>attentiveneſs</hi> for <hi>brevity,</hi> nor will their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance allow them to underſtand it. The contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting vices of their minds, do call for impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities for the cure. Their <hi>Incapacity</hi> ſaith, It muſt be a full explication, or I cannot apprehend the ſenſe or truth. Their averſeneſs and ſlothfulneſs ſaith, It muſt be ſhort, or I ſhall be tired with it, or cannot have while to read it. I cannot anſwer both theſe expectations to the full: but though the greatneſs of the matter have made the Book bigger than I intended, the nauſeating ſtomack of moſt Readers hath perſwaded me to avoid unneceſſary words: and as big as the Book is, I muſt tell the Reader, that the ſtyle is ſo far from redundancies (though ſome things be oft repeated) that if he will not chew the <hi>particular words,</hi> but ſwallow them whole, and beſtow his labour only on the Sentences, I ſhall ſuppoſe that he hath not read the Book.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ficinus</hi> very truly noteth, that while children and youth are ſufficiently conſcious of their ignorance, to keep in a learning courſe, they may do well; but when they firſt grow to a confidence of their own underſtandings, and at ripeneſs of age imagine, that their wits are ripe, and think that their unfurniſhed

But if God keep them as humble dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent learners, till they have orderly gone through their courſe of ſtudies, and ſanctifie their greener youthful knowledge; they then grow up to be confirmed Chriſtians. <hi>Ficin. de Verit. Rel. cap.</hi> 3. It is therefore the <hi>diligence</hi> and <hi>patience</hi> of the Reader which I ſtill intreat, and not his belief: for I will beg nothing of his <hi>underſtanding,</hi> but <hi>juſtice</hi> to the <hi>truth</hi>; but (ſuppoſing God's help) do truſt to the cogencie of evidence.</p>
            <p>Yet I muſt tell you, that I expect the Reader, by the truths which he learneth, ſhould be able himſelf to anſwer an hundred trivial objections, which are here paſſed by: and that in particular <hi>textual difficulties,</hi> he have recourſe to Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries and Tractates on thoſe ſubjects: for this Book is long enough already. He that will diligently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the connection of the conſequent Propoſitions to the Antecedent, and will underſtand what he readeth as he goeth along, will ſee that I give him ſufficient proof of all which I deſire him to aſſent to. But I make no doubt but a haſty and half-witted Reader can find objections and words enough againſt the plaineſt truth here written; and ſuch as he thinks do need a particular anſwer. When an underſtanding Reader would be offended with me, if I ſhould recite them. I had more compaſſion on the ſober Reader, than for the humouring of every brainſick Sceptick, to ſtand proving that two and two are four. I write for ſuch as are <hi>willing</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:59459:10"/>
be <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>happy,</hi> and that at dearer rates than jeſting: For others, I muſt leave them, whether I will or no, to be wiſe too late.</p>
            <p>And for thoſe capricious brains who deride our ordinary preaching, as begging and ſuppoſing that which we do not prove, when they have here, and in other ſuch writings, found our <hi>fundamentals proved,</hi> let them hereafter excuſe our ſuperſtructure, and not think that every Sermon muſt be ſpent in proving our Chriſtianity and Creed.</p>
            <p>In the firſt part of this Book, I give you no te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies from the Chriſtian writings or authorities, becauſe I ſuppoſe the Reader to be one that doth not believe them; and my buſineſs is only to prove Natural Verities by their proper evidence: But leſt any ſhould think that there is not ſo much legible in <hi>Nature,</hi> becauſe the wiſeſt Heathens ſaw it not, I have cited in the margin their atteſtations to moſt particulars, to ſhew that indeed they did confeſs the ſame, though leſs diſtinctly and clearly than they might have done, (as I have plainly proved.) But, being many years ſeparated from my Books, I was forced to do this part leſs exactly than I would have done, had I been near my own or any other Library. Again, I ſeriouſly profeſs, that I am ſo confident of the juſt proofs and evidences of truth here given, that I fear nothing as to fruſtrate the ſucceſs, but the Reader's <hi>Incapacity,</hi> (through <hi>half-wittedneſs</hi> or <hi>wickedneſs</hi>) or his <hi>Lazineſs</hi> in a curſory and negligent peruſal of what is conciſely but evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently propoſed.

               <p>Moreover Nature teacheth all men to ſeek felicity, and fear infelicity and calamity: which they need not do, nor could not do, if they were all <hi>parts of God</hi>: God cannot be miſerable, but <hi>Man</hi> can, as to his <hi>Soul</hi> as well as his Body, and the miſery of his Body is little to that of the Soul even in this life.

God may not be puniſhed or afflicted, but a wicked man may be puniſhed and afflicted, even in his <hi>mind</hi> or <hi>Soul</hi>; and a Magiſtrate will not think, when he hangeth a thief, that he either puniſhed bare fleſh, or that he puniſhed God.</p>
               <p>Moreover God can wrong no man, but one man may wrong another. God need not fear doing any thing amiſs, but the Soul of man muſt fear it. No part of God can be ſo unhappy as to chooſe to be a Toad, or a wicked or miſerable man. God hath no Body, but ſo have theſe Souls; elſe when men eat a plant, or bird, or any fleſh, they eat part of the Body of God.</p>
               <p>Moreover I find, that it is Bodies only that are Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative or Extenſive, and ſo diviſible into parts: many parts of <hi>one Body</hi> may be animated by <hi>one Soul,</hi> but not by <hi>many parts</hi> of that one Soul, (except the Soul be material it ſelf.)</p>

Nor is it part of God that is Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and part that is Omniſcient, and part that is</hi> Good; <hi>or</hi> quae poteſt intelligit &amp; vult: <hi>lut the whole Godhead is</hi> Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, <hi>the whole</hi> Omniſcient, <hi>and the whole is</hi> Good, <hi>or Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs it ſelf: Yet each of theſe Notions by it ſelf alone is not a total or full expreſſion of the whole perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Deity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore we muſt neither confound the eſſential Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in God, nor divide the Eſſence. The Omnipotency is as one faculty, the Underſtanding another, and the Will another; but the Godhead and Eſſence of them all is one, the Glory equal, the Majeſty co-eternal.

               <p>And becauſe of the Unity of the Eſſence, theſe <hi>Three</hi> may be predicated in the <hi>Concrete</hi> of each other, but not in the <hi>Abſtract,</hi> becauſe of their formal diverſity. And ſo it may be ſaid, that the Power is an Underſtanding or wiſe Power, and the Underſtanding is an Omnipotent Underſtanding, and the Will a moſt Wiſe and Omnipotent Will, and the Power a Good and Willing Power: but not that the Power is the

               <p>But yet that God is <hi>much more</hi> to the world than a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive Soul,</hi> is undeniable; becauſe he is the <hi>creating Cauſe,</hi>

And therefore though we call not God the Soul of Man, becauſe we would not ſo diſhonour him, nor confound the Creator and the creature; yet we all know that he is to us much more than the Soul of Souls, for in him we live, and move, and have our being. So alſo it is as to God's cauſation of the Being, Motion and Order of all the world. God is incomparably <hi>more</hi> to it than its Form, as being the total firſt Cauſe of Form and Matter.

As it is no diſhonour to a Watch-maker to make that Engine, which ſheweth his skill, inſtead of performing all the motions without that little frame of means: But yet no ſimilitude will reach the caſe, becauſe all creatures themſelves are but the continued productions of the Creator's will; and the virtue which they put forth, is

               <p>Though he made his Body of pre-exiſtent Matter, yet was that Matter made of nothing; and therefore God is
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59459:36"/>
properly Mans CREATOR, and not his Fabricator only. And a CREATURE is a Relation, which inferreth the Correlate, a CREATOR, as a <hi>Son</hi> doth a Father. This therefore is Gods firſt grand Relation unto Man, which hath no cauſe to produce it, but his actual <hi>Creation,</hi> which is its <hi>fundamentum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 2. <hi>This Grand prime Relation, inferreth a Trinity of Grand Relations,</hi> viz. <hi>That God is our OWNER, our R<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LER, and our BENEFACTOR, of which we are now to ſpeak in order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That theſe Three are juſtly diſtinguiſhed from each other, is paſt doubt to all that underſtand what is meant by the terms. An <hi>Owner</hi> as ſuch is not a <hi>Ruler</hi> or <hi>Benefactor,</hi> a <hi>Ruler</hi> as ſuch is not an <hi>Owner</hi> or a <hi>Benefactor.</hi> A <hi>Benefactor</hi> as ſuch is neither an <hi>Owner</hi> nor a <hi>Ruler.</hi> And the enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſufficient: All humane affairs, or actions of converſe and ſociety, belong to Man in one of theſe three Relations, or ſuch as are ſubordinate to them, and meer dependents on them, or compounded of them. They are in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the <hi>Genera,</hi> and in ſome as it were the <hi>Elements</hi> of all other Relations. And from the manner of men, they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to God, with as much propriety of ſpeech, as any terms that man can uſe concerning him. And he that could draw a true ſcheme or method of the Body of Morality (or Theology, for all is one with me) would reduce all the dealings of God with Man, which are ſubſequent to the fundamental Act of Creation, to theſe <hi>three Relations</hi>; and accordingly diſtinguiſh of them all: Yet in the <hi>Mixt acts,</hi> (as moſt are ſuch) diſtinguiſhing only of the compounding Elements (I mean, the intereſt of theſe three Relations, as making up the ſeveral acts.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 3. <hi>A full</hi> Owner <hi>or Proprietor, is called</hi> Dominus <hi>in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, and is one that hath a</hi> Jus poſſidendi, diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nendi, &amp; utendi; <hi>a right of</hi> having <hi>or poſſeſſing,</hi> diſpoſing <hi>and</hi> uſing, <hi>without any copartner, or ſuperior Proprietor, to reſtrain him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The meaning is better known by the bare terms of deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, through common uſe, than by definition. We know what it meaneth, when a man ſaith of any thing, <hi>It is mine own:</hi> There are defective half-proprieties, of Co-partners,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59459:37"/>
and ſubordinate Proprietors, which belong not to our preſent caſe. The word <hi>Dominus, &amp; Dominuim,</hi> is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time taken laxely, as comprehending both Propriety and Rule; and ſometime <hi>improperly,</hi> for Government or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it ſelf: But among Lawyers it is moſt commonly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken properly and ſtrictly for an <hi>OWNER</hi> as ſuch: But leſt any be contentious about the uſe of the word, I here put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of it, the word <hi>Owner</hi> and <hi>Proprietor,</hi> as being more free from ambiguity.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Thoſe writers who confound Propriety and Government un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the word Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and then beſtow long and ſharp diſputes on the queſtion, what is the <hi>fundamentum</hi> of Gods dominion, do but delude the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and exerciſe the patience or contempt of the intelligent,</note>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 4. <hi>GOD is</hi> jure Creationis &amp; Conſervationis, <hi>the moſt abſolute Owner or Proprietor of Man, and the whole Creation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not poſſible that there ſhould be a more full and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>title</hi> to <hi>propriety,</hi> than <hi>Creation,</hi> and <hi>total conſervation</hi> is. He that giveth the World all <hi>its Being,</hi> and that of <hi>nothing,</hi> and <hi>continueth</hi> that being, and was beholden to no pre-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtent matter, nor to any co-ordinate concauſe, nor depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on any ſuperiour cauſe in his cauſation, but is himſelf the firſt independent, efficient, total cauſe of being and well-being, and all the means thereto, muſt needs be the abſolute Owner of all, without the leaſt limitation or exception.</p>
               <p>It is not the ſupereminency of Gods nature, excelling all created beings, that is the foundation of this his <hi>Propriety</hi> in the creature. For <hi>Excellency</hi> is no title to Propriety. And yet he that is <hi>unicus in capacitate poſſidendi,</hi> that is ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendently excellent as to have no Copartner in a claim, might by Occupation be ſole Proprietor, in that kinde of Propriety <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> which Man is capable of: Becauſe there is no other whom he can be ſaid to wrong. But GOD hath a more plenary title by Creation, to <hi>Abſolute Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 5. <hi>Therefore it belongeth to GOD to be the</hi> Abſolute Diſpoſer <hi>of all things: To do with them what he pleaſe: and to</hi> uſe <hi>them to the pleaſure of his will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Every one may do with his own what he liſt, except the propriety be but limited, and dependent on another, or but <hi>ſecundum quid.</hi> Who ſhould interpoſe and any way hinder God, from the <hi>free diſpoſall</hi> of his <hi>own?</hi> Not any Copartner, for there is none. Nor the Creature it ſelf, becauſe it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely His.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 6. <hi>Therefore alſo</hi> (in hoc inſtanti, <hi>antecedently to any
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59459:37"/>
further Relation or Covenant) it is not poſſible for God to do wrong to his Creature, howſoever he ſhall uſe it: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is abſolutely his own, and he oweth it nothing: And where there is no</hi> Debitum, <hi>there is no</hi> Jus, <hi>and can be no</hi> Injuria.</p>
               <p>It is to be remembred that I ſpeak not here of God as now related to the Rational creature as a <hi>Rector</hi> and a <hi>Benefactor,</hi> and as having declared his <hi>own will</hi> in his Laws or Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to the contrary. But I ſpeak of God only in the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Proprietor ſimply in it ſelf conſidered, and ſo of his Abſolute right, and not his <hi>Ordinate will</hi> (as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called). No man need to fear leſt God ſhould deal unequally with him, or contrary to that which true Reaſon calleth Juſtice. For God having made himſelf <hi>Rector</hi> of the World, hath, as it were, obliged himſelf, that is, declared his will, to deal equally with all men, and judge them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their works: And ſo hath created a <hi>Debitum, &amp; Jus</hi> to man, which inferreth a certain <hi>Juſtice</hi> on Gods part. But conſidering him <hi>only in this firſt Relation, meerly, ut Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus abſolutus,</hi> or <hi>Proprietor,</hi> it is not poſſible for any thing that he can do, to be <hi>an injury</hi>: A meer corporal pain (including no contradiction or error, as <hi>conſciences accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the innocent,</hi> doth) could be no wrong: There being leſs appearance of reaſon to call it wrong, than for my burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Wood, or plucking a Roſe to be a wrong: For it is not the <hi>Pain</hi> of one that can make it an injury, any more than the deſtruction of the other: where there is no <hi>Jus,</hi> there can be no <hi>Injuria</hi>: And where there is no <hi>Debitum</hi> there is no <hi>Jus.</hi> My Roſe hath poſſeſſion of its life, but no <hi>Right</hi> to it: Therefore it is no wrong to deſtroy it. And yet in this, and in the killing of Birds, and Beaſts and Fiſhes, and labouring my Horſe and Oxe in continual wearineſs and pain, my borrowed half-propriety <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> excuſeth me from doing them any wrong: Which <hi>Gods Abſolute Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety</hi> will do much more unqueſtionably by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 7. <hi>Though all Gods Three Eſſential Principles or Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs, appear in each of his Three grand Relations, Owner, Ruler, and Benefactor; yet each one of theſe hath moſt eminently ſome one of Gods Eſſential principles or faculties appearing in it:</hi> viz. <hi>His Power moſt appeareth
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59459:38"/>
in his Propriety, his Wiſdom in his Rule, and his Goodneſs or Love in his benefits given us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore Propriety reſulteth immediately from <hi>Creation,</hi> as producing the Creature as a Creature; but ſo doth not Government, as we ſhall ſee anon. And as Omnipotency is the moſt eminent Attribute in the Creation, ſo is it in that <hi>Abſolute Propriety</hi> of the Creator, acquired by it.</p>

               </p>
               <p>For there is nothing more reaſonable, than that every one ſhould have his own: And the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> of man ſhould conceive of things as they are, and the <hi>Will</hi> of man ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to his Makers Intereſt and right, or elſe it were moſt crooked, irregular and unjuſt.

                  <hi>§.</hi> 3. <hi>Therefore man ſhould labour to know wherein he may be moſt uſeful to his Maker's Intereſt, (which is his Pleaſure in our perfection) and therein he ſhould willingly and joyfully lay out himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For it is undeniable that God ſhould be ſerved with his Own, and that entirely without dividing: for we are not <hi>in part,</hi> but <hi>wholly his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 4. <hi>Therefore no man can have any propriety in himſelf, but what is derived from his Abſolute Lord, and ſtandeth in full ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to his propriety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:59459:38"/>For there can be but one full and abſolute Proprietor. I can have no other propriety in my ſelf, but by derivation and truſt from my Creator.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 5. <hi>Therefore alſo no creature can have any Propriety in another creature, but onely derivatively, ſubordinate,</hi> &amp; ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum quid.</p>
               <p>No Parent hath any propriety in his Children, nor the moſt abſolute and potent Prince in his People, but as God's Stewards under him; no not in <hi>themſelves,</hi> and therefore not in others.

                  <hi>§.</hi> 6. <hi>And as I am not my Own, ſo nothing is properly my own which I poſſeſs, but all that I have is God's as well as I.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For no man can have more title to any thing elſe than to himſelf. He that is not Owner of himſelf, is Owner of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And we have not any thing, nor can have, which is not as much from God as we, and therefore is not as much his.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 7. <hi>Therefore no man ſhould repine at God's diſpoſal of him, but all men ſhould acquieſce in the diſpoſing-will of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For it is unreaſonable and unjuſt to murmur at God, for doing as he liſt with his own, and uſing any thing to his ends.</p>

                  <hi>§.</hi> 8. <hi>And therefore all men ſhould avoid all</hi> ſelfiſh <hi>affections, and partiality, and be more affected with God's intereſt than their own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For we are not ſo much our <hi>Own</hi> as his, and our intereſt is not conſiderable in compariſon of his.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But yet we muſt take heed how we oppoſe or neglect this laſt eſpecially, becauſe the will of God doth take moſt pleaſure in the publick or common benefit of his creatures; and therefore theſe two are very ſeldom ſeparated: nor ever at all as to their real good, though as to carnal, lower good, it may ſo fall out.</p>
               <p>All theſe are ſo plain, that to ſtand to prove or illuſtrate them, were but to be unneceſſarily and unprofitably tedious.</p>

               <p>For as he hath taught men (and bruits too) to love their <hi>Own,</hi> it intimateth that he will not deſpiſe his <hi>Own</hi>: and therefore his intereſt in us is our comfort.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The thing that I am firſt to prove, is, That Man's Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor hath made him <hi>ſuch</hi> a <hi>creature,</hi> whoſe nature requireth a Government; that he hath a <hi>neceſſity</hi> of Government, and an <hi>aptitude</hi> to it.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Government</hi> I mean, the exerciſe of the moral means of

               <p>I diſtinguiſh Laws from all meer natural motions and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitation: for though analogically the <hi>Shepherd</hi> is ſaid to <hi>rule</hi> his Sheep, and the <hi>Rider</hi> his Horſe, yea, and the <hi>Pilot</hi> his Ship, and the <hi>Plow-man</hi> his Plow, and the <hi>Archer</hi> his Arrow: yet this is but equivocally called <hi>Government,</hi> and is not that which we here mean, which is the propoſal of duty, ſeconded with rewards or puniſhment for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glects, by thoſe in authority, for the right governing of thoſe that are committed to their care and truſt. So that it is not <hi>all moral</hi> means neither which is called Government, for the inſtruction or perſwaſion of an Equal is not ſuch. Laws, and Judgment, and Execution are the conſtitutive parts of Government. But by <hi>Laws</hi> I mean the whole kind, and not only <hi>written Laws,</hi> nor thoſe only which are made by Sovereign Rulers of Common-wealths, which by excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency are called Laws: but I mean, <hi>The ſignification of the will of a Governour, making the ſubjects duty, and determining of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the obedient, and puniſhments to the diſobedient.</hi> Or, <hi>[An authoritative conſtitution de debito officii, praemii &amp; poenae, for the ends of Government.]</hi> So that as Parents, and Tutors, and Maſters, do truly govern as well as Kings; ſo they have truly <hi>Laws,</hi> though not in ſuch eminency as the Laws of Republicks. The will of a Parent, a Tutor, or Maſter, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted concerning duty, is truly a Law to a Child, a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, or a Servant. If any diſlike the uſe of the word <hi>[Law]</hi> in ſo large a ſenſe, it ſufficeth now for me to tell them in what ſenſe I uſe it, and ſo it will ſerve to the underſtanding of my mind. I take it for ſuch an Inſtrument of Government. The parts of it are, 1. The conſtituting of the <hi>debitum officii,</hi> or what ſhall be due <hi>from the Subject.</hi> 2. The conſtituting the <hi>debitum praemii vel poenae,</hi> or what ſhall be due <hi>to the Subject,</hi> which is in order to the promoting of obedience, though as to the <hi>performances</hi> obedience may be in order to the <hi>reward.</hi> Now that man is a creature made to be <hi>governed,</hi> by ſuch a proper moral Government, I prove.</p>

And though his power be tranſcendent, his exerciſe of it muſt be according to the capacity of the ſubject: and therefore morally by Laws and Executions.

But if it had been granted, that all God's government is by Phyſical efficacy, it would ſtand good nevertheleſs, that Laws and Judgment are part of the means which he maketh ſo effectual.

               <p>Obj. <hi>Then God's Covenants to man do not bind him.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not at all, by proper obligation, as if it were his <hi>Duty</hi> to keep them, and his <hi>Sin</hi> to break them; for God is not capable of <hi>duty</hi> or <hi>ſin.</hi> But yet improperly they may be called Obligations, becauſe they are the demonſtrations of his Will, which the perfection of his Nature will not let him violate. It would be an imperfection, if God ſhould break promiſe, though not a ſin or crime: And therefore it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for God to lie.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But ſuppoſe we ſay, that Man is under no other obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions than a Beaſt; and that among men there is no proper right or wrong, duty or fault: yet men by confederacies, without any other Government, would ſettle Rules for the ſafety of cohabitation and converſe, and for love of themſelves would forbear wronging others. And this is all the Law of Nature that Man hath above Bruits.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thoſe <hi>Confederacies</hi> would no further oblige them, than their <hi>Intereſt</hi> required them to obſerve them. Still by this rule a man is left free to kill wife and children; if he be weary of them, which no neighbour, being wronged by none, will ſeem obliged to revenge: ſtill he that is the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is left to do his worſt, without fault, to ſeize upon other mens eſtates, and to depoſe Kings and deſtroy them, and all the world would be in a ſtate of war. Or if ſelf-intereſt keep ſome quiet for a time, it would be but till they had ſtrength and opportunity to do otherwiſe. He is not fit for humane ſociety, who would tell all about him [I take my ſelf free to defraud and murder any of you, as ſoon as my own ſafety and intereſt will allow it me.] And no man that thus taketh a man for a beaſt, can expect any better uſage than a beaſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, any further than ſelf-love ſhall reſtrain others from abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him: nor can he plead any better title to his eſtate, nor exemption from the violence of the ſtronger. And it will

alſo follow, that <hi>honeſty</hi> is nothing but <hi>ſelf-preſerving</hi> policy; and that blaſphemy and impiety againſt God need not be feared or avoided; nor any thing as a <hi>fault,</hi> but only as a <hi>folly,</hi> expoſing the perſon himſelf to danger. Inceſt, Perjury, Lying, might be impudencies, but not any crimes.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>If you ſuppoſed them in God, they would be but imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and not crimes, and why ſhould you judge othewiſe of them in Man.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe the <hi>abſolute perfection of his Nature</hi> is inſtead of a Law to God, who hath no Superiour.

               <p>And moreover, if Man have reaſon and wiſdom above a Beaſt, which maketh him capable of knowing Right and Wrong, and of being moved by the things that are evident to reaſon, though not to ſenſe; and if he be made to be governed by Laws, (as was proved before) then he is certainly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned accordingly; or elſe his nature and reaſon were given him in vain, which could not be by the moſt wiſe Creator.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>God governeth the world as the Soul governeth the Body, which is rationally</hi> ex parte animae; <hi>but not by giving reaſon or laws to the Body: but deſpotically by the natural power of the Will.</hi>

The Government muſt be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the capacity of the Subject. Though the Rider rule the Horſe by a bridle and ſpur, and not by a Law, it followeth not that the King muſt not rule the Rider ſo. The Soul and Body conſtitute one <hi>Suppoſitum</hi> or Man; and therefore the Body is governed by a Law, becauſe the Soul is ſo, which deſpotically moveth it: Laws are for diſtinct individuals, and not for one part of an individual to give to another part.</p>

               </p>
               <p>It is the groſs ignorance of the Divine perfections, which ever made any one queſtion the particular Providence of God as extending to the ſmalleſt things and actions. 1. It is proved by his <hi>Immenſity</hi> (conceived of as without corporeal extenſion of parts as before ſaid): He that made and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth all the World, did never make that which is greater than himſelf, and excludeth his preſence. Though being a Spirit he hath not Corporeal quantity, yet analogically and in a way of eminency and tranſcendency, we muſt ſay that he is Greater and Immenſe: And it is his perfection which denyeth extenſion and dimenſions; and therefore in a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler kinde he is every where preſent. And if he be here as certainly as I am, and in a more excellent manner, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but obſerve all things and actions which are here.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He is <hi>Omnipotent</hi> and <hi>All ſufficient,</hi> and therefore as Able to obſerve and govern every the ſmalleſt Thing and

action, as if he had but that one to look after in the world. And I think, if God had but <hi>one man</hi> at all to mind and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern in all the world, the Adverſary himſelf, that now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth his particular providence, would confeſs, that God doth obſerve and regard that one individual. It is mens Atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or Blaſphemous diminutive thoughts of God, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of him as <hi>finite,</hi> though they call him <hi>infinite,</hi> which is the cauſe of all ſuch kind of errors.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His <hi>Omniſcience</hi> infallibly proveth alſo his particular ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of all things and actions in the world: for His <hi>Knowledge</hi> being his natural perfection is <hi>neceſſary:</hi> He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>ignorant</hi> of any thing that is. If I had but one thing juſt before my eyes to ſee, in the open light, I muſt needs ſee it, if it have the neceſſaries of a viſible object, unleſs I wink. If the Sun's illumination were an act of viſion, (as its like it is nothing more ignoble) how eaſily would it at once diſcern all that is upon one half of the earth at once? All things are naked and open before the eye of the Omniſcient being: He cannot but behold or know them, and therefore obſerve them and regard them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. His Creation, Cauſation and Manutetency alſo prove, that he both <hi>knoweth</hi> and regardeth all things: For can he be either ignorant, forgetful or mindleſs of that which he made, and ſtill doth ſo conſerve, as to continue a kind of Creation of it? His Omnipotent Will which gave it a being, doth ſtill continue it; ſhould he withdraw his active ſuſtentation, it would turn all, not only to confuſion but to nothing. And doth he not know and regard what is continually as in his hand, or by continual volition produced or maintained by him? He is the univerſal Cauſe of all the agency and motion in the world; in him we Live, Move and Be: and can he be ignorant or regardleſs of what <hi>he doth?</hi> Why will he make, maintain, and move that which he doth not <hi>regard?</hi>

For that Creature which <hi>is nothing</hi> of it ſelf, and hath not <hi>any Being</hi> but in full dependance on its Maker, can have <hi>no action</hi> of it ſelf, but in full dependance upon him; what ever it doth, it doth by him: though as to the <hi>ſpecifying compariſon, why this rather than that,</hi> God hath given <hi>men</hi> a <hi>power</hi> with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, yet the Action as an Action, being from the Power which was totally from him, is ſo it ſelf: There can be no leſs of God's agency in any action, becauſe he doth it by a Creature, than if he did it without; though there be <hi>more</hi> of the Creatures, there is no <hi>leſs</hi> of his: His communication of Power is not by diſcerption, or diviſion and diminution of his own.

                  <hi>§.</hi> 2. <hi>All men are obliged to conſent to this ſubjection, and to give up themſelves abſolutely to the government of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God's abſolute propriety in us as his creatures, giveth him ſo full a Title to govern us, that <hi>our conſent</hi> is not at all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to our <hi>obligation</hi> and ſubjection-relative; but only to our <hi>actual obedience,</hi> which cannot be performed by one that conſenteth not. Therefore God's right and our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral condition are the foundation of our ſubjection to him, as to <hi>Obligation</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi>; and he that <hi>conſenteth</hi> not, ſinneth by high Treaſon againſt his Soveraign. As God did not ask our <hi>conſent</hi> whether he ſhould make us men, ſo neither whether he ſhould be our Governour and we his Subjects as to obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation: nor yet whether he ſhall puniſh the rebellious and diſobedient. But he asketh our <hi>conſent</hi> to <hi>obey him,</hi> and to be <hi>rewarded</hi> by <hi>him</hi>: for we ſhall neither be <hi>holy</hi> nor <hi>happy</hi> but

               <p>THe true nature of a Law I have opened before.<note place="margin">Though <hi>Cicero</hi>'s books <hi>de legibus,</hi> be uſually read by us when we are boyes, they are worthy the peruſal of the wiſeſt men, and fit for the edification and pleaſure of the learned.</note> It is not neceſſary that it be <hi>written</hi> nor <hi>ſpoken</hi>; but that it be in general any apt <hi>[ſignification of the Will of the Rector to his ſubjects, inſtituting what ſhall be due from them and to them, for the ends of Government.]</hi> Therefore whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is a <hi>ſignification of Gods will to man, appointing us our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and telling us what benefit ſhall be ours upon the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, and what loſs or hurt ſhall befall us, if we ſin,</hi> is a Law of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 1. A Law <hi>being the</hi> Rectors Inſtrument <hi>of</hi> Governing, <hi>there can be no Law where there is no Government: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that which ſome call,</hi> The eternal Law, is indeed no Law at all; But it is the Principle of all juſt Laws.</p>
               <p>The Eternal Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God (that is, the Perfection of his Nature and Will) as related to a <hi>Poſſible, or future Kingdom,</hi> is denominated <hi>Juſtice</hi>: And this <hi>Juſtice</hi> ſome call the <hi>Eternal Law</hi>: But it is truly no Law, becauſe it is the will of God in himſelf, and not as <hi>Rector</hi>; nor is it any <hi>ſignification</hi> of that <hi>Will,</hi> nor doth it ſuppoſe any <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned ſubjects</hi> in being from Eternity; nor doth it make any duty to any from Eternity: But all the Laws which God maketh <hi>in time,</hi> (and conſequently which <hi>men make,</hi> which are juſt and good) are but the Products of this Eternal Will and Juſtice.</p>
               <p>And whereas ſome ſay, that there is an eternall truth in ſuch Axiomes as theſe [Thou ſhalt love God above all, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59459:57"/>
do as thou would'ſt be done by, and the good ſhould be incouraged, and the bad puniſhed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] I anſwer, God formeth not Propoſitions; And therefore there were no ſuch Propoſitions from Eternity: Nor was there any Creature to love God,<note place="margin">Quod (de magiſtratu loquitur) cum dico legem, a me dici ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil aliud intelligi vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo quàm imperium, ſine quo nec domus ulla, nec civitas, &amp;c. <hi>Id. de leg.</hi> 3. <hi>init.</hi>
                  </note> or to do Good or Evil, and be the ſubject of ſuch Propoſitions: That Propoſition therefore which <hi>was not</hi> from Eternity, was neither <hi>true</hi> nor <hi>falſe</hi> from Eternity; for <hi>non entis non ſunt accidentia vel modi.</hi> But this is true, that from Eternity there were the <hi>grounds</hi> of the verity of ſuch Propoſitions when they ſhould after be: And that if there had been ſubjects from Eternity for ſuch Propoſitions, and Intellects to frame them, they <hi>would have</hi> been of Eternal truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 2. <hi>At the ſame time of his Creation that God made Man his ſubject, he alſo made him ſome Laws, to govern him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, ſubjection being a general obligation to obedience, would ſignifie nothing, if there were no particular duties to be the matter of that obedience. Elſe Man ſhould owe God no obedience, from the beginning, but be Lawleſs; for where there is no Law, there is no Obedience: (Taking a Law in the true comprehenſive ſenſe, as I here do.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 3. <hi>All the objective ſignifications</hi> in natura rerum, within <hi>us or</hi> without <hi>us, of the Will of God, concerning our Duty, reward or puniſhment, are the True Law of Nature, in the primary proper ſenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 4. <hi>Therefore it is falſly defined by all Writers, who make it conſiſt in certain axioms (as ſome ſay) born in us, or written on our hearts from our birth; (as others ſay) diſpoſitively there.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, that there is in the nature of Mans Soul a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain aptitude to underſtand certain Truths, as ſoon as they are revealed, that is, as ſoon as the very <hi>Natura rerum</hi> is obſerved: And it is true, that this diſpoſition is brought to actual know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as ſoon as the minde comes to actual conſideration of the things. But it is not true that there is any <hi>actual</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of any Principles born in Man: Nor is it true, that the ſaid <hi>Diſpoſition to know</hi> is truly <hi>a Law</hi>; nor yet that the actual knowledge following it, is a Law: But the <hi>diſpoſition</hi> may be called <hi>a Law Metonymically,</hi> as being the aptitude of the faculties to receive and obey a Law; as the Light of the Eye,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59459:57"/>
which is the <hi>potentia &amp; diſpoſitio videndi,</hi> may be called [the <hi>Light of the Sun</hi>] but unhanſomly: And the ſubſequent actual knowledge of Principles, may be called the <hi>Law of Nature metonymically,</hi> as being the <hi>perception</hi> of it, and an effect of it: as <hi>actual ſight</hi> may be called, the Light of the Sun, and as <hi>actual knowledge</hi> of the Kings Laws, may be called His <hi>Laws within us,</hi> that is, the effect of them, or the Reception of them: But this is far from propriety of ſpeech.</p>
               <p>That the inward axiomes as <hi>known</hi> are not Laws, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, 1. Becauſe a Law is <hi>in genere objectivo,</hi> and this is <hi>in genere actionum</hi>: A Law is <hi>in genere ſignorum</hi>; but this is the <hi>diſcerning of the ſign:</hi> A Law is the <hi>will of the Rector ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified</hi>: this is his will <hi>known</hi>: A Law is <hi>Obligatory</hi>: this is the <hi>perception</hi> of an Obligation. A Law <hi>maketh duty</hi>: but this is the <hi>knowledge</hi> of a <hi>duty made.</hi> 2. The Law is not in our power to change or abrogate: But a mans inward diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and perceptions are much in his power, to encreaſe or diminiſh, or obliterate: Every man that is wilfully ſenſual and wicked, may do much to blot out the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> which is ſaid to be written on his heart; But wickedneſs cannot alter or obliterare the <hi>Law</hi> of God: If this were Gods Law which is upon the heart, when a ſinner hath blotted it out, he is diſobliged from duty and puniſhment: For where there is no Law, there is no duty or tranſgreſſion. But no ſinner can ſo diſoblige himſelf by altering his Makers Laws: 3. Elſe there would be as many Laws of Nature, not only as there are men, but as there are diverſity of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions: But Gods Law is not ſo uncertain and multiform a thing. 4. And if Mans <hi>diſpoſition</hi> or <hi>actual knowledge</hi> be Gods Law, it may be alſo called Mans Law: And ſo the Kings Law, ſhould be the Subjects perception of it.</p>
               <p>It is therefore moſt evident, that the true Law of Nature is another thing: (And is it not then a matter of admiration, that ſo many ſagacious, accurate Schoolmen, Philoſophers,<note place="margin">Omnis lex inventum ſane &amp; donum eſt Deorum. Decretum vero hominum pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentum— <hi>Demoſt. cont. Ariſ. or.</hi> 1.</note> Lawyers, and Divines, ſhould for ſo long time go on in ſuch falſe definitions of it!) The whole World belongeth to the Law of Nature, ſo far as it <hi>ſignifieth to us</hi> the <hi>will</hi> of God, about our duty, and reward, and puniſhment: The World is as Gods Statute Book: The foreſaid <hi>natural aptitude,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59459:58"/>
us fit to read and practiſe it. The <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> is as the external Light of the Sun; and the ſaid <hi>natural diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,</hi> is as the viſive faculty to make uſe of it. Yet much of the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> is <hi>within us too</hi>: But it is there only <hi>in genere objectivo, &amp; ſigni:</hi> Mans own Nature, his Reaſon, Free will, and Executive power, are the moſt notable <hi>ſigns</hi> of his duty to God; To which all Mercies, Judgements, and other ſignifying means belong.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 5. <hi>The way that God doth by Nature oblige us, is by laying ſuch</hi> fundamenta <hi>from which our duty ſhall naturally reſult, as from the ſignification of his Will.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>§.</hi> 6. <hi>Theſe</hi> fundamenta <hi>are ſome of them unalterable (while we have a being,) and ſome of them alterable: And therefore ſome Laws of Nature are alterable, and ſome unalterable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</hi>

Nature by the poſition of many circumſtances, hath made Inceſt ordinarily a thing producing manifold evils, and a ſin againſt God: And yet <hi>Nature</hi> ſo placed the children of <hi>Adam,</hi> in other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that the ſaid <hi>Nature</hi> made that their duty (to marry one another) which in others would have been an unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral thing: Nature forbiddeth Parents to murder their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59459:58"/>
But when God the abſolute Lord of life, would that way try <hi>Abrahams</hi> obedience, when he was ſure that he had a ſupernatural command, even Nature obliged him to obey it. Nature forbiddeth men to rob each other of their proper goods. But when the <hi>Owner</hi> of all things, had given the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> the <hi>Egyptians</hi> goods, and changed the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the <hi>fundamentum</hi> of their former natural obligation ceaſed. Changes <hi>in natura rerum,</hi> which are the <hi>foundation</hi> of our obligation, may make changes in the obligations, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were natural. But ſo far as <hi>Nature,</hi> that <hi>Nature</hi> which foundeth duty is the ſame, the duty remaineth ſtill the ſame: The contrary would be a plain contradiction.</p>

                  <hi>and Related thus to God, and Gods Nature and Relations being as afore deſcribed, Man is naturally obliged to take God to be what he is in all his Attributes forementioned</hi> (cap. 5.) <hi>and to ſuit his will, and affections to God accordingly: that is, to take him to be omnipotent, omniſcient, and moſt good, moſt faithfull, and moſt juſt, &amp;c. and to believe him, ſeek him, truſt him, love him, fear him, obey him, meditate on him, to honour him, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre him before all the World; and this with all our Heart and might, and to take our chiefeſt pleaſure in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this ſo evidently reſulteth from the Nature of God and Man compared, that I cannot perceive that it needeth proof or illuſtration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 10. <hi>It is a contradiction to Nature, that any of this duty proper to God, may be given to any other, and that any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Idol of our Imagination ſhould be eſteemed, loved, truſted, obeyed, or honoured as God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:59459:59"/>For that were falſhood in us, injury to God, and abuſe of the Creature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 11. <hi>Nature requireth, that Man having the gift of ſpeech from God, ſhould imploy his Tongue in the Praiſe and ſervice of his Maker.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This plainly reſulteth, from our own Nature, and the uſe of the Tongue, compared with, or related to Gods Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and perfections, with his propriety in us, and all that's ours, and his Government of us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 12. <hi>Seeing Man liveth in totall dependance upon God, and in continual receivings from him, Nature obligeth him to uſe his heart and tongue in holy deſires expreſs'd and exerciſed in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and in returning thanks to his great Benefactor, (of which more anon.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For though God know all our ſins and wants already, yet the Tongue is fitted to <hi>confeſs</hi> our <hi>ſins,</hi> and to expreſs our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires: And by <hi>confeſsing</hi> and <hi>expreſſing,</hi> a twofold capacity for mercy accreweth to us: That is, 1. Our own <hi>Humiliation</hi> is excited and increaſed by the ſaid Confeſſions; and our Deſires, and Love, and Hope, excited and increaſed by our own Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, (the tongue having a power to reflect back on the heart, and the exerciſe of all good affections being the means of their increaſe.) 2. And a perſon that is found in the actual exerciſe of <hi>Repentance</hi> and holy <hi>Deſire,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> is morally, and in point of Juſtice, a much fitter recipient for pardon, and acceptance, and other bleſſings, than another is: And it being proved by Nature, that Prayer, Confeſſion and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, hath ſo much uſefulneſs to our good, and to our further duty, Nature will tell us, that the tongue and heart ſhould be thus imployed. And therefore Nature teacheth all men in the World, that believe there is a God, to confeſs their ſins to him, and call upon him in their diſtreſs, and to give him thanks for their receivings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 13. <hi>Seeing Societies as ſuch are totally dependent upon God, and mens gifts are communicative, and Solemnities are operative: Nature teacheth us, that God ought to be ſolemnly acknowledged,</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>III.</hi> Of GOD's Relation to Man as his BENEFACTOR and his END. Or as his CHIEF GOOD.</head>
               <p>THE Three <hi>Eſſential Principles</hi> in God, do eminently give out themſelves to Man in his Three Divine Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to us. His <hi>Power, Intellect</hi> and <hi>Will</hi>; His <hi>Omnipotency, Omniſcience</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi>; in his being our <hi>Owner,</hi> our <hi>Ruler,</hi> and our <hi>Chief Good.</hi> The two firſt I have conſidered already; our Omnipotent Lord or Owner, and our moſt <hi>wiſe Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> and our Counter-relations with the duties thereof. I now come to the third.</p>
               <p>For the right underſtanding whereof, let us a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59459:62"/>
of the <hi>Image of God</hi> in Man,<note place="margin">Porro coeli generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis authorem ſumme Bonum atque excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentiſſimum (aſſeruit <hi>Plato</hi>): ejus quippe quod ſit in rebas conditis pulcherri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum, eum eſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditorem quem intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligibilium omnium conſtet eſſe praeſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſimum. Itaque quoniam hujuſmodi Deus eſt, coelam ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro praeſtantiſſimo illi ſimile eſt, quoniam pulcherrimum cerni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, nulli creaturae erit ſimilius, quàm Deo ſoli. <hi>Laert. in Plat.</hi>
                  </note> in which we muſt here ſee him. It is Man's WILL, which is his ultimate, perfective, imperant faculty; it is the proper ſubject of Moral habits, and principal agent of Moral acts: And therefore in all Laws and Converſe, the WILL is taken for the Man; and nothing is further morally Good or Evil, Virtuous or culpably Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, than it is Voluntary. The INTELLECT is but the Director of the WILL: Its actions are not the perfect actions of the Man: If it apprehend bare <hi>Truth</hi> without reſpect to <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> its Object is not the higheſt or felicitating or attractive Object, and therefore the act can be no higher: if it apprehend any Being or Truth as <hi>good,</hi> it apprehendeth it but as a ſervant or guide to the WILL, to bring it thither to be received by LOVE. The perfect excellency of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of humane acts is <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> and not meer <hi>Entity</hi> or <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> Therefore the excellenteſt faculty is the <hi>Will</hi>: It is <hi>Good</hi> that is the <hi>final-Cauſe</hi> in the object of all humane acts: Therefore it is the <hi>fruition</hi> of <hi>Good</hi> which is the perfective final Act; and that <hi>fruition</hi> of Good as Good, is, though intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductorily by Viſion, yet finally and proximately by Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies, which is nothing elſe but <hi>Love</hi> in its moſt eſſential act, delighting in its attained object. And for the <hi>executive Power,</hi> though in the order of its natural being, it be before the Will, yet in its operation <hi>ad extra,</hi> it is after it, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by it.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, while we ſee God but in this Glaſs, we muſt conceive that his Principle of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> ſtand in the foreſaid order as to his WILL: and his Omnipotence and Omniſcience, to that <hi>eminently-moral Goodneſs,</hi> which is the perfection of his will. (The <hi>natural goodneſs</hi> of his <hi>Eſſence</hi> filling all.)</p>
               <p>Therefore here note, that this Attribute of God (his GOODNESS) doth make Him <hi>our Chief Good,</hi> in a two-fold reſpect, both EFFICIENTLY and FINALLY. In ſome ſort it is ſo with the other Attributes: His <hi>Power</hi> is <hi>Efficiently</hi> the ſpring of our being and actions; and <hi>finally</hi> and <hi>objectively</hi> it terminateth our ſubmiſſion and our truſt. His <hi>Wiſdom</hi> is the <hi>principle</hi> of his Laws, and alſo the <hi>object</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries and underſtandings. But his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> is the EFFI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIENT of all our good in its <hi>perfection</hi> of <hi>cauſality,</hi> and that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59459:63"/>
END of our Souls,<note place="margin">Nihil eſt Deo ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius &amp; gratiis, quàm vir, animo perfecto bonus, qui homini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus caeteris antecel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit, quod ipſe à Diis immortalibus diſtat. <hi>Luc Apul. de Deo Socr.</hi>
                  </note> which is commonly called ULTIMATE ULTIMUS. So that to <hi>ſubmit</hi> to his <hi>Power,</hi> and to be <hi>ruled</hi> by his <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> is, as I may ſay, <hi>initially</hi> our end. But to be <hi>pleaſing</hi> to his <hi>good-will,</hi> and to be <hi>pleaſed</hi> in his <hi>good-will</hi>; that is to <hi>Love Him,</hi> and to be <hi>beloved by Him,</hi> is the abſolute perfection and end of man.</p>
               <p>Therefore under this his Attribute of <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> God is to be ſpoken of both as our BENEFACTOR and our END; which is to be indeed our <hi>ſummum bonum.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>No creature can give us any thing which is originally its own, having nothing but what it hath received from God: Therefore it is no more to us, but either a gift of God, or a Meſſenger to bring us his gift; they have nothing themſelves but what they have received: nor have we any ſort of Good, either Natural, Moral, of Mind, or Body, or Fortune, or Friends, but what is totally from the Bounty of our Creator, and as totally from him, as if no creature had ever been his inſtrument.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>§.</hi> 3. <hi>As God's Goodneſs is that by which he communicateth Being and all Good to all his Creatures, and is his moſt comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Attribute, in point of</hi> Efficiency, <hi>ſo is it that Attribute which is</hi> in genere cauſae finalis, <hi>the</hi> finis ultimate ultimus <hi>of all his works. God can himſelf have no ultimate end but Himſelf: and his rational creatures can have no other lawful ultimate End: And in Himſelf, it is his</hi> Goodneſs, <hi>which is completely and ultimately that End.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here I am to ſhew, I. That God himſelf can have no ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate end but Himſelf. II. That Man ſhould have no other. III. That God, as in his <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> is <hi>ultimate ultimus,</hi> the End of Man.</p>
               <p n="1">I. 1. That which is moſt Beloved of God is his ultimate End: but God Himſelf is moſt beloved of Himſelf: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is his own ultimate End.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of the major Propoſition is, Becauſe to be the <hi>ultimate end,</hi> and to be <hi>maxime amatum,</hi> is all one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

hath reſpect to the Means of attainment, and is that <hi>cujus amore media eliguntur &amp; applicantur.</hi> This God is not capable of, (ſpeaking in propriety) becauſe he never <hi>wanteth</hi> his End. <hi>Finis fruitionis</hi> is that which <hi>amando fruimur</hi>; which we love complacentially in full attainment: And ſo God doth ſtill <hi>enjoy</hi> his end: and to have it in Love is to <hi>enjoy</hi> it.</p>

                  <hi>Obj.</hi>
                  <q>But if God have not <hi>finem quaerentis,</hi> then in every inſtant he enjoyeth his end: and if ſo, then he uſeth no <hi>means</hi> at all: for what need any means be uſed for that end, which is not ſought but ſtill enjoyed. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, where there is no means there is no end.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> As <hi>finis</hi> ſignifieth nothing but <hi>effectum, viz. perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionem operis,</hi> which is but <hi>finis terminativus</hi>; ſo it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at preſent attained; and God may be ſaid to uſe means, that is, ſubordinate efficients or inſtruments to accompliſh it. But as it ſignifieth <hi>cauſam finalem,</hi> ſcil. <hi>cujus amore res fit,</hi> ſo far as it may (without all imperfection) be aſcribed to him, he muſt be ſaid continually to <hi>enjoy</hi> it: And yet to uſe means for it, but not as wanting it, but in the ſame inſtant <hi>uſing</hi> and <hi>enjoying</hi>: that is, He conſtantly communicateth himſelf to his creatures, and conſtantly loveth himſelf ſo communicated. He is the firſt efficient and ultimate end, without any interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing inſtant of Time, (were Eternity diviſible) but in order of <hi>Nature,</hi> he is the <hi>Efficient</hi> before he is the <hi>End enjoyed,</hi> but not before the End intended. He ſtill ſendeth forth the beams of his own Glory, and ſtill taketh pleaſure in them ſo ſent forth: His <hi>works</hi> may be increaſed and attain perfection, (called <hi>finem operis</hi> by ſome) but his <hi>Complacency</hi> is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed or perfected in his works, but is always perfect: As if the Sun took conſtant pleaſure in its own emitted light and heat, though the effects of both on things below were moſt various. God is ſtill <hi>pleaſed</hi> in that which <hi>ſtill is,</hi> in all his own works, though his works may grow up to more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>Or if any think fit to ſay, that God doth <hi>quaerere finem,</hi> and that he may enjoy more of it at one time than another, yet muſt he confeſs, that nothing below the complacency of his own will, in his own emitted beams of Glory, ſhining in his works, is this his ultimate end.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:59459:64"/>2. That which is the Begining muſt be the End: But God is the Beginning of all his works: therefore he is the End of all. He himſelf hath no Beginning or Efficient, and conſequently no final cauſe of himſelf: but his <hi>works</hi> have himſelf for the Efficient, and for their End: that is, He that made them, intended in the making of them, that they ſhould be illuſtrious with his communicated beams of Glory, and thereby <hi>amiable</hi> to his <hi>will,</hi> and ſhould all ſerve to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency.</p>
               <p>If the End were lower than the Beginning, there would be no proportion; and the Agent would ſink down below himſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If any thing beſides God were his ultimate End, it muſt thereby be in part Deifi'd, or his actions debaſed by the lowneſs of the End: but theſe are impoſſibilities. The Actions are no nobler than their End: and the End is more noble than the <hi>Means</hi> as ſuch.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The ultimate End is the moſt amiable and delectable: The Creature is not to God the moſt amiable and delectable: Therefore the Creature is not his ultimate end. The firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument was from the Act, this from the Object.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The ultimate end is that in which the Agent doth finally acquieſce: God doth not finally acquieſce in any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Therefore no creature is his ultimate end.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>That the</hi> finis cui <hi>is properly the ultimate end, and the</hi> finis cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus <hi>is ſubordinate to it,</hi> Cicero <hi>ſheweth in</hi> Piſo<hi>'s ſpeech,</hi> l. 5. de finib. p. 188.

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59459:64"/>
which he doth <hi>propter voluntatis impletionem, &amp; inde complacentiam</hi>; which is the final act, and the final object of the creating act; But for the <hi>actus complacentiae</hi> it is not <hi>actus intentionis</hi> but <hi>fruitionis</hi>; and therefore hath no end, above it ſelf: And the final object of that Complacency, is not the Creature it ſelf, but the Impletion of the Divine will in the Creature; yea, the Image of his Omnipotency, Wiſdom and Goodneſs ſhining in the Creation, is not loved <hi>propter ſe,</hi> ultimately; but for the ſake of that <hi>Divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> and Perfection of which it is the Image: (as we love the Image of our friend for his ſake;) ſo that when all is done, God himſelf is his own end in all his works, ſo farr as (very improperly) he may be ſaid to <hi>intend an end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or if you could prove the Creature to be the <hi>Objectum finale,</hi> that proveth him not to be properly the <hi>finis ultimus:</hi> For that is a difference between Mans agency and Gods: Man is an Agent made and acting for his final Object, and more ignoble than his Object (as the eye of a Flie that beholdeth the Sun): But God is an Agent more noble than the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, who gave the Object it ſelf its being, and made it of nothing, for himſelf; and ſo the Object is <hi>for his</hi> final Act.</p>

               <p n="2">II. That <hi>man</hi> ſhould have no ultimate End but God, (that is, <hi>ultimate ultimus</hi> as its called) is proved in what is ſaid: and the fuller opening of it, belongeth to the next Chapter.</p>

But God is neither <hi>mortall</hi> needing a propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpecies, nor is he ſubſervient to any other, and finally for its uſe.</p>
               <p>And as for the <hi>Soul,</hi> it made not the <hi>matter</hi> of its own body, but found it made, though in the formation of it, it might be ſo efficient <hi>as domicilium ſibi fabricare.</hi> But God
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59459:66"/>
made all <hi>matter</hi> of nothing, and gave the World whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is or hath; And therefore was Perfect himſelf before: For an imperfect being could never have been the cauſe of ſuch a frame: Therefore he needed no <hi>domicilium</hi> for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor as an imperfect Part (a form) to concurr to the conſtitution of a <hi>whole.</hi> But he is the <hi>efficient, dirigent</hi> and <hi>final</hi> cauſe of the World and all things, but not the <hi>conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent</hi> or <hi>eſſential</hi>; for then the Creature and Creator were all one, and God debaſed, and the Creature deified: But he is to them a <hi>ſupra-eſſential cauſe</hi>; even more than a <hi>form</hi> and <hi>ſoul,</hi> while he is a <hi>total efficient</hi> of all.</p>

               <p>If you ſay, that all this is hurtfull to the <hi>Individuals,</hi> but not to the <hi>

For you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that the good which would make it Happy, is given to it limitedly, and with mixtures of permitted or inflicted evil; and that God could have given them more of that goodneſs, if he would: God could have freed them from pain and miſery; yea, and have given the ignorant more knowledge, and honeſty, and grace. So that it is not <hi>our intereſt</hi> that is the meaſure of his goodneſs: And if ſo, what is it that you call the <hi>

Therefore it muſt be ſomewhat above the ſenſible intereſt of any or all the Individuals, which you call the <hi>Bonum <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſitatis:</hi> and that can be nothing elſe but that <hi>ſtate</hi> and <hi>order</hi> of the <hi>

               <p>It is certain that God is infinitely good, and that all his works alſo are good in their degree: but withall it is certain, that God in himſelf is the <hi>Simple Primitive Good,</hi> and that <hi>created goodneſs</hi> principally conſiſteth in a conformity to his Will, which is the ſtandard and meaſure of it.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> He that will ever come to knowledge, muſt begin at the firſt Fundamental Truths, and in his enquiry pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to leſſer Superſtructures, and reduce uncertainties and difficulties to thoſe points which are <hi>ſure</hi> and <hi>plain,</hi> and not caſt away the <hi>plaineſt certain truths,</hi> becauſe they over-take ſome difficulties beyond them. The true method of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry is, that we firſt try <hi>whether there be a God that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Good or not:</hi> If this be once proved beyond all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, then all that followeth is certainly reconcilable to it: for Truth and Truth is not contradictory. Now that God is <hi>perfectly Good</hi> hath been fully proved before: He that giveth to all the world, both Heaven, and Earth, and all the Orbs, all that Good, whether Natural, Gracious or Glorious, which they poſſeſs, is certainly Himſelf better than all the world: for he cannot give more Goodneſs than he hath: this is not to be denied by any man of reaſon: therefore it is proved that God is perfectly Good.<note place="margin">Iſ God's making man a free Agent be not againſt his Goodneſs, then the ſin which a free Agent committeth is no impeachment of Gods Goodneſs: <hi>At verum prius:</hi> Ergo— The reaſons why God made man with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, the antient VVri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters commonly render to the Infidels: <hi>itenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Tertullian, Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Alexand.

               <p>Therefore to come back again upon every conſequent which you underſtand not, and to deny a fundamental prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, which hath been undeniably demonſtrated; this is but to reſolve that you will not know. By this courſe you may deny any demonſtrated truth in Mathematicks, when you meet with difficulties among the ſuperſtructed conſequents.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore methodically proceed: We have proved that God is the cauſe of all the Goodneſs in the world, in Heaven and Earth, and therefore muſt needs be Beſt himſelf. And it is certain, that all the ſins and calamities which you mention <hi>are</hi> in the world, and that the creature hath all

                  </note> therefore it is certain that theſe two Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities are conſiſtent, what ever difficulty appeareth to you in the reconciling them. Thus far there is no matter of doubt. And next we are therefore certain, that the Meaſure of God's Goodneſs is not to be taken from the Creatures intereſt. And yet we know that his Goodneſs inclineth him to communicate goodneſs and felicity to his creatures: for all the Good in the world is from him. It remaineth therefore, that he <hi>is good, neceſſarily</hi> and <hi>perfectly</hi>: and that he doth all <hi>well</hi> whatſoever he doth: and that there is in the Creature a higher Goodneſs than its own felicity, even the Image of God's Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs, in which his Holineſs and Juſtice have their place. And that this Goodneſs of the Univerſe (which conſiſteth in the Glorious appearances of God in it, and the ſuitableneſs of all to his Will and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) includeth all things except ſin, which are contained in your objection; and that puniſhment of ſinners, though it be <hi>malum phyſicum</hi> to them, is a moral good, and glorifieth God's Juſtice and Holineſs: and even the permiſſion of ſin it ſelf is good, though the ſin be bad. And yet that God will alſo glorifie that part of his Goodneſs which conſiſteth in Benignity; for he hath an <hi>amor beneficentiae,</hi> of which the creature only is the object; but of his <hi>amor complacentiae</hi> he himſelf is the chief object, and the creature but the ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary, ſo far as it participateth of Goodneſs. (And Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency is the eſſential act of Love.) Think but what a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Fabrick he hath made of all the Orbs, compoſed into One World! and can you poſſibly have narrow thoughts of his Goodneſs? He hath placed more Phyſical Goodneſs in the nature of one ſilly Bird, or Fly, or Worm, than humane wit is able to find out; much more in Plants, in Beaſts, in Men, in Sea and Land, in the Sun, and fixed Stars, and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets: Our underſtandings are not acquainted with the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandth thouſandth thouſandth part of the Phyſical goodneſs which he hath put into his creatures: there may be more of the wonderful skill, and power, and goodneſs of God, laid out on one of thoſe Stars, that ſeems ſmalleſt to our ſight, than millions of humane intellects, if united, were able to comprehend.

When the anatomizing of the body of one man or beaſt might wrap up any conſiderate man into <hi>Galen</hi>'s admiration and praiſes of the Maker! and how many myriades of ſuch bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies hath God created? and how much more excellent are the forms or ſouls than any of thoſe bodies? And how little know we how incomparably more excellent the nature of Angels may be than ours? and what glorious Beings may inhabit the more glorious Orbs? and yet can you think meanly of the Creator's Goodneſs?</p>
               <p>O but you ſay, that all theſe lower Creatures have ſtill the forementioned ſorrows and imperfections.</p>
               <p>I anſwer you, 1. They were not made <hi>Gods,</hi> but <hi>Creatures,</hi> and therefore were not to be perfect. 2. It is the corrupt and blinded ſenſual mind which crieth out for want of <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible pleaſure,</hi> and can ſee no goodneſs in any thing but this: but true reaſon telleth any man that hath it, that our <hi>ſenſible pleaſure</hi> is a thing too low to be the higheſt excellency of the creature, and to be the ultimate end of God: and that the glory of the whole world, even the inanimate parts as well as the animate, ſhewing the glory of the Infinite Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is the excellency of the world. What if the Sun, and Stars, and Earth, and Sea, the Fire and Air have no <hi>feeling</hi>; have they therefore no goodneſs but what is a Means to the ſenſible delights of lower things? Hath a Worm more good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than the Sun, if it have more feeling? Theſe are the madneſſes of ſenſual men. May not an excellent Limner, Watch-maker, or other Artificer, make a Picture, a Watch, or Muſical Inſtrument, meerly for his own delight? and may he not delight in the excellency of it, though you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine him to have no need of <hi>it,</hi> or of the <hi>delight</hi>? And what is the excellency of ſuch a Picture, but to be the full demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Author's skill, in the moſt full repreſentation of the thing reſembled? Will you ſay that he hath done no good, becauſe he made not his Picture <hi>ſenſible,</hi> and made not
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59459:71"/>
                  <hi>its pleaſure</hi> his ultimate end? Thoſe things which in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars we call Bad, are Good as they are parts of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal frame; as many darknings and ſhadowings in a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture may conduce to make it beautiful. The eye is a more excellent part of the body than a finger or a tooth; and yet it maketh to the perfection of the <hi>whole</hi> that there be fingers and teeth, as well as eyes: So it doth to the perfection of the world, that there be Men, and Beaſts, and Plants, as well as Angels; and poor men as well as rich, and ſick man as well as ſound, and pain as well as pleaſure. Our narrow ſight that looketh but on a ſpot or parcel of God's work at once, doth judge according to the particular intereſt of that parcel, (and ſo we would have no variety in the world, but every thing of that ſpecies which we think beſt); But God ſeeth all his works at once, <hi>uno intuitu,</hi> and therefore ſeeth what is beſt in reference to the glory of the Univerſe; and ſeeth what variety is beautiful, and what each part ſhould be according to the office and order of its place.</p>
               <p>And 3. doth not your own experience reprehend your own complaint as guilty of contradiction? You would have all things fitted to your particular intereſt, or elſe you think God is not good enough to you: and may not every other creature ſay the ſame as juſtly as you. And then how would you have a Horſe to carry you, an Ox to plow for you, a Dog to hunt for you, a Hare or Partridge to be hunted; yea, a bit of fleſh to nouriſh you, yea, or the fruit of trees and plants, yea, or the earth to bear you, or the air to breath in, or the water to refreſh you.<note place="margin">Non quoniam muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles vires habemus, improbitatis noſtrae culpa in Deum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferenda eſt: Non enim in facultat bus ſunt vitia, ſed in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitibus: Habitus au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem ex electione &amp; voluntate ſunt.

This and much more he doth againſt it, and more he could do, which ſhould prove effectual; but his wiſdom ſaw it not meet, nor conducible to the glory of the Univerſe, to make all Moral Agents of one ſize, any more than all Natural Agents: and therefore he made not man indefectible. Do you think that [a Rational creature with <hi>free-will,</hi> being the Lord of its own acts, and a ſelf-deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining Principle, to act without force] is not a thing which God <hi>may</hi> make and take delight in? as well as a Watch-maker taketh delight to make a Clock that ſhall go of it ſelf, without his continued motion, (and the longer he can make it go without him, and ſo the liker to himſelf, the more excellent he thinks his work.) If God may <hi>make</hi> ſuch a <hi>free-agent,</hi> then is it no impeachment to his goodneſs, if it abuſe its freedom unto ſin; eſpecially when he will over-rule even that ſin, ſo far as to bring good out of it by accident.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, as for all the objections from <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>miſery</hi> againſt God's goodneſs; I anſwer you with thoſe Queſtions. Do you know what number the holy and glorious Angels are, in compariſon both of wicked men and Devils? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they may not be ten thouſand to one? Do you know how many thouſand fixed Stars there are, beſides Planets? Do you know whether they are all Suns? and how much bigger they are than the Earth? and how much more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious? Do you know whether they are all inhabited or not? (when you ſee almoſt no place on Earth uninhabited, not ſo much as Water and Air) Do you know whether thoſe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of more glorious Orbs have not inhabitants anſwerable to their greatneſs and glory, beyond the inhabitants of this darker Orb? Do you know whether ſin and ſorrow be not
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59459:72"/>
kept out there, and confined to this, and ſome few ſuch obſcurer receptacles? Do you know the degrees of holineſs and Glory which thoſe ſuperiour Inhabitants poſſeſs? And do you know that all theſe things ſet together, the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Gods goodneſs by the way of Beneficence, is not ten thouſand times beyond the demonſtrations of it in the way of Juſtice, and all the other ſorrows that you complain of? Till you know all theſe, do not think your ſelves meet, from your ſenſible troubles, to argue againſt that <hi>Infinite goodneſs,</hi> which demonſtrateth it ſelf ſo unqueſtionably to all, by all the Goodneſs of the whole Creation.</p>
               <p>I may boldly then conclude, that GOD is OUR FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER, our CHIEF GOOD, our CHIEF BENEFACTOR, and ULTIMATE END.</p>
               <p>And ſo that <hi>in ſenſu pleniſſimo,</hi> THERE IS A GOD; that word comprehending both the foreſaid Trinity of Principles in the Unity of his Eſſence, and the Trinity of Relations, in the Unity of the Relation of our CREATOR.</p>

Or whether <hi>Benefits</hi> ſimply without any reſpect to <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Subjection,</hi> may be ſaid to oblige to Moral Duty as ſuch, is a Queſtion that I am not concerned to determine; as long as God is both Governour and Benefactor, and his Government may give the formal moral obligation, as his Benefits provide the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59459:73"/>
greateſt <hi>Materials</hi> of the Duty. Though this much I may ſay to it, that I cannot ſee but the Duty of a Beneficiary as ſuch, may be called moral, as well as the Duty of a Subject as ſuch: And if it were ſuppoſed that two men were <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely equals</hi> as to any <hi>ſubjection,</hi> and that one of them ſhould by kindneſs exceedingly oblige the other, all will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ingratitude to be an <hi>unnatural</hi> thing: and why that vice may not be called properly morall in a <hi>rational free</hi> agent, I am not yet convinced. You will ſay, It's true; but that is becauſe that both thoſe men are <hi>Subjects</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> whoſe Law obligeth them both to <hi>Gratitude,</hi> and therefore Ingratitude is a ſin only as againſt the Law of God in Nature. To which I reply, that I grant Gods Law of Nature maketh Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude a ſin: and I grant that a Law is properly the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Governour as ſuch: and ſo as Ingratitude is the violation of a Law, it is only a ſin againſt Government as ſuch. But I queſtion whether as <hi>Love</hi> is ſomewhat different from <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> and as a <hi>Benefactor</hi> and an <hi>attractive good</hi> hath the higheſt and a peculiar kinde of obligation, ſo there be not ſomething put by God into our <hi>Nature,</hi> which though it be not formally a <hi>Law,</hi> yet is as obligatory, and as much if not more than a Law, which maketh it <hi>more</hi> than the <hi>Duty</hi> of a Subject, to anſwer <hi>love</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> with <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> and <hi>love</hi>: ſo that if <hi>per impoſſibile</hi> you ſuppoſe that we had no other obligation to God but this of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> (or abſtract this from the reſt) I queſtion whether it be not moſt eminently morall, and whether the performance of it do not morally fit us for the higheſt benefits, and felicity, and the violation of it merit not, (morally) the rejections of our great Benefactor, and the withdrawing of all his favours to our undoing.

               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 1. <hi>There is in the preſent diſpoſition of Man a great averſeneſs to ſuch a life of</hi> Reſignation, Obedience <hi>and</hi> Love to God, <hi>as is before deſcribed, even when he cannot deny it to be his duty, and to be the beſt, moſt honourable, and moſt felicitating life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Too ſad experience confirmeth this. The bad are ſo averſe, that they will not be perſwaded to it: the godly have ſuch a mixture of averſeneſs, as findeth them matter of continual conflict. It is this <hi>averſneſs</hi> which ſerveth inſtead of arguments againſt it, or which is a <hi>pondus</hi> to the very judgment, and maketh it ſo hard to believe any arguments which go againſt ſo ſtrong a contrary inclination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 2. <hi>We find that the ſenſes of men are grown maſterly and inordinate, and are too eagerly ſet upon their objects, and hold down the mind from riſing higher, and cauſe it to adhere to things terrene.</hi>

               <p>So that man's life now is like that of the bruits: it is things of the ſame nature that he valueth and adhereth to, and moſt men live to no higher ends but to enjoy their ſenſual pleaſure while they may.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 3. <hi>We find that Reaſon in moſt men is ſo debilitated, that it cannot potently reduce it ſelf into action, nor ſee that practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally which ſpeculatively it confeſſeth, nor clearly and powerfully obſerve thoſe Perfections of God in his works, nor thoſe Duties of man, which we are convinced to be true: but by inconſiderateneſs and dull apprehenſions is almoſt as no reaſon to them, and falleth down before their ſenſuality.</hi>

               <p>Senſe is irrational, and faſtneth on its object: and when Reaſon faileth in its office, there we are left like Dogs gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a Carrion, and in greedineſs fighting for it with each other; when we have ſeparated the creature from God

Few places are ſo good, where Goodneſs expoſeth not men to ſufferings, from the rabble of the vulgar, if not from the Governours; ſlanders and abuſes are the common lot of thoſe that will differ from the carnal, wilde, rebellious Rout. And poverty, pain, ſickneſs, and death, do come alike to all. The ſenſual, that have wit enough, ſo far to bridle their luſts, as to preſerve their health, do uſually live longer than more obedient men: And they deny themſelves none of thoſe fleſhly pleaſures, which the obedient do continually abſtain from.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But do you not ordinarily ſay, that Vice bringeth its puniſhment with it in its natural effects? and Obedience its Reward? Is not the life of a Glutton and Drunkard puniſhed by poverty, and ſhame, and ſickneſs? And is not Godlineſs a pleaſure in it ſelf? If it be our higheſt end and Happineſs to love God and pleaſe him, then ſure the beginnings of it here, muſt have more good, than all the pleaſures of ſin? and ſo God maketh a ſufficient difference here.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Some Vices that are ſottiſhly managed, do bring poverty, ſhame and ſickneſs: but that may eaſily be avoided by a vicious wit: Gluttony and drunkenneſs may fall ſhort of ſickneſſes. Fornication and adultery and inceſt may be managed with greater craft. Pride and ambition may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain dominion and wealth: Theft may be hid, and cheating and fraud may make men rich, and free them from the pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wants, and cares, and the temptations to diſcontent and contention, of the poor. Malice may delight it ſelf in ſecret revenges, in poyſonings, murderings, and ſuch like,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59459:83"/>
without any worldly hurt to the tranſgreſſour. A <hi>Tiberius,</hi> a <hi>Nero,</hi> a <hi>Caligula,</hi> a <hi>Domitian,</hi> a <hi>Commodus,</hi> a <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> a <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> may be on the Throne, when a <hi>Socrates,</hi> a <hi>Seneca,</hi> a <hi>Cicero,</hi> a <hi>Cato,</hi> a <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> is put to death; yea, when a <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Peter,</hi> an <hi>Ignatius,</hi> a <hi>Cyprian,</hi> are ſacrificed to their bloody rage.</p>
               <p>Yet it is true, that all this while they want the dignity and comfort of the Juſt: But while they <hi>value</hi> it not, and <hi>feel not</hi> the want of it, they take it not for a puniſhment, but chooſe it as a felicity.</p>
               <p>And as for the preſent Rewards of Virtue, to ſpeak impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, I verily think that if there <hi>were no</hi> life to come, Virtue and Holineſs were rationally more eligible: But that is much becauſe <hi>God</hi> is <hi>an End above our ſelves</hi>! And for <hi>our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi> in <hi>many,</hi> Holineſs would give the minde more pleaſure, than all fleſhly pleaſure, and worldly greatneſs could coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſe. But with many others, whoſe afflictions are very heavy, and pains and poverty very great, and who are grievouſly tormented by cruel perſecutors; and perhaps a Melancholy conſtitution may forbid them much delight, it is hard to ſay, that if they durſt let looſe themſelves to all ſin, which maketh for their fleſhly intereſt, their Pleaſure would not be much greater. While the Soul is in fleſh, it unavoidably partaketh of the pain or pleaſure of the fleſh: Therefore the torment of the Stone, or Strangury, or of a Rack or Strappado will reach the Soul: And the operations of the Soul being in and by the body, a tormented body will hinder thoſe Contemplations which ſhould feed our Joy, and alſo hinder the Joy of thoſe Contemplations. Moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians enjoy little comfort in Holineſs, through the very cares of this life, and the weakneſs of Grace, and power of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and doubts and fears which do attend them: Much leſs would they have much comfort, if they were here tormented, and miſerable in body, and had no hope of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life. In ſome ſenſe we may ſay, that Heaven is begun on Earth, becauſe Holineſs is begun: But the Heaven on Earth is the hope and reflection of the Heaven indeed, and is ſoon gone if that be gone, as the light here ceaſeth when the Sun is ſet. God ſeen and loved in a glaſs doth more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as to us from God as ſeen and loved in the intuition of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59459:84"/>
his Glory, than the heart of man is now able to conceive. The difference may be well called ſpecifical as to our actions, yea tranſcendently ſuch. Let any man in torment without any hope of Heaven be Judge.</p>
               <p>And though Honeſty without the Pleaſure and Comforts of it, be ſtill <hi>better</hi> and more eligible, yet while mans Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Virtue is ſo <hi>weak,</hi> and his ſenſe and appetite ſo ſtrong, and his body hath ſo much power upon his minde, it is very few that the meer Love of Virtue would prevail with, if that Virtue were never to come to a higher degree than this.</p>
               <p>It is undoubtedly true, that the Delights of Holineſs, are incomparably more deſireable, as we have them in this life, than Kingdoms and all the pleaſures of the fleſh: But that is principally becauſe that this life is the paſſage to a better, and hath relation to ſo glorious a reward: The leaſt fore-thought of future Bleſſedneſs, may weigh down all the riches and pleaſures of the World. But take away the reſpect to the life to come, and weak man would meet with no ſuch comforts.</p>
               <p>It is true alſo, that Virtue and Piety is moſt deſirable even for it ſelf: But that is eſpecially as it will be <hi>it ſelf</hi> indeed, in a life of fuller <hi>perfection</hi> than this: For here it is ſo weak, and clogged with ſo many corruptions, and infirmities, that the comfort of it is little perceived: But as a Childe in infancy hath leſs pleaſure than a Bruite, for all his Reaſon; and as young Scholars for a time, do meet with more trouble than pleaſure in their Learning, and half-witted Artiſts are oft more incommodious than none; and no one would much ſeek after Arts or Learning for all its excellency, if they had not hopes to aſcend above that troubleſome ſmattering de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: Even ſo in the preſent Caſe, though the leaſt Virtue be in it ſelf more valuable than all ſenſual pleaſure, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as <hi>Good to us,</hi> we ſhould never be able to preferre it, if we had not hopes of a higher meaſure, than moſt of the truly virtuous and obedient, do here attain.</p>
               <p>Either it is fleſhly, worldly pleaſure, or it is the pleaſing and enjoying of God in Holineſs and Love, which is Mans ultimate end. If it be the former, then certainly the ſenſual and wicked are in a better condition than the obedient: For they have much more of that kinde of delight; while
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59459:84"/>
the beſt are oft tormented and perſecuted by their cruelty.<note place="margin">Animus eſt ingene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus à Deo, ex quo verè vel agnatio no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis cum coeleſtibus vel genus vel ſtirps appellari poteſt. <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> 1. <hi>de Legib.</hi>

It is not the work of a Ruler only to ſee that no man be a loſer by him or his ſervice in point of commutative Juſtice; but to ſee that by diſtributive Juſtice ſuch a difference be made between the obedient and diſobedient, as the difference of their actions do require, in order to the ends of Government.

                  </note> to clear the former general Argument. The Major is proved by experience; the Heart is the Fountain of Good and Evil, man cannot ſee it, and therefore pretendeth not to govern it, or make Laws for it; if they did, it would be all in vain. The heart may be guilty of Atheiſm, Blaſphemy, Idolatry, Malice, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivements, and deſires of Treaſon, Murder, Inceſt, Adultery, Fraud, Oppreſſion, and all the Villany in the world, and no man can know or puniſh it: and God doth not do it ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily in this life, with any ſufficient act of Juſtice. So alſo all thoſe ſins which men are but able to hide, as ſecret Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Treaſons, Revenge, Slanders, Fraud, &amp;c. do eſcape all puniſhment from man. And God hath no obſervable ordinary courſe of outward Juſtice in this world, but what he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth by men, (though extraordinarily he ſometime other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe interpoſe.) And how eaſie and ordinary it is for ſubtil men to do much wickedneſs, and never be diſcovered, needs no proof. The like we may ſay in ſome meaſure of thoſe <hi>ſecret duties</hi> of heart and life, which have neither reward nor notice in this life; and if obſerved, are uſually turned into matter of reproach.</p>
               <p>The Minor needeth no more proof, when we have proved already that God is our Governour: It is certain, that the ſecret acts of heart and life are as much under his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as the open, and therefore ſhall have equal retribution.</p>

               <p n="3">3. Thoſe few Countries which believe that there is no life to come, (or rather thoſe <hi>perſons</hi> in ſome Countries) do proportionably increaſe or excel in wickedneſs: they give up themſelves to ſenſuality and luſts, to pride, and covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and revenge, and cruelty; and are uſually worſe than others, as their belief is worſe; what maketh Cannibals more ſavage than other people?

Now men have a ſecret witneſs in their breaſts, which checketh and reſtraineth them: Now they have Kings and Rulers, who having ſome belief of a life to come, do form their Laws accordingly, and govern the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with ſome reſpect to that belief. Now there are many

(through the mercy of God) who are ſerious in that belief, and live accordingly; who are inſtructors, reſtraints and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to the reſt.

               <p>The Major is eaſily proved by our great experience: for the world conſiſteth partly of men that believe another life, and partly of them that do not: and <hi>Reaſon</hi> maketh them <hi>both</hi> the more miſerable.

To have <hi>Reaſon</hi> to lead a man in ſuch a deluſory life, and to torment him with the fears of what may befall him after death, is ſure to be by reaſon more unhappy than the beaſts, that have none of this.</p>
               <p>And for the <hi>Atheiſts, they</hi> are more unhappy too, ſo far as they are rational and conſiderate.

the <hi>certainty</hi> of their <hi>death</hi>:<note place="margin">Thus Man who is the perfecteſt of Animals ſhould be the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and he that is the wiſeſt ſhould be the moſt deluded.</note> they know how all their ſport and pleaſure will end, and leave them in dolour, and how their corps muſt be rotting and turn to duſt: they fore-ſee abundance of croſſes in their way: they are troubled with cares for the time to come. A beaſt hath none of this fore-knowledge, and none of the fore-thoughts of pain or dying, but only fearfully flieth from a preſent danger. Moreover the poor Atheiſt, having no certainty of the truth of his own opinion, (that there is no other life) is oft haunted with fears of it, and eſpecially when approaching death doth awake both his reaſon and his fears: he then thinks, O what if there <hi>ſhould be</hi> another world, where I muſt live in miſery for my ſin! In deſpight of him, ſome ſuch fears will haunt him. Judge then whether the uſe of reaſon be not to make man a more deluded and tormented creature than the bruits, if ſo be there were no life after this?</p>
               <p>But this cannot ſtand with the methods of our Creator: To give us ſo great an excellency of nature, to make us more vain and unhappy than the beaſts.

               </p>
               <p>The reaſon of the conſequence is manifeſt in what is ſaid: the <hi>Ignorant</hi> have nothing to diſturb them in their ſenſual delights. The liker to beaſts they can be to eat, and drink, and play, and ſatisfie every luſt, and never think of a rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning, or of death it ſelf, the more uninterrupted would be their delights; the fore-thoughts of death or any change would not diſturb them: their folly, which maketh them over-value all the matters of the fleſh, would encreaſe their pleaſure and felicity: for things delight men as they are <hi>eſteemed,</hi> rather than as indeed they are.

So that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the moſt knowing would be the moſt miſerable; and though Nature delight in knowing much, it would but let in an inundation of vexatious paſſions on the mind.</p>
               <p>But Knowledge is ſo great a gift of God, and Ignorance ſo great a blemiſh unto Nature, that it is not by ſober reaſon to be believed, that ſo noble a gift ſhould be given us as a plague, and ſo great a plague and ſhame of nature as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is, ſhould be a bleſſing or felicity.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Kings juſtly take away mens lives for Treaſon: They that look but to the preſent temporal good or hurt of the Common-wealth, do think that no temporal puniſhment or

               <p n="1">1. Though ſome are very incredulous about <hi>Witches,</hi> yet to a full enquiry the evidence is paſt queſtion, that multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of ſuch there be. Though many are wronged, and ſome may be thought ſo fooliſh or melancholy, as not to know what they ſay againſt themſelves; yet againſt ſuch numerous and various inſtances, theſe exceptions do but confirm the general truth, that ſuch there are. I have ſaid ſo much of them in <note n="*" place="margin">Saints Reſt; Part <hi>2.</hi> and unreaſonableneſs of Infidelity.</note> two other Writings, that I ſhall now ſay no more but this: That thoſe Judges ordinarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn

                  <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and <hi>Eſſex,</hi> about twenty years ago, that left the buſineſs paſt all doubt to the Judges, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, and Reverend Miniſters, (yet living) who were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely ſent with them for the fuller inquiſition. That the teſtimonies are ſo numerous and beyond exception, record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the many Volumes written on this ſubject, by the <hi>Malleus Maleficorum, Bodin, Remigius,</hi> and other Judges who condemned them, that I owe no man any further proof, than to deſire him to read the foreſaid Writings: wherein he ſhall find Men and Women, Gentlemen, Scholars, Doctors of Divinity, of ſeveral qualities and tempers, all confeſſedly guilty, and put to death for this odious ſin. And he ſhall find what compacts they made with the Devil, promiſing him their Souls or their ſervice, and renouncing their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God. All which doth more than intimate, that men have Souls to ſave or loſe, and that there is an Enemy of Souls who is moſt ſollicitous to deſtroy them; or elſe to what end would all this be? When people are in wrath and malice, deſirous of revenge or in great diſcontents, or too eagerly deſirous after overhaſty knowledge in any needleſs ſpeculation, the Devil hath the advantage to appear to them, and offer them his help, and draw them into ſome contract with him (implicit at leaſt, if not explicit) I have my ſelf been too incredulous of theſe things, till cogent evidence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained my belief. Though it belong not to us to give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, why Satan doth it, or why upon no more, or why God permitteth it, yet that ſo it is in point of fact, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be rationally denyed. And therefore we have ſo much ſenſible evidence, that there is a happineſs and miſery after this life, which the Devil believeth, though Atheiſts do not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And though ſome are as incredulous of <hi>Apparitions,</hi> yet evidence hath confuted all incredulity. I could make mention of many: but for the notoriety I will name but two; which it is eaſie to be ſatisfied about:</p>

The thing I have by me deſcribed largely and atteſted by learned godly Miniſters, that were at the place; and is famous, paſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But (to name no more) he that will read a ſmall Book called <hi>The Devil of Maſcon,</hi> written by Mr. <hi>Perreand,</hi> and publiſhed by Dr. <hi>Peter Moulin,</hi> will ſee an inſtance paſt all queſtion: The Devil did there for many months together at certain hours of the day, hold diſcourſe with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and publikely diſputed with a Papiſt that challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him, and when he had done, turn'd him and caſt him down ſo violently, that he went home diſtracted: He would ſing and jeſt and talk familiarly with them as they do with one another: He would anſwer them queſtions about things done at a diſtance; and would carry things up and down before them, and yet never ſeen in any ſhape: All this was done in the houſe of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Perreand</hi> a Reverend faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſter of the Proteſtant Church, in the hearing of perſons of both Profeſsions, Papiſts and Proteſtants that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily came in, for above three months at <hi>Maſcon</hi> a City of <hi>France</hi> (And at laſt upon earneſt Prayer it ceaſed.)

               <p>See the other Teſtimonies cited in my <hi>Saints Reſt,</hi> Part 2.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But how doth this ſignifie that there is any future ſtate for man.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Commonly, theſe Apparitions do expreſly referr to ſome ſin or duty which are regardable in order to a further Life. Sometimes they come to terrifie Murderers or other great Offenders: and ſometimes the Devil hath killed men out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right:
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59459:97"/>
(which yet were no more painfull than another death, if it fetcht not their ſouls into a greater miſery) ſometimes they are uſed to tempt people to ſin, to witchcraft, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, to idolatry and ſuperſtition (to which uſe they are common among many of the <hi>Indians</hi>): And all this intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ſome further hurt which ſin doth men after this preſent life; which they take not here for their pain, but their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. 2. Many of theſe Apparitions ſay, that they are the <hi>ſouls of ſuch</hi> and ſuch perſons that have lived here: If it <hi>be ſo,</hi> then the queſtion is granted. And whether it be ſo, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is to us uncertain: For why a condemned Soul may not appear as well as Satan, notwithſtanding that both of them are in that ſtate of miſery which is called Hell, I yet could never hear any ſure proof. But (becauſe this is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain) 3. At leaſt it ſheweth us, that theſe evil Spirits are neer us, and able to moleſt us, and therefore are ordinarily reſtrained, and that their natures are not as to any elevation ſo diſtant from ours, but that a converſe there may be; and therefore that it is very probable, that when the ſouls of the Wicked are ſeparated from their bodies, they ſhall be ſuch as they, or have more converſe with them; and that the good Spirits ſhall be the companions of the ſouls of men that here were not far unlike themſelves. When we perceive that we live among ſuch inviſible Spirits, it is the eaſier to believe that <hi>we ſhall</hi> live with ſuch of them hereafter, as we are moſt like.</p>

I may adde to theſe the inſtance of <hi>ſatanical Poſſeſſions</hi>: For though many diſeaſes may have of themſelves very ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and ſtrange effects, yet that the Devil, I mean ſome evil Spirit, doth operate in many is paſt all contradiction: ſome will ſpeak Languages which they never learnt: ſome will tell things done far off: ſome will have force and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are beyond their proper natural ability: Moſt great Phyſicians, how incredulous ſoever, have been forced to confeſs theſe things: and abundance of them have written particular inſtances.</p>
               <p>And the manner of their tranſportations, their horrid blaſphemies againſt God, with other carriages, do common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimate a life to come, and a deſire that Satan hath to diſhonour God, and deſtroy the ſouls of men as well as their bodies.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:59459:97"/>4. And laſtly, the <hi>Temptations</hi> and ſuggeſtions of Satan, yea, and oft his external contrived ſnares, are ſuch as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently give men a palpable diſcovery of his agency, that there is indeed ſome evil Spirit that doth all this to the hurt of Souls. Were there no ſuch Tempter it were ſcarce cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible that ſuch horrid inhumane Villanies ſhould ever be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated by a rational Nature, as Hiſtories credibly report, and as in this Age our eyes have ſeen. That men ſhould ever, even againſt their own apparent intereſt, be carryed on obſtinately to the laſt, in a wilfull courſe of ſuch ſins as ſeem to have little or nothing to invite men to them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Polybius</hi> often noteth, that many excellent men have attempted great and excellent works; but very few have ever been ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as to perform them; and of thoſe that have gone a little way, but few have finiſhed them.</note> but a delight in doing hurt and miſchief in the World. Whence is it that ſome men feel ſuch violent importunate ſuggeſtions to evil in their mindes, that they have no reſt from them, but which way ſoever they goe, they are haunted with them till they have committed it, and then haunted as much to hang themſelves in deſperation. Whence is it that all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities are ſo ſtrangely fitted to a ſinners turn, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate him in his deſires and deſigns? And that ſuch wonderfull ſucceſſive trains of impediments are ſet in the way of almoſt any man that intendeth any great good work in the World? I have among men of my own acquaintance obſerved ſuch admirable fruſtrations of many deſigned ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent works, by ſuch ſtrange unexpected means,<note place="margin">He that did but well ſtudy the plain ſtrife between Chriſt and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, about knowledge and ignorance in the World, and how mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly Satan keepeth the Goſpel from the Infidel World, and locketh up the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture in an unknown tongue among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and hindereth Preachers in all the World, will ſee that there is certainly a Kingdom of Darkneſs and a Kingdome of Light, which ſtrive for Souls.</note> and ſuch variety of them, and ſo powerfully carryed on, as hath of it ſelf convinced me, that there is a moſt vehement inviſible malice permitted by God to reſiſt Mankinde, and to militate againſt all Good in the World. Let a man have any <hi>evil</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and he may carry it on uſually with leſs reſiſtance. Let him have any work of greateſt <hi>Natural importance</hi> which tendeth to no great benefit to Mankinde, and he may go on with it without any extraordinary impedition: But let him have any great deſign for <hi>Common good,</hi> in things that tend to deſtroying ſin, to heal diviſions, to revive Charity, to increaſe Virtue, to ſave mens Souls, yea or to the publick common felicity, and his impediments ſhall be ſo multifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, ſo far fetcht, ſo ſubtile, inceſſant, and in deſpight of all his care and reſolution, uſually ſo ſucceſsfull, that he ſhall ſeem to himſelf to be like a man that is held faſt hand and foot, while he ſeeth no one touch him! or that ſeeth an
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59459:98"/>
hundred blocks brought and caſt before him in his way, while he ſeeth no one do it. Yea, and uſually the greateſt attempts to do good ſhall turn to the clean contrary, even to deſtroy the good which was intended, and drive it much further off. How many Countreys, Cities, Churches, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, who have ſet themſelves upon ſome great Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have at firſt ſeen no difficulties almoſt in their way? And when they have attempted it, they have been like a man that is wreſtling with a Spirit? Though he ſee not what it is that holdeth him, when he hath long ſwear, and chafed, and tired himſelf, he is fain to give over; yea, leave behind him ſome odious ſcandal, or terrible example, to frighten all others from ever medling with the like again. I have known that done which men call a Miracle, a ſudden deliverance in an hour, from the moſt ſtrange and terrible Diſeaſe, while by Faſting and Prayer men were preſent begging the deliverance: And preſently the Devil hath drawn the perſons in ſuch a ſcandalous ſin, that God had none of the honour of the deliverance, nor could any for ſhame make mention of it, but it turned to the greater diſhonour of piety and prayer, though the wonder was paſt doubt. I have known men wonderfully enlightened and delivered from courſes of Error and Schiſme, and being men of extraordinary worth and parts, have been very like to have proved the recovery of abundance more: And they have been ſo unreſiſtibly carryed into ſome particular Errors on the contrary extream, that all the hopes of their doing good hath turned to the hardening of others in their Schiſm, while they ſaw thoſe Errors, and judg'd accordingly of all the reaſons of their change. But eſpecially to hinder the ſucceſſes of godly Magiſtrates, and Miniſters, in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formings, and their Writings for the winning of Souls, it were endleſs to ſhew, the ſtrange unexpected difficulties which occurre, and lamentably fruſtrate the moſt laudable attempts. Nay, I have known divers men that have had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute deſigns, but to build an Alms-houſe, or a School-houſe, or to ſettle ſome publick charitable work, that when all things ſeemed ready, and no difficulty appeared, have been hindered in deſpight of the beſt of their endeavours, all their dayes, or many years: Yea men that purpoſed but
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59459:98"/>
to put it in their Wills, to do ſome conſiderable work of Charity, have been ſo delayed, hindered and diſappointed, that they were never able to effect their ends. By all which it is very perceivable to an obſerving minde, that there is a working inviſible Enemy ſtill ſeeking to deſtroy all Godlineſs, and to hinder Mens ſalvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Perhaps you will ſay, that if this be ſo, you make the Devil to be ſtronger than God, and to be the Governour of the World, or to be more in hatred to goodneſs, than God is in love with it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, No: but it appeareth that his Enmity to it is implacable, and that he militateth againſt God and mans fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, and that ſin hath ſo far brought this lower World under Gods diſpleaſure, that he hath in a <hi>great meaſure</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken it, and left it to the will of Satan: Yet hath he his holy ſeed and Kingdom here, and the purpoſes of his Grace ſhall never be fruſtrated, nor the Gates of Hell prevail againſt his Church: And if he may forſake <hi>Hell totally</hi> as to his <hi>feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citating preſence,</hi> he may alſo penally <hi>forſake Earth</hi> as to the greater number, whileſt for ought we know, he may have thouſands of Orbs of better Inhabitants which have not ſo forfeited his love, nor are not ſo forſaken by him.</p>

               <p>Three ſorts of men will read what I have written: 1.

Thoſe whoſe Faith and Holineſs, hath made the World to come, to be <hi>their intereſt,</hi> happineſs, hope, deſire, and only joy. 3. Thoſe that only underſtand in generall, that it is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt intereſt of humane Nature, that there be a full felicity hereafter; and ſee it a moſt <hi>deſireable</hi> thing, though they know not whether it be to be expected or not. The firſt ſort, I may fear are under ſuch a Curſe of God, as that he may leave their Wills to maſter their Belief,<note place="margin">Tria ſunt quae ex ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae providentia acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit corpus animalis: ut vivat, ut decore vivat, &amp; ut immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitas illi ſucceſſione quaeratur. <hi>Macrob.</hi> 7. <hi>Satur.</hi>

                  <hi>§.</hi> 1. <hi>IT ſeemed good to the moſt wiſe Creator to give Man with Reaſon a Liberty of Will, by which he is a kind of firſt cauſe of its own determination in comparative moral acts; though he hold the power in full dependance upon God, and perform each act as an act</hi> in genere <hi>by the influx of his Maker, and do all under his perfect government. And theſe great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in his Nature, his</hi> Power, <hi>his</hi> Reaſon, <hi>and his</hi> free ſelf-determining Will, <hi>are the Image of God, in which as Man he was created, which advanced by the</hi> perfections <hi>of</hi> Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, Wiſdom <hi>and</hi> Moral Goodneſs, <hi>are alſo in</hi> Holineſs <hi>the Image of God's Perfections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When a man deliberateth whether he ſhall do this ſin or not, (as lie or murder) he cannot <hi>act</hi> in general without God, but that he chooſeth <hi>this</hi> act rather than another, may be without any more of God, than his giving and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining his free-chooſing power, and his univerſal influx before mentioned, and his ſetting him among ſuch objects as he acteth upon. Neither do <hi>thoſe objects,</hi> nor any <hi>Phyſical ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient

motion</hi> of God, or any creature beſides himſelf, <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine his will effectually</hi> to chooſe the evil and refuſe the good. It is not true, that nothing undetermined can determine it ſelf to act; this is but to deny God's natural Image on the Will of Man. The Will cannot determine it ſelf without the conduct of an Intellect, and without an Object <hi>in eſſe cognito,</hi> nor without Divine ſuſtentation and univerſal influx: But it can determine it ſelf to the moral ſpecies, which is but the mode of action, to this rather than that in the comparative propoſal, without any pre-determining efficient: (for ſuch none of the former are.)</p>

                  <hi>§.</hi> 2. <hi>God planted in man's mind a natural inclination to Truth and Goodneſs, and to his own felicity, and an averſeneſs to falſhood, and to evil, and to his own miſery and hurt; that theſe lying deeper than his liberty of choice, might be a</hi> pondus <hi>to his motions, and help him the more eaſily and ſtedfaſtly to obey, and to adhere to and proſecute his propoſed happineſs and end.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 3. <hi>Accordingly God formed his holy Law, with a perfect fitneſs to theſe faculties and inclinations, furniſhing it wholly with truth and goodneſs, and fitting all things in it to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of man: (as is proved before.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 4. <hi>This Law had a ſufficient promulgation, being legible on the face of the whole Creation, (within our view) and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on the nature of man himſelf, from whence his duty did reſult.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 5. <hi>And God was pleaſed to make as legible the moſt</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional powerful motives <hi>to love and obedience, that can be imagined by man, that no tempter might poſſibly bid the ten thouſandth part ſo much for our love and obedience as he had bid, and aſſured us of himſelf.</hi>

               <p>

                  </note>The firſt benefit is to conſtrain men to duty, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them from doing ill. This is done immediately by the <hi>fear</hi> of <hi>puniſhment,</hi> (with the expectation of the benefit): This <hi>fear</hi> of <hi>puniſhment</hi> is to be cauſed by the rational <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation</hi> of it, if they do offend. This <hi>expectation</hi> is to be cauſed by the <hi>commination</hi> of the Law. When the Law ſaith, [He that ſinneth ſhall ſuffer] the Subject avoideth ſin for fear of ſuffering. Therefore the Subject muſt <hi>believe</hi> that the Law-giver meaneth as he ſpeaketh, even to govern and judge in Juſtice according to that Law: and he that can but make the Subject believe, that the Governour doth but affright men with a lie, and meaneth not to execute his penalties, ſhall eaſily make his Laws of none effect, and turn looſe offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to preſumptuous diſobedience. Therefore the fore-belief of execution is neceſſary to the efficacy of the Law, which elſe is but as a Mawkin to affright away birds, and fit to work on none but fools. And if it be ſo neceſſary a duty to the Subject to <hi>believe</hi> that the Law ſhall be the <hi>Norma judicii,</hi> and <hi>ſhall</hi> be executed; then in our preſent caſe it is certainly true: For God cannot lie, nor make it the duty of the world to believe a lie, nor need ſo vile a means to keep the world in order. So that it is moſt evident, that if the <hi>Law</hi> be <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,</hi> the execution of it is <hi>ordinarily</hi> neceſſary; and either the execution, or ſome means as effectual to the ends of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, is <hi>ever neceſſary.</hi>

               <p>This is undeniable; that it is in God's choice whether he will take away his Being it ſelf, or only all the Mercies which are neceſſary to his well-being: for he that had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before but by free gift, may be deprived of <hi>any thing</hi> which was none of his own, if he forfeit it by abuſe.

                  <hi>§.</hi> 17. <hi>Nature teacheth men to chooſe a great deal of (tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) pain and miſery, rather than</hi> not be at all: <hi>even ſo much as will not utterly weigh down the love of life, and of vital operations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay not (as ſome) that the <hi>greateſt torment</hi> or <hi>miſery</hi> is more eligible (or leſs odious) than <hi>annihilation.</hi> But it is certain, that a <hi>great deal</hi> is. We ſee abundance (how ever the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Philoſophers ſcorned it as baſeneſs) who are blind, or lame, or in grievous pains of the Gout and Stone, and many that are in miſerable poverty, begging their bread, or toiling from morning to night like horſes, and yet ſeldom taſte a pleaſant bit, but joyn diſtracting cares with labours; and yet they are all unwilling to die: Cuſtom hath made their miſery tollerable, and they had rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo for ever than be annihilated. If then God may anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate even the <hi>innocent,</hi> (ſuppoſing he had not promiſed the contrary) then may he lay all that <hi>pain,</hi> and <hi>care,</hi> and <hi>labour</hi> on them, which they would themſelves prefer before anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation. For its no wrong to one that hath his reaſon and liberty to give him his own choice.</p>

                  <hi>§.</hi> 18. <hi>It is juſt with God to lay more miſery on a</hi> ſinner, <hi>than on one that never deſerved ill: and to lay more on him for his ſin, than he would chooſe himſelf before annihilation.</hi>

               <p>Whether God may without injuſtice inflict more miſery on the <hi>innocent,</hi> than he would himſelf prefer before anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation, ſome make a queſtion, and deny it. For my part, I ſee no great difficulty in the queſtion.</p>

If he ſay, I did not know that ſin (even final impenitency in an ungodly life) deſerved ſo ill, common reaſon, and all the world will riſe up againſt him, and the light of nature will ſhew him to his face, that all the forty points of malignity were in ſin, which I mentioned before; and therefore that the Law of nature had a ſufficient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation.</p>
               <p>Having thus ſhew'd what puniſhment God <hi>may</hi> inflict without the leaſt imputation of injuſtice, let us next enquire of Reaſon, what he <hi>will inflict.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>§</hi> 32. <hi>When it is at God's choice whether he will annihilate a ſinner, or let him live in miſery, Reaſon telleth us, that the latter is more ſuitable to the ends of Government: becauſe the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offendor will not only be ſtill a ſpectacle in the eyes of others, as a man hang'd up in chains, but will alſo confeſs his folly and ſin, and his conſcience will juſtifie his Judge, and ſo God's Juſtice will be more glorious and uſeful to its ends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which <hi>is not,</hi> is not <hi>ſeen</hi> nor <hi>heard:</hi> the annihilated are out of ſight. And the mind of man is apt to think of a ſtate of annihilation as that which is as a ſtate of reſt, or eaſe,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59459:107"/>
and feeleth no harm, and ſo is not terrible enough, (as ſhall be farther ſaid anon.) The living ſufferer therefore is ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the fitteſt monument of God's Juſtice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§</hi> 33. <hi>It muſt reaſonably be expected, that a Soul which is made apt to perpetual duration, ſhould perpetually endure: and that the Soul enduring, the miſery alſo ſhould endure, ſeeing it was due by the Law of Nature, (as is proved.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perpetual duration</hi> is <hi>neceſſary</hi> to no creature, their Beings being but <hi>contingent</hi> and <hi>dependent</hi> on the will of God, But <hi>perpetual duration</hi> of a dependent being is <hi>certain,</hi> when the <hi>firſt Being</hi> doth declare <hi>his will</hi> that it ſhall be ſo: and the natural way by which God declareth his <hi>will</hi> concerning the <hi>uſe</hi> of any thing, is by the nature and uſefulneſs of it: becauſe he maketh all things wiſely, and nothing in vain. Therefore when he maketh the <hi>nature</hi> of an <hi>Angel</hi> or <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual being, apt</hi> to <hi>perpetual duration,</hi> as being not mixt of ſeparable Principles, nor corruptible, he thereby declareth his <hi>will</hi> for its <hi>duration,</hi> becauſe he gave it not that durable nature in vain.</p>
               <p>Two Arguments therefore I now offer to prove, that man's Soul is of perpetual duration: 1. Becauſe it is ſuch in its <hi>operations,</hi> (and therefore in its eſſence) as the ſuperiour Spirits are which are ſo durable: for they are but <hi>Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences</hi> and <hi>Free-agents,</hi> fitted to love God, and delight in him, and praiſe him; and ſo is <hi>man.</hi> 2. Becauſe (as is fully proved before) it is made to be happy in another life: and that proveth that it dieth not with the Body: and that proveth that its nature is incorruptible, and that proveth that it ſhall be perpetual, unleſs any ſin ſhould forfeit its being by way of penal deprivation: and that is improbable, both becauſe God hath fitter ways of puniſhment, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timateth in its corruptible nature that this is not his intent, and becauſe the ſtate of future reward is like to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed ſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§</hi> 34. <hi>Experience telleth the world, that ſo great is the folly and obdurateneſs of man, and the force of preſent ſenſual allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that nothing leſs than a perpetual miſery, worſe than annihilation, is rationally ſufficient to be the Penalty of that Law, which is the inſtrument of governing the world: and therefore it is certain that ſo much is in the Law, and ſo much ſhall be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</hi>

                  </note>Thoſe thieves and murderers that have confirmed their infidelity, and overcome all the expectations of another world, will as boldly venture their lives to rob and kill, as if they were of little worth: yea, when they know that they muſt die, how deſperately go they to the gallows, and how little make they of their lives: Its true, (as was aforeſaid) that nature abhorreth death; but we ſee among Souldiers, that he that at firſt is timerous, when he hath been uſed a while to kill men, or to ſee them kill'd by thouſands, groweth ſenſeleſs, almoſt regardleſs of his life, and will make as it were a jeſt of death. And when it is ſo ordinary a thing with men to kill birds, and fiſhes, and beaſts, for their daily food and pleaſure, why ſhould they not eaſily bear their own, if they look for nothing after death? A beaſt loveth his life as well as we, and our death is no more pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than theirs, and we ſhould have as much courage as a beaſt. Eſpecially men that live a poor and miſerable life on earth, would little fear that death which endeth it; and ſo humane Government it ſelf would be in vain. He that would have an inſtrument to revenge him on his enemy, to kill his Governour, or do any villany in the world, if it were not for fear of another world, might find enow among Poor villains, that by miſery or melancholly are a-weary of their lives. At leaſt as long as they run but a hazard, like a Souldier in fight, and may poſſibly ſcape by craft, or flight, or friends, or ſtrength, what wickedneſs will they not commit? What Prince ſo juſt that hath not ſome rebellious Subject, or ſome Enemy that ſeeks his life? What man ſo good that is not maliced by ſome? Who hath mony or an eſtate, which one or other doth not deſire? and if there were nothing but death and annihilation to reſtrain men, what Prince, what perſon, had any ſecurity of his life or eſtate? If a Rogue once grow but ſenſual and idle, he will deliberately reſolve, [I will venture my life to live in pleaſure, rather than live in certain toil and miſery; a ſhort life, and a ſweet, is better than a longer which is miſerable, and muſt end at laſt.] We ſee, if once men be perſwaded that they ſhall die like beaſts, that they are not much troubled at it, becauſe they think that when they have no being, they ſhall have no fear, nor care, nor grief, nor trouble, nor pain, nor want. And though

right improved Reaſon, which hath higher expectations, makes a greater matter of the loſs of them; yet ſenſual men ſo brutine themſelves, that they grow contented with the felicity of a Bruit, and are not much troubled that they have no more.

               </p>

If it hardened them of its own nature, and not meerly by their abuſe, and if it ended in miſery by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignment of the Giver and the tendency of the gift, then were it as you ſay, no mercy but a Plague. But it is Mercy which in its nature and by the Donors will, hath a fitneſs and tendency to mens recovery, and to prevent their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59459:113"/>
and they are commanded and intreated accordingly to uſe it; and are warned of the danger of abuſe.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Gods fore-knowledge or Omniſcience is his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and will you argue from thence againſt his Mercy? His foreknowledge of mens ſin and miſery cauſeth them not: What if he foreknew them not? Were it any praiſe to him to be ignorant? And yet the Mercy would be but the ſame? If you will not be reconciled to Gods wayes, till he ceaſe to be Omniſcient, or till he prevent all the ſin and miſery which he foreknoweth, you will periſh in your enmity, and he will eaſily juſtifie his mercy againſt ſuch accuſations.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But God could give men ſo much more grace as to prevent mens ſin and miſery if he would.</q>

               <p>Here note, that it is one thing to ſay of any <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> [This is ſo deſerved, that God may inflict it if he pleaſe, without Injuſtice, yea and thereby demonſtrate his Juſtice;] and another thing to ſay [This is ſo due that God muſt or will inflict it, if he will be juſt; unleſs a compenſation be made to Juſtice.] It is of the firſt ſort that I am now ſpeaking: For God may have variety of times, and meaſures, and kinds of Puniſhments, which he may uſe at his own choice, and yet not leave the ſin unpuniſhed finally: But whether he properly diſpenſe with any Law, which is determinate as to the penalty, I am not now to ſpeak, it being not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to this place and ſubject.</p>

               <p>To remit or forgive the Puniſhment is ſo far to forgive the ſin; for forgiveneſs as to <hi>execution,</hi> is but <hi>non punire</hi> proceeding from commiſeration or mercy. And it is certain by all the <hi>Mercy</hi> beſtowed on them, that God remitteth <hi>ſomething</hi> of the puniſhment, which in Law and Juſtice he might inflict.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HILST I reſolved upon a deep and faithful ſearch into the grounds of all Religion, and a review and trial of all that I had my ſelf believed, I thought meet firſt to paſs by <hi>Perſons,</hi> and ſhut up my <hi>Books,</hi> and with retired <hi>Reaſon</hi> to read the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> only: and what I have there found, I have juſtly told you in the former <hi>Part</hi>; purpoſely omitting all that might be controverted by any conſiderable ſober reaſon, that I might neither ſtop my ſelf nor my Reader in the way; and that I might not deceive my ſelf with plauſible conſequences of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound or queſtionable antecedents; nor diſcourage my Reader by the caſting of ſome doubtful paſſages in his way, which
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:59459:120"/>
might tempt him to queſtion all the reſt. For I know what a deal of handſome ſtructure may fall through the falſneſs of ſome one of the ſupports, which ſeemed to ſtand a great way out of ſight: And I have been wearied my ſelf, with ſubtil diſcourſes of learned men, who in a long ſeries of <hi>Ergo's</hi> have thought, that they have left all ſure behind them, when a few falſe ſuppoſitions were the life of all. And I know that he who interpoſeth any doubtful things, doth raiſe a <hi>diffidence</hi> in the Reader's mind, which maketh him ſuſpect that the ground he ſtandeth on is not firm, and whether all that he readeth be not meer uncertain things.<note place="margin">Nullus unquam à mortali ſemine vir abſolute bonus naſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>Dion.

                  </note> Therefore leaving things controvertable for a fitter place and time, I have thus far taken up ſo much as is plain and ſure, (which I find of more importance and uſefulneſs to my own information and confirmation, than any of thoſe controvertible points would be, if I could never ſo certainly determine them.</p>
               <p>And now having peruſed the Book of Nature, I ſhall caſt up the account, and try what is yet wanting, and look abroad into the opinions of others in the world, and ſearch whence that which is yet wanting may be moſt fully, and ſafely, and certainly ſupplied.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 1. <hi>And firſt, when I look throughout the world, I find, that though all the evidence aforeſaid for the neceſſity of a holy virtuous life, be unqueſtionable</hi> in naturâ rerum, <hi>yet moſt of the world obſerve it not, or diſcern but little of it, nor much regard the light without; or the ſecret witneſs of their conſciences within.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Natural light or evidence is ſo unſucceſsful in the world, that it loudly telleth us, ſomething is yet wanting, what ever it is. We can diſcern what it is which is neceſſary to man's happineſs: but we can hardly diſcern whether <hi>de facto</hi> any conſiderable number (at beſt) do by the teaching of nature alone attain it. When we enquire into the <hi>Writings</hi> of the beſt of the Philoſophers, we find ſo little evidence of real holineſs, that is, of the foreſaid <hi>Reſignation, Subjection,</hi> and <hi>Love to God as God,</hi> that it leaveth us much in doubt whether indeed they were holy themſelves or not, and whether they made the Knowledge, Love, Obedience and Praiſe of God, the end and buſineſs of their lives. However, there is too great evidence, that the world lieth in darkneſs and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59459:120"/>
where there is no more than natural light.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 2. <hi>I find therefore that the diſcovery of the will of God, concerning our duty and our end, called, The Law of Nature, is a matter of very great difficulty, to them that have no ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural light to help them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though all this is legible in Nature, which I have thence tranſcribed; yet if I had not had another Teacher, I know not whether ever I ſhould have found it there. Nature is now a very hard book: when I have learnt it by my Teachers help, I can tell partly what is there: but at the firſt peruſal, I could not underſtand it. It requireth a great deal of <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>ſtudy,</hi> and <hi>help</hi> to underſtand that, which when we <hi>do underſtand</hi> it, is as plain to us as the high-way.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is no difficulty in learning theſe words: But, 1. There is great difficulty in learning to underſtand the ſenſe, and certain truth of that which is contained in them. To know what God is, ſo far as is neceſſary to our obedience and love, and to know what it is in him which is ſo amiable, and to know that there is a Life to come, and what it is, and to know what is God's will, and ſo what is duty, and what is the ſin which we muſt repent of; theſe are more difficult. Generals are ſoon named; but it is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular underſtanding which is neceſſary to practice. 2. And it is hard to ſee that certainty and attractive Goodneſs in theſe things, as may draw the mind to the practical em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracements of them, from the love of other things. An ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure doubtful wavering apprehenſion, is not ſtrong enough to change the heart and life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 4. <hi>Theſe difficulties in the meer natural way of Revelation, will fill the learned world with controverſies: and thoſe contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies will breed and feed contentions, and eat out the heart of practical godlineſs, and make all Religion ſeem an uncertain or unneceſſary thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is undoubtedly proved, 1. In the reaſon of the thing. 2. And in all the worlds experience: ſo numerous were the controverſies among Philoſophers, ſo various their Sects, ſo common their contentions, that the world deſpiſed them, and all Religion for their ſakes, and look'd on moſt of them but as Mountebanks, that ſet up for gain, or to get Diſciples, or to ſhew their wit: Practical piety died in their hands.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>This is a conſequent not to be avoided, becauſe no way hath ſo reſolved difficulties, as to put an end to controverſies and ſects.</hi>

The life of man is held upon a conſtant uncertainty, and no man is ſure to live another year: and therefore we have need of precepts ſo plain as may be eaſily and quickly learnt, that we may be always ready, if death ſhall call us to an account. I confeſs that what I have tranſcribed from nature is very plain there, to one that already underſtandeth it: but whether the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed blindneſs of the world do not need yet ſomething plainer, let experience determine.</p>

               <p>To true reaſon which is at liberty, and not enthralled by ſenſuality and error, the light of nature might have a ſufficiency to lead men up to the love of God, and a life of holineſs: But experience telleth us, that the reaſon of the world is darkned, and captivated by ſenſuality, and that few men can well uſe their own faculties. And ſuch eyes need ſpectacles, ſuch criples need crutches; yea, ſuch diſeaſes call for a Phyſician. Prove once that the world is not diſeaſed, and then we will confeſs that their natural food may ſerve the turn, without any other diet or Phyſick.</p>

                  <hi>§.</hi> 7. <hi>When I have by</hi> natural Reaſon <hi>ſilenced all my doubts about the Life to come, I yet find in my ſelf an uncouth unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory kind of apprehenſion of my future ſtate, till I look to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural evidence: which I perceive is from a double cauſe. 1. Becauſe a Soul in fleſh, would fain have ſuch apprehenſion as participateth of ſenſe. 2.

               </p>
               <p>What I have ſaid in the firſt part of this Book, doth ſo fully ſatisfie my Reaſon, as that I have nothing to ſay againſt it, which I cannot eaſily diſcern to be unſound: and yet for all that, when I think of another world, by the help of this natural light alone, I am rather <hi>amazed</hi> than ſatisfi'd; and am ready to think, [All this ſeemeth true, and I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of weight to ſay againſt it; but alas how poor and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain a thing is man's underſtanding! how many are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in things that ſeem as undeniable to them!

know I what one particular may be unſeen by me, which would change my judgment, and better inform me in all the reſt? If I could but <hi>ſee</hi> the world which I believe, or at leaſt but ſpeak with one who had been there, or gave me ſenſible evidence of his veracity, it would much confirm me.] Senſe hath got ſo much maſtery in the Soul, that we have much ado to take any apprehenſion for ſure and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, which hath not ſome great correſpondency with ſenſe. This is not well: But it is a diſeaſe which ſheweth the need of a Phyſician, and of ſome other ſatisfying light.</p>

The contrary is ſufficiently apparent in the irrationality of his <hi>Alcoran</hi>: There is no true Learning nor excellency in it, but ſuch as might be expected among men of the more incult wits, and barbarous education: There is nothing delivered methodically or rationally, with any evidence of ſolid underſtanding: There is nothing, but the moſt nauſeous repetition an hundred times over of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſimple incoherent ſpeeches, in the dialect of a drunken man; ſometimes againſt Idolaters, and ſometimes againſt Chriſtians for calling Chriſt, God; which all ſet together ſeem not to contain (in the whole <hi>Alcoran</hi>) ſo much ſolid uſefull ſenſe and reaſon as one leaf of ſome of thoſe Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers whom he oppoſeth, however his <hi>time,</hi> had delivered him from their Idolatry, and cauſed him more to approach the Chriſtian Faith.</p>

                  <hi>§.</hi> 2. <hi>In this Religion (received defectively both as to Matter and Grounds,) I found a Power even in my Childhood, to awe my Soul, and check my ſin and folly, and make me carefull of my ſalvation, and to make me love and honour true wiſdom and holineſs of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 3. <hi>But when I grew up to fuller uſe of Reaſon, and more diſtinctly underſtood what I had generally and darkly received, the power of it did more ſurprize my minde, and bring me to deeper conſideration of ſpiritual and everlaſting things: It humbled me in the ſenſe of my ſin and its deſerts: and made me think more ſenſibly of a Saviour: It reſolved me for more exact Obedience to God; and increaſed my love to God: and increaſed my love to perſons and things, ſermons, writings, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, conference, which reliſhed of plain reſolved Godlineſs.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 6. <hi>The Chriſtian Religion is to be conſidered,</hi> 1. <hi>In</hi> its ſelf, <hi>as delivered by God.</hi> 2. <hi>In its</hi> Reception <hi>and</hi> Practice <hi>by</hi> men <hi>profeſſing it.

To a diligent Enquirer, <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is beſt known in its Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples delivered by Chriſt the Author of it: and indeed is <hi>no otherwiſe perfectly</hi> known; becauſe it is no where elſe perfectly to be ſeen: But yet it is much more <hi>viſible,</hi> and <hi>taking</hi> with unskilfull ſuperficial Obſervers, in the <hi>Profeſſors Lives:</hi> For they can diſcern the good or evil of an <hi>action,</hi> who perceive not the nature of the <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Precepts.</hi> The <hi>vital form</hi> in the Roſe-tree is the moſt excellent part; but the <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> of the Roſe is more eaſily diſcerned. <hi>Effects</hi> are moſt <hi>ſenſible,</hi> but <hi>cauſes</hi> are moſt <hi>excellent.</hi> And yet in <hi>ſome reſpect</hi> the <hi>Practice</hi> of Religion is more excellent than the Precepts, in as much as the Precepts are <hi>Means</hi> to <hi>Practice:</hi> For the end is more excellent than the Means as ſuch.

The fourth day he made the Sun, Moon and Starrs, for Luminaries to the Earth; either then forming them, or then appointing them to that Office (but not revealing their other uſes which are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to us.)

cured Fevers, Palſies, and all diſeaſes, caſt out Devils, and raiſed the dead to life again; and ſo open, uncontroled and numerous were his Miracles, as that all men might ſee, that the Omnipotent God did thereby bear witneſs to his Word. Yet did not the greateſt part of the <hi>Jews</hi> believe in him, for all theſe Miracles, becauſe he came not in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pomp to reſtore their Kingdom, and ſubdue the world: but they blaſphemed his very Miracles, and ſaid, He did them by the power of the Devil: And fearing leſt his fame ſhould bring envy and danger upon them from the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> who ruled over them, they were his moſt malicious perſecutors themſelves: The doctrin which he preached was not the unneceſſary curioſities of Philoſophy, nor the ſubſervient Arts and Sciences, which natural light reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and which natural men can ſufficiently teach: But it was to teach men to know God, and to know themſelves, their ſin and danger, and how to be reconciled to God, and pardoned, and ſanctified, and ſaved: How to live in holineſs to God, and in love and righteouſneſs to men, and in ſpecial amity and unity among themſelves, (who are his diſciples): How to mortifie ſin, and to contemn the wealth and honours of the world, and to deny the fleſh its hurtful deſires and luſts; and how to ſuffer any thing that we ſhall be called to, for obedience to God, and the hopes of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: To tell us what ſhall be after death; how all men ſhall be judged, and what ſhall become both of ſoul and body to everlaſting: But his great work was, by the great demonſtrations of the Goodneſs and Love of God to loſt mankind, (in their free pardon and offered ſalvation) to win up mens hearts to the love of God, and to raiſe their hopes and deſires up to that bleſſed life, where they ſhall ſee his glory, and love him, and be beloved by him for ever.

Hereupon they condemned him, and clothed him in purple like a King in ſcorn, and ſet a Crown of thorns on his head, and put a Reed for a Scepter into his hand, and led him about to be a deriſion: They cover'd his eyes, and ſmote him, and buffeted him, and bid him tell who ſtrake him: At laſt they nailed him upon a Croſs, and put him to open ſhame and death, betwixt two Malefactors, (of whom, one of them reviled him, and the other believed on him): they gave him gall and vinegar to drink: The Souldiers pierced his ſide with a Spear, when he was dead. All his Diſciples forſook him and fled; <hi>Peter</hi> having before denied thrice that ever he knew him, when he was in danger. When he was dead, the earth trembled, the rocks and the vail of the Temple rent, and darkneſs was upon the earth, though their was no natural Eclipſe; which made the Captain of the Souldiers ſay, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily this was the Son of God.</hi> When he was taken down from the Croſs, and laid in a ſtone-Sepulchre, they ſet a guard of Souldiers to watch the grave, having a ſtone upon it, which they ſealed; becauſe he had fore-told them that he would riſe again:<note place="margin">All this is written by the four Evangeliſts.</note> On the morning of the third day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt day of the week, an Angel terrified the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and rolled away the ſtone, and ſate upon it; and when his Diſciples came, they found that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was not there: And the Angel told them, that he was riſen, and would appear to them: Accordingly he oft appeared to them, ſometimes as they walked by the way, and once as they were fiſhing, but uſually when they were aſſembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: <hi>Thomas,</hi> who was one of them, being abſent at his firſt appearance to the reſt, told them he would not believe

it, unleſs he ſaw the print of the nails, and might put his finger into his wounded ſide: The next firſt day of the week, when they were aſſembled, Jeſus appeared to them, (the doors being ſhut) and called <hi>Thomas,</hi> and bad him put his fingers into his ſide, and view the prints of the nails in his hands and feet, and not be faithleſs but believing: After this he oft appeared to them, and once to above five hundred brethren at once: He earneſtly preſt <hi>Peter</hi> to ſhew the love that he bare to himſelf, by the feeding of his flock: He inſtructed his Apoſtles in the matters of their employment: He gave them Commiſſion to go into all the world, and preach the Goſpel, and gave them the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the New Covenant of Grace, and made them the Rulers of his Church, requiring them by Baptiſm ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly to enter all into his Covenant, who conſent to the terms of it, and to aſſure them of pardon by his Blood, and of ſalvation if they perſevere: He required them to teach his Diſciples to obſerve all things which he had commanded them, and promiſed them that he would be with them (by his Spirit, and grace, and powerful defence) to the end of the world. And when he had been ſeen of them forty days, ſpeaking of the things pertaining to the Kingdom of God, being aſſembled with them, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them not to depart from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but wait till the holy Spirit came down upon them, which he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them: But they, being tainted with ſome of the worldly expectations of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and thinking that he who could riſe from the dead, would ſure now make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his followers glorious in the world, began to ask him whether he would at this time reſtore the Kingdom to <hi>Iſrael</hi>: But he anſwered them,<note place="margin">Act. 1.</note> [It is not for you to know the times or ſeaſons which the Father hath put in his own power: But ye ſhall receive power, after that the holy Ghoſt is come upon you, and ye ſhall be witneſſes to me both at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and in all <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> and to the uttermoſt parts of the earth.] And when he had ſaid this, while they beheld, he was taken up, and a cloud re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him out of their ſight: And while they looked ſtedfaſtly toward heaven, as he went up, two men ſtood by them in white apparel, and ſaid, Why gaze ye up into

Upon this they returned to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and continued together,<note place="margin">Act. 2.</note> till ten days after: as they were all together, (both the Apoſtles and all the reſt of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples) ſuddenly there came a ſound from Heaven, as of a ruſhing mighty wind, and the likeneſs of fiery cloven tongues ſate on them all, and they were filled with the holy Ghoſt, and began to ſpeak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them utterance: By this they were enabled both to preach to people of ſeveral languages, and to work other miracles to confirm their doctrine; ſo that from this time forward, the holy Spirit which Chriſt ſent down upon Believers, was his great <hi>Witneſs</hi> and <hi>Agent</hi> in the world; and procured the belief and entertainment of the Goſpel whereſoever it came: For by this extraordinary reception of the Spirit, the Apoſtles themſelves were much fullier inſtructed in the doctrine of ſalvation than they were before, notwithſtanding their long converſe with Chriſt in perſon; (it being his pleaſure to illuminate them by ſupernatural infuſion, that it might appear to be no contrived deſign to deceive the world.) And they were enabled to preach the word with power, and by this Spirit were infallibly guided in the performance of the work of their Commiſſions, to ſettle Chriſt's Church in a holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and to leave on record the doctrine which he had commanded them to teach: Alſo they themſelves did heal the ſick, and caſt out devils, and propheſie, and by the laying on of their hands, the ſame holy Spirit was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily given to others that believed: ſo that Chriſtians had all one gift or other of that Spirit, by which they convinced and converted a great part of the world in a ſhort time: and all that were ſincere, had the gift of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, and were regenerate by the Spirit, as well as by Baptiſmal water, and had the love of God ſhed abroad in their hearts, by the holy Ghoſt which was given them: A holy and heavenly mind and life, with mortification, contempt of the world, ſelf-denial, patience, and love to one another and to all men, was the conſtant badge of all Chriſt's followers:<note place="margin">Act. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; 3.</note> The firſt Sermon that <hi>Peter</hi> preached

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It is moſt <hi>Holy,</hi> for it calleth us up entirely unto God,<note place="margin">

                  </note> and conſiſteth in our abſolute dedication and devotedneſs to him. 2. It is moſt <hi>Spiritual,</hi> leading us from things <hi>carnal</hi> and <hi>terrene</hi>; and being principally about the government of the Soul; and placing all our <hi>felicity</hi> in things ſpiritual, and not in fleſhly pleaſures with the <hi>Epicureans</hi> and <hi>Mahometans</hi>: It teacheth us to worſhip God in a ſpiritual manner, and not either irrationally, toyiſhly, or irreverently: And it direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our lives to a daily converſe with God in holineſs. 3. The Principles of it are the three Eſſentialities of God in Unity, <hi>viz.</hi> the Infinite Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs; and the three grand Relations of God to Man, as founded in his three moſt famous works, <hi>viz,</hi> as our Creator, our Redeemer, and our Regenerater or Sanctifier; and the three great Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ariſing from Creation, and alſo from Redemption, <hi>viz.</hi> as he is our Owner, our Ruler and our Benefactor or chiefeſt Good and End. 4. The <hi>Ends</hi> of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, I find are proximately the ſaving of man from Satan, and the Juſtice of God; the ſanctifying them to God, and purifying them from ſin, the pardon of their ſins, and the everlaſting happineſs of their Souls, in the pleaſing and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of God for ever. In a word, it is but the redeeming us
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:59459:141"/>
from our carnal <hi>ſelf,</hi> the world, and the devil, to the love and ſervice of our Creator. 5. Nothing can be ſpoken more honourably of God in all his perfections, in the language of poor mortals, than what the Chriſtian Religion ſpeaketh of him. 6. And no Religion ſo much <hi>humbleth man,</hi> by opening the malignity both of his original and actual ſin, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the diſpleaſure of God againſt it. 7. It teacheth us who once lived as without God in the world, to live wholly unto God,<note place="margin">

And all Chriſtians are obliged to love each other with a pure heart, and fervently; yea, to ſhew that love which they profeſs to Chriſt himſelf, by the loving of one another: How frequently and earneſtly is this great duty preſſed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles? how great a ſtreſs doth he lay upon it? He maketh it the evidence of our love to God: He promiſeth ſalvation to it: He forbiddeth <hi>ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> that it may not hinder it: He commandeth us to live in the conſtant expreſſion of it, and to provoke one another to love and to <hi>good works</hi>: He hath made himſelf the moſt matchleſs and wonderful example of it: He hath told us, that according to mens <hi>charity</hi> he will judge them at the laſt day.

And they have one Head and Centre, one God and Saviour, who is their common Governour, End and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, in whom therefore they may all unite: when moſt others in the world do ſhew a man no further end than <hi>ſelf-preſervation</hi>; and ſo while <hi>ſelf</hi> is each mans <hi>end</hi> and <hi>intereſt,</hi> there are as many ends as men; and how then is it poſſible that ſuch ſhould have any true unity and concord? But to every true Chriſtian, the pleaſing and glorifying of God, and the promoting of his Kingdom for the ſalvation of the world, is above all ſelf-intereſt whatſoever; and therefore in this they are all united: And though they all ſeek their own felicity and ſalvation, it is only in the ſeeking of this higher end; which is <hi>finis amantis; ſed creaturae amantis creatorem</hi>; the end of a lover, which deſireth unity, and reſpecteth both the lover and the beloved; but it is not the end of the love of <hi>equals,</hi> but of the creature to the Creator, who therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth his beloved before himſelf in his intentions. So that it is only this holy centring in God, that can ever make men all of a mind, and agree the diſagreeing world: While <hi>Self</hi> is every mans end, they will have ſuch conſtant contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of intereſts, that it will be impoſſible for them to agree; but covetouſneſs, ambition and ſenſuality will keep them in factions, contentions and wars continually. Moreover it is Chriſtianity that moſt urgeth, and effectually giveth a hearty love to one another, and teacheth them to love their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours as themſelves, and to do as they would have others to do by them: and this is the true root and ſpring of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. And it is Chriſtianity which moſt teacheth the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving of wrongs, and loving of enemies, and forbearing that revenge, which Heathens were wont to account an honour. And it is Chriſtianity which teacheth men to contemn all the riches and honours of the world, which is the bone that worldly dogs do fight for, and the great occaſion of their ſtrife: and it teacheth them to mortifie all thoſe vices, which feed mens diviſions and contentions. So that if any man live as a Chriſtian, he muſt needs be a man of unity and peace. If you ſay, that the contrary appeareth in the practice of Chriſtians; I ſhall anſwer that with the reſt of the objections
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:59459:143"/>
by themſelves: I ſhall only ſay now, That if this that I have laid down be certainly the doctrin of Chriſt, then it is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the contrary is contrary to Chriſtianity, and that ſo far ſuch perſons are no Chriſtians: It is hypocrites that take up the name of Chriſtians for worldly advantage, and are no Chriſtians indeed, who live thus contrary to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and precepts of Chriſtianity which they profeſs.</p>

                  <hi>§.</hi> 1. <hi>I find in general, that there is an admirable concord between Natural Verity, and the Goſpel of Chriſt; and that Grace is medicinal to Nature; and that where Natural light endeth, Supernatural beginneth; and that the ſuperſtructure which Chriſt hath built upon Nature, is wonderfully adapted to its foundation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is made manifeſt in all the firſt part of this Treatiſe. Reaſon, which is our Nature, is not deſtroyed, but repaired, illuminated, elevated and improved, by the Chriſtian faith. Free-will, which is our Nature, is made more excellently free by Chriſtianity. <hi>Self-love,</hi> which is our Nature, is not deſtroyed, but improved by right conduct and help to our attainment of its ends. The Natural part of Religion is ſo far from being abrogated by Chriſtianity, that the latter doth but ſubſerve the former. Chriſt is the way to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The duty which we owe by Nature to our Creator, we owe him ſtill; and Chriſt came to enable and teach us to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:59459:147"/>
perform it: the love of God our Creator with all our hearts is ſtill our duty: and faith in Chriſt is but the <hi>means</hi> to the love of God, and the bellows to kindle that holy fire. The Redeemer came to recover us to our Creator; He taketh not the Book of the Creatures or Nature out of our hands, but teacheth us better to read and uſe it. And ſo it is through all the reſt.</p>

                  </note> and a Religion fitted to reſiſt Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: He that is an Idolater, or a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> or Infidel, would make more: And they that are againſt all ſerious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, are as eager to make others of their minde, as if it were a work of charity or commodity: And he that is endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to undoe Souls, is as vehement in it, as he that is endeavouring to ſave them. He that hath any paſſion or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt affection is as inclinable to convey it to another, as fire is to kindle fire, or one that hath the Plague to infect his Neighbour. Covetouſneſs, ambition, voluptuouſneſs, luſt, and wrath and revenge, are all contagious. Rioters think it ſtrange if we run not with them into all exceſs. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry noiſe of their impertinent talk and buſineſs, and the great adoe that they make in doing nothing, is a great diverter of thoſe that are about them, from ſerious buſineſs and ſober conſideration: They keep men ſo buſie about their vanities, that they can finde no leiſure to remember that they are men, or to think what buſineſs they have in the World, nor where it is that they muſt dwell for ever. And when their folly and ſelfiſhneſs hath ſet them all together by the ears, they muſt needs draw or drive others into the fire of contention with them; They cry, Who is on my ſide? who? And he that will not be of one party or other, but will keep his peace, ſhall loſe it by the enmity of all: And no man ſhall be taken for orthodox or honeſt, that will not be of that Faction whoſe commendation he deſireth: And when he hath hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured them, he ſhall go for a knave or a reproached per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, with all the reſt: A peaceable man ſhall hardly finde the peace which he deſireth to himſelf; but it's ten to one but he loſeth his labour if he would make peace between others; eſpecially, if he have an honeſt ambition, of extending that bleſſing to Parties and Countreys, or any great and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable numbers. If by tyranny and cruelty, by priſons, and torments, and death, they cannot affright men from honeſty and the obedience of God, at leaſt they will vex them in their way, and be as thorns and bryars to them in this Wilderneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">III. And it is a <hi>calamitous, miſerable</hi> World. It is void of the comforts of ſacred Illumination, and of the aſſured Love of God, and of the exerciſe of wiſdom, or holineſs:
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:59459:150"/>
The delights of Saints in loving God, and waiting for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, are unknown to all the multitudes of the ungodly: They are confounded and loſt in their ignorance and error; and tormented with their own paſſions, diviſions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. Their vices are part of their diſquietment and pain, though pleaſure be their intended end. It is a pitifull ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude that they are in to Satan, and an endleſs drudgery that they follow, in ſerving their covetouſneſs, pride, and luſt; and a tireſome task to care and labour to make proviſion for their fleſhly appetites and wills. They are led captive by Satan to do his will; and yet in doing it they do their own, and are in love with their Captivity, and glory in their Chains. They are engaged daily againſt God and Mercy, againſt their Happineſs, and their Friends that would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it; and think him their Enemy that would make them wiſer. They go under the guilt of all this ſin; and they have no aſſurance of pardon or deliverance: And God over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh them many times with bodily diſtreſſes here: Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and pains conſume men, and torment them; Warrs, and plagues do ſend them by thouſands, out of the World, which they took for their felicity: Fire and famine, piracy and robbery, and fraud, impoveriſh them: The fruſtrations of their hope torment them. And yet under all, they are hardened againſt God, and fall not out with their ſin and folly, but with the Juſtice of Heaven, and with its inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or rather with all that beareth the Image of the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God. This is the viſible condition of this World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> If you ſay, <hi>How can all this ſtand with the infinite Goodneſs of God?</hi> I have anſwered it before: It ſheweth you, that it is not <hi>this World,</hi> which is the great demonſtration of the Goodneſs or Love of God, from whence we muſt take our eſtimate of it by the effects. If you will judge of the Kings ſplendour, and bounty, and clemency, will you go ſeek for examples and demonſtrations of it in the Gaol, and at the Gallows, or rather at the Court? Hell is as the Gallows, and Earth is as the Gaol: Meaſure not Gods bounty and mercy by theſe: It is no ſign of unmercifulneſs in God that there are Flies and Worms, and Toads, and Serpents on Earth as well as Men: nor that Earth was not made as indefectible as Heaven: And when men have drown'd themſelves in ſin,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:59459:151"/>
it is no <hi>want</hi> of Goodneſs in God, but it is Goodneſs it ſelfe which cauſeth the demonſtrations of his Juſtice on them. This World is not ſo much to all Gods Creation, as a wen or wart upon a Mans body is to the whole body: And if it were all forſaken of God, as it hath forſaken him, it were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably no more than the cutting off ſuch a wart or Wen. God hath many thouſand thouſand thouſand times more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious Regions, which it's like have more noble and bleſſed Inhabitants: Look to them, if you would ſee his Love, in its moſt glorious demonſtration: Juſtice alſo muſt be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated if men will ſin. And if Hell be quite forſaken, and Earth which is next it be partly forſaken of the favour of God, for all that God may gloriouſly demonſtrate his Love, to a thouſand thouſand-fold more ſubjects (of the nobler Regions) than he doth demonſtrate his Juſtice on in Hell or Earth.<note place="margin">

The condition of the World is viſibly ſo ſuitable to the whole Office of Chriſt, and to the Doctrine of the Goſpel, that I am driven to think, that if God have mercy for it, ſome Phyſician and extraordinary help ſhall be afforded it: And when I ſee none elſe but <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whom Reaſon will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me to believe is that Phyſician, it ſomewhat prepareth my minde to look towards him with hope.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And alſo the <hi>Evil</hi> of this preſent World, is very ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Doctrine of Chriſt, when he telleth us that he came not to ſettle us here in a ſtate of Proſperity, nor to make the World our Reſt or Portion; but to <hi>ſave us from</hi> it, as our enemy and calamity, our danger and our Wilderneſs and trouble; and to bring up our hearts firſt, and then our ſelves to a better World, which he calleth us to ſeek, and to make ſure of.

                  <hi>§.</hi> 3. <hi>Moreover I finde, that the Law of entire Nature was

And it was no more neceſſary to man in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency to have a ſuitable Law for his preſervation and confirmation, than it is to man in ſin and guilt to have a Law of Grace for his pardon and recovery, and a courſe of means preſcribed him for the healing of his Soul, and for the eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the ſtroke of Juſtice.

               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 4. <hi>It ſeemeth very congruous to Reaſon, that as Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy is the perfecteſt ſort of Government (which it is probable is even among the Angels) ſo Mankinde ſhould have one univerſal Head or Monarch over them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Kingdoms have their ſeveral Monarchs; but there is ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an Univerſal Monarch over them all! we know that God is the <hi>primary</hi> Soveraign; but it is very probable to Nature, that there is a ſubordinate Soveraign or general Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor under him: It is not only the Scriptures that ſpeak a Prince of the Devils, and of Principalities, and Powers, and Thrones, and Dominions, among the happy Spirits; and that talk of the Angels that are Princes of ſeveral Kingdoms, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. but even the Philoſophers and moſt Idolaters, have from this apprehenſion, been drawn to the worſhip of ſuch,<note place="margin">Almoſt all the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens in the World, who worſhipped one God as Chief, had their Demi-gods, as their particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors, and favourers, or Mediators; as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating that Man is conſcious of the need of ſome Mediator of acceſs to the ſupreme Deity.</note> as an inferiour kinde of Deity. And if man muſt have a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate univerſal King, it is meet that it be one that is alſo <hi>Man:</hi> As Angels and Devils have Principals of their own ſort and nature, and not of others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 5. <hi>It ſeemeth congruous to Reaſon, that this Head be one that is fitted to be our Captain Generall, himſelf to lead us by Conduct, Precept and Example, in our warfare againſt thoſe Devils, who alſo are ſaid to have their Prince and General.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As Devils fight againſt us under a Prince of their own nature, ſo is it congruous, that we fight againſt them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:59459:152"/>
a Prince of our own nature, who hath himſelf firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered him, and will go on before us in the fight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 6. <hi>It is congruous to Reaſon, that lapſed Man under the guilt of ſin, and deſert of puniſhment, who is unable to deliver himſelf, and unworthy of immediate acceſs to God, ſhould have a</hi> Mediator <hi>for his reſtoration and reconciliation with God: If any be found fit for ſo high an Office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 7. <hi>And it is congruous to Reaſon, that this Mediator be one, in whom God doth condeſcend to Man, and one in whom man may be encouraged to aſcend to God, as to one that will forgive and ſave him: And one that hath made himſelf known to man, and alſo hath free acceſs to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 8. <hi>It is congruous to Reaſon, that lapſed, guilty, darkened ſinners, that know ſo little of God, and of his Will, and of their own Concernments, and of the other World, ſhould have a</hi> Teacher <hi>ſent from Heaven, of greater Authority and Credit than an Angel, to acquaint us with God and his will, and the Life that we are going to, more certainly and fully than would be done by Nature only.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The moſt learned men of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> that ſaw by Reaſon the Immortality of the Soul, the life to come, and the Perfections of God, were yet ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtfull of their own Reaſons, that they ſpake of the Life to come with great pauſes of doubtfulneſs or darkneſs: And were many of them glad to run to Oracles, and <hi>Augures</hi> and <hi>Aruſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> to try if they could get any additionall light by ſuperficial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. How glad then would they have been of a certain Teacher ſent from Heaven?</note>That this is very <hi>deſireable</hi> no man can doubt: How glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would men receive a Letter or Book that dropt from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Or an Angel that were ſent thence to tell them what is there, and what they muſt for ever truſt to? Yea, if it were but one of their old acquaintance from the dead? But all this would leave them in uncertainty ſtill, and they would be doubtfull of the credit and truth of any ſuch a Meſſenger: And therefore to have one of fuller Authority, that ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his Word by unqueſtionable atteſtations, would very much ſatisfie men. I have proved, that Nature it ſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth to us, a Life of Retribution after this; and that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of Souls may be proved without Scripture: But yet there is ſtill a darkneſs and unacquaintedneſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently a doubting and queſtioning the certainty of it, upon a carnal minde: And it would greatly ſatisfie ſuch, if beſides meer Reaſon, they had ſome proof which is more agreeable to a minde in fleſh; and might either ſpeak with ſome cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Meſſenger who hath been in Heaven, and fully know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all theſe matters; or at leaſt might be certainly informed of his Reports.

                  </note> yet reaſon is now become ſo blind, and unſound, and partial, and enſlaved to the fleſh, that it is not fit for ſuch an office, according to our neceſſity, without ſome heavenly Revelation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 9. <hi>And it is exceeding congruous to mans neceſſity, who is faln under the power and fears of death, as well as the doubts and eſtrangedneſs to the other world, that he that will ſave and heal us, do himſelf in our nature riſe from the dead, and aſcend up into heaven, to give us thereby a viſible demonſtration, that indeed there is a Reſurrection and a life to come for us to look for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though God was not obliged to do thus much for us, yet Reaſon telleth us, that if he will do it, it is very ſuitable to our neceſſities. For all the reaſonings in the world do not ſatisfie in ſuch things, ſo much as ocular demonſtration: when we either ſee a man that is riſen from the dead, or have certain teſtimony of it, it facilitateth the belief of our own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection: and he that is gone into Heaven before us, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſureth us that a Heaven there is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 10. <hi>When God in mercy would forgive and ſave a ſinful people, it was very congruous to reaſon, that there ſhould be ſome fit means provided, to demonſtrate his holineſs in his juſtice, and to vindicate the honour of his Laws and Government, and ſo to ſecure the ends of both.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if God make a penal Law and execute it not, but let man ſin with impunity, and do nothing which may deter him, nor demonſtrate his Juſtice, as much as the ſinners ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings would do, it would tell the world, that he that gave them the Law, and thereby told them, that he would rule and judge them by it, did but deceive them, and meant not as he ſpake: And it would bring both the Law and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour into contempt, and perſwade men to ſin without any
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:59459:153"/>
fear: and he that was queſtion'd for the ſecond crime, would ſay, I ventured, becauſe I ſuffered not for the firſt. It was the devils firſt way of tempting men to ſin, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade mankind that God meant not as he ſpake in his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their death, but that they ſhould not die, though God had threatned it. And if God himſelf ſhould by his actions ſay the ſame, it would tempt them more to ſin than Sathan could, as his credibility is greater. Therefore he that is a Governour muſt be juſt as well as merciful; and if God ſhould have pardoned ſinners, without ſuch a ſacrifice or ſubſtitute means, as might preſerve the honour of his Law and Government, and the future innocency of his Subjects, as well as their puniſhment in the full ſenſe of the Law would have done, the conſequents would have been ſuch, as I will leave to your own judgements.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 11. <hi>And it was very congruous to reaſon, that ſo odious a thing as ſin ſhould be publickly condemned and put to ſhame, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ſinner be forgiven: As it was done in the life and death of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the purity of God is irreconcileable to ſin, though not to the ſinner; and therefore it was meet that the ſin have all the publick ſhame, though the ſinner eſcape: and that God be not like weak imperfect man, who cannot do good, without doing or encouraging evil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 12. <hi>It is congruous to our condition, that ſeeing even the upright do renew their ſins, their conſciences ſhould have ſome remedy for the renewal of their peace and comfort, that it ſink them not into deſperation; which is moſt ſuitably provided for them in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For when we were pardoned once, and again, and oft, and yet ſhall ſin, he that knoweth the deſert of ſin, and purity of God, will have need alſo to know of ſome ſtated certain courſe of remedy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 13. <hi>It was meet that the ſinful world have not only a certain Teacher, but alſo a perfect pattern before them, of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, love, ſelf-denial, meekneſs, patience, contempt of lower things, &amp;c. which is given us by Jeſus Chriſt alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore the Goſpel is written Hiſtorically, with Doctrins intermixt, that we might have both perfect Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Pattern.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:59459:153"/>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 14. <hi>It was very congruous to a world univerſally lapſed, that God ſhould make with it a new Law and Covenant of Grace; and that this Covenant ſhould tender us the pardon of our ſins, and be a conditional act of oblivion: And that ſinners be not left to the meer Law of perfect Nature, which was to preſerve that innocency which they have already loſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To ſay <hi>[Thou ſhalt perfectly obey]</hi> to a man that hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready diſobeyed, and is unfitted for perfect obedience, is no ſufficient direction for his pardon and recovery. Perhaps you'l ſay, That God's gracious Nature is inſtead of a Law of Grace or Promiſe. But though that be the <hi>ſpring</hi> of all our hopes, yet that cannot juſtly quiet the ſinner of it ſelf alone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is juſt as well as merciful, and Juſtice hath its objects, and pardon dependeth on the free-will of God, which cannot be known to us without its proper ſigns. The <hi>Devils</hi> may ſay that the <hi>Nature</hi> of God is <hi>good and gracious,</hi> and ſo may any condemned malefactor ſay of a good and gracious Judge and King; and yet that is but a ſlender reaſon to prove his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity or pardon.

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:59459:155"/>
convince us, that Jeſus Chriſt is the Saviour of the world. That a man appearing like one of us, is the Eternal Word of God incarnate, is a thing which no man is bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, without very ſound evidence to prove it. God hath made Reaſon eſſential to our Nature: it is not our <hi>weakneſs,</hi> but our natural excellency, and his Image on our nature. Therefore he never called us to renounce it, and to lay it by: for we have no way to know Principles, but by an Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual diſcerning them in their proper Evidence: and no way to know concluſions by, but by a rational diſcerning their neceſſary connexion to thoſe principles. If God would have us know without reaſon, he would not have made us reaſonable creatures: man hath no way of mental diſcerning or knowledge, but by underſtanding things in their proper evidence: to know without this, were to know without knowledge. Faith is an act or ſpecies of knowledge, it is ſo far from being contrary to reaſon, that it is but an act of cleared elevated reaſon: it is not an act of immediate intuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God or Jeſus Chriſt himſelf; but a knowledge of the truth by the divine evidence of its certainty: they that wrangle againſt us, for giving reaſon for our Religion, ſeem to tell us, that they have none for their own; or elſe repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend us for being men.

he was cut off out of the land of the living, for the tranſgreſſion of my people was he ſtricken: and he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; becauſe he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth.

The Propheſie of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is full of ſuch, and is but a Prophetical Goſpel.</p>
               <p>To theſe muſt be adjoyned the Prophetical <hi>Types,</hi> even the <hi>typical Perſons,</hi> and the <hi>typical Ordinances and Actions.</hi> It would be too long to open, how his ſufferings from the malignant world was typified in the Death of <hi>Abel,</hi> and the attempted oblation of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and the ſelling of <hi>Joſeph.</hi> And his work of Salvation, in <hi>Noah,</hi> and his preſerved Ark and Family: And his Paternity as to Believers, in <hi>Abraham</hi>: And his Kingly conduct and deliverance of the Church, by <hi>Moſes</hi> and his deliverance of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from <hi>Egypt,</hi> and conduct of them in the Wilderneſs; and by <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s victorious bringing them into the Land of Promiſe: His Reign and Kingdom by <hi>David,</hi> and his building of the Church by <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> and his Prieſthood by <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Succeſſors, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And it would take up a juſt volume to open all the <hi>typical Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Actions,</hi> which prefigured Chriſt:<note place="margin">See <hi>Whately</hi> on the Types, and <hi>Lud.

I will only crave your conſideration of the cuſtom of <hi>Sacrificing</hi> in the general: it came into the world immediately upon mans ſin: we find <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> the two firſt perſons born into the world, employed in it. From thence to this day it hath continued (in doctrin, though the practice be reſtrained) with the <hi>Jews</hi>: it was no peculiar Ceremony of their Law, but hath
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:59459:158"/>
been commonly exerciſed by almoſt all Nations through the world, both <hi>Greeks, Romans</hi> and <hi>Barbarians.</hi> And it yet continueth in moſt countries of the Heathens, where the Doctrin of Chriſt hath not aboliſhed it, as it hath done both with the Chriſtians and Mahometans. (For the Mahometans borrow the confeſſion of one God, and the rejection of Idols and Sacrifices originally from the Chriſtians.) Now I muſt confeſs, that I am not able to ſatisfie my ſelf of the original and univerſality of the cuſtom of Sacrificing, upon any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but thoſe of the Chriſtians: either it was a prophetical promiſſory inſtitution of God himſelf, to lapſed <hi>Adam,</hi> to point him to a Saviour, the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi>; or elſe it muſt be from the Law of Nature, or elſe it is from ſome other poſitive Inſtitution, or elſe it muſt be an univerſal Errour. There can no fifth way that is probable be imagined. And, 1. I am not able to ſee that the meer Light or Law of Nature ſhould be the original cauſe; for then it would be all mens duty ſtill: and what reaſon can Nature give us to judge, that God is delighted in the bloud and pain of the innocent bruits? or that the killing and offering of them ſhould be any ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to his juſtice for our ſins, or any rational means to avert his judgments, or procure our forgiveneſs? If it be ſaid that [It was but a ceremonial confeſſion, that we our ſelves deſerve death, as that creature ſuffered it] I anſwer, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> is indeed due from us by the Law of Nature; but the queſtion is, of the killing of the poor beaſts, and offering them in ſacrifice. If the exerciſe of our own penitence by confeſſion were all, that might be done as well without the creatures bloud and death. What is it that this addeth to a penitent confeſſion? and why was the <hi>oblation to God</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Sacrifice? If you ſay, that the life of bruits is not ſo regardable, but that we take it away for our daily food; I anſwer, Its true, that it is allowed us for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of our lives; but yet it is not to be caſt away in vain, nor is God to be repreſented as one that doth delight in bloud: And the common ſenſe of all the world in their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing hath been, that beſides the confeſſion of their own deſert, there is ſomewhat in it to appeaſe God's diſpleaſure; and none that I ever read of did take it for a meer confeſſing ſign or action. If it be ſaid, that they did it to ſignifie their
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:59459:158"/>
homage to God; I anſwer, Why then did they not offer him only the <hi>living creature</hi> rather than the <hi>dead?</hi> all took it to be a propitiatory action. And if there <hi>had</hi> been an aptitude in this ſign to betoken our penitent confeſſion only, yet when God knoweth our confeſſions as well without it, and when the tongue is made the natural inſtrument to expreſs the mind, and there are variety of other ſigns, it is incredible that all the world ſhould ever (even ſo early) hit upon this <hi>one ſtrange way</hi> of expreſſion, without ſome ſpecial revelation or command of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And it cannot be ſaid with any credibility, that God made any <hi>other</hi> revelation of his will, to the world for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing, beſide what is made in <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>in holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:</hi> for who ever dreamt of ſuch a thing? or hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered us any ſuch revelation, and told us when, and to whom, and how it was made?</p>
               <p n="3">3. And it is not credible that it was taken up <hi>erroneouſly</hi> by all the world, as their vices or ſuperſtitions are: for though it is paſt queſtion that error hath cauſed the <hi>abuſe</hi> of it through the world, yet for the <hi>thing it ſelf</hi> there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of ſuch an original. For what can we imagin ſhould induce men to it, and make all Nations (how various ſoever their Idols are) to agree in this way of worſhipping and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiating them? There is nothing of <hi>ſenſuality</hi> in it, that by gratifying a luſt of the fleſh, might have ſuch an univerſal effect? And it muſt be ſome univerſal <hi>Light,</hi> or ſome univerſal <hi>Luſt</hi> or <hi>Intereſt,</hi> that muſt cauſe ſuch an univerſal concord. Nay, on the contrary you ſhall find that Tradition, and the cuſtom of their Fore-fathers, is the common <hi>argument</hi> plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſacrificing through all the world, even in the Ancients Hiſtorical reports of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Therefore it remaineth, very probable at leaſt, that they received it indeed by <hi>tradition from their fore-fathers:</hi> and that could be from none <hi>originally</hi> but the univerſal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitor of mankind, who was capable of conveying it to all his poſterity, (for no Hiſtory mentioneth any later original nor could any later than <hi>Adam</hi> or <hi>Noah</hi> have made it ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal.) And no man can imagine why <hi>God</hi> ſhould inſtitute it, if it were not to intimate the tranſlating of our puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into our Redeemer, and to point us to the <hi>great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:59459:159"/>
which is truly propitiatory, and is the great demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> who in <hi>Mercy</hi> doth forgive.</p>

                  <hi>§.</hi> 7. II. <hi>The ſecond Witneſs of the Spirit, which is inherent and conſtitutive to the Goſpel of Chriſt, is that image of God, the unimitable character of Divinity, which by the holy Spirit is put into the doctrin of Chriſt, as the very life or ſoul of it, (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the ſame on the pattern of his own life.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. On <hi>Chriſt himſelf,</hi> the unimitable Image of God in his Perfection, is a teſtimony of his veracity: (which I aſcribe to the holy Spirit, as the ultimate Operator in the Trinity, even that holy Spirit by which he was conceived, and which fell upon him at his Baptiſm, and which, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies did blaſpheme) Many men have ſo lived, that no <hi>notable</hi> ſin of commiſſion hath been found or obſerved in them by the world at a diſtance. But the moſt vertuous, except Chriſt, was never without diſcernable infirmities, and ſins of omiſſion. No man ever convicted him of any ſin, either in word or deed; His obedience to the Law of God was every way perfect, He was the moſt excellent Repreſentative of the Divine Perfections:<note place="margin">All Chriſtians agree in the main Doctrins of a holy life. <hi>Leg.

I have oft thought, Why is it that as Chriſtians, man live together in love; but as Parties, when they come to the intereſt of their Sects, they hate, revile and perſecute one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other? And I anſwer it, Becauſe as Chriſtians they give no cauſe of hatred to each other; but as Sects and Parties, they leave God's way, and ſhew their ſelfiſhneſs and loathſome faults, and are enclined to injure one another, and ſo do again ſuffer by thoſe whom they have injured.

He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured patiently to be reviled, ſcorned, buffeted, ſpit upon, crowned with thorns, nailed to a croſs, and put to death; and this upon the falſe accuſation and imputation of being an evil doer: In a word, He was perfect, and ſinleſs, and manifeſted firſt all that obedience and holineſs in his life, which he put into his Laws, and preſcribed unto others: And ſuch Perfection is inſeparable from Veracity.</p>

If the Narrative of his Life in the Goſpel have that evident proof, which I ſhall anon produce, there can remain no doubt of the perfect holineſs and innocency of Chriſt in his Perſon and his Life.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>We find him accuſed of many crimes, as of being a gluttonous perſon, and a Wine-bibber; of blaſphemy, and impiety, and treaſon.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The very accuſations are ſuch as ſhew their falſhood, and his innocency. He is called a <hi>gluttonous perſon,</hi> and a <hi>Wine-bibber,</hi> becauſe he did eat and drink as other men in temperance and ſobriety, and did not tie himſelf to a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs life of auſterity, in total abſtinence from common meats and wine, as <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> did, and as they thought he that profeſſed extraordinary ſanctity ſhould have done.

His ſpeeches of <hi>Herod</hi> and the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees are not revilings, but a free and juſt reprehenſion of their ſin: which being done by God's commiſsion, and in his Name, and for his cauſe, is no more to be called <hi>reviling,</hi> than an arreſt of a Felon or Traitor in the Kings name, or an accuſation put in againſt him for his crimes, ſhould be ſo called. God will not forbear damning impenitent rebels, though they call it cruelty; nor will he forbear the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion and ſhaming of their villanies, though they call it railing; nor will he flatter proud rebellious duſt, though they call flattery a neceſſary civility; nor will he give leave to his Meſſengers to leave ſin in honour, and to let the proud do what their liſt, and quietly damn themſelves and others, without plain reproof, though it be called unreverent ſaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cineſs or ſedition. 2. And he that conſidereth how little Title <hi>Caeſar</hi> had to the Kingdom of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that the ſword alone is a better proof of <hi>force</hi> and <hi>ſtrength,</hi> than of <hi>Authority,</hi> and is a Plea which an Uſurper may have on his ſide, will rather praiſe the <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> and <hi>peaceableneſs</hi> of Chriſt, than blame him as diſloyal. But for the doctrin of <hi>Obedience</hi> in general, who hath ever taught it more plainly and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingly, than Chriſt and his Apoſtles?</p>
               <p n="2">2.

                  </note> and a perfect rule of life delivered to us by him, and all this ſealed by a Divine atteſtation: that this doctrin is ſuited to the capacity of the weakeſt, and yet ſo myſterious as to exerciſe the ſtrongeſt wits: and is delivered to us, not by an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing force, but by the exhortations and perſwaſions of men like our ſelves, commiſſioned to open the evidences of truth and neceſſity in the Goſpel: All this is no leſs than the Image and wonderful effect of the <hi>Wiſdom of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> is as reſplendent in it all: for this is the effect of the whole deſign, to ſet up a Glaſs in the work of our Redemption, in which God's <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> ſhould be as wonderfully repreſented to mankind, as his <hi>Power</hi> was in the works of Creation. Here ſinful man is ſaved by a means which he never thought of or deſired: he is fetch'd up from the gates of hell; redeemed from the Sentence of the righteous violated Law of God, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of his Juſtice: The Eternal Word ſo condeſcendeth to man in the aſſumption of our nature, as that the greatneſs of the love and mercy, incomprehenſible to man, becomes the greateſt difficulty to our belief. He revealeth to us the things of the world above, and bringeth life and immortality to light: He dwelleth with men; He converſeth with the meaneſt: He preacheth the glad tidings of Salvation to the world: He refuſeth not ſuch familiarity with the pooreſt or the worſt, as is needful to their cure: He ſpendeth his time in doing good, and healing all manner of bodily diſeaſes: He refuſeth the honours and riches of the world, and the pleaſures of the fleſh, to work out our ſalvation: He beareth the ingratitude and abuſe of ſinners, and endureth to be ſcorned, buffeted, ſpit upon, tormented and crucified by thoſe, to whom he had done no greater wrong than to ſeek their ſalvation: He maketh himſelf a Sacrifice for ſin, to ſhew the world what ſin deſerved, and to ſave them from the deſerved puniſhment. God had at firſt decreed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that death ſhould be the puniſhment of ſin: and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan had maliciouſly drawn man to it, by contradicting this threatning of God, and making man believe that God would falſifie his word, and that he did envy man the felicity of his advancement to be liker God in knowledge: And now
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:59459:161"/>
Chriſt will firſt juſtifie the truth and righteouſneſs of God, and will demonſtrate himſelf by dying in our ſtead, that death is indeed the wages of ſin; and will ſhew the world, that God is ſo far from envying their felicity, that he will purchaſe it at the deareſt rate, and deliver them freely from the miſery which ſin and Sathan had involved them in. Thus Enemies are reconciled by the ſufferings of him whom they offended; even by his ſufferings in the fleſh, whoſe Godhead could not ſuffer; and by his death as Man, who as God was moſt immortal. As ſoon as he was riſen, he firſt appear'd to a Woman, who had been a ſinner, and ſent her as his firſt meſſenger with words of love and comfort to his diſconſolate Diſciples, who had but lately ſinfully forſaken him: He giveth them no upbraiding words, but meltingly ſaith to her, [<hi>Go to my brethren, and ſay unto them,</hi>

He gave the holy Spirit miraculouſly to them, to enable them to carry on this work; and to leave upon record to the world, the infallible narrative of his Life and Doctrine: His Goſpel is filled up with matter of conſolation, with the promiſes of mercy, pardon and ſalvation, the deſcription of the priviledges of holy Souls, juſtification, adoption, peace and joy: and finally, He governeth and defendeth his Church, and pleadeth our cauſe, and ſecureth our intereſt in Heaven, according to the promiſes of this his word. Thus is the Goſpel the very <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God. And ſuch a <hi>Doctrin</hi> from ſuch a <hi>Perſon</hi> muſt needs be Divine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And the <hi>Method</hi> and <hi>Style</hi> of it is moſt excellent, becauſe moſt ſuitable to its holy ends: not with the excellency of frothy wit, which is but to expreſs a wanton fancy, and pleaſe the ears of aery perſons, who play with words, when they ſhould cloſe with wiſdom and heavenly light: (ſuch

excellency of ſpeech muſt receive its eſtimate by its uſe and end:) But as the end is moſt Divine, ſo the light that ſhineth in the Goſpel is Heavenly and Divine: the Method of the Books themſelves is various, according to the time and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of their writing, (the objections againſt them are to be anſwered by themſelves anon): But the <hi>Method</hi> of the <hi>whole Doctrin</hi> of Chriſtianity ſet together, is the moſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and perfect in the world; beginning with God in Unity of Eſſence, proceeding to his Trinity of Eſſential Active Principles, and of Perſons, and ſo to his Trinity of Works, Creation, Redemption and Regeneration, and of Relations of God and Man accordingly, and to the ſecond Trinity of Relations, as he is our Owner, Ruler and Chief Good: And hence it brancheth it ſelf into a multitude of <hi>benefits</hi> flowing from all theſe <hi>Relations</hi> of God to Man, and a multitude of anſwerable <hi>duties</hi> flowing from our <hi>Correlations</hi> to God, and all in <hi>perfect method,</hi> twiſted and inoculated into each other, making a kind of cirulation between <hi>Mercies</hi> and <hi>Duties,</hi> as in mans body there is of the arterial and venal bloud and ſpirits, till in the iſſue, as all Mercy came from God, and Duty ſubordinately from man, ſo Mercy and Duty do ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in the Everlaſting Pleaſure of <hi>God ultimately,</hi> and <hi>man ſubordinately,</hi> in that <hi>mutual love</hi> which is here begun, and there is perfected. This method you may ſomewhat perceive in the deſcription of the Chriſtian Religion, before laid down.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And the ſtyle alſo is ſuited to the end and matter: not to the pleaſing of curious ears, but to the declaring of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly myſteries: not to the conceits of Logicians, who have put their underſtandings into the fetters of their own ill-deviſed notions, and expect that all men that will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted wiſe, ſhould uſe the ſame notions which they have thus deviſed, and about which they are utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreed among themſelves: But in a Language ſuitable both to the ſubject, and to the world of perſons to whom this word is ſent, who are commonly ignorant, and unlearned, and dull: <hi>That</hi> being the beſt Phyſick which is moſt ſuitable to the Patients temper and diſeaſe. And though the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Writers of the Sacred Scriptures have their <hi>ſeveral Styles,</hi> yet is there in them all in common a Style which is

ſpiritual, powerfull and divine; which beareth its teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny proportionably of that Spirit, which is the common Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in them all: (But of this more among the Difficulties and Objections anon.)</p>
               <p>But for the diſcerning of all this <hi>Image</hi> of God in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, Reaſon will allow me to expect theſe neceſſary qualifications in him that muſt diſcern it: 1. That before he come to <hi>ſupernatural Revelations,</hi> he be not unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with thoſe <hi>natural Revelations,</hi> which are ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, and ſhould be foreknown (as I have in this book ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained them with their evidence): For there is no coming to the higheſt ſtep of the Ladder, without beginning at the loweſt: Men ignorant of things knowable, by <hi>Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> are unprepared for higher things. 2. It is reaſonably expected that he be one that is not treacherous and falſe to thoſe Natural Truths which he hath received: For how can he be expected to be impartial and faithfull in ſeeking after more Truth, who is unfaithfull to that which he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of? or that he ſhould receive that Truth which he doth not yet know, who is falſe to that which he already knoweth? Or that he ſhould diſcern the evidence of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Revelation, who oppoſeth with enmity the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary light or Law of Nature? Or that God ſhould vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe his further light and conduct to that Man, who will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſinneth againſt him, in deſpight of all his former teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? 3. It is requiſite that he be one that is not a ſtranger to <hi>himſelf,</hi> but acquainted with the caſe of his heart and life, and know his ſins, and his corrupt inclinations, and that guilt, and diſorder, and miſery, in which his need of mercy doth conſiſt: For he is no fit Judge of the Preſcripts of his Phyſician, who knoweth not his own diſeaſe and tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

Not controlled or checked by any greater contrary Miracles, as the wonders of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Sorcerers were by <hi>Moſes</hi>; but altogether uncontrolled: 4.

               <p>And that miracles, and ſuch miracles as theſe, are a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain proof of the truth of Chriſt and Chriſtianity, is moſt evident; in that they are the atteſtation of God himſelf.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is undenyable, that they are the effects of <hi>Gods own Power</hi>: If any queſtion, whether God do them <hi>immediately,</hi>
                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:59459:165"/>
or whether an Angel or Spirit may not do them, that makes no difference in the caſe conſiderable: for all creatures are abſolutely dependant upon God, and can uſe no power but what he giveth them, and continueth in them, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth by them: the power of the creatures is all of it the power of God: without him they <hi>are</hi> nothing, and can <hi>do</hi> nothing: and God is as near to the effect himſelf, when he uſeth an inſtrument, as when he uſeth none. So that undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly it is God's work.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And God having no voice, but created, revealeth his mind to man by his operations: and as he cannot lie, ſo his infinite wiſdom and goodneſs will not give up the world to ſuch unavoidable deceit, as ſuch a multitude of miracles would lead them into, if they were uſed to atteſt a lie. If I cannot know him to be ſent of God, who raiſeth the dead, and ſheweth me ſuch a Seal of Omnipotency to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, I have no poſſibility of knowing who ſpeaketh from God at all, nor of eſcaping deceit in the greateſt matters; of which God by his Omnipotent Arm would be the cauſe. But none of this can ſtand with the Nature and righteous Government of God. This therefore is an infallible proof of the Veracity of Chriſt and his Apoſtles: and the truth of the Hiſtory of theſe Miracles ſhall be further opened anon.</p>

It abſolutely ſubjecteth the Soul to God, and ſitteth up his Authority as abſolute, over our thoughts, and words, and all our actions. And maketh the Chriſtians life a courſe of careful obedience to his Laws, ſo far as they underſtand them. 4. It taketh up a Chriſtians mind with the thankful ſenſe of his Redemption; ſo that the pardon of his ſins, and his deliverance from hell, and his hopes of everlaſting glory, do form his ſoul to a holy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and make the expreſſions of it to be his work. 5. It giveth man a ſenſe of the <hi>love of God,</hi> as his gracious Redeemer; and ſo of the goodneſs and mercifulneſs of his Nature: It cauſeth them to think of God as their greateſt Benefactor, and as one that loveth them; and as LOVE it ſelf: and ſo it reconcileth their eſtranged alienated minds to him, and maketh the love of God to be the very conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and life of the Soul. 6. It cauſeth men to believe that there is an everlaſting Glory to be enjoyed by holy Souls; where we ſhall ſee the glory of God, and be filled with his love, and exerciſed in perfect love and praiſe, and be with Chriſt, his Angels and Saints, for evermore: It cauſeth them to take this felicity for their portion, and to ſet their hearts upon it, and to make it the chief care and buſineſs of all their lives to ſeek it. 1. It cauſeth them to live in the joyful hopes and foreſight of this bleſſedneſs, and to do all that they do as means thereunto: and thus it ſweetneth all their lives, and maketh Religion their chief delight. 8. It accordingly employeth their thoughts and tongues; ſo that the praiſes of

God, and the mention of their everlaſting bleſſedneſs, and of the way thereto, is their moſt delightful conference, as it beſeemeth travellers to the City of God: and ſo their poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical converſe is in heaven. 9. And thus it abateth the fears of death, as being but their paſſage to everlaſting life: And thoſe that are confirmed Chriſtians indeed, do joyfully enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, and long to ſee their glorified Lord, and the bleſſed Majeſty of their great Creator. 10. It cauſeth men to love all ſanctified perſons with a ſpecial love of complacency, and all mankind with a love of benevolence; even to love our neighbours as our ſelves, and to abhor that ſelfiſhneſs which would engage us againſt our neighbours good. 11. It cauſeth men to love their enemies, and to forgive and forbear, and to avoid all unjuſt and unmerciful revenge.

This true Regeneration by the Spirit of Chriſt, doth make thoſe Superiours that hath it, even Princes, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, Parents and Maſters, to Rule thoſe under them in holineſs, love and juſtice, with ſelf-denial; ſeeking more the pleaſing of God, and the happineſs of their Subjects, for ſoul and body, than any carnal ſelfiſh intereſt of their own: and therefore it muſt needs be the bleſſing of that happy Kingdom, Society or Family, which hath ſuch a holy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, (O that they were not ſo few!) 14.

It cauſeth men to acknowledge, that all this grace and mercy is from the love of God alone, and to depend on him for it by faith in Chriſt; and to devote and refer all to himſelf again; and make it our ultimate end to pleaſe him; and thus to ſubſerve him as the firſt Efficient, the chief Dirigent, and the ultimate, final Cauſe of all: of whom, and through whom, and to whom are all things; to whom be Glory for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>

<pb n="284" facs="tcp:59459:168"/>
the remedy, and to God by him; and ſo kindling the love of God in them by the bellows of faith; and then leading them towards perfection in the exerciſes of that holy love.</p>
               <p n="3">III. And it will further lead us to the original of this <hi>Change,</hi> to conſider <hi>on whom</hi> it is thus wrought. 1. For their place and time. 2. Their quality in themſelves. 3. And as compared to each other. 4. And as to their numbers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place,</hi> it is in all ages ſince Chriſt (to ſay nothing of the former ages now) and in all Nations and Countries which have received him and his Goſpel, that Souls have been thus regenerated to God. If it had been only a fanatick rapture of brain-ſick men, it would have been like the effects of the Hereſies of the <hi>Valentinians, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilidians, Gnoſticks, Montaniſts,</hi> &amp;c. or of the <hi>Swenckfeldians, Weigelians, Behmeniſts, Quakers,</hi> and other ſuch Enthuſiaſts, who make a ſtir for one Age, in ſome one corner of the world, and then go out with a perpetual ſtink. In all Ages and Countries, theſe effects of Chriſtian Doctrine are the very ſame as they were in the firſt Age, and the firſt Country where it was preached. Juſt ſuch effects as it hath in one Kingdom or Family, it hath in all others who equally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it; and juſt ſuch perſons as Chriſtians were in the firſt Ages at <hi>Jeruſalem, Rome, Antioch, Philippi,</hi> &amp;c. ſuch are they now in <hi>England,</hi> according to their ſeveral degrees of grace, (though not in miracles and things extraordinary to the Church.) The children of no one father are ſo like as all God's ſanctified children are throughout the world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to their <hi>civil quality,</hi> it is men of all degrees that are thus ſanctified, though feweſt of the Princes and great ones of the world. And as to their <hi>moral qualification,</hi> it ſometime falleth on men prepared by a conſidering ſober temper, and by natural plainneſs and honeſty of heart; and ſometimes it befalleth ſuch as are moſt prophane, and drown'd in ſin, and never dreamt of ſuch a change; nay, purpoſely ſet their minds againſt it: Theſe God doth often ſuddenly ſurprize by an over-powering light, and ſuitable-conſtraining-over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming attraction, and maketh them new men.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And as to their <hi>capacities compared,</hi> there is plainly a <hi>diſtinguiſhing</hi> hand that diſpoſeth of the work. Sometimes a perſecuting <hi>Saul</hi> is converted by a voice from Heaven, when
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:59459:168"/>
Phariſees that were leſs Perſecutors are left in their unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy. Sometimes under the ſame Sermon, one that was more prophane and leſs prepared is converted, when ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that was more ſober and better diſpoſed remaineth as he was before: The husband and the wife, the Parents and the Children, Brothers and Siſters, Companions and Friends, are divided by this work, and one converted and the other not: Though none is deprived of this Mercy, but upon the guilt of their forfeiture, reſiſtance, or contempt; yet is there plainly the effect of ſome ſpecial choice of the Holy Spirit, in taking out ſome of theſe that abuſed and forfeited grace, and changing them by an inſuperable work.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And as to the <hi>number,</hi> it is many thouſands that are thus renewed; enow to ſhew the Love and Power of him that calleth them: But yet the far ſmaller part of mankinde, to ſhew his <hi>Dominion,</hi> and diſtinguiſhing will, who knoweth the reaſon of all his works: (of which more anon.)</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Conſider what <hi>Oppoſition</hi> this work of Grace doth overcome: 1. Within us. 2. Without us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Within men, it findeth 1. A dungeon of <hi>Ignorance,</hi>

A <hi>love</hi> to ſin, which it turneth into hatred: 5. An idolizing ſelf-eſteem, and ſelf-conceitedneſs, and ſelf-love, and ſelf-willedneſs,<note place="margin">

It findeth in us an over-valuing love of
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:59459:169"/>
this preſent World, and a fooliſh inordinate deſire to its profits, dignities, and honours; which it deſtroyeth and turneth into a rational contempt. 7. It findeth in us a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing ſenſuality, and an unreaſonable appetite and luſt; and a Fleſh that would bear down both Reaſon and the Authority of God: And this it ſubdueth, and mortifieth it's inordinate deſires, and bringeth it under the Laws of God. 8. It findeth all this radicated and confirmed by <hi>Cuſtome</hi>: And overcometh thoſe ſins, which a ſinner hath turned as into his Nature, and hath lived in the love and practice of all his dayes. All this and more oppoſition <hi>within</hi> us grace doth overcome in all the ſanctified: And there is not one of all theſe if well conſidered of, but will appear to be of no ſmall ſtrength, and difficulty to be truly conquered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And <hi>without</hi> us, the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> overcometh, 1. World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allurements, 2. Worldly men, 3. All other aſſaults of Satan.</p>
               <p n="1">1. While the Soul is in fleſh, and worketh by the means of the outward ſenſes, theſe preſent things will be a ſtrong temptation to us: Proſperity and plenty, wealth and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, eaſe and pleaſure are accommodated to the deſires of the fleſh; partly to its <hi>natural</hi> appetite, and much more to it as inordinate by corruption: And the fleſh careth not for <hi>Reaſon,</hi> how much ſoever it gainſay: And then all theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing things are <hi>neer</hi> us, and ſtill preſent with us, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes; when Heavenly things are all unſeen: And the ſweetneſs of honour, wealth and pleaſure, is known by <hi>feeling,</hi> and therefore known <hi>eaſily</hi> and by <hi>all</hi>; when the goodneſs of things ſpiritual is known only by Reaſon, and believing: All which laid together (with ſad experience) do fully ſhew, that it muſt be a very great work to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come this World, and raiſe the heart above it to a better, and ſo to ſanctifie a ſoul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And <hi>worldly men</hi> do riſe up againſt this <hi>Holy work,</hi> as as well as worldly things: Undenyable experience aſſureth us, that through all the World, <hi>ungodly ſenſual</hi> men, have a marvellous implacable hatred to <hi>Godlyneſs</hi> and true mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification; and will by flattery or ſlanders, or ſcorns, or plots, or cruel violence, do all that they are able to reſiſt
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:59459:169"/>
it: So that he that will live a holy temperate life, muſt make himſelf a ſcorn, if not a prey: The fooliſh wit of the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is bent, to reaſon men out of Faith, Hope, and Holineſs, and to cavill againſt our obedience to God, and to diſgrace all that courſe of life, which is neceſſary to ſalvation. And it is a great work to overcome all theſe temptations of the fooliſh and furious World. Great I ſay, becauſe of the great folly and corruption of unregenerate men, on whom it muſt be wrought; though it would be ſmaller to a wiſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate perſon. To be made as an Owl, and hunted as a Partridge or a beaſt of Prey, by thoſe that we converſe with, when we might have their favour, and friendſhip, and Preferments, if we would ſay and do as they, this is not eaſie to fleſh and blood: But its eaſie to the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Devil is ſo notoriouſly an enemy to this ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing work, that it is a ſtrong diſcovery that Chriſt was ſent from God to do it. What a ſtir doth he firſt make to keep out the Goſpel, that it may not be Preached to the Nations of the World? And where that will not ſerve, what a ſtir doth he make to debauch Chriſts Miniſters, and corrupt them by ignorance, hereſie, error, ſchiſm, domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering pride, ſenſuality, covetouſneſs, ſlothfulneſs and negligence, that they may do the work of Chriſt deceitfully, as if they did it not: Yea, and if it may be, to win them to his ſervice, to deſtroy the Church by Oppreſſion or Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, under pretenſe of ſerving Chriſt? And what cunning and induſtry doth this Serpent uſe, to inſinuate into great ones and Rulers of the Earth, a prejudice againſt Chriſt and Godlineſs, and to make them believe, that all that are ſeriouſly Godly are their enemies, and are againſt ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of theirs, that ſo he might take the ſword which God hath put into their hands, and turn it to his own ſervice againſt him that gave it? How cunning and diligent is he to ſeduce men that begin to ſet themſelves to a Religious life, into ſome falſe Opinions, or dividing Sects, or ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous unjuſtifiable practice, that thereby he may triumph againſt Chriſt, and have ſomething to ſay againſt Religion, from the faults of men, when he hath nothing to ſay againſt it juſtly from it ſelf? and that he may have ſomething to
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:59459:170"/>
ſay to thoſe Rulers and People, with whom he would fain make Religion odious? How cunningly doth he engage ungodly men, to be his Servants in ſeducing others, and making them ſuch as they are themſelves, and in ſtanding up for ſin and darkneſs againſt the light and life of Faith? So that ungodly men are but the Souldiers and Preachers of the Devil, in all parts employed to fight againſt God, and draw men from holineſs and juſtice, and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to ſin, and to damnation: So that it is a very diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thing, that <hi>Satan</hi> is the <hi>Head</hi> of one party in the World, as the Deſtroying Prince of Darkneſs and deceit; and that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>other party,</hi> as the Prince of light, and truth, and holineſs: And that there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued war or oppoſition, between theſe two Kingdoms or Armies, in all parts and ages of the World (of which I have fullyer treated in another Book <note n="*" place="margin">Treatiſe againſt Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, <hi>Part 3.</hi>
                  </note>) If any ſhall ſay, How know you that all this is the work of Satan? I ſhall have fitter occaſion to anſwer that anon: I ſhall now ſay but this, that the <hi>nature</hi> of the work, the <hi>tendency</hi> of it, the <hi>irrationall, erroneous,</hi> or brutiſh tyrannical <hi>manner</hi> of doing it, the internal <hi>importunity</hi> and manner of his ſuggeſtions, and the <hi>effects</hi> of all, and the <hi>contrariety</hi> of it to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> will ſoon ſhew a conſiderate man the author. (Though more ſhall be anon added.)</p>
               <p n="5">V. All this aforegoing will ſhew a reaſonable man, that the Spirits Regenerating work is ſuch, as is a full atteſtation of God to that Doctrine, by which it is effected. And if any now ſay, How prove you, that all this is to be aſcribed to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> any more than to <hi>Socrates</hi> or to <hi>Seneca,</hi> or <hi>Cicero</hi>: I anſwer: 1. So much truth of a ſacred tendency, as <hi>Plato,</hi> or <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> or <hi>Socrates,</hi> or any Philoſopher taught, might do ſome good, and work ſome reformation, according to its quality and degree: But as it was a lame imperfect doctrine which they taught, ſo was it a very lame imperfect reformation which they wrought, unlike the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Doctrine and Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt: I need to ſay no more of this, than to deſire any man to make an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial and judicious compariſon between them. And, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides much more, he ſhall quickly finde theſe differences fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: 1. That the Philoſophers Diſciples had a very

poor, dark, diſordered knowledge of God,<note place="margin">Difference between the effects of Philoſophy and Chriſtianity.</note> in compariſon of the Chriſtians: and that mixt with odious fopperies, either blaſphemous or idolatrous. 2. The Philoſophers ſpake of God, and the Life to come almoſt altogether <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally,</hi> as they did of Logick or Phyſicks; and very few of them <hi>Practically,</hi> as a thing that mans happineſs or miſery was ſo much concerned in. 3. They ſpake very jejunely and dryly about a holy ſtate and courſe of life, and the duty of Man to God, in reſignation, devotedneſs, obedience and love. 4. They ſaid little comparatively to the true humbling of a Soul, nor in the juſt diſcovery of the evil of ſin, nor for ſelf-denyall. 5. They gave too great countenance to Pride, and Worldlineſs, and pleaſing the ſenſes by exceſs. 6.<note place="margin">

                  </note> The Doctrine of true Love to one another, is taught by them exceeding lamely and defectively: 7. Revenge is too much indulged by them, and loving our Enemies, and forgiving great wrongs, was little known, or taught, or practiſed: 8. They were ſo pitifully unacquainted with the certainty and bleſſedneſs of the Life to come, that they ſay nothing of it, that is ever likely to make any conſiderable number ſet their hearts on Heaven, and to live a heavenly Life. 9. They were ſo unacquainted with the nature and will of God, that they taught and uſed ſuch a manner of Worſhip as tended rather to delude and corrupt men, than to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them: 10. They medled ſo little with the inward ſins and duties of the heart, eſpecially about the holy Love of God; and their goodneſs was ſo much in outward acts, and in meer reſpect to men; that they were not like to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Soul, or make the <hi>Man good,</hi> that his <hi>actions</hi> might be good; but only to poliſh men for Civil Societies; with the addition of a little Varniſh of Superſtition and Hypocriſie. 11. Their very ſtyle is either ſuitable to dead ſpeculation, as a Lecture of Metaphyſicks; or ſleight and dull, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to be effectual to convert and ſanctifie mens Souls: 12. Almoſt all is done in ſuch a diſputing ſophiſtical way, and clogg'd with ſo many obſcurities, uncertainties, and ſelf-contradictions, and mixt in heaps of Phyſical and Logical Subtilties, that they were unfit for the common peoples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, and could tend but to the benefit of a few. 13. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience taught, and ſtill teacheth the World, that <hi>Holy
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:59459:171"/>
Souls</hi> and <hi>Lives,</hi> that were ſincerely ſet upon God and Heaven, were ſtrangers amongſt the Diſciples of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, and other Heathens: Or if it be thought that there were ſome ſuch among them, certainly, they were very few, in compariſon of true Chriſtians, and thoſe few very dark, and diſeaſed and defective: with us, a Childe at ten years old will know more of God, and ſhew more true piety, than did any of their Philoſophers; with us poor women, and labouring perſons, do live in that holineſs, and heavenlineſs of minde and converſation, which the wiſeſt of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers never did attain. I ſpake of this before, but here alſo thought meet, to ſhew you the difference between the effect of Chriſts doctrine and the Philoſophers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And that all this is juſtly to be imputed to Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I ſhall now prove. 1. He gave them a perfect pattern for his holy, obedient, heavenly Life, in his own perſon and his converſation here on Earth. 2. His Doctrine and Law requireth all this holineſs which I deſcribed to you: You finde the Preſcript in his Word, of which the holy Souls and Lives of men are but a tranſcript. 3. All his Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Ordinances are but means and helps to this. 4. He hath made it the condition of mans Salvation to be thus holy, in ſincerity, and to <hi>deſire</hi> and <hi>ſeek after</hi> perfection in it: He taketh no other for true Chriſtians indeed, nor will ſave any other at the laſt. 5. All his comforting Promiſes of mercy and defence are made only to ſuch. 6. He hath made it the Office of his Miniſters through the World, to perſwade and draw men to this Holineſs: And if you hear the Sermons, and read the Books which any faithfull Miniſter of Chriſt doth preach or write, you will ſoon ſee that this is the buſineſs of them all: And you may ſoon perceive, that theſe Miniſters have another kinde of preaching and writing than the Philoſophers had; more clear, more congruous, more ſpiritual, more powerfull, and likely to win men to Holineſs and Heavenlineſs: When our Divines and their Philoſophers are compared, as to their promoting of true Holineſs, verily, the latter ſeem to be but as Glow-worms, and the former to be the Candles for the Family of God: And yet I truly value the wiſdom and virtue which I finde in a <hi>Plato,</hi> a <hi>Seneca,</hi> a <hi>Cicero,</hi> an
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:59459:171"/>
                  <hi>Antonine,</hi> or any of them. If you ſay, our advantage is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe coming after all, we have the helps of all, even of thoſe Philoſophers. I anſwer, mark in our Books and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons whether it be any thing but Chriſtianity which we preach? It is from Chriſt and Scripture, that we fetch our Doctrine, and not from the Philoſophers: we uſe their helps in Logick, Phyſicks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that's nothing to our Doctrine! He that taught me to ſpeak Engliſh, did not teach me the Doctrine which I preach in Engliſh: And he that teacheth me to uſe the Inſtruments of Logick, doth not teach me the doctrine about which I uſe them. And why did not thoſe Philoſophers by all their art, attain to that skill in this Sacred work, as the Miniſters of Chriſt do, when they had as much or more of the Arts than we? I read indeed of many good Orations then uſed; even in thoſe of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Julian,</hi> there is much good; and in <hi>Antonine, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, Epictetus, Plutarch,</hi> more. And I read of much ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king-Oratory of the <hi>Bonzii</hi> in <hi>Japan, &amp;c.</hi> But compared to the endeavours of Chriſtian Divines, they are poor, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantick, barren things, and little ſparks; and the ſucceſs of them is but anſwerable. 7. Chriſt did before hand promiſe to ſend his Spirit into mens Souls, to do all this work upon all his Choſen. And as he promiſed, juſt ſo he doth. 8. And we finde by experience, that it is the preaching of Chriſts doctrine by which the work is done: It is by the reading of the ſacred Scripture, or hearing the Doctrine of it open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and applyed to us, that Souls are thus changed, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſcribed: And if it be by the medicines which he ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us himſelf, by the hands of his own Servants, that we are healed, we need not doubt whether it be <hi>he</hi> that healed us. His <hi>Doctrine</hi> doth it as the inſtrumental Cauſe; for we finde it adapted thereunto, and we finde nothing done upon us but by that Doctrine; nor any remaining effect but what is the impreſſion of it: But his <hi>Spirit</hi> inwardly reneweth us as the <hi>Principal cauſe,</hi> and worketh with and by the Word: For we finde that the Word doth not work upon all; nor upon all alike, that are alike prepared: But we eaſily perceive a voluntary diſtinguiſhing choice in the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. And we finde a power more than can be in the words alone, in the effect upon our ſelves. The heart is
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:59459:172"/>
like the Wax, and the Word like the Seal, and the Spirit like the hand that ſtrongly applyeth it: We feel upon our hearts, that (though nothing is done without the Seal, yet) a greater force doth make the impreſſion than the weight of the Seal alone could cauſe.</p>
               <p>By this time it is evident, that this work of Sanctification is the atteſtation of God by which he publickly owneth the Goſpel, and declareth to the World, that Chriſt is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and his Word is true: For 1. It is certain that this work of Renovation is the work of God: For 1. It is his Image on the Soul: It is the life of the Soul as flowing from his Holy Life: wherein are contained the Trinity of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: It is the <hi>Power</hi> of the Soul, by which it can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> the <hi>World</hi> and the <hi>Devil,</hi> which without it none is able to do: It is the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of the Soul, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by his Light and <hi>Wiſdom</hi>; by which we know the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Good and Evil, and our Reaſon is reſtored to its dominion over fleſhly ſenſe: It is the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of the Soul, by which it is made ſuitable to the Eternal Good; and fit to know him, love him, praiſe him, ſerve him, and enjoy him: And therefore nothing lower than his Goodneſs can be its principal Cauſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It ſubſerveth the Intereſt of God in the World: And recovereth the apoſtate Soul to himſelf: It diſpoſeth it to honour him, love him and obey him: It delivereth up the whole man to him as his own: It caſteth down all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belleth againſt him: It caſteth out all which was preferred before him: It rejecteth all which ſtandeth up againſt him, and would ſeduce and tempt us from him: And therefore it is certainly his work.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whoſe elſe ſhould it be? Would Satan or any evil cauſe produce ſo excellent an effect? would the <hi>worſt</hi> of beings do the beſt of <hi>works?</hi> (It is the <hi>beſt</hi> that is done in this lower world) Would any enemy of God ſo much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, and promote his intereſt, and reſtore him his own? would any enemy of mankind thus advance us, and bring us up to a life of the higheſt honour and delights, that we are capable of on earth, and give us the hopes of life eternal?</p>
               <p>And if any good Angel, or other Cauſe, ſhould do it, all reaſon will confeſs, that they do it but as the Meſſengers or
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:59459:172"/>
Inſtruments of God, and as ſecond cauſes, and not as the firſt Cauſe: for otherwiſe we ſhould make them gods. For my own part, my Soul perceiveth, that it is God himſelf that hath imprinted this his Image on me, and hath hereby, as it were, written upon me his Name and Mark, even <hi>HOLINESS TO THE LORD</hi>; and I bear about me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually a Witneſs of Himſelf, his Son, and holy Spirit; a Witneſs within me, which is the Seal of God, and the pledge of his love, and the earneſt of my heavenly inheritance.</p>
               <p>And if our Sanctification be thus <hi>of GOD,</hi> it is certainly his atteſtation to the truth of Chriſt, and to his Goſpel: for, 1. No man that knoweth the perfections of God, will ever believe, that he would bleſs a deceiver, and a lie, to be the means of the moſt <hi>holy</hi> and excellent work that ever was done in the world. If Chriſt were a Deceiver, his crime would be ſo execrable, as would engage the Juſtice of God againſt him, as he is the righteous Governour of the world: And therefore he would not ſo highly honour him, to be his chiefeſt inſtrument for the worlds Renovation. He is not <hi>impotent</hi> to <hi>need</hi> ſuch inſtruments; he is not <hi>ignorant,</hi> that he ſhould ſo miſtake in the choice of inſtruments; he is not <hi>bad,</hi> that he ſhould love and uſe ſuch Inſtruments, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with their deceits. Theſe things are all ſo clear and ſure, that I cannot doubt of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. No man that knoweth the <hi>mercifulneſs</hi> of God, and the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of his <hi>Government</hi> can believe, that he would give up Mankind ſo remedileſly to ſeduction; yea, and be the principal cauſer of it himſelf. For if beſides <hi>Prophecie,</hi> and a <hi>holy Doctrine,</hi> and a multitude of famous <hi>Miracles,</hi> a Deceiver might alſo be the great <hi>Renewer and Sanctifier</hi> of the world, to bring man back to the obedience of God, and to repair his Image on Mankind; what poſſibility were there of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of that deceit? Or rather ſhould we not ſay, he were a <hi>bleſſed Deceiver,</hi> that had deceived us from our ſin and miſery, and brought back our ſtraying ſouls to God?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nay, when Chriſt fore-told men, that he would ſend his Spirit to do all this work, and would renew men for eternal life, and thus be with us to the end of the world; and when I ſee all this done, I muſt needs believe, that he that can ſend down a <hi>Sanctifying Spirit,</hi> a <hi>Spirit of Life,</hi> a
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:59459:173"/>
                  <hi>Spirit of Power, Light and Love,</hi> to make his Doctrine in the mouths of his Miniſters <hi>effectual</hi> to mens Regeneration and Sanctification, is no leſs himſelf than God, or certainly no leſs than his certain Adminiſtrator.</p>
               <p n="4">4. What need I more to prove the <hi>Cauſe</hi> than the <hi>adequate effect</hi>? When I find that Chriſt doth actually <hi>ſave me,</hi> ſhall I queſtion whether he be <hi>my Saviour</hi>? When I find that he ſaveth thouſands about me, and offereth the ſame to others, ſhall I doubt whether he be the Saviour of the world? Sure he that <hi>healeth</hi> us all, and that ſo wonderfully and ſo cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, may well be called our <hi>Phyſician.</hi> If he had <hi>promiſed</hi> only to <hi>ſave</hi> us, I might have doubted whether he would perform it, and conſequently whether he be indeed <hi>the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</hi> But when he <hi>performeth</hi> it on <hi>my ſelf,</hi> and <hi>performeth</hi> it on thouſands round about me, to doubt <hi>yet</hi> whether he be the <hi>Saviour,</hi> when he <hi>actually ſaveth</hi> us, is to be ignorant in deſpite of Reaſon and Experience. I conclude therefore that the <hi>Spirit of Sanctification</hi> is the <hi>infallible Witneſs</hi> of the <hi>Verity of the Goſpel,</hi> and the <hi>Veracity</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And I entreat all that read this, further to obſerve, the great uſe and advantage of this teſtimony above others: in that it is <hi>continued</hi> from Generation to Generation, and not as the gift and teſtimony of <hi>Miracles,</hi> which continued plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully but one Age, and with diminution ſomewhat after: this is Chriſt's witneſs to the end of the world, in every Country, and to every Soul: yea, and continually dwelling in them: <hi>For if any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his, Rom.</hi> 8.9. He that is not able to examine the Hiſtory which reporteth the Miracles to him, may be able to find upon his Soul the Image of God imprinted by the Goſpel, and to know that the Goſpel hath that Image in it ſelf which it imprinteth upon others; and that it cometh from God, which leadeth men ſo directly unto God; and that it is certainly his own means which he bleſſeth to ſo great and excellent ends.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Note alſo, that part of the work of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God in ſucceeding the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, doth conſiſt in the <hi>effectual production</hi> of <hi>Faith it ſelf</hi>: for though the work be wrought by the <hi>Reaſons</hi> of the Goſpel, and the <hi>Evidences</hi> of Truth; yet is it alſo wrought by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:59459:173"/>
with that evidence, and as the internal Efficient, exciting the ſluggiſh faculties to do their office, and illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the underſtanding, and fitting the will to entertain the truth: for the <hi>difficulties</hi> are ſo great, and the temptations to unbelief ſo ſubtil and violent, and our own <hi>indiſpoſedneſs</hi> through corruption, the greateſt impediment of all, that the bare Word alone would not produce a belief of that lively vigorous nature, as is neceſſary to its noble effects and ends, without the internal co-operation of the Spirit. So that Chriſt doth not only <hi>teach</hi> us the <hi>Chriſtian Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> but doth <hi>give</hi> it us, and <hi>work it in us</hi> by his <hi>Spirit.</hi> And he that can <hi>do ſo,</hi> doth prove the Divine approbation of his Doctrine, without which, he could not have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of mens Souls.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Note alſo, that the Goſpel propoſeth to the Soul of man both <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi>: and the <hi>Truth</hi> is in order to the <hi>Good,</hi> and ſubſervient to it: That <hi>Chriſt</hi> is indeed the <hi>Saviour,</hi> and his Word infallibly true, is believed, that we may be made partakers of <hi>his Salvation,</hi> and of the <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> promiſed. And when the Spirit by the Goſpel hath regenerated and renewed any Soul, he hath given him part of that grace in poſſeſſion, and hath procreated in him the <hi>habitual love of God,</hi> and of <hi>holineſs,</hi> with a love to that Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and holy Word which brought him to it. So that this <hi>Love</hi> is now become as a <hi>new Nature</hi> to the Soul: and this being done, the Soul cleaveth now as faſt to Chriſt and the Goſpel by <hi>Love,</hi> as by Belief: not that love becometh an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational cauſleſs love, nor continueth without the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of Belief, or Belief without the Reaſons and Evidence of Verity and Credibility: But Love now by concurrence greatly aſſiſteth <hi>Faith</hi> it ſelf, and is the faſter hold of the two: ſo that the Soul that is very weak in its <hi>Reaſoning</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and may oft loſe the ſight of theſe Evidences of truth, which it did once perceive, may ſtill hold faſt by this holy Love. As the man that by reaſoning hath been convinced that hony is ſweet, will eaſilier change his mind than he that hath <hi>taſted</hi> it; ſo <hi>Love</hi> is the Souls <hi>taſte,</hi> which cauſeth its faſteſt adherence to God and to the Goſpel. If a caviller diſpute with a loving child, or parent, or friend, to alienate their hearts from one another, and would perſwade them
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:59459:174"/>
that it is but diſſembled love that is profeſſed to them by their relations and friends; <hi>Love</hi> will do more here to hinder the belief of ſuch a ſlander, than <hi>Reaſon</hi> alone can do: and where Reaſon is not ſtrong enough to anſwer all that the caviller can ſay, yet Love may be ſtrong enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it.</p>
               <p>And here I muſt obſerve how oft I have noted the great mercy of God, to abundance of poor people, whoſe reaſoning faculty would have failed them in temptations to Atheiſm and Infidelity, if they had not had a ſtronger hold than that, and their <hi>Faith</hi> had not been radicated in the <hi>Will</hi> by <hi>Love</hi>: I have known a great number of <hi>women</hi> who never read a Treatiſe that pleaded the Cauſe of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, nor were able to anſwer a crafty Infidel, that yet in the very decaying time of Nature, at fourſcore years of age and upward, have lived in that ſenſe of the Love of God, and in ſuch Love to him and to their Saviour, as that they have longed to die, and be with Chriſt, and lived in all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, charity, and piety, ſuch blameleſs, exemplary, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Lives, in the joyfull expectation of their Change, as hath ſhewed the firmneſs of their <hi>Faith</hi>; and the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> which was in them, would have rejected a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation to Atheiſm and Unbelief, more effectually than the ſtrongeſt Reaſon alone could ever do. Yet none have cauſe to reproach ſuch, and ſay, Their <hi>Wills</hi> lead their <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings,</hi> and they cuſtomarily and obſtinately believe they know not why: for they have known ſufficient reaſon to believe, and their underſtandings have been illuminated to ſee the truth of true Religion; and it was this knowledge of Faith which bred their Love and Experience: but when that is done, as Love is the more noble and perfect operation of the Soul (having the moſt excellent object) ſo it will act more powerfully and prevailingly, and hath the ſtrongeſt hold: Nor are all they without Light and Reaſon for their belief, who cannot form it into arguments, and anſwer all that is ſaid againſt it.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But may not all this which you call Regeneration, and the Image of God, be the meer power of fantaſie, and affectation? and may not all theſe people force themſelves, like melancholy perſons, to conceit that they have that which indeed they have not?</hi>

               <p>And if the objectors mean, that all this is true, and yet it is but upon deluſion or miſtake that they raiſe theſe hopes, and raiſe theſe affections; I anſwer, This is the thing that I am diſproving: 1. The love of God, and a holy mind and life, is not a dream of the Soul, or a deliration: I have proved from Natural reaſon in the firſt Book, that it is the end, and uſe, and perfection of man's faculties: that if God be God, and man be man, we are to love him above all, and to obey him as our abſolute Sovereign, and to live as devoted to him, and to delight in his love. Man were more ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble or miſerable than a beaſt, if this were not his work. And is that a dream or a deluſion, which cauſeth a man to live as a man? to the ends that he was made for? and according to the nature and uſe of his reaſon and all his faculties? 2. While the <hi>proofs</hi> of the excellency and neceſſity of a holy life are ſo fully before laid down, from natural and ſupernatural revelation, the Objector doth but refuſe to ſee

in the open light, when he ſatisfieth himſelf with a bare aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, that all this is no ſufficient ground for a <hi>holy life,</hi> but that it is taken up upon miſtake. 3.

               <p>Object. <hi>But how ſhall I know that there is indeed ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in Chriſtians as you mention, and that it is not diſſembled and counterfeit?</hi>

Chriſt is ſo far from owning any other, that he will condemn them the more for abuſing his Name to the covering of their ſins: All are not Chriſtians who have the name of Chriſtians: in all profeſſions, the vulgar rabble of the ignorant and ungodly, do uſe to joyn with the party that is uppermoſt, and ſeem to be of the Religion which is moſt for their worldly ends, be it right or wrong, when indeed they are of none at all. Hypocrites are no true Chriſtians, but the perſons that Chriſt is moſt diſpleaſed with. Judge but by his precepts and example, and you will ſee who they are that are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians indeed.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But what if the preaching or writings of a Miniſter do convert and ſanctifie men, it doth not follow that they are Saviours of the world.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> What ever they do, they do it as the Miniſters and Meſſengers of Chriſt, by <hi>his Doctrine,</hi> and not by any of their own: by his Commiſſion, and in his Name, and by his Power or Spirit. Therefore it witneſſeth to his truth and honour, who is indeed the <hi>Saviour,</hi> which they never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of themſelves.</p>

change: and that change but upon few, and that but for a few Ages, and then another Sect ſucceedeth them: So that they have no ſuch atteſtation and approbation of God, as Chriſt hath in the renovation of ſo many thouſands all abroad the world, and that for ſo many ages together. 2. They did not affirm themſelves to be the Sons of God, and the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours of the world; if they had, God would not have anne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed ſuch a teſtimony to their word, as he doth to Chriſts. 3. The mercy of God is over all his works. He hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion upon all Nations; and ſetteth up ſome candles, where the Sun is not yet riſen: The Light and Law of Nature are his, as well as the Light and Law of Supernatural Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and accordingly he hath his inſtruments for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of them, to the rude and ignorant part of the world. All the truth which any Philoſopher teacheth, is God's truth: and it is no wonder if a God of ſo much good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, do bleſs his own truth, according to its nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, who ever be the meſſenger of it. Whether the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Philoſophy, be ever the true ſanctification and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any ſouls, is a thing that I meddle not with; (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth not to us, and therefore is not revealed to us:) But it is viſible in the Goſpel, that all that part of practical do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which the Philoſophers taught, is contained in the doctrine of Chriſt, as a part in the whole: and therefore the impreſs and effect is more full and perfect, as the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; and the impreſs and effect of the Philoſophers do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, can be no better than the cauſe, which is partial and defective, and mixt with much corruption and untruth. All that is good in the Philoſophers is in the doctrine of Chriſt: but they had abundance of falſe opinions and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to corrupt it; when Chriſtianity hath nothing but clean and pure. So that as no Philoſopher affirmed himſelf to be the <hi>Saviour,</hi> ſo his doctrine was not atteſted by the plenary and common effect of Regeneration; as Chriſt's was: but as they were but the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the God of Nature, ſo they had but an anſwerable help from God; who could not be ſuppoſed (however, had they wrought miracles) to have atteſted more than themſelves aſſerted, or laid claim to.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is not proved, that his Doctrine doth truly ſanctifie any: 2. The effect which it hath can be but lame, defective, and mixt with much vanity and error, as his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is: for the effect cannot excell the cauſe. 3. That part of his doctrine which <hi>is good, and doth good,</hi> is not his <hi>own,</hi> but part of <hi>Chriſts,</hi> from whom he borrowed it, and to whom the good effects are to be aſcribed. 4. <hi>Mahomet</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pretended to be the Son of God, and Saviour of the World, but only to be a Prophet: Therefore his cauſe is much like that of the Philoſophers forementioned, ſaving that he giveth a fuller teſtimony to Chriſt. 5. If <hi>Mahomet</hi> had proved his <hi>Word,</hi> by antecedent Propheſies, Promiſes, and Types, through many ages; and by <hi>inherent purity,</hi> and by <hi>concomitant Miracles,</hi> and by ſuch wonderfull ſubſequent communications of renewing ſanctifying grace, by the Spirit of God, ſo ordinary in the World; we ſhould all have had reaſon to believe his Word: But if he pretend only to be a Prophet, and give us none of all theſe proofs, but a fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh, ridiculous bundle of Non-ſenſe, full of carnal doctrines, mixt with holy truth, which he had from Chriſt, we muſt judge accordingly of his Authority and Word, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding God may make uſe of that common truth, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an anſwerable degree of Goodneſs, among thoſe that hear and know no better.</p>

They were done in the open light, and not in a corner, or in the dark. 5. They were done many times over,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:59459:178"/>
and not once or twice only. 6. The nature of the things was ſuch, as a juggling deluding of the ſenſes could not ſerve for ſo common a deceit: As when the perſons that were born blinde, the lame, the Paralitick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were ſeen to be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly healed; and ſo of the reſt. 7. They were perſons who followed Chriſt, and were ſtill with him, (or very oft): and therefore if they had been once deceived, they could not be ſo alwayes 8. And vigilant ſubtile enemies were about them, that would have helped them to have detected a deceit. 9 Yea, the twelve Apoſtles and 70 Diſciples were employed themſelves in working Miracles, healing the ſick and Demoniacks, in Chriſts own life-time; and rejoyced in it: And they could not be deceived for divers years together in the things which they ſaw, and heard, and felt, and alſo in that which they did themſelves: Beſides that, all their own Miracles which they wrought after Chriſts aſcenſion, prove that they were not deceived. 10 There is no way left then but one to deceive them; and that is, if God himſelf ſhould <hi>alter and delude</hi> all their ſenſes, which it is certain that he did not doe: For then he had been the chief cauſe of all the deluſion, and all the conſequents of it in the World: He that hath given men <hi>ſight, and hearing, and feeling,</hi> will not delude them all by unreſiſtable alterations and deceits, and then forbid them to believe thoſe lies, and propagate them to others. Man hath no other way of knowing things ſenſible but by ſenſe.

               <p>
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:59459:179"/>This I have fully and undenyably proved, in a Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in my Book againſt Infidelity: by ſuch arguments as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The uſe and obligation of ſuch Miracles doth extend to all that have ſufficient evidence of their truth. But the Nations and generations which never ſaw them, may have ſufficient evidence of their truth (that they were done): <hi>Ergo,</hi> the uſe and obligation doth extend to ſuch.</p>
               <p>The Major is paſt all contradiction. He that hath ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient evidence of the truth of the fact, is obliged to believe it. The Minor is to be proved in the following Sections.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The contrary doctrine maketh it impoſſible for God to oblige the World by Miracles, according to their proper uſe. But it is not impoſſible: Therefore that doctrine is falſe.</p>
               <p>Here note, that the uſe and force of miracles lyeth in their being <hi>extraordinary,</hi> rather than in the <hi>Power</hi> which they manifeſt: For it is as great an effect of Omnipotency to have the Sun move, as to ſtand ſtill: Now if miracles oblige none to believe but thoſe that ſee them, then every man in every City, Countrey, Town, Family, and in all generations to the end of the World, muſt ſee Chriſt riſen, or not believe it, and muſt ſee <hi>Lazarus</hi> riſen, or not believe it; and muſt ſee all the miracles himſelf which oblige him to believe: But this is an abſurdity, and contradiction, making Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles Gods ordinary works, and ſo as no miracles.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <note place="margin">Every man expecteth himſelf to be believed: and therefore oweth juſt belief to others.</note>3. They that teach men that they are bound to believe no Miracles but what they ſee, do deprive all after-ages of all the benefit of all the miraculous works of God, both Mercies and Judgements, which their forefathers ſaw: But God wrought them not only for them that ſaw them; but alſo for the abſent,<note place="margin">The teſtimony of one or two eye-witneſſes, is to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many learned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures and argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. Many wiſe men heretofore thought that they proved by argument, that there were no <hi>Antipodes,</hi> and others that men could not live under the <hi>Aequator</hi> and <hi>Poles;</hi> But one Voyage of <hi>Columbus</hi> hath fully confuted all the firſt; and many ſince have confuted both the one and the other; and are now believed againſt all thoſe learned Arguments by almoſt all.</note> and after-times.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By the ſame reaſon, they will diſoblige men from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving any other matters of fact, which they never ſaw themſelves: And that is to make them like new comers into
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:59459:179"/>
the World, yea, like Children and Fools, and to be unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Humane Society.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This reaſoning would rob God of the honour of all his moſt wonderous works, as from any but thoſe that ſee them: ſo that no abſent perſon, nor following age ſhould be obliged to mention them, believe them, or honour him for them: which is abſurd and impious.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The World would be ſtill as it were to begin anew, and no age muſt be the wiſer for all the experiences of thoſe that have gone before; if we muſt not believe what we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw. And if men muſt not learn thus much of their Anceſtors, why ſhould they be obliged to learn any thing elſe, but Children be left to learn only by their own eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight?</p>
               <p n="7">7. If we are not bound to believe Gods wonderous works which have been before our dayes, then our anceſtors are not bound to tell them us, nor we to be thankfull for them: The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhould not have told their Poſterity how they were brought out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> nor <hi>England</hi> keep a day of Thankſgiving for its deliverance from the <hi>Powder-plot</hi>: But the conſequent is abſurd: <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſo is the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent. What have we our tongues for, but to ſpeak of what we know to others? The love that Parents have to their Children will oblige them to acquaint them with all things uſefull which they know. The Love which men have naturally to truth, will oblige them to divulge it. Who that had but ſeen an Angel, or received inſtructions by a Voice from Heaven, or ſeen the dead raiſed, would not tell others what he had ſeen and heard? And to what end ſhould he tell them, if they were not obliged to believe it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Governments, and Juſtice, and all humane converſe is maintained by the belief of others, and the reports and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of things which we ſee not: Few of the Subjects ſee their King. Witneſſes carry it in every cauſe of Juſtice: Thus Princes prove their Succeſſions and title to their Crowns, and all men their Eſtates, by the records or teſtimony of others.</p>
               <p n="9">9. It is impudent arrogancy for every Infidel to tie God to be at his beck, to work Miracles as oft as he requireth it: To ſay, I will not believe without a Miracle; and if thou

And though ſome men would go far in ſeeking followers and applauſe, when they believe the doctrine which they preach them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet hardly in preaching that which they know to be falſe: the ſtirrings of conſcience would torment ſome of them, among ſo many, and at laſt break out into open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and detection of the fraud. 8.

And the piety and humility of their writings ſheweth, that applauſe was not their end and prize: if they had ſought this, they would have fitted their endeavours to it; whereas it is the ſanctifying and ſaving of ſouls, through faith in Jeſus Chriſt, which they bent their labours towards. 10. So many men could never have agreed among themſelves in ſuch a ſcatter'd caſe, to carry on the juggle and deceit, without detection. Now tell us, if you can, where ever ſo many perſons in the world, ſo notably humble, pious and ſelf-denying, did preach againſt pride, man-pleaſing and lying, as damnable ſins, and debaſe themſelves, and ſuffer ſo much reproach and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and go through ſuch labour and travel, and lay down their lives, and confeſſedly hazard their ſouls for ever, and all this to get followers, that ſhould believe <hi>in another man,</hi> by perſwading men that <hi>he wrought miracles,</hi> and <hi>roſe from the dead,</hi> when they knew themſelves that all were lies which they thus laboriouſly divulged? If you give an inſtance in the Diſciples of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the caſe was nothing ſo: no ſuch miracles atteſted! no ſuch witneſſes to proclaim it! no ſuch conſequents of ſuch a teſtimony! none of all this was ſo: but only a Deceiver maketh a few barbarous people believe that he had Revelations, and was a Prophet, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Souldier, and proſpering in War, he ſetteth up and keepeth up a Kingdom by the Sword, his Preachers being ſuch as being thus deluded, did themſelves believe the things which they ſpake, and found it the way to worldly greatneſs.</p>

when I find that the Apoſtles never wrote againſt any ſuch, nor contended with them, nor were ever put to anſwer any of their writings or objections: When all men will confeſs that their writings muſt needs be written according to the ſtate and occaſion of thoſe times in which they wrote them: and if then there had been any books or reaſonings divulged againſt Chriſt's miracles, they would either have wrote pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely againſt them, or let fall ſome confutations of them, in their Epiſtles to the Churches: but there are no ſuch things at all.</p>

And all theſe new converts had underſtandings which were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally inclined to truth as truth, and averſe to falſhood; and they had all ſelf-love: and they all embraced now a doctrine which would expoſe them to ſuffering and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in the world: And therefore both nature and intereſt obliged them to be at the labour of enquiring, whether theſe things were ſo or not, before they ran themſelves into ſo great miſery: And the three thouſand which <hi>Peter</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted at his firſt Sermon, muſt alſo take the ſhame of being murderers of their Saviour, and for this they were pricked at the heart: And <hi>Paul</hi> muſt be branded for a confeſſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor, and guilty of the bloud of <hi>Stephen</hi>!

Chriſt fed ſo many thouſand twice miraculouſly, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he healed ſuch as he was ſaid to heal, who were then living? and whether he raiſed <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and others, from death, who were then living? and whether the earth trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and the vail of the Temple rent, and the Sun was dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at his death?

               </p>
               <p>If it were but by one or two men that Miracles were wrought, there would be greater room for doubting of the truth: But when it ſhall be by hundreds and thouſands, there can be no difficulty in the proof: That the Apoſtles and the ſeventy Diſciples wrought them in Chriſts own time, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before:<note place="margin">Math. 16.17.

               <p>And <hi>James</hi> (5.14, 15.) exhorteth Chriſtians when they <hi>were ſick, to ſend to the Elders of the Church, that they may pray for them and anoynt them,</hi> and they may be forgiven and recover: By which it ſeems it was no unuſual thing in thoſe times to be healed by the Prayers of the Elders. Yea, the very Hypocrites, and ungodly perſons, that had only the barren profeſſion of Chriſtianity, had the gift of Miracles, without the grace of Sanctification: And this Chriſt foretold, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Many ſhall ſay in that day, Lord, have we not propheſied in thy Name? and in thy Name caſt out devils? and done many wonderfull works?</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Certainly, they did not cure all men that were ſick: For then who would have dyed? It was none of the intent of the Spirit of Chriſt, in working Miracles, to make men immortal here on earth; and to keep them from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? 2. And it is eaſily confeſs'd, that the Spirit was not at the command or will of them that had it: And therefore they could not do what and when they pleaſed, but what the Spirit pleaſed; And his operations were at his own time and diſpoſal. And this proveth the more fully, that it was the teſtimony of God, and not the contrivance of the wit of man. 3. And miracles and tongues were not for them that believed, but rather for them that believed not: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a <hi>Trophimus</hi> or a <hi>Timothy</hi> might be unhealed.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Diſſimulation might be eaſilyer cloaked for a few acts, than it can be for ſo many years. At leaſt theſe gifts and miracles continued during the Age of the Apoſtles, though not performed every day, or ſo commonly as might make them uneffectual, yet ſo frequently as to give ſucceſs to the Goſpel, and to keep up a reverence of Chriſtianity in the World. They were wrought not only at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but at <hi>Samaria, Antioch, Epheſus, Corinth, Philippi,</hi> and the reſt of the Churches through the World.</p>
               <p>

               <p>The Holy Ghoſt fell on the Apoſtles and all the Diſciples at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> before all the people; that is, <hi>They all heard them ſpeak in ſeveral tongues, the wonderfull works of God; even the Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Meſopotamia, Judaea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Aſia, Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia, Pamphylia, Egypt, Lybia, Cyrene, Rome, Jews and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelites, Cretes, and Arabians,</hi> Act. 2.8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

The gifts of tongues, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, were commonly exerciſed before Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or multitudes. And crowds of people flocked to them to be healed; As with Chriſt they uncovered the roofs of the houſes to lay the ſick before him; ſo with the Apoſtles they ſtrove who might come within their ſhadow, or touch the hem of their garment, or have Cloaths or Napkins from them, that they might be healed. So that here was an <hi>age</hi> of <hi>publick Miracles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 37. 5. <hi>All theſe miracles were uncontrolled; that is, They were not wrought in oppoſition to any controlling Truth, which hath certain evidence contradicting this; nor yet were they overtopt by any greater miracles for the contrary.</hi>

               <p>A miracle (if God ſhould permit it to be wrought in ſuch a caſe) might be ſaid to be <hi>controlled,</hi> either of theſe two wayes: 1. If a man ſhould work Miracles to contradict the certain light of Nature, or perſwade men to that which is certainly falſe: 2. If men ſhould do wonders as <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But theſe Miracles had no ſuch controll, but prevailed without any check from contradictory Truths or Miracles. Thus Chriſt performed his Promiſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.12. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, he that believeth on me, the works that I do, ſhall he do alſo, and greater works than theſe ſhall he do, becauſe I goe unto the Father.</hi>

                  <hi>§.</hi> 38. III. <hi>The third teſtimony of the Spirit to the truth of the Apoſtles witneſs, was the marvellous ſucceſs of their doctrine to the ſanctifying of ſouls; which as it could not be done without the power and Spirit of God, ſo neither would the righteous and mercifull Governour of the World; have made a company of profligate lyars and deceivers his inſtruments of doing this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent work by cheats and falſhoods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:59459:189"/>This I ſpake of before, as it is the Seal of <hi>Chriſts own</hi> doctrine: I now ſpeak of it only as it is the Seal of the <hi>Apoſtles verity</hi> in their teſtimony of the Reſurrection and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of Chriſt. <hi>Peter</hi> converted three thouſand at once: Many thouſands and myriads up and down the world were ſpeedily converted. And what was this Converſion. They were brought unfeignedly to love God above all, and their neighbours as themſelves. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42, 46. <hi>They continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles doctrine, and fellowſhip, and breaking of bread and prayer: And all that believed were together and had all things common,</hi> (not by levelling, but by lone) <hi>and ſold their poſſeſſions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need, and did eat their meat with gladneſs and ſingleneſs of heart, praiſing God, and having favour with all the People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Act. 4.32. <hi>The multitude of Believers were of one heart, and of one ſoul, neither ſaid any of them that ought of the things that he poſſeſſed was his own, but they had all things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All that are in Chriſt, have <hi>his Spirit, and are ſpiritually minded, and walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit,</hi> Rom. 8. <hi>They that are Chriſts, have crucified the fleſh, with the affections and luſts: The world is crucified to them, and they to the world,</hi> Gal. 5.24. &amp; 6.14. <hi>They are choſen to be holy and unblameable in love,</hi> Eph. 1.4. They walk as <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in the ſpirit of their mindes, with all lowlineſs and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and long-ſuffering, forbearing one another, endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace</hi>: Eph. 4.23.2.3. As being <hi>created unto good works in Chriſt:</hi> Eph. 2.10. <hi>Without corrupt communication, bitterneſs, wrath, clamor, evil-ſpeaking, fornication, uncleanneſs, covetouſneſs, filthineſs, fooliſh talking and jeaſting,</hi> Eph. 4.29. &amp; 5.3.4. <hi>Denying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlyneſs and worldly luſts, living ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent world, as redeemed from all iniquity, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified as a peculiar people to Chriſt, zealous of good works</hi>: Tit. 2.12, 14. <hi>Having their converſation in Heaven, from whence they expect their Redeemer</hi> to tranſlate them into Glory, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20, 21. Theſe were the fruits of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>And God was pleaſed to bleſs their labours more than any

               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 39. <hi>It is the great advantage of our Faith, that theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond atteſtations to the Diſciples teſtimony of the Miracles of Chriſt, are much more open, evident, and convincing, to us at this diſtance, than the Miracles of Chriſt himſelf; that ſo there might be no place for rational doubting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſorts of their miracles were as numerous as his: They were wrought by hundreds and thouſands, and not by Chriſt alone. They were wrought for an age, and not for three years and a half alone: They were wrought in a great part of the World, and not in <hi>Judaea</hi> and <hi>Galilee</hi> alone: They were done in the face of abundance of Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and not before the <hi>Jews</hi> only: And they ſucceeded to the converſion and ſanctification of many thouſands more than did the preaching of Chriſt himſelf. So that if any thing that is ſaid before, of the confirmation of Chriſts own mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, had wanted evidence, it is abundantly made up in the evidence of their miracles who were the reporters and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of his.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 40. <hi>I have hitherto been ſhewing you, how the miracles of Chriſt were proved, atteſted, and made certainly known to the firſt Churches planted by the Apoſtles themſelves,</hi> viz. <hi>by the teſtimony of the Spirit,</hi> 1. <hi>In their doctrine and lives,</hi> 2. <hi>In their miracles, and</hi> 3. <hi>In their ſucceſs, in the ſanctification of mens ſouls: I am next to ſhew you how theſe matters of fact, or actions of the Apoſtles, are certainly proved, or brought down to us.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 41. <hi>And this is by the ſame three wayes of proof as the Apoſtles proved to the firſt Churches, their teſtimony: (though with much difference in the point of miracles)</hi> viz.

II. <hi>That there is a natural</hi> Impoſſibility <hi>that our Hiſtory of the Apoſtles gifts and miracles ſhould be falſe, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by reviewing all the particulars by which the ſame was proved of the Apoſtles teſtimony of the miracles of Chriſt; And in many reſpects, with much more advantage.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 44. (1.) <hi>It is naturally impoſſible that all Reporters could be themſelves deceived: For</hi> 1. <hi>They were</hi> many thouſands, <hi>in ſeveral Countreys through the World: And therefore could not be all either</hi> mad or ſenſleſs: 2. <hi>They were men that took their ſalvation to be moſt neerly concerned in the thing, and were to forſake the pleaſures of the World, and ſuffer from men for their Religion: and therefore could not be</hi> utterly careleſs <hi>in examining the thing:</hi> 3. <hi>They were</hi> preſent <hi>upon the place, and eye-witneſſes, and ear-witneſſes of all.</hi> 4. <hi>The Languages were ſaid to be ſpoken, in their aſſemblies, and the miracles done among them, for many years, even an age toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And it is impoſſible all Countreys could be cheated by juggling, in matters which their eyes and ears were ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent witneſſes of, for ſo many years together.</hi> 5. <hi>They were ſaid to be the objects of many of theſe miracles themſelves</hi>; viz. <hi>That the cures were wrought on many of them; that the ſame Spirit was given to them all.</hi> 6. <hi>And they were ſaid to be the Agents themſelves in the ſeveral works of that Spirit, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their ſeveral gifts.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Scriptures fore-cited tell us, that the ſame holy Ghoſt was given to them all, though all had not the ſame gifts; and that tongues, and healing, and miracles were the gifts of many, though not of all: which, as I have ſhewed, they could not themſelves have believed of themſelves, if it had not been true. Yea, ſufficient hiſtorical teſtimony telleth us, that for three or four hundred years, (at leaſt till <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> owned and protected Chriſtianity by Secular Power) miracles were wrought in confirmation of the Chriſtian faith. It hath been the devils craft to ſeek to deſtroy the credit of them, partly by hypocrites, who have counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited miracles; and partly by lying Legends of the carnal proud domineering part of the Church, who have told the world ſo many palpable lies, that they ſeemed to do it in deſign, to perſwade them to believe nothing that is true. But yet all wiſe men will know the difference between Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory credible and incredible. The many teſtimonies of the

miracles of <hi>Gregory Thaumaturgus,</hi> and many others, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and almoſt all other Chriſtian Writers of thoſe times, and thoſe mentioned by <hi>Auguſtine, de Civitate Dei, lib.</hi> 22 <hi>cap.</hi> 8. and <hi>Retract. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. <hi>&amp; paſſim</hi>; and by <hi>Cyprian, Tertullian,</hi> and many more, will not be thought incredible by impartial conſidering men.</p>

               </p>
               <p>How far the ſanctifying renewing ſucceſs of the doctrine, is a Divine atteſtation to its verity, I have before opened: and how far God owneth even the truths of Philoſophy, by bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them with an adequate proportionable ſucceſs. The defective partial truths of Philoſophy, produce a defective partial reformation; (how far God accepteth it, belongeth not to my preſent buſineſs to determine.) The more full and integral diſcovery of God's will, by Jeſus Chriſt, doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a more full and integral renovation. And, 1. The cauſe is known by the effect. 2. And God will not (as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid) bleſs a lie to do the moſt excellent work in all the world. Now it is a thing moſt evident, that God hath ſtill bleſs'd the Miniſtry of the Chriſtian Paſtors in all ages, to the renewing of many thouſand ſouls: That this is truly ſo, I ſhall ſomewhat fullier ſhew anon: but that it is God's own atteſtation, I have ſhewed before.</p>

                  </note>This (which I ſpake of the fore going Chapter) is a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in every holy ſoul, which the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt.

Nor hath he promiſed this to all that are baptized or called Chriſtians, but only to thoſe that ſincerely conſent to learn of him, and take his counſel, and uſe the remedies which he preſcribeth them. And is it not certain that Chriſt doth truly perform this undertaking? How then can he be a deceiver, who doth perform all that he undertaketh? Of this all true Chriſtians have a juſt demonſtration in themſelves, which is his witneſs.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But Chriſt undertaketh more than this, even to bring us to everlaſting bleſſedneſs in heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is our comfort that he doth ſo: but me-thinks its eaſie to believe him in that, if he perform the reſt: For, 1. I have proved in the firſt part of this Book, that by the light of nature, a future life of retribution muſt be expected,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:59459:199"/>
and that man is made for a future happineſs. 2. And who then ſhould have that happineſs, but the holy and renewed ſouls? Doth not natural reaſon tell you, that ſo good a God will ſhew his love to thoſe that are good, that is, to thoſe that love him? 3. And what think you is to be done to bring any man to heaven, but to pardon him, and make him holy? 4. And the nature of the work doth greatly help our faith. For this <hi>holineſs</hi> is nothing but the beginning of <hi>that happineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we find that Chriſt hath by his Spirit begun to make us <hi>know God,</hi> and <hi>love him,</hi> and <hi>delight in him,</hi> and <hi>praiſe him</hi>; it is the eaſier to make us believe that he will perfect it. He that promiſeth to convey me ſafely to the Antipodes, may eaſily be believed when he hath brought me paſt the greateſt difficulties of the voyage. He that will teach me to ſing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially, hath merited credit, when he hath taught me the gradual tones, the Scale of Muſick, the Sol-fa-ing, the Cliffs, the Quantity, the Moods, the Rules of time, &amp;c. He that cauſeth me to love God on earth, may be believed if he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe me that I ſhall love him more in heaven: And he that cauſeth me to deſire heaven above earth, before I ſee it, may be believed when he promiſeth, that it ſhall be my great delight when I am there. It is God's work to love them that love him, and to reward the obedient; and I muſt needs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God will do <hi>his</hi> work, and will never fail the juſt expectations of any creature. All my doubt is, whether I ſhall do <hi>my</hi> part, and whether I ſhall be a prepared ſubject for that felicity: and he that reſolveth this, reſolveth all: He that will make me fit for heaven, hath overcome the greateſt difficulty of my belief; and I ſhould the more eaſily believe that he will do the reſt, and that I ſhall ſurely come to heaven when I am fit for it.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But Chriſt doth not only undertake to regenerate and to ſave us, but alſo to juſtifie us, and this by a ſtrange way, by his Sacrifice and Merits.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The greater is his wiſdom and goodneſs, as made known to us. I am ſure an unpardoned unrighteous perſon, is uncapable of felicity in that ſtate: and I am ſure I cannot pardon my ſelf, nor well know which way elſe to ſeek it. And I am ſure that ſo excellent and holy a perſon, is fitter to be well-beloved of God I than. But I pray you remember,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:59459:200"/>
1. That he undertaketh not to pardon or juſtifie any man, whom he doth not renew and ſanctifie. 2. And that all his means, which ſeem ſo ſtrange to you, are but to reſtore God's Image on you, and fit you for his love and ſervice. And this we can teſtifie by experience that he hath done, in ſome meaſure in us: and if I find his means ſucceſsful, I will not quarrel with it, becauſe it ſeemeth ſtrange to me. A Phyſician may preſcribe me remedies for ſome mortal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, which I underſtand not, but ſeem unlike to do the cure: but if I find that thoſe unlikely means effect it, I will not quarrel with him, nor refuſe them, till I know my ſelf to be wiſer than he, and have found out ſome ſurer means.</p>
               <p>It is moſt evident then, that he who ſaveth us is our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; and he that ſaveth us from ſin, will ſave us from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; and he that maketh us fit for pardon, doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our pardon; and he that cauſeth us to love God above all, doth fit us to enjoy his love; and he that maketh us both to love him, and to be beloved by him, doth prepare us for heaven, and is truly the MEDIATOR.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. Of ſome other ſubſervient and Collateral Arguments for the Chriſtian Verity.</head>
               <p>HAving largely opened the great Evidence of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Verity, <hi>viz.</hi> The SPIRIT in its four wayes of teſtifying, Accidentally, Inherently, Concomitant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Subſequently, I ſhall more briefly recite ſome other ſubſervient Arguments, which I finde moſt ſatisfactory to my own underſtanding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 1. I. <hi>The natural evidence of the truth of the Scripture, about the Creation of the World, doth make it the more Credible to me in all things elſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For that is a thing which none but God himſelf could reveal to us: For the Scripture telleth what was done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was any man in being. And that this World is not eternal, nor of any longer continuance, is exceeding probable, by the ſtate of all things in it. 1. Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are far from that maturity, which a longer continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or an Eternity would have produced. Guns and Printing are but lately found out: The body of man is not yet well Anatomized; A <hi>Sellius</hi> his milkie <hi>Veines,</hi> and <hi>Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets</hi> Receptacle of the Chyle, and <hi>Bartholines</hi> Glandules, and the <hi>Vaſa Lymphatica,</hi> are of late diſcovery: <hi>Galilaeus</hi> his Glaſſes, and his four <hi>Medicaean</hi> Planets, and the Lunary mutations of <hi>Venus,</hi> and the ſtrange either opacous parts and
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:59459:201"/>
ſhape of <hi>Saturn,</hi> or the proximity of two other Stars which miſhape it to our ſight, the ſhadowy parts of the Moon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with the innumerable Stars in the <hi>Via Lactea,</hi> &amp;c. were all unknown to former ages. <hi>Gilberts</hi> magnetical diſcoveries (I ſpeak not of thoſe queſtionable Inferences which <hi>Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nella</hi> and others contradict) the nature of many Minerals and Plants, the chief operations and effects of Chymiſtry, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſecrets for the cure of many diſeaſes, even the moſt excellent medicaments, are all of very late invention. Almoſt all Arts and Sciences are encreaſing neerer towards Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Ocular demonſtrations by the <hi>Teleſcope,</hi> and ſenſible experiments, are daily multiplyed: Yea, the World it ſelf is not all diſcovered to any one part; but a great part of it was but lately made known even to the <hi>Europeans,</hi> whoſe knowledge is greateſt, by <hi>Columbus,</hi> and <hi>Americus Veſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus</hi>; and it is not long ſince it was firſt meaſured by a Circumnavigation. If the World had been eternall, or of much longer duration than the Scripture ſpeaketh, it is not credible that multiplyed experiences, would not have brought it above that Infancy of knowledge in which it ſo long continued.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>Curſed Warrs by Fire and Depopulation, conſume all Antiquities, and put the World ſtill to begin anew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It doth indeed do much this way; but it is not <hi>ſo much</hi> that Warre could do: For when it is in one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, others are free, and ſome would fly, or lie hid or ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive, who would preſerve Arts and Sciences, and be teachers of the reſt. Who can think now that any Wars are like to make <hi>America,</hi> or <hi>Galilaeus</hi>'s Stars unknown again? or any of the forenamed Inventions to be loſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Moreover, it is ſtrange, if the World were eternall, or much elder than Scripture ſpeaketh, that no part of the World ſhould ſhew us any elder Monument of Antiquity; no engraven Stones or Plates; no <hi>Mauſolus,</hi> Pyramids, or Pillars; no Books; no Chronological Tables, no Hiſtories or Genealogies, or other Memorials and Records. I know to this alſo, curſed Warrs may contribute much: But not <hi>ſo much,</hi> as to leave <hi>nothing</hi> to inquiſitive Succeſſors.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Even between the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal hypocritical nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Chriſtian, and the true Chriſtian: as <hi>Gal. 4.29.</hi> As then he that was born after the Fleſh perſecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even ſo it is now.</note>Such a contrariety there is, even between <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> Children of the ſame Father; ſuch an implacable enmity throughout all the World, in almoſt all wicked men againſt Godlineſs it ſelf, and thoſe that ſincerely love and follow it; ſuch a hatred in thoſe that are Orthodoxly bred, againſt the true power, uſe and practice, of the Religion which they themſelves profeſs; ſuch a reſolute reſiſtance of all that is ſeriouſly good and holy, and tendeth but to the ſaving of the reſiſters; that it is but a publick viſible acting of all thoſe things which the Scripture ſpeaketh of; and a fulfilling them in all ages and places in the ſight of all the World. Of which having treated largely in my Treatiſe againſt Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, I referre you thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 4. IV. <hi>It much confirmeth me to finde that there is no other Religion profeſſed in the World, that an impartial rational man can reſt in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That man is made for another life, the light of Nature proveth to all men: And ſome way or other there muſt be opened to us to attain it: <hi>Mahometaniſme</hi> I think not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a confutation. <hi>Judaiſme</hi> muſt be much beholden to Chriſtianity for its proofs, and is but the introduction to it, incluſively conſidered. The Heathens or meer Naturaliſts are ſo blinde, ſo idolatrous, ſo divided into innumerable ſects, ſo loſt and bewildred in uncertainties, and ſhew us ſo little holy fruit of their Theology, that I can incline to no more than to take thoſe natural Verities which they confeſs, and which they caſt among the rubbiſh of their fopperies and wickedneſs, and to wipe them clean, and take them
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:59459:202"/>
for ſome part of my Religion. Chriſtianity or nothing is the way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 5. V. <hi>It much confirmeth me to obſerve, that commonly the moſt true and ſerious Chriſtians, are the holyeſt and moſt honeſt, righteous men; and that the worſe men are, the greater enemies they are to true Chriſtianity: And then to think, how incredible it is that God ſhould lead all the worſt men into the truth, and leave the beſt and godlyeſt in an error.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſmall matters, or common ſecular things, this were no wonder: But in the matter of Believing, worſhipping and pleaſing God, and ſaving of Souls, it is not credible. As for the belief of a Life to come, no men are ſo far from it as the vileſt Whoremongers, Drunkards, perjured perſons, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, Oppreſſors, Tyrants, Thieves, Rebels, or if any other name can denote the worſt of men: And none ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a Life to come as the moſt godly, honeſt-hearted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: And can a man that knoweth that there is a God, believe that he will leave all good men in ſo great an error, and rightly inform and guide all theſe Beaſts, or living walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing images of the Devil. The ſame in a great meaſure is true of the friends and enemies of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§.</hi> 6. VI. <hi>It hath been a great convincing argument with me, againſt both Atheiſme and Infidelity, to obſerve the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous Providences of God, for divers of his ſervants, and the ſtrange anſwer of Prayers, which I my ſelf, and ordinarily other Chriſtians have had.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have been and am as backward to ungrounded creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty about wonders, as moſt men, that will not ſtrive againſt knowledge. But I have been oft convinced by great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and teſtimonies which I believed equally with my eye-ſight, of ſuch actions of God, as I think would have convinced moſt, that ſhould know as much of them as I did. But few of them are fit to mention: For ſome of them ſo much concern my ſelf, that ſtrangers may be tempted to think that they ſavour of ſelf-eſteem; and ſome of them the factions and parties in theſe times, will by their intereſt be engaged to diſtaſte; And ſome of them have been done on perſons, whoſe after ſcandalous Crimes have made me think it unfit to mention them; leſt I ſhould ſeem to put honour on a ſcandalous ſinner, or ſeem to diſhonour Gods Works

by mentioning ſuch an object of them: And I have much obſerved, that whatever wonder I ever knew done, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Prayer, or atteſtation of any good, the Devil hath with marvellous ſubtilty, endeavoured by ſome error or ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of men, to turn it all againſt Chriſt and to his own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. But yet God declareth the truth of his Promiſes, by the deliverances of his Servants, and the granting of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which are put up to him in the name of Chriſt. I will not diſpute whether theſe actions ſhall be called <hi>Miracles,</hi> or not: It is enough for my purpoſe, if they be but atteſting Providences. All Church-Hiſtory telleth us of many ſuch heretofore: how great things have been done, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances wrought upon Chriſtians earneſt Prayer to God. The ſucceſs of the Thundering Legion in the Army of <hi>Marcus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius Antoninus,</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> is commonly mentioned: You may ſee it in the <hi>Apolog.</hi> of <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi>: See more in <hi>Pamelius</hi>'s Notes on <hi>Tertull.</hi> N. 64. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius,</hi> pag. 328 of the Chriſtians caſting out of Devils, <hi>[O ſi audire velles &amp; videre, quando a nobis adjurantur &amp; torqientur ſpiritalibus flagris, &amp; verborum tormentis de obſeſſis corpori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ejiciuntur, quando ejulantes &amp; gementes voce humanâ, &amp; poteſtate divinâ flagella &amp; verbera ſentientes, venturum judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium confitentur.

to forge ſo many miracles and matters of fact, and call a man</hi> God, <hi>and to perplex the world with needleſs deluſory ſtrictneſſes, and to father all this on God himſelf, would have been a villany ſo tranſcendent, that none but men extremely bad could do it.

               <p>And though the further we go from the root, the more darkneſs, and diſſimilitude appeareth to us, yet it is ſtrange to ſee even in the <hi>Body,</hi> what Analogies there are to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Soul; In the <hi>ſuperior, middle,</hi> and <hi>inferior</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions: And in them the <hi>natural, vital,</hi> and <hi>animal</hi> parts, with the three ſorts of <hi>Humours</hi>; three ſorts of <hi>Concoctions,</hi> and three ſorts of <hi>Spirits,</hi> anſwerable thereto, and admirably united: with much more, which a juſt Scheme would open to you. And therefore ſeeing God is known to us by this his Image, and in this Glaſs, though we muſt not think that any thing in God is <hi>formally</hi> the ſame as it is in <hi>Man</hi>; yet certainly we muſt judge, that all this is <hi>eminently</hi> in God; and that we have no fitter notions and names con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his incomprehenſible Perfections, than what are bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the Minde of man. Therefore it is thus unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyable, that GOD is in the Unity of his Eternal, Infinite <hi>Eſſence,</hi> a Trinity of <hi>Eſſentialities,</hi> or Active Principles: <hi>viz.</hi> POWER, INTELLECT and WILL: And in their <hi>HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY</hi> Perfections, they are, <hi>Omnipotency, Omniſcience</hi> (or Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) and <hi>Goodneſs</hi>: And in his Relative Supremacy is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this Trinity of Relations, He is our OWNER, our RECTOR and our CHIEF GOOD, that is, Our Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor and our end.</p>

               <p>If you ſay, what is all this to the Trinity of Hypoſtaſes or perſons, I anſwer, Either the three Subſiſtences in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity are the ſame, with the <hi>Potentia, Intellectus</hi> and <hi>Voluntas,</hi> in the Divine Eſſence, or not: If they are the ſame, there is nothing at all intelligible, incredible or uncertain in it: For natural Reaſon knoweth that there is all theſe eminently in God; And whoever will think that any humane language can ſpeak of him, muſt confeſs that his Omnipotence, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs, his Power, Intellect and Will, muſt be thus to mans apprehenſion diſtinguiſhed: Otherwiſe we muſt ſay nothing at all of God, or ſay that his power is his willing, and his willing is his knowing, and that he willeth all the ſin which he knoweth, and all that he <hi>can</hi> do: which language will, at beſt, ſignifie nothing to any man.</p>
               <p>And it is to be noted, that our Saviour in his <hi>Eternal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence,</hi> is called in Scripture, The WISDOM of God, (or his internal Word): and in his <hi>Operations</hi> in the <hi>Creation</hi>; he is called, <hi>The Word of God,</hi> as <hi>operative</hi> or efficient: and in his <hi>Incarnation,</hi> he is called <hi>The Son of God</hi>: Though theſe terms be not <hi>alwayes</hi> and <hi>only</hi> thus uſed, yet <hi>uſually</hi> they are.</p>

He that confoundeth the Attributes of God, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth not thoſe which expreſs theſe three Eſſential Primalities, or Active Principles, to which our faculties are analogous, from the reſt; or that thinketh that we ſhould caſt by this diſtinction, under the name of an inadequate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, ſo far as we can imagine theſe Principles to be the ſame, and that there is not truly in the Deity a ſufficient ground for this diſtinction, is not the man that I am willing now to debate this cauſe with; I have done that ſufficiently before. Whether the diſtinction be real, formal or denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native, the <hi>Thomiſts, Scotiſts</hi> and <hi>Nominals</hi> have diſputed more than enough. But even the Nominals ſay, that there is a ſufficient ground for the denomination, which ſome call Virtual, and ſome Relative. And they that diſpute of the
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:59459:217"/>
diſtinction of Perſons, do accordingly differ, calling it either Relative, Virtual, Formal or Modal, or <hi>ratione ratiocinata,</hi> as they imagine beſt. And they that differ about theſe, do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly differ about the difference of the faculties of our ſouls. For my part I ſee not the leaſt reaſon to doubt, but that the Trinity of Divine Primalities, Principles and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections hath made its impreſs on man's ſoul, in its three parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the Natural, the Moral, and the Dominative parts: in the firſt we have an Active Power, an Intellect and Free-will. In the ſecond Fortitude, (or holy promptitude and ſtrength) Wiſdom and Goodneſs, (or Love:) In the third, we are to the inferiour creatures their Owners, Rulers and Benefactors, or End: and what ever you will call our facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and their moral perfections, it is undoubted that in God, his <hi>Omnipotency, Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> are his <hi>Eſſence,</hi> and yet as much diſtinct as is aforeſaid. And what mortal man is able to ſay, whether the diſtinction of Perſons be either greater or leſs than this? And remember, that as I ſpeak of <hi>Motion, Light</hi> and <hi>Heat,</hi> both as in the <hi>faculties</hi> of the Sun, (as I may call them) and in the <hi>Acts</hi> or <hi>Emanations</hi>; and of the <hi>Power, Intellect</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> of man, both as in the <hi>Faculties</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi>; ſo do I here of the <hi>Divine Primalities</hi>; yet ſo, as ſuppoſing that in God, who is called a Pure Act, there is not ſuch a difference between <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Act,</hi> as there is in man or other creatures.</p>
               <p n="4">4. No man, I think, is able to prove, that the <hi>works</hi> of the <hi>Trinity, ad extra,</hi> are <hi>any more undivided,</hi> than the works of the three Eſſential Active Principles: they are ſo undivided, as that yet the work of <hi>Creation</hi> is <hi>eminently,</hi> or moſt notably aſcribed to the <hi>Father,</hi> (as is alſo the ſending of the Son into the world, the forgiving of ſin for his ſake, &amp;c.) and the work of <hi>Redemption</hi> to the <hi>Son,</hi> and the work of <hi>Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to the <hi>holy Ghoſt:</hi> We ſhall be as loth to ſay, that the Father or holy Ghoſt was incarnate for us, or died for us, or mediates for us, as that the <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Love</hi> of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doth the works which belong to his <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> And the Eſſential Wiſdom and Love of God are no more communicable to man, than the Son and holy Spirit, who are ſaid to be given to us, and to dwell within us.

Abundance of Hereticks have troubled the Church with their ſelf-deviſed opinions about the Trinity, and the Perſon and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Chriſt: and I am loth to ſay, how much many of the Orthodox have troubled it alſo, with their ſelf-conceited, miſguided, uncharitable zeal, againſt thoſe whom they judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hereticks: The preſent diviſions between the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the <hi>Armenians, Syrians, Copties</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> is too ſad a proof of this: and the long conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> about the terms <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſis</hi> and <hi>Perſona.</hi>

               <p n="6">6. But for my own part, as I unfeignedly account the doctrine of the Trinity, the very ſumm and kernel of the Chriſtian Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (as expreſt in our Baptiſm) and <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> his Creed, the beſt explication of it that ever I read; ſo I think it very unmeet in theſe tremendous myſteries, to go further than we have God's own light to guide us: And it is none of my purpoſe at all to joyn with either of the two fore-mentioned parties; nor to aſſert that the myſterie of the bleſſed Trinity of Hypoſtaſes or Perſons is no other than this uncontroverted Trinity of Eſſential Principles. All that I endeavour is but as aforeſaid, to ſhew that this Doctrine is neither contradictory, incredible, nor unlikely, by ſhewing the <hi>veſtigia</hi> or Image of it, and that which is as liable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and yet of unqueſtionable truth. And if the three Hypoſtaſes be not the ſame with the Trinity of Principles

aforeſaid, yet no man can give a ſufficient reaſon, why Three in One ſhould not be truly credible and probable in the one inſtance, when common natural reaſon is fully ſatisfied of it in the other.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is indeed the greateſt difficulty of faith: but if you do not miſtake the matter, you will find it alſo the greateſt excellency of faith. 1. Therefore you muſt take heed of making it difficult by your own errour: think not that the Godhead was <hi>turned</hi> into man, (as you talk of a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a flie) nor yet that there was the leaſt real change upon the Deity by this incarnation: nor the leaſt real abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, diſhonour, loſs, injury or ſuffering to it thereby.

And indeed the opinion, that God is the Soul of ſouls, or of the Intellectual world, hath that in it, which may be a ſtrong temptation to the wiſeſt to imagine it: Though indeed he is no conſtitutive form of any of thoſe creatures, but to be their Creator and total efficient is much more. What Union it is which we call Hypoſtatical, we do not fully underſtand our ſelves: but we are ſure that it is ſuch as no more abaſeth the Deity, than its concourſe with the Sun in its efficiencies.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But what kin are theſe aſſertions of Philoſophers to yours, of the Incarnation of the Eternal Word and Wiſdom of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> What was it but an Incarnation of a Deity, which they affirmed of <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> and ſuch others? And they that thought God to be the <hi>Soul of the world,</hi> thought that the world was as much animated with the Deity, as we affirm the humane Nature of Chriſt to have been; yea, for ought I ſee, whilſt they thought that this ſoul was parcelled out to every individual, and that Matter only did <hi>pro tempore</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuate, they made every man to be God incarnate. And can they believe that it is ſo with <hi>every man,</hi> and yet think it
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:59459:219"/>
                  <hi>incredible</hi> in Chriſtianity, that our humane Nature is perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally united to the Divine? I think in this they contradict themſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And it is no way incredible that God ſhould value man according to his natural worth and uſefulneſs, as an intellectual agent, capable of Knowing, and Loving, and Praiſing him, and Enjoying him: His creating us ſuch, and his abundant mercies to us, do abundantly prove the truth of this. Nor is it incredible that he ſhould be willing that his depraved creature ſhould be reſtored to the uſe and ends of its nature: nor is it incredible that God ſhould chooſe the beſt and fitteſt means to effect all this. Nothing more credible than all this.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And it is not incredible at all, that the Incarnation of the Eternal Word ſhould be the <hi>fitteſt means</hi> for this reparation: If we conſider, 1. What queſtion we ſhould have made of the <hi>word</hi> of an Angel, or any meer creature, that ſhould have ſaid, he came from God to teach us; ſeeing we could not be ſo certain that he was infallible, and indefectible. 2. And how ſhort a creature would have fallen in the Prieſtly part of Mediation. 3. And how inſufficient he would have been for the Kingly Dignity, and univerſal Government and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Church, and Judgement of the world. 4. And withall, that <hi>God Himſelf,</hi> being the <hi>Glorifier of Himſelf,</hi> and the Donor of all felicity to us, it is very congruous, that he ſhould moſt eminently <hi>Himſelf</hi> perform the moſt eminent of theſe works of mercy.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And it much aſſiſteth my belief of the Incarnation, to conſider, that certainly the work that was to be done for man's recovery, was the winning of his heart to the <hi>Love</hi> of God, from himſelf and other creatures: and there was no way imaginable ſo fit to inflame us with love to God, as for him moſt wonderfully to manifeſt his love to us: which is more done in the work of man's Redemption, than any other way imaginable; ſo that being the moſt ſuitable means to reſtore us to the love of God, it is fitteſt to be the way of our recovery; and ſo the more credible.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And it much ſuppreſſeth temptation to unbelief in me, to conſider, that the three grand works in which God's Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentialities declare themſelves, muſt needs be all ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemeth
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:59459:219"/>
God; that is, <hi>moſt wonderful,</hi> tranſcending man's comprehenſion. And as his <hi>Omnipotency</hi> ſhewed it ſelf (with <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Love</hi>) in the great work of <hi>Creation,</hi> ſo was it meet that his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> ſhould ſhew it ſelf moſt wonderfully in the great work of <hi>Redemption,</hi> in order to the as <hi>wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> declaration of his <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> in the great work of our Salvation, (our Regeneration, and Glorification.) And therefore if this were not a <hi>wonderful</hi> work, it were not fit to be parallel with the Creation, in demonſtrating God's Perfections to our minds.</p>
               <p>Object. III. <hi>But how incredible is it that humane nature ſhould, in a glorified Chriſt, be ſet above the Angelical nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is no arguing in the dark, from things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, againſt what is fully brought to light. What God hath done for man, the Scripture hath revealed, and alſo that Chriſt himſelf is far above the Angels: But what Chriſt hath done for Angels, or for any other world of creatures, God thought not meet to make us acquainted with. There have been Chriſtians who have thought, (by plauſible reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings from many Texts of Scripture) that Chriſt hath three Natures, the Divine, and a Super-angelical, and a Humane; and that the Eternal Word did firſt unite it ſelf to the Super-angelical nature, and in that created the world; and in that appeared to <hi>Abraham</hi> and the other Fathers; and then aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the Humane nature laſt of all for Redemption: And thus they would reconcile the <hi>Arrians</hi> and the <hi>Orthodox.</hi> But the moſt Chriſtians hold only two Natures in Chriſt: but then they ſay, that he that hath promiſed that we ſhall <hi>be equal with the Angels,</hi> doth know that the nature of Man's Soul and of Angels differ ſo little, that in advancing one, he doth as it were advance both: and certainly maketh no diſorder in nature, by exalting the inferiour <hi>in ſenſu compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſito,</hi> above the Superiour and more excellent. Let us not then deceive our ſelves, by arguing from things unknown.</p>
               <p>Object. IV. <hi>There are things ſo incredible in the Scripture-Miracles, that it is hard to believe them to be true.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. No doubt but Miracles muſt be <hi>Wonders:</hi> they were not elſe ſo ſufficient to be a divine atteſtation, if they were not things exceeding our power and reach. But why ſhould they be thought incredible? Is it becauſe they tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:59459:220"/>
the <hi>Power</hi> of God, or his <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> or his <hi>Goodneſs?</hi> Or becauſe they are harder to him than the things which our eyes are daily witneſſes of? Is not the motion of the Sun and Orbs, and eſpecially of the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> which the Peripateticks teach; yea, or that of the Earth and Globes, which others teach, as great a work, as any miracle men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the holy Scriptures? Shall any man that ever conſidered the number, magnitude, glory, and motions of the Fixed Stars, object any difficulty to God? Is it not as eaſie to raiſe one man from the dead, as to give life to all the living?</p>
               <p n="2">2. And are not Miracles according to our own neceſſities and deſires? Do not men call for ſigns and wonders, and ſay, If I ſaw one riſe from the dead, or ſaw a Miracle, I would believe? Or at leaſt, I cannot believe that Chriſt is the Son of God, unleſs he work Miracles? And ſhall that be a hinderance to your belief, which is your laſt remedy againſt unbelief? Will you not believe without miracles, and yet will you not believe them becauſe they are Miracles? This is but meer perverſneſs? as much as to ſay, we will neither believe with Miracles nor without.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Impartially conſider of the proof I have before given you, of the certain truth of the <hi>matter of Fact,</hi> that ſuch miracles were really done: and then you may ſee not only that they are to be believed, but the doctrine to be the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believed for their ſakes.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Immortality of the Soul, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly its perpetual duration, and a life of Retribution after this, did not ſeem things incredible to moſt of the Heathens and Infidels in the World: And I have proved it before by evidence of Nature to common Reaſon. So that to make that incredible in Chriſtianity, which Philoſophers and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the World hold, and which hath cogent natural evidence, is to put out the eye of Reaſon as well as of Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And that it hath much uſe of, or dependance on the body in its preſent operations, is no proof at all that when it is out of the body it can no otherwiſe act or operate. Not to meddle with the controverſie, whether it take with it hence the material ſenſitive Soul as a body afterward to act by? or whether it fabricate to it ſelf an aethereal body? or remain without any body of it ſelf? It is certain, that it was not the Body that was the Principle of Intellection and Volition here: but it was the Soul which did all in the body, but according to the mode of its preſent coexiſtence: ſeeing then that it was the Soul that did it here, why may it not alſo do it hereafter? If the Candle ſhine in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn, It can ſhine out of it, though with ſome difference: He is ſcarce rational that doubteth whether there be ſuch things as incorporeal inviſible intelligences, minds or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: And if <hi>they</hi> can act without bodies, why may not <hi>our minds?</hi> Though the Egge would die if the ſhell were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or the Hen did not ſit upon it, it doth not follow, that therefore the Chicken cannot live without a ſhell, or ſitting on. Though the Embrio and Infant muſt have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity with the mother, and be nouriſhed by her nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it doth not follow, that therefore it muſt be ſo with him, when he is born and grown up to ripeneſs of age. And when there is full proof that Souls have a future life to live, it is a folly to doubt of it, meerly becauſe we cannot conceive of the manner of their acting without a body: For he that is not deſirous to be deceived, muſt reduce things uncertain and dark, to thoſe that are clear and certain, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily: All good arguing is <hi>à notioribus,</hi> and not <hi>à minùs notis.</hi> The neerer any Being is in excellency unto God, the more there is in it which is hard to be comprehended: Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits

and Minds are excellent Beings; and therefore very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly known even by themſelves, while they are in the Lanthorn, the Shell, the Womb of fleſh. The Eye is not made to ſee its own ſight, though it may ſee in a Glaſs the Organ of its ſight: And as ſight ſeeth not ſight, nor hearing heareth not hearing, nor taſte taſteth not taſting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the act being not its own object; But yet by ſeeing other things, I am moſt certain that I ſee, and by hearing, taſting, ſmelling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I am certain that I hear, taſte, and ſmell; ſo is not the Intellect here fitted intuitively to underſtand its own act of underſtanding; but by underſtanding other objects, it under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth that it doth underſtand: (Though I confeſs, ſome learned men in this think otherwiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Intellect intuitively knoweth it ſelf.) If a man have a Watch which is kept in order, to tell him the hour of the day, though he know not the reaſon of the frame, the parts and motions, nor how to take it into pieces, and ſet it again together, yet it ſerveth his turn to the uſe he bought it for. And a Ship may carry him who is unacquainted with the workmanſhip that's in it: And ſo if a mans Soul know how to love and pleaſe its Maker, and know it <hi>ſelf morally,</hi> it attaineth its end,<note place="margin">

It is not incredible that unholy enemies of God and Holineſs, ſhould not live hereafter in the bleſſed ſight and love, and holy delightful fruition of God, no more than that a Swine is not made a King: nor that an immortal Soul, who is excluded immortal happineſs by his wilful refuſal, ſhould know his folly, and know what he hath loſt by it: nor that ſuch knowledge ſhould be his continual torment: nor is it incredible that God will not continue to him the pleaſures of whoredom, and gluttony, and drunkenneſs, and
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:59459:222"/>
ſports, and worldly wealth, or tyrannical domination, to quiet him in his loſs of heaven: nor that he will deprive him of the temporal mercies which now content him, or may afford him any delight hereafter: nor is it incredible, if his body riſe again, that it ſhall be partaker with his ſoul: nor that God, who might deprive him of his <hi>being,</hi> if he had been <hi>innocent,</hi> may make him worſe, or bring him into a condition to which he would prefer annihilation, when he is an <hi>obſtinate impenitent</hi> ſinner.

               <p n="4">4.

Or that ſuch are <hi>meet</hi> for puniſhment, and <hi>unmeet</hi> for the love and holy fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of God? When I <hi>ſee</hi> that moſt men are <hi>ungodly,</hi> and <hi>uncapable</hi> of Heaven, is it not harder to reaſon, to believe that theſe <hi>ſhall have</hi> that joy and employment of which they are uncapable, than that they ſhall have the puniſhment which agreeth with their capacity, deſert and choice?

               <p n="5">5. Can any man in his wits deny, that it is as ſure that God permitteth <hi>ſin</hi> in the world, as that the <hi>Sun</hi> ſhineth on us: yea, that he permitteth that univerſal enormous deluge of wickedneſs which the world groaneth under at this day?

And that this ſin is the ſouls calamity; and to a right judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is much worſe than puniſhment, what ever beaſtly ſenſuality may gainſay.

                  <pb n="390" facs="tcp:59459:224"/>Now this being ſo, for ought we know thoſe glorious parts may have inhabitants without <hi>any ſin</hi> or <hi>miſery</hi>; who are filled with their <hi>Makers love</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi>; and ſo are fitter to be the demonſtration of that <hi>love and goodneſs,</hi> than this ſinful mole-hill or dungeon of ignorance is. If I were ſure that God would ſave <hi>all mankind,</hi> and only leave the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi> in their damnation, and forſake no part of his Creation but <hi>their Hell,</hi> it would not be any great ſtumbling to my faith: Or if <hi>Earth</hi> were all God's creation, and I were ſure that he would condemn but one man of a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, or a million, and that only for <hi>final impenitency</hi> in the contempt of the mercy which would have ſaved him; this would be no great difficulty to my faith. Why then ſhould it be an offence to us, if God, for their final refuſal of his grace, do for ever forſake and puniſh the far greater part of this little dark and ſinful world, while he glorifieth his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity and Love abundantly upon innumerable Angels, and bleſſed Spirits, and inhabitants of thoſe more large and glorious ſeats? If you would judge of the Beneficence of a King, will you go to the Jail and the Gallows to diſcern it, or to his Palace and all the reſt of his Kingdom? And will you make a few condemned malefactors the meaſure of it? or all the reſt of his obedient proſperous ſubjects? If <hi>Hell</hi> be totally forſaken of God, as having totally forſaken him; and if Earth have made it ſelf next to Hell, and be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken as to the far greater part, becauſe that greater part hath forſaken him; as long as there may be millions of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ones above, to one of theſe forſaken ones on earth, it ſhould be no offence to any but the ſelfiſh guilty ſinner. I confeſs I rather look on it as a great demonſtration of God's holineſs and goodneſs in his Juſtice, that he will puniſh the rebellious according to his Laws; and a great demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Goodneſs in his Mercy, that he will ſave <hi>any</hi> of ſuch a rebellious world, and hath not forſaken it utterly as Hell:<note place="margin">Eunomiani minas fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turi ſupplicii &amp; ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hennae, non ad veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem, ſed ad metum prolatas aiebant. <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menopul. de Sectis.

Some men are ſo little conſcious of their huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that they think that nothing is known at all: But he that knoweth by ſenſe that <hi>He is himſelf,</hi> and that there is a <hi>World about him,</hi> and then by Reaſon that there is <hi>a God,</hi> may know alſo by Reaſon that there are other Creatures which he never ſaw: Neither <hi>ſenſe</hi> nor <hi>hiſtory</hi> told us of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the (then) unknown parts of the World; and yet it had been eaſie to gather at leaſt a ſtrong probability that there are ſuch. He that knoweth that an intelligent Nature is better than a non-intelligent, and then knoweth that God hath made man intelligent, and then thinketh what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is in matter, magnitude and glory, between the dirty body of Man with the Earth he liveth in, and thoſe vaſt and glorious Ethereal ſpaces; will quickly judge that it is a thing incredible, that God ſhould have no Creatures nobler than man, nor imprint more of his Image upon any in thoſe more glorious Regions, than on us that dwell as Snails in ſuch a ſhell; or that there ſhould be ſuch a ſtrange diſproportion in the works of God, as that a <hi>punctum</hi> of dirty earth only ſhould be poſſeſſed of the Divine or Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual nature, and the vaſt and glorious Orbs or Spaces be made only to look on, or to ſerve theſe mortal Worms: But proofs go according to the preparation of the Receivers minde: Nothing is a proof to the unprepared and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We have <hi>ſenſe</hi> by the Teleſcope to tell us, that the Moon hath parts unequal, and looketh much like the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Earth: And we have ſenſe to tell us, that there are <hi>Witches</hi> and <hi>Apparitions,</hi> and conſequently other kinde of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Wights than we. And we have Hiſtory to tell us
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:59459:225"/>
of the appearances and offices of Angels: And if there be certainly ſuch wights, our eyes may help us to conjecture at their Numbers (compared to us) by the ſpaces which they inhabit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a proportion and harmony in all the works of God: And therefore we that ſee how much the ſuperiour Orbs do in glory excell this dirty Earth, have reaſon to think that the nature of the Inhabitants is ſuited to their Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and conſequently that they are more excellent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures than we, and therefore leſs ſinfull, and therefore more happy.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yet after all this, I am neither aſſerting that all this is ſo, nor bound to prove it. I only argue, that you who are offended at the numbers that ſin and periſh, do wrangle in the dark, and ſpeak againſt you know not what. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture is enough for me, to prove that you do fooliſhly to argue againſt experience (of the ſin and miſery of the moſt) upon meer uncertainties. You will not cenſure the actions of a Prince or Generall, when your ignorance of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels maketh you uncertain of the <hi>cauſe</hi>; yea and of the <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact</hi> it ſelf. The proof lyeth on your part, and not on mine: You ſay, <hi>our doctrine is incredible,</hi> becauſe ſo few are ſaved, and yet confeſs that for ought you know, taking all together it may be many millions for one that periſheth. I think by proving you <hi>uncertain</hi> of this, I prove you fooliſh in your Infidelity. And if you will <hi>conjecture</hi> then, that there may as many of thoſe other Regions be damned, 1. You ſhew your ſelves much more harſh in your cenſures than the Chriſtians are, whoſe harſhneſs you are now reproving: Yea you conjecture this without all ground or probability. And will you ſay then, <hi>For ought I know it may be ſo,</hi> Ergo, <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity is incredible?</hi> Can a groundleſs conjecture allow any rational man ſuch a Concluſion?</p>

Chriſt hath procured a new Covenant upon which all thoſe that hear the Goſpel, ſhall again be tryed for life or death: And thoſe that hear it not, have divers means which have a tendency to their recovery, and are under undenyable Obligations to uſe thoſe means in order to their recovery: which if they do not faithfully, they periſh for their own ſin.

It was the wiſe deſign of Jeſus Chriſt, that few in compariſon ſhould be converted by his perſonal converſe or teaching, and thouſands might be ſuddenly converted upon his Aſcenſion, and the coming down of the Holy Ghoſt: Both becauſe his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion were part of the Articles to be believed, and were the chiefeſt of all his Miracles which did convert men: And therefore he would Riſe from the dead before the multitude ſhould be called: And becauſe the Spirit as it was his extraordinary Witneſs and Advocate on Earth, was to be given by him after he aſcended into glory; And he would have the World ſee, that the Converſion of men to Faith and Sanctity, was not the effect of any politick Confederacy between him and

them, but the effect of Gods Power, Light and Love: ſo that it ſhould be a great confirmation to our Faith to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that thoſe multitudes believed by the wonderfull teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and work of the Holy Ghoſt, upon the Diſciples, when Chriſt had been crucified in deſpight, who yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not before, but were his Crucifiers: It was not ſo hard nor honourable an act to believe in him; when he went about working Miracles, and ſeemed in a poſſibility to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore their temporal Kingdom, as to believe in him after he had been crucified among Malefactors.

Or ſhall he let the Devil go for true, who told <hi>Eve</hi> at firſt, <hi>You ſhall not die?</hi> and let the world ſin on with boldneſs, and laugh at his Laws, and ſay, God did but frighten us with a few words, which he never intended to fulfill? or ſhould God have damned all the world according to their deſert? If none of all this be credible to you, then certainly nothing ſhould be more credible, than that his wiſdom hath found out ſome way, to exerciſe pardoning ſaving mercy, without any injury to his governing juſtice and truth, and without expoſing his Laws and himſelf to the contempt of ſinners, or emboldening them in their ſins; even a way which ſhall vindicate his honour, and attain his ends of government, as well as if we had been all puniſhed with death and hell; and

yet may ſave us with the great advantage of honour to his mercy; and in the fulleſt demonſtration of that love and goodneſs, which may win our love.

As God doth not ſyllogize or know by our imperfect way of ratioci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but yet knoweth all things better than ſyllogizers do; ſo Chriſt hath a more high and excellent kind of Logick and Oratory, and a more apt and ſpiritual and powerful ſtyle, than <hi>Ariſtotle, Demoſthenes, Cicero</hi> or <hi>Seneca.</hi> He ſhewed not that skill in <hi>methodical healing</hi> which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> ſhewed: But he ſhewed <hi>more</hi> and <hi>better</hi> skill, when he could heal with a word, and raiſe the dead, and had the power of life and death, ſo did he bring more convincing evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence than <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and perſwaded more powerfully than <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> or <hi>Cicero.</hi> And though this kind of formal learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was below him, and below the inſpired meſſengers of his Goſpel, yet his inferiour ſervants (an <hi>Aquinas,</hi> a <hi>Scotus,</hi> an <hi>Ockam,</hi> a <hi>Scaliger,</hi> a <hi>Ramus,</hi> a <hi>Gaſſendus</hi>) do match or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel the old Philoſophers, and abundance of Chriſtians equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize or excel a <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> or <hi>Cicero,</hi> in the trueſt Oratory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His mercy had a general deſign, for the ſalvation of all ſorts and ranks of men, and therefore was not to confine it ſelf to a few trifling pedantick Logicians and Orators, or thoſe that had learned to ſpeak in their new-made words and phraſes: but he muſt ſpeak in the common Dialect of all thoſe whom he would inſtruct and ſave. As the Statutes of the land, or the Books of Phyſick, which are moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:59459:235"/>
are written in a ſtyle which is fitted to the ſubject matter, and to the Readers, and not in Syllogiſms, or terms of Logick; ſo was it more neceſſary that it ſhould be with the doctrine of ſalvation. The poor and unlearned were the greateſt number of thoſe that were to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and ſaved by the Goſpel, and ſtill to uſe the holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is greater exactneſs of true Logical method in ſome parts of the Scripture, (as <hi>e. g.</hi> in the Covenant of Faith, the Lord's Prayer, and the Decalogue) than any is to be found in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> or <hi>Cicero</hi>; though men that underſtand them not do not obſerve it. The particular Books of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture were written at ſeveral times, and on ſeveral occaſions, and not as one methodical ſyſtem, (though the Spirit that indited it, hath made it indeed a methodical ſyſtem, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to its deſign:) but if you ſaw the doctrines of all this Bible <hi>uno intuitu,</hi> in a perfect ſcheme, as it is truly intended by the Spirit of God; if you ſaw all begin the Divine Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and branch out it ſelf into the Trinity, and thence into the Trinity of Relations and Correlations, and thence into the multiplied branches of Mercy and Precepts, and all theſe accepted and improved in Duty and Gratitude by man, and returned up in Love to the bleſſed Trinity and Unity again, and all this in perfect order, proportion and harmony; you would ſee the moſt admirable perfect method that ever was ſet before you in the world: The reſemblance of it is in the circular motion of the humours and ſpirits in mans body, which are delivered on from veſſel to veſſel, and perfected in all their motions. I know there are many ſyſtems and ſchemes attempted, which ſhew not this: but that is becauſe the wiſdom of this method is ſo exceeding great, that it is yet but imperfectly underſtood: for my own part, I may ſay as thoſe that have made ſome progreſs in Anatomy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their Anceſtors, that they have no thought that they have yet diſcovered all; but rejoyce in what they have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, which ſhewed them the hopes and poſſibility of more. So I am far from a perfect comprehenſion of this wonderful method of Divinity; but I have ſeen that which truly aſſureth me, that it excelleth all the art of Philoſophers and Orators, and that it is really a moſt beautiful frame,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:59459:236"/>
and harmonious conſort; and that more is within my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect than I am yet come to.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Moreover it is Chriſt who gave all men all the gifts they have: to Logicians, Orators, Aſtronomers, Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Phyſicians, and Muſicians, &amp;c. what ever gifts are ſuited to mens juſt ends and callings, he beſtoweth on them; and to his Apoſtles he gave thoſe gifts which were moſt ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to their work: I do not undervalue the gifts of Nature or Art in any; I make it not, with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> an argument for the contempt of Muſick, <hi>Jovem neque canere, neque cytharam pulſare</hi>; but I may ſay, that as God hath greater excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in himſelf, ſo hath he greater gifts to give; and ſuch gifts as were fitteſt for the confirmation of the truth of the Goſpel, and firſt planting of the Churches he gave to the Apoſtles: and ſuch as were fit for the edifying of the Church he giveth to his Miniſters ever ſince. And ſuch as were fit for the improvement of Nature, in lower things, he gave the Philoſophers and Artiſts of the world.</p>
               <p>Object. XVII. <hi>The Scripture hath many contradictions in it, in points of Hiſtory, Chronology, and other things: Therefore it is not the word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Nothing but ignorance maketh men think ſo: underſtand once the true meaning, and allow for the errors of Printers, Tranſcribers and Tranſlators, and there will no ſuch thing be found. Young Students, in all Sciences, think their books are full of contradictions; which they can eaſily reconcile, when they come to underſtand them. Books that have been ſo oft tranſlated into ſo many Languages, and the Originals and Tranſlations ſo oft tranſcribed, may eaſily fall into ſome diſagreement between the Original and Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and the various Copies may have divers inconſiderable verbal differences. But all the world muſt needs confeſs, that in all theſe Books, there is no contradiction in any point of Doctrine, much leſs in ſuch as our ſalvation reſteth on.</p>
               <p>There are two opinions among Chriſtians about the Books of the holy Scripture: the one is, That the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are ſo entirely and perfectly the product of the Spirit's Inſpiration; that there is no word in them which is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly true. The other is, That the Spirit was promiſed and given to the Apoſtles, to enable them to preach to the world
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:59459:236"/>
the true Doctrine of the Goſpel, and to teach men to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what ever Chriſt commanded; and truly to deliver the Hiſtory of his Life and Sufferings, and Reſurrection, (which they have done accordingly.) But not to make them perfect and indefectible in every word, which they ſhould ſpeak or write, no not about Sacred things; but only in that which they delivered to the Church, as neceſſary to ſalvation, and as the Rule of Faith and Life: but every Chronological and Hiſtorical narrative, is not the Rule of Faith or Life. I think that the firſt opinion is right, and that no one errour or contradiction in any matter, can be proved in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures: yet all are agreed in this, that it is ſo of Divine Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as yet in the manner, and method, and ſtyle, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the various abilities of the Writers, and conſequently of their humane imperfections. And that it is a meer mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, which Infidels deceive themſelves by, to think that the Writings cannot be of Divine Inſpiration, unleſs the Book, in order, and ſtyle, and all other excellencies, be as perfect as God himſelf could make it: Though we ſhould grant that it is leſs Logical than <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and leſs Oratorical and Grammatical and exact in words, than <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> or <hi>Cicero,</hi> it would be no diſparagement to the certain truth of all that is in it. It doth not follow that <hi>David</hi> muſt be the ableſt man for ſtrength, nor that he muſt uſe the weapons which in themſelves are moſt excellent, if he be called of God to overcome <hi>Goliah</hi>; but rather that it may be known that he is called of God, he ſhall do it with leſs excellence of ſtrength and weapons, than other men: and ſo there may be ſome real weakneſs (not culpable) in the Writings of the ſeveral Prophets and Apoſtles in point of ſtyle and method, which ſhall ſhew the more that they are ſent of God to do great things by little humane excellency of ſpeech, (and yet that humane excellency be never the more to be diſliked, no more than a ſword, becauſe <hi>David</hi> uſed but a ſling and ſtone.) If <hi>Amos</hi> have one degree of parts, and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> another, &amp;c. God doth not equal them all by Inſpiration, but only cauſe every man to ſpeak his ſaving truth in their own language, and dialect, and ſtyle. As the body of <hi>Adam</hi> was made of the common earth, though God breathed into him a rational ſoul, (and ſo is the body of
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:59459:237"/>
every Saint, even ſuch as may partake of the infirmities of parents) ſo Scripture hath its ſtyle, and language, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods ſo from God, as we have our bodies; even ſo that there may be in them the effects of humane imperfection; and it is not ſo extraordinarily of God as the truth of the Doctrine is: All is ſo from God, as to be ſuitable to its proper ends: but the <hi>body</hi> of Scripture is not ſo extraordinarily from him, as the <hi>ſoul</hi> of it is; as if it were the moſt excellent and exact in every kind of ornament and perfection. The <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> is the <hi>ſoul</hi> of the Scripture, together with the <hi>power</hi> manifeſted in it: and in theſe it doth indeed excel. So that variety of gifts in the Prophets and Apoſtles, may cauſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of ſtyle and other accidental excellencies in the <hi>parts</hi> of the holy Scriptures, and yet all theſe parts be animated with one ſoul of <hi>Power, Truth</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But thoſe men who think that theſe humane imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Writers do extend further, and may appear in ſome by-paſſages of Chronologies or Hiſtory, which are no proper part of the Rule of Faith and Life, do not hereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Chriſtian cauſe. For God might enable his Apoſtles to an infallible recording and preaching of the Goſpel, even all things neceſſary to ſalvation, though he had not made them infallible in every by-paſſage and circumſtance, no more than they were indefectible in life.</p>
               <p>As for them that ſay, <hi>I can believe no man in any thing, who is miſtaken in one thing, (at leaſt as infallible)</hi> they ſpeak againſt common ſenſe and reaſon: for a man may be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly acquainted with ſome things, who is not ſo in all: An Hiſtorian may infallibly acquaint me, that there was a Fight at <hi>Lepanto,</hi> at <hi>Edge-hill,</hi> at <hi>York,</hi> at <hi>Naſeby</hi>; or an Inſurrection and Maſſacre in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> &amp;c. who cannot tell me all the circumſtances of it: or he may infallibly tell men of the late Fire which conſumed <hi>London,</hi> though he cannot tell juſt whoſe houſes were burnt, and may miſtake about the Cauſers of it, and the circumſtances. A Lawyer may infallibly tell you whether your cauſe be good or bad, in the main, who yet may miſreport ſome circumſtances in the opening of it. A Phyſician, in his Hiſtorical obſervations, may partly erre as an Hiſtorian in ſome circumſtances, &amp; yet be infallible as a Phyſician in ſome plain caſes which belong directly to his
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:59459:237"/>
Art. I do not believe that any man can prove the leaſt error in the holy Scripture in any point, according to its true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and meaning: but if he could, the Goſpel, as a Rule of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> in things neceſſary to ſalvation, might be nevertheleſs proved infallible by all the evidence before given.</p>

               <p>Obj. XXI. <hi>Chriſt ſeemeth to calculate all his Precepts to the poorer ſort of peoples ſtate, as if he had never hoped that Kings and Nobles would be Chriſtians: If men think as hardly of the Rich as he doth, and take them to be ſo bad, and their ſalvation ſo difficult, how will they ever honour their Kings and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours? And if all men muſt ſuffer ſuch as abuſe and injure them, and muſt turn the other cheek to him that ſtriketh them, and give him their Coat who taketh away their Cloak, what uſe will there be for Magiſtrates and Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Chriſt fitteth his Precepts to the benefit of all men: But in ſo doing he muſt needs tell them of the danger of over-loving this World, as being the moſt mortal ſin which he came to cure: And he muſt needs tell them what a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous temptation a fleſh-pleaſing proſperous ſtate is to the moſt, to entice them to this pernicious ſin. Had he ſilenced ſuch neceſſary truths as theſe, he could not have been their Saviour: For how ſhould he ſave them from ſin, if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the evil and the danger of it? If the corruption of mans Nature be ſo great, that Riches and Honours, and Pleaſures are ordinarily made the occaſions of mens perdition, muſt Chriſt be Chriſt and never tell them of it? And is he to be blamed for telling them the truth? or they rather who create theſe difficulties and dangers to themſelves? Chriſt teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth men to honour a Sacred Office, ſuch as Magiſtracy is, without honouring Vice, or betraying ſinners by concealing their temptations. And to holy faithfull Rulers he teacheth us, to give a double honour. They that will prove, that moſt of the great and wealthy ſhall be ſaved, muſt prove firſt that moſt of them are godly, and mortified, heavenly perſons: And the fit proof of that muſt be by ſhewing us the men that are ſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Laws of Chriſt require every Soul to be ſubject to the higher Powers, and not reſiſt; and this not only for fear of their wrath, but for Conſcience ſake; and to pay ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:59459:239"/>
and cuſtom to all whom it is due to. And what more can be deſired for the ſupport of Government.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yea, nothing more tendeth to the comfort and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Governours, than the obedience of thoſe Precepts of patience and peace, which the Objection quarrelleth with. If Subjects would love each other as themſelves, and forgive injuries, and love their enemies, what could be more joyfull to a faithfull Governour? And to the Queſtion, <hi>What uſe would there be then of Judicatures?</hi> I anſwer, They would be uſefull to good men for their protection againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of the bad; where we are but Defendants; And alſo in Caſes where it is not want of <hi>Love,</hi> but of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> which cauſeth the Controverſie, and when no fit arbitration can decide it: And they will be uſefull among contentious perſons: For all men are not true Believers: The moſt will be (ordinarily) the worſt: As we will not be Fornicators, Thieves, Perjured, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> leſt you ſhould ſay, To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is the Law againſt ſuch offenders? ſo we will not be revengefull and contentious, leſt you ſhould ſay, To what end are Judicatures? The Law is to <hi>prevent</hi> offences by threatned penalties: And that is the happyeſt Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, where the Law doth moſt without the Judge, and where Judicatures have leaſt employment: For there is none to be expected on Earth ſo happy, where meer LOVE (of Virtue and of one another) will prevent the uſe both of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Laws and Judicatures.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And it is but ſelfiſhneſs, and contentiouſneſs, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate revenge which Chriſt forbiddeth, and not the neceſſary defence or vindication of any Talent which God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to our truſt, ſo it be with the preſervation of brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Love and Peace.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And that Chriſt foreknew what Princes and States would be converted to the Faith, is manifeſt, 1. In all his Prophets, who have foretold it (that Kings ſhall be our Nurſing Fathers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) 2. In that Chriſt propheſied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that when he was lifted up, he would draw all men to him. 3.

The certainty cannot exceed the weakeſt of the Premiſes: And this is the argument: [The Doctrine which was atteſted by Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles is of God: But the Chriſtian Doctrine was atteſted by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles: Proved: The ſpectators averred it to others, who have tranſmitted the Teſtimony down to us.] So that you are no ſurer of the Doctrine than of the Miracles, and no ſurer of the Miracles than of the Humane Teſtimony which hath delivered it to you.</hi>

Peruſe it impartially, and you will finde all this in what is ſaid.</p>
               <p>What would men rather deſire to atteſt the veracity of a Meſſenger from Heaven, than Miracles: Evident, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled; multiplyed miracles? And muſt this meſſenger live in every age, and go into every Land, to do theſe Miracles in the preſence of every living Soul? If not, how would thoſe that live in another Land or Age, be brought to the knowledge of them, but by the teſtimony of thoſe that ſaw them? And how would you have ſuch teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies better confirmed, than by multiplyed miracles, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in a way which cannot poſſibly deceive? and fully and perpetually atteſted by the Spirit of effectual ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

on Believers? It is an unreaſonable arrogancy to tell our Maker, that we will not believe any miracles which he doth, by whomſoever or howſoever witneſſed, unleſs we ſee them our ſelves with our own eyes; and ſo they be made as common as the ſhining of the Sun; (and then we ſhould contemn them as of no validity.)</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is the Devils way of oppoſing Chriſt, to do it by apiſh imitation: So would the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Magicians have diſcredited the miracles of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And Chriſtianity conſiſteth not of any <hi>words</hi> which another may not ſpeak, or any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of devotion, or geſture, or formality, which no man elſe can do. There are no words which ſeem to ſignifie a rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (which are not miraculous) but they may be counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited: But yet as a Statuary or Painter may be known from a Creator, and a Statue from a Man, ſo may the Devils imitations and fictions from the evidences of Chriſtianity which he would imitate. Look through the four parts of the teſtimony of the Spirit, and you may ſee this to be ſo. 1. What antecedent Propheſies have foretold us of theſe mens actions? 2. What frame of Holy doctrine do they deliver bearing the Image of God, beſides ſo much of Chriſts own doctrine as they acknowledge? 3 And what Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are with any probability pretended to be done by any of them (unleſs you mean any Preacher of Chriſtianity in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of that common Chriſtian Faith.) There are no Quakers or other Fanaticks among us, that I can hear of, who pretend to miracles: In their firſt ariſing, two or three of them were raiſed to a confidence that they had the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical gift of the Spirit, and ſhould ſpeak with unlearnt Languages, and heal the ſick, and raiſe the dead; but they failed in the performance, and made themſelves the common ſcorn, by the vanity of their attempts: Not one of them that ever ſpake a word of any Language but what he had learnt; nor one that cured any diſeaſe by Miracle: One of them at <hi>Worceſter</hi> half famiſhed, and then (as is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable) drown'd himſelf; and a woman that was their Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der undertook to raiſe him from the dead; But ſhe ſpake to him as the Prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi> to their God, that could not hear; and made but matter of laughter and pity to thoſe that heard of it. There hath not been in <hi>England</hi> in our dayes, that ever I could hear of, either by Jeſuit, Fryer, Quaker, or other Fanatick, ſo much as a handſome Cheat, reſembling a Miracle, which the People might not eaſily ſee, to be a tranſparent foolery. But many <hi>wonders</hi> I have known done at the earneſt Prayers of humble Chriſtians. So that he who ſhall compare the Fryers and Fanaticks with the Apoſtles
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:59459:243"/>
and other Diſciples of Chriſt, (whoſe Miracles were ſuch as afore-deſcribed) will ſee that the Devils apiſh deſign, though it may cheat forſaken Souls into infidelity, is ſuch as may confirm the faith of ſober men. 4. And what <hi>Spirit of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification</hi> doth accompany any of their peculiar doctrines? If any of them do any good in the World, it is only by the doctrine of Chriſt: But for their <hi>own doctrines,</hi> what do they but cheat men and draw the ſimple into ſin? A Frier by his <hi>own doctrine</hi> may draw men to ſome foppery or ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous ceremony, or ſubjection to that Clergy, whoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diligence conſiſteth in <hi>ſtriving who ſhall be greateſt, and Lord it over the inheritance of Chriſt, and rule them by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, and not willingly.</hi> A Quaker by his <hi>own doctrine</hi> may teach men to caſt away their bands, and cuffs, and points, and hat-bands, and to ſay <hi>[Thou]</hi> inſtead of <hi>[You]</hi> and to <hi>put off their hats to no men,</hi> and to be the publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate <hi>revilers</hi> of the <hi>holieſt</hi> and <hi>ableſt</hi> Preachers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and the beſt of the people, and with truculent coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances to rail at God's ſervants in a horrid abuſe of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-terms. If this <hi>image</hi> and <hi>work</hi> of the Devil were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the <hi>image</hi> and <hi>work</hi> of God, it were ſome teſtimony of the verity of their doctrine. And yet even theſe Sects do but like a flaſh of lightning, appear for a moment, and are ſuddenly extinct, and ſome other ſect or fraternity ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth them. The Quakers already recant moſt of thoſe rigidities, on which at firſt they laid out their chiefeſt zeal. If a flaſh of ſuch lightning, or a ſquib, or glow-worm, be argument ſufficient to prove that there is no other Sun, then Friers and Fanaticks, as oft as they are mad, may warrant you to believe that all men are ſo too, even Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Object. IV. <hi>But the power of cheaters, and credulity of the vulgar is almoſt incredible. The great number of Papiſts who believe their holy cheats, and the greater number of Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, who believe in a moſt ſottiſh ignorant deceiver, do tell us what a folly it is to believe for company.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is ſufficiently anſwered already: no doubt but cheaters may do much with the ignorant and credulous mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude: but doth it follow thence, that there is nothing certain in the world? None of theſe were ever ſo ſucceſsful
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:59459:244"/>
in deceiving, as to make men of ſound underſtanding and ſenſes believe, that they ſaw the lame, and blind, and deaf, and ſick, and lunatick, healed, and the dead raiſed, and that they themſelves performed the like, and that they ſaw and were inſtructed by one riſen from the dead, when there was no ſuch thing; or that abundance of men did ſpeak in many unlearn'd tongues, and heal the lame, and blind, and ſick, and raiſe the dead; and this for many years together, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Countries, before many Congregations; and that they procured the ſame ſpirit to thoſe that believed them, to do the like; and that by this means they planted Churches of ſuch believers through the world: Who is it that hath been ſuch a ſucceſsful deceiver?</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> they do but believe by education and humane authority, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> was a great Prophet, whoſe ſword, and not his miracles, hath made his ſect ſo ſtrong, that they dare not ſpeak againſt it. Thoſe few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles which he pretendeth to, are ridiculous unproved dreams. And if there be found a people in the world, that by a Tyrants power may be ſo barbarouſly educated as to believe any foppery, how fooliſh and vain ſoever be the report, it doth not follow, that full and unqueſtionable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is not to be believed.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But what can be imagined by the wit of man more certain than ſenſe? when it is ſound ſenſes, and all the ſenſes, and all mens ſenſes, upon an object ſuitable and near, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient media,</hi>

                  <hi>&amp;c. And yet in the point of Tranſubſtantiation, it is not a few fools, but Princes, Popes, Prelates, Paſtors, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, and the moſt profound and ſubtil School-men, with whole Kingdoms of People of all ſorts, who believe that all theſe ſenſes are deceived, both other mens and their own.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> And yet a <hi>nihil ſcitur vel certum eſt,</hi> is an inhumane fooliſh conſequence of all this; nor hath it any force againſt the certainty of the Scripture Miracles. For, 1. All this is not a believing that <hi>poſitively they ſee, and feel, and taſte, and hear,</hi> that which indeed they do not: but it is a believing that they <hi>do not</hi> ſee, and hear, and feel, and taſte, that which indeed they <hi>do</hi>: they are made believe that there is <hi>no Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> when indeed there <hi>is.</hi> But this is no
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:59459:244"/>
deluſion of the <hi>ſenſes,</hi> but of the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> denying cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to the ſenſe: If you had proved that all theſe Princes, Lords, Prelates and People, had verily thought that they <hi>had ſeen, and taſted, and felt Bread and Wine,</hi> when it was not ſo, then you might have carried the cauſe of unbelief; but upon no other terms (which is to be remarked) than by proving that <hi>nothing in all the world is certain or credible.</hi> For all the certainty of the Intellect is ſo far founded in the certainty of ſenſe, and reſolved into it, in this life, that it cannot poſſibly go beyond it. If you ſuppoſe not <hi>all mens ſound conſenting ſenſes</hi> to have as much infallibility, as man is capable of in this life, for the ordinary conduct of his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you muſt grant that there is no further infallibility to be had by any natural way. For he that is not certain of the infallibility of ſuch <hi>conſenting ſenſes,</hi> is not certain that ever there was a Bible, a Pope, a Prieſt, a Man, a Council, a Church, a World, or any thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And for my part I do not believe, that all theſe that you mention do really believe, that their ſenſes are deceived: (though if they did, its nothing to our caſe.) Moſt of them are frightned for carnal preſervation into a ſilencing of their belief: others know not what Tranſubſtantiation meaneth. Many are cheated by the Prieſts changing the queſtion, and when they are about to conſider, <hi>Whether all our ſenſes be certain that this is Bread and Wine?</hi> they are made believe that the queſtion is, <hi>Whether our ſenſes are certain of the Negative, that here is not the real Body and Bloud of Chriſt.</hi> And they are taught to believe, that ſenſe is not deceived about the <hi>Accidents,</hi> which they call the <hi>Species,</hi>

Do you know what is meant by the <hi>reſolution</hi> and <hi>grounds</hi> of faith? Faith is the believing of a concluſion, which hath two premiſes to infer and prove it: and there muſt be more argumentation for the proof of ſuch premiſes, and faith in its ſeveral reſpects and dependances, may be ſaid to be <hi>reſolved</hi> into more things than one, even into every one of theſe.

But whether they are animated or no, is to us utterly uncertain: and if we were ſure they were, yet we are ſure that they are the products of the Will of the Eternal Being: And he that made both them and us, is the Governour of them and us: and therefore as long as he hath no way taught us to call them Gods, nor to pray to them, nor offer them any ſacrifice, as being uncertain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they underſtand what we do or ſay; nor hath any way revealed that this is his will, nay, and hath expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden us to do ſo; Reaſon forbiddeth us to do any more,

all doubt to thoſe that are impartial Judges. How few of all the Roman Heathen Emperours was there, that died not by ſubjects hands? Among the <hi>Athenians,</hi> a King and a Tyrant were words too often of the ſame ſignificant. How hateful the name of a King was among the <hi>Romans,</hi> is well known. How few even of their moſt renowned Orators and Philoſophers were not put to death, upon accuſation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of ſome Prince: (<hi>Brutus, Cicero, Cato, Seneca,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>Cicero, pro Milone,</hi> can ſay, [<hi>Non ſe obſtrinxit ſcelere, ſiquis Tyrannum occidat; quamvis familiarem</hi> (which <hi>Brutus</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed on <hi>Caeſar</hi>) Et <hi>Tuſcul.</hi> 5. <hi>Nulla nobis cum Tyrannis ſocietas eſt, neque eſt contra naturam ſpoliare eum quem honeſtum eſt necare.</hi> Much more ſuch dangerous doctrine hath <hi>Cicero.

How things were uſed to be carried at <hi>Rome,</hi> you may perceive by theſe words of <hi>Lampridius,</hi> who wondring that <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> was killed no ſooner, but permitted three years, ſaith, [<hi>Mirum fortaſſe cuipiam videatur,</hi> Conſtantine <hi>venerabilis, quod haec clades quam retuli loco Principum fuerit, &amp; quidem propè triennio, ita ut nemo inventus fuerit qui iſtum à gubernaculis</hi> Romanae <hi>Majeſtatis abduceret; cum</hi> Neroni, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellio, Caligulae, <hi>coeteriſque hujuſmodi nunquam tyrannicida defuerit.</hi>

               <p>We do not deny but there are three ſorts of Chriſtians that are too much for the reſiſting and deſtroying of bad Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:59459:247"/>
and ſpeak much as theſe Heathens did:<note place="margin">Imperatorem neceſſe eſt ut ſuſpiciamus, ut enim quem Dominus noſter elegit: ut me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rito dixerim, Noſter eſt magis <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ut à Deo noſtro conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus. <hi>Tertul. Apol. c.</hi> 33.</note> The one ſort are ſome over-philoſophical learned men, who have more converſed with the antient <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> than with Chriſtian Writers. Such was honeſt <hi>Petrarch,</hi> who pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilouſly ſaith, <hi>Et ſane ſi vel unum Patria civem bonum habeat, malum Dominum diutius non habebit.</hi> The ſecond ſort are the faction of the Pope, who are led to it by meer intereſt, their Religion and Clergy-intereſt both conſiſt in an univerſal Kingdom or Government over Kings and all the Chriſtian world: it is no wonder therefore to find them induſtrious to ſubject all powers to themſelves. The third ſort are here and there a few Enthuſiaſts, or fanatical deluded perſons, who are like the turbulent Zealots among the <hi>Jews,</hi> who occaſioned the combuſtions and bloud-ſhed at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> about the time of its deſtruction: who are but the ignoranter ſort of Chriſtians, miſled by pretences of zeal or inſpiration, for want of judgment, ſtayedneſs and experience. And this is <hi>vitium perſonae,</hi> and is no diſparagement to Chriſt. As for any doctrines of rebellion or ſedition, or depoſing and killing excommunicate Kings, there is none more condemneth them than Chriſt. It is not every proud or covetous perſon that maketh the name of Chriſtianity or Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a cloak for his uſurpation, ambition or worldlineſs, that we are pleading for:<note place="margin">

It is not flattering hypocrites that I am to defend, let them bear their ſhame; but it is the doctrine of Chriſt which is the thing in queſtion.

But if it teach men patiently to ſuffer, rather than rebelliouſly

Chriſtianity is but <hi>One,</hi> and eaſily known; and all Chriſtians do indeed hold this as certain, by common agreement and conſent, they differ not at all about that which I am pleading for: there may be a difference, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> or the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> be the greater, or whether one Biſhop muſt rule over all, and ſuch like matters of carnal quarrel; but there is no difference whether Chriſt be the Saviour of the world, or whether all his doctrine be infallibly true: and the more they quarrel about their perſonal intereſts and by-opinions, the moſt valid is their teſtimony in the things wherein they all agree: it is not thoſe things which they differ about, that I am now pleading for, or perſwading any to embrace; but thoſe wherein they all conſent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But if they agree not in all the <hi>Integrals</hi> of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, it is no wonder, nor inferreth any more than that they are not all <hi>perfect</hi> in the knowledge of ſuch high and myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

things: and when no man underſtandeth all that is in <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> nor no two interpreters of him agree in every expoſition, no, nor any two men in all the world agree in every opinion, who hold any thing of their own, what wonder if Chriſtians differ in many points of difficulty.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But their differences are nothing in compariſon of the Heathen Philoſophers, who were of ſo many minds and ways, that there was ſcarce any coherence among them, nor many things which they could ever agree in.</p>

The very differences of abundance of honeſt Chriſtians, is occaſioned by their earneſt deſire to pleaſe God, and do nothing but what is juſt and right, and their high eſteem of piety and honeſty, while the imperfection of their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments keepeth them from knowing in all things, what it is which indeed is that good and righteous way which they ſhould take. If children do differ and fall out, if it be but in ſtriving who ſhall do beſt, and pleaſe their father, it is the more excuſable: enemies do not ſo: ideots fall not out in School-diſputes or Philoſophical controverſies: ſwine will not fall out for gold or jewels, if they be caſt before them in the ſtreets: but it's like that <hi>men</hi> may.</p>

<pb n="439" facs="tcp:59459:249"/>
inſomuch as among the Turkiſh Mahometans, and the Indian Banians, the wickedneſs of Chriſtians is the grand cauſe that they abhor Chriſtianity, and it keepeth out your Religion from moſt Nations of the earth: ſo that it is a proverb among them, when any is ſuſpected of treachery, What, do you think I am a Chriſtian?

Every man knoweth, that the vulgar rabble, who indeed are of no Religion, will ſeem to be of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which is moſt for their worldly advantage, or elſe which their Anceſtors and Cuſtom have delivered to them: And who can expect that ſuch ſhould live as Chriſtians, who are no Chriſtians? You may as well blame men, becauſe Images do not labour, and are not learned, wiſe and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. We never took all for Chriſtians indeed, who for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal intereſt, or cuſtom, or tradition, take up the bare name, and deſire to be called Chriſtians: rebels may affect the name of loyal ſubjects: and thieves and robbers, the name of true and honeſt men: Shall loyalty, truth and honeſty therefore be judged of by ſuch as them? Nothing can be more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous, than to judge of Chriſtianity by thoſe hypocrites, whom Chriſt hath told us ſhall be condemned to the ſoreſt puniſhment, and whom he hateth above all ſorts of ſinners. What if <hi>Julian, Celſus, Porphyry,</hi> or any of theſe objectors, ſhould call themſelves Chriſtians, and live in drunkenneſs, cruelty, perjury or deceit, is it any reaſon that Chriſt ſhould be reproached for their crimes? Chriſtianity is not a dead opinion or name, but an active heavenly principle, renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and governing heart and life. I have before ſhewed what <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is.</p>

And in the Dominions of the <hi>Moſcovite,</hi> tyranny hath ſet up a jealouſie of the Goſpel, and ſuppreſſed Preaching, for fear leſt Preachers ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the Emperour.

And that there are thouſands and millions of humble, holy, faithful Chriſtians in the world, is a truth which nothing but ignorance or malice can deny. 2. Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites are no true Chriſtians, what zeal ſoever they pretend: There is a zeal for <hi>ſelf</hi> and <hi>intereſt,</hi> which is oft masked with the name of zeal for Chriſt. It is not the <hi>ſeeming,</hi> but the <hi>real</hi> Chriſtian, which we have to juſtifie. 3. It is commonly a few young unexperienc'd novices, which are tempted into diſorders. But Chriſt will bring them to repentance for all, before he will forgive and ſave them. Look into the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and ſee whether it do not diſown and contradict every fault, both great and ſmall, which ever you knew any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian commit? If it do, (as viſibly it doth) why muſt Chriſt be blamed for our faults, when he is condemning them, and reproving us, and curing us of them?</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The greater number of the world are not Kings nor Philoſophers, nor wiſe nor good men: and yet that is no diſparagement to Kings, or learned, or good men. 2. The moſt of the world do not know what Chriſtianity is, nor ever heard the reaſons of it; and therefore no wonder if they are not Chriſtians. And if the moſt of the world be ignorant and carnal, and ſuch as have ſubjected their reaſon to their luſts, no wonder if they are not wiſe. 3. There is no where in the world ſo much learning as among the Chriſtians, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience puts that paſt diſpute with thoſe, that have any true knowledge of the world. Mahomitaniſm cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the light of learning, and therefore doth ſuppreſs or ſleight it. The old Greeks and Romans had much learning, which did but prepare for the reception of Chriſtianity, at whoſe ſervice it hath continued ever ſince. But barbarous ignorance hath over ſpread almoſt all the reſt of the world: even the learning of the <hi>Chinenſes</hi> and the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> of the Eaſt, is but childiſhneſs and dotage, in compariſon of the learning of the preſent Chriſtians.</p>

               <p>I Have anſwered the objections againſt Chriſtianity, but have not removed the chiefeſt impediments: for <hi>reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitur ad modum recipientis</hi>; the grand impediments are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, even the incapacity, or indiſpoſition, or frowardneſs of the perſons that ſhould believe. It is not every head and heart that is fit for heavenly truth and work. I will next therefore tell you what conditions Reaſon it ſelf will require of them that would not be deceived: that ſo you may not lay that blame on Chriſt, if you be infidels, which belongeth only to your ſelves.</p>

               <p>For ill will cannot eaſily believe well. Malice and partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity will blind the ſtrongeſt wits, and hide the force of the plaineſt evidence.</p>
               <p>Con. 2. <hi>Drown not the love of truth in a vitious fleſhly heart and life; and forfeit not the light of ſupernatural revelation, by wilful ſinning againſt natural light, and debauching your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, by abuſing the knowledge which already you have.</hi>

Deſpighting truth, and enſlaving reaſon, and turning a man into a beaſt, is not the way to heavenly illumination.</p>

And it is an exceeding great cauſe of the multiplying of Infidels, that moſt men are dull or idle drones, and unacquainted with the common natural truths, which muſt give light to Chriſtianity, and prepare men to receive it. And they think to know what is in Heaven before they will learn what they are themſelves, and what it is to be a man.</p>

               <p>For my own part, I am aſſured, if it were not for the Chriſtian doctrine, my heart and life would be much worſe than it is; though I had read <hi>Epictetus, Arrian, Plato, Plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus, Jamblichus, Proclus, Seneca, Cicero, Plutarch,</hi> every word: and thoſe few of my neighbourhood, who have fallen off to infidelity, have at once fallen to debauchery, and abuſe of their neareſt relations, and differed as much in their lives from what they were before in their profeſſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, (though unſound) as a leprous body differeth from one in comelineſs and health.</p>
               <p>Cond. 13. <hi>Be well acquainted (if poſſible) with Church-Hiſtory, that you may underſtand by what Tradition Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity hath deſcended to us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For he that knoweth nothing but what he hath ſeen, or receiveth a Bible, or the Creed, without knowing any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whence and which way it cometh to us, is greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantaged as to the reception of the faith.</p>
               <p>Cond. 14. <hi>In all your reading of the holy Scriptures, allow ſtill for your ignorance in the languages, proverbs, cuſtoms, and circumſtances, which are needful to the underſtanding of particular Texts: and when difficulties ſtop you, be ſure that no ſuch ignorance remain the cauſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He that will but read <hi>Brugenſis, Grotius, Hammond,</hi> and many other that open ſuch phraſes and circumſtances, with Topographers, and <hi>Bochartus,</hi> and ſuch others as write of the Animals, Utenſils, and other circumſtances of thoſe times, will ſee what groſs errors the opening of ſome one word or phraſe may deliver the Reader from.</p>

               </p>
               <p>It ſeduceth many to infidelity to imagine, that if Scripture be the word of God, it muſt needs be moſt perfect in every accident and mode; which were never intended to be part of its perfection. Whereas God did purpoſely make uſe of
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:59459:256"/>
thoſe men, and of that ſtyle and manner of expreſſion, which was defective in ſome points of <hi>natural excellency,</hi> that ſo the <hi>ſupernatural excellency</hi> might be the more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. As Chriſt cured the blind with clay and ſpittle, and <hi>David</hi> ſlew <hi>Goliah</hi> with a ſling. The excellency of the means muſt be eſtimated by its aptitude to its end.</p>
               <p>Cond. 16. <hi>If you ſee the evidences of the truth of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the whole, let that ſuffice you for the belief of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts, when you ſee not the true anſwer to particular exceptions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you ſee it ſoundly proved, that Chriſt is the Meſſenger of the Father, and that his word is true, and that the holy Scripture is his word; this is enough to quiet any ſober mind, when it cannot confute every particular objection: or elſe no man ſhould ever hold faſt any thing in the world; if he muſt let all go after the fulleſt proof, upon every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception which he cannot anſwer. The inference is ſure. If the whole be true, the parts are true.</p>
               <p>Cond. 17. <hi>Obſerve well the many effects of Angels miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the evidences of a communion between us and the ſpirits of the unſeen world: for this will much facilitate your belief.</hi>

               <p>Cond. 18. <hi>Over-look not the plain evidences of the Apparitions, Witches, and wonderful events which fall out in the times and places where you live: and what reflections they have upon the Chriſtian cauſe.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Cond. 20. <hi>Be well ſtudied at home, about the capacity, uſe and tendency of all your faculties; and you will find that your very nature pointeth you up to another life, and is made only to be happy in that knowledge, love and fruition of God, which the Goſpel moſt effectually leads you to.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Cond. 21. <hi>Mark well the propheſies of Chriſt himſelf, both of the deſtruction of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and the ſucceſſes of his Apoſtles in the world, &amp;c. and mark how exactly they are all fulfilled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Cond. 22. <hi>Let no pretence of humility tempt you to debaſe humane nature below its proper excellency; leſt thence you be tempted to think it uncapable of the everlaſting ſight and fruition of God.</hi>

                  <pb n="449" facs="tcp:59459:256"/>The devils way of deſtroying is oftentimes by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing. The proud devil will help you to be very humble, and help you to deny the excellency of reaſon and natural free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, and all ſupernatural inclinations, when he can make uſe of it to perſwade you, that man is but a ſubtil ſort of bruit, and hath a ſoul but gradually different from ſenſitives, and ſo is not made for another life.</p>
               <p>Cond. 23. <hi>Yet come to Chriſt as humble learners, and not as arrogant ſelf-conceited cenſurers: and think not that you are capable of underſtanding every thing as ſoon as you hear it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Cond. 24. <hi>Judge not of the main cauſe of Chriſtianity, or of particular texts or points, by ſudden haſty thoughts and glances; as if it were a buſineſs to be curſorily done: but allow it your moſt deliberate ſober ſtudies, your moſt diligent labour, and ſuch time and patience, as reaſon may tell you are neceſſary to a learner in ſo great a cauſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Cond. 25. <hi>Call not ſo great a matter to the trial in a caſe of melancholy and natural incapacity; but ſtay till you are fitter to perform the ſearch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is one of the common cheats of Satan, to perſwade poor weak, and melancholy perſons, that have but half the uſe of their underſtandings, to go then to try the Chriſtian Religion, when they can ſcarce caſt up an intricate account, nor are fit to judge of any great and difficult thing. And then he hath an advantage to confound them, and fill them with blaſphemous and unbelieving thoughts; and if not to ſhake their habitual faith, yet greatly to perplex them, and diſturb their peace. The ſoundeſt wit and moſt compoſed, is fitteſt for ſo great a task.</p>
               <p>Cond. 26. <hi>When upon ſober trial you have diſcerned the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of the Chriſtian verity, record what you have found true: and judge not the next time againſt thoſe evidences, till you have equal opportunity for a full conſideration of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this caſe the Tempter much abuſeth many injudicious ſouls: when by good advice and ſobereſt meditation, they have ſeen the evidence of truth in ſatisfying clearneſs, he will after ſurpriſe them, when their minds are darker, or their thoughts more ſcattered, or the former evidence is out of mind, and puſh them on ſuddenly then to judge of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of immortality, and of the Chriſtian cauſe, that what he
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:59459:257"/>
cannot get by truth of argument, he may get by the inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of the diſputant: As if a man that once ſaw a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſome miles diſtant from him, in a clear day, ſhould be tempted to believe that he was deceived, becauſe he ſeeth it not in a miſty day, or when he is in a valley, or within the houſe: Or as if a man that in many days hard ſtudy, hath caſt up an intricate large account, and ſet it right under his hand, ſhould be called ſuddenly to give up the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count anew, without looking on that which he before caſt up; when as if his firſt account be loſt, he muſt have equal time, and helps, and fitneſs, before he can ſet it as right again. Take it not therefore as any diſparagement to the Chriſtian truth, if you cannot on a ſudden give your ſelves ſo ſatisfactory an account of it, as formerly in more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and by greater ſtudies you have done.</p>
               <p>Cond. 27. <hi>Gratifie not Satan ſo much, as to queſtion well reſolved points, as oft as he will move you to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though you muſt prove all things, till, as learning, you come to underſtand them in their proper evidence, time and order; yet you muſt record and hold faſt that which you <hi>have proved,</hi> and not ſuffer the devil to put you to the anſwer of one and the ſame queſtion over and over, as often as he pleaſe: this is to give him our time, and to admit him to debate his cauſe with us by temptation, as frequently as he will: which you would not allow to a ruffian to the debauching of your wife or ſervants: and you provoke God to give you up to errour, when no reſolution will ſerve your turn. After juſt reſolution, the tempter is to be rejected and not diſputed with; as a troubleſome fellow that would interrupt us in our work.</p>
               <p>Cond. 28. <hi>Where you find your own underſtandings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, have recourſe for help to ſome truly wiſe judicious Divine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not to every weak Chriſtian, nor unskilful Miniſter, who is not well grounded in his own Religion: but to thoſe that have throughly ſtudied it themſelves: you may meet with many difficulties in Theology, and in the Text, which you think can never be well ſolved, which are nothing to them that underſtand the thing. No Novice in the ſtudy of Logick, Aſtronomy, Geometry, or any Art or Science, will
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:59459:257"/>
think that every difficulty that he meeteth with, doth prove that his Author was deceived, unleſs he be able to reſolve it of himſelf: but he will ask his Tutor, or ſome one verſed in thoſe matters to reſolve it: and then he will ſee that his ignorance was the cauſe of all his doubts.</p>
               <p>Cond. 29. <hi>Labour faithfully to receive all holy truths with a practical intent, and to work them on your hearts according to their nature, weight and uſe. For the doctrine of Chriſtianity is</hi> ſcientia affectiva practica; <hi>a doctrine for Head, Heart and Life. And if that which is made for the Heart, be not admitted to the Heart, and rooted there, it is half rejected while it ſeemeth received, and is not in its proper place and ſoil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you are yet in doubt of any of the ſupernatural Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, admit thoſe truths to your hearts which you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of: elſe you are falſe to them and to your ſelves, and forfeit all further helps of grace.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>This is but a trick of deceit to engage the affections, when you want arguments to convince the judgment:</hi> Perit omne judicium cum res tranſit in affectum.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> When the affection is inordinate, and over-runs the judgment, this ſaying hath ſome truth; but it is moſt falſe as of <hi>ordinate affections</hi> which follow ſound judgment. For by ſuſcitation of the faculties, ſuch affections greatly <hi>help</hi> the judgment:<note place="margin">Dubitamus, ambigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, neceſſe quod di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citut plenum fidei ſuſpicam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If your wife be taught that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal love is due to her husband; and your child, that filial love and reverence is due to his father; ſuch affections will not blind their judgments; but contrarily they do not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely receive theſe precepts, if they let them not into the heart, and anſwer them not with theſe affections.</p>
               <p>And here is the great difference between the faith of an honeſt ſanctified Plowman, and of a carnal unſanctified Lord or Doctor: the one openeth his <hi>heart</hi> to the doctrine which he receiveth, and faithfully admitteth it to its proper work, and ſo embraceth it <hi>practically, and in love</hi>; and therefore holdeth it faſt as a <hi>radicated experienced truth,</hi> when he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not anſwer all cavils that are brought againſt it. The other ſuperficially receiveth it into the <hi>brain,</hi> by meer ſpeculation; and treacherouſly ſhuts up his heart againſt it, and never
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:59459:258"/>
gave it real rooting; and therefore in the time of trial loſeth that unſound ſuperficial belief which he hath. God bleſſeth his word to the heart that honeſtly and practically receiveth it, rather than to him that impriſoneth it in unrighteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Cond. 30. <hi>Laſtly, if yet any doubts remain, bethink you which is the ſureſt ſide, which you may follow with leaſt danger, and where you are certain to undergo the ſmalleſt l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is pity that any ſhould heſitate in a matter of ſuch evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and weight, and ſhould think with any doubtfulneſs, of Chriſtianity as an uncertain thing: But yet true Believers may have cauſe to ſay, <hi>Lord, help our unbelief,</hi> and <hi>encreaſe our faith.</hi> And all doubting will not prove the unſoundneſs of belief. The true mark to know when Faith is true and ſaving, notwithſtanding all ſuch doubtings, is the <hi>meaſure of its prevalency with our hearts and lives:</hi> That belief in
<q>Chriſt and the life to come is true and ſaving, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all doubtings, which habitually poſſeſſeth us with the love of God above all, and reſolveth the will to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the pleaſing of him, and the hopes of heaven, before all the treaſures and pleaſures of this world, and cauſeth us in our endeavours to live accordingly. And that faith is unſound which will not do this, how well ſoever it may be defended by diſpute.</q>
Therefore at leaſt, for the reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your wills for <hi>choice</hi> and <hi>practice,</hi> if you muſt doubt, yet conſider which is the ſafeſt ſide.

               <p>For my own part, I humbly thank the Heavenly Majeſty, for the advantages which my education gave me, for the timely reception of the Chriſtian faith: But temptations and difficulties have ſo often called me to clear my grounds, and try the evidences of that Religion, which I had firſt received upon the commendation of my Parents, that I have long thought no Subject more worthy of my moſt ſerious faithful ſearch; and have wondred at the great number of Chriſtians, who could ſpend their lives in ſtudying the ſuperſtructures, and wrangling about many ſmall uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to the great diſturbance of the Church's peace, and found no more need to be <hi>confirmed</hi> in the <hi>faith.</hi> In this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, I have moſt clearly to my full ſatisfaction diſcerned, all thoſe natural evidences for GODLINESS or HOLINESS which I have laid down in the firſt part of this Book. And I have diſcerned the congruous ſuperſtruction and conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the CHRISTIAN Religion thereunto: I have found by unqueſtionable experience the ſinful and depraved ſtate of man: and I have diſcerned the admirable ſuitableneſs of the remedy to the malady: I have alſo diſcerned the atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, in the grand evidence, the HOLY SPIRIT, the ADVOCATE or Agent of Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The <hi>ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent</hi> evidence in the Spirit of Prophecie, leading unto Chriſt. 2. The <hi>inherent conſtituent</hi> evidence of the Goſpel, and of Chriſt, the <hi>Image of God,</hi> in the <hi>Power, Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> both of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and of his doctrine. 3. The <hi>concomitant</hi> evidence of Miracles, in the Life, Reſurrection, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of Chriſt, and in the abundant Miracles of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and other his Diſciples through the world. 4. The <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent</hi> evidence, in the ſucceſſes of the Goſpel, to the true
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:59459:259"/>
ſanctification of millions of ſouls, by the powerful efficacy of Divine co-operation. I have ſpent moſt of my life in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with ſuch truly ſanctified perſons, and in preaching this Goſpel (through the great mercy of God) with ſuch ſucceſs upon no ſmall numbers: ſo that I am certain by full experience of the reality of that holy change, which cannot be done but with the co-operation of God. I have ſeen that this change is another matter than fancy, opinion, or factious conjunction with a Sect;
<q>[Even the ſetting up God in the ſoul as God, as our <hi>Owner, Ruler,</hi> and <hi>Chief Good,</hi> and the devoting of the ſoul to him in <hi>Reſignation, Obedience</hi> and <hi>thankful Love</hi>; the ſeeking of an everlaſting felicity in his glorious ſight and love in heaven; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of this world, as it pleaſeth the fleſh, and the holy uſe of it, as the way to our felicity and pleaſing God; the ſubduing and denying all carnal deſires, which would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel againſt God and reaſon, and reſtoring Reaſon to the government of the lower faculties: the denying of that inordinate <hi>ſelfiſhneſs,</hi> which ſetteth up our intereſt againſt our neighbours; and the reſpecting and loving our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours as our ſelves; and doing to others as we would be done by; and doing good to all men as far as we have power: the holy governing of our inferiours, and obeying our ſuperiours in order to theſe ends: living ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this world; and in the patient bearing of all afflictions, and diligent ſerving God in our ſeveral places, to redeem our time, and prepare for death, and wait with longing for the everlaſting glory, the hope of which is cauſed in us by faith in Chriſt, our Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, Reconciler, Example, Teacher, Governour and Judge.]</q>
This is the true nature of the Religion expreſſed in the Goſpel, and impreſſed on the ſouls of ſanctified men. By this effect, I know that Chriſt is the Saviour of the world, and no deceiver, as I know a man to be a true Phyſician and no deceiver, when I ſee him ordinarily and throughly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the cures which he undertaketh. He ſaveth us actually from the power of our ſins, and bringeth up our hearts to God, and therefore we may boldly ſay, He is our Saviour: This witneſs through his mercy I have in my ſelf, and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with me, and in thoſe whom I converſe with round
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:59459:260"/>
about me. I have alſo upon juſt enquiry found, that the witneſſes of Chriſt's Reſurrection and Miracles have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered us their teſtimony with a three-fold evidence: 1. The evidence of juſt <hi>credibility</hi> to a <hi>humane belief.</hi> 2. The evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of <hi>natural certainty</hi> in the natural impoſſibilities of deceit. 3. The evidence of <hi>ſupernatural divine</hi> atteſtation, in, 1. The Image of God on their hearts and doctrine: 2. Their miracles: and, 3. Their ſanctifying ſucceſs. And I have found that the witneſſes of the <hi>Miracles</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves, have alſo given us the ſame <hi>three degrees</hi> of <hi>proof</hi> of the Verity of <hi>their</hi> teſtimony; though Miracles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue not now as then. And I have look'd round about me in the world, as diligently and impartially as I could, to ſee whether Chriſt, and the way which he hath preſcribed us, have any competitor which may make it difficult, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve which to prefer and follow. And as I have found that none but GOD alone hath abſolute Dominion and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty over us, and is our chief Benefactor, nor fit to be our felicity and ultimate end; ſo I have found, that there is no one ſo fit to be taken for our Mediator and the Way to God, as Jeſus Chriſt: none elſe that hath a natural aptitude, none elſe among men that is perfect without ſin, that hath conquered Satan, the world and death; that is a Meſſenger from Heaven ſo infallible and ſure; whoſe Doctrine and Life is ſuited to our caſe: none elſe that is become a Sacrifice for our ſins, and hath riſen from the dead, and aſcended into Glory, and doth govern and preſerve us, and will judge the world, and hath power to give the holy Ghoſt, both for Gifts and Graces, nor that actually giveth it to the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of all his ſincere followers; none elſe that hath ſuch a Church and Kingdom, contemning the world, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned by the world, and ſo truly fitted to the pleaſing of God, and the future fruition of him in Glory. I ſee that <hi>Judaiſm</hi> is but the porch of Chriſtianity; and if Chriſt had not confirmed the verity of the Old Teſtament to me, I ſhould have found the difficulty of believing it much greater. And as for Mahometaniſm, beſides the common truths which it retaineth, (of the Unity of the Godhead, the Verity of Chriſt, and the Life to come, &amp;c.) there is nothing elſe which at all inviteth my underſtanding. And as for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:59459:260"/>
the caſe that it hath brought the miſerable world into, is much to be pitied and deplored:<note place="margin">Leg. Idiotae contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templat. de Amore Dei.</note> Much precious truth is revealed to us by Nature; but experience telleth us of the need of more: and Chriſtianity hath all which Nature teacheth, with a great deal more. So that Chriſtianity hath no conſiderable competitor.</p>
               <p>And as for worldly wealth and honour, ſuperiority and command of others, the favour, applauſe and praiſe of great ones, or of the multitude, voluptuouſneſs, and fleſhly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, &amp;c. eaſe, long life, or any accommodations of the fleſh, yea, learning it ſelf, as it is but the pleaſing of the fancy in the knowledge of unneceſſary things; all theſe I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed, and found them to be <hi>deceit</hi> and <hi>trouble</hi>: a glimpſe of heaven, a taſte of the love of God in Chriſt, yea, a fervent <hi>deſire</hi> after God, yea, a penitent tear, is better than them all, and yieldeth a delight which leaveth a better taſte behind it, and which my Reaſon more approveth in the review: and the vanity of all inferiour pleaſures appeareth to me in the common effects: they diſtract and corrupt the minds of thoſe that have the greateſt meaſure of them, and make them the calamity of their times, the furious afflicters of the upright, and the pity of all ſober ſtanders-by, who ſee them turn the world into a <hi>Bedlam</hi>: and how all their honour, wealth and ſport will leave them at a dying hour, and with what dejected minds unwelcome death will be entertain'd by them, and with what ſad reviews they will look back upon all their lives, and in what ſordid duſt and darkneſs they muſt leave the rotting fleſh, when their ſouls are gone to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their doom, before the Judge of all the world. All theſe are things which were paſt all doubt with me, ſince I had any ſolid uſe of reaſon, and things which are ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my eyes.</p>

The little taſtes of this ſweetneſs which my thirſty ſoul hath had, do tell me that there is no other real joy. I feel that thou haſt <hi>made</hi> my mind to <hi>know thee,</hi> and I feel thou haſt made my heart to love thee, my tongue to praiſe thee, and all that I am and have to ſerve thee! And even in the pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing languiſhing deſires and motions of my ſoul, I find that thou, and only thou, art its reſting place: and though Love do now but <hi>ſearch,</hi> and <hi>pray,</hi> and <hi>cry,</hi> and <hi>weep,</hi> and is reaching upward, but cannot reach, the glorious light, the bleſſed knowledge, the perfect love, for which it long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; yet by its eye, its aim, its motions, its moans, its groans, I know its meaning, where it would be, and I know its end. My diſplaced ſoul will never be <hi>well,</hi> till it come near to thee, till it know thee better, till it love thee more. It loves it ſelf, and juſtifyeth that ſelf love, when it can love thee: it loaths it ſelf, and is weary of it ſelf as a lifeleſs burden, when it feels no pantings after thee. Wert thou to be found in the moſt ſolitary deſart, it would ſeek thee; or in the uttermoſt parts of the earth, it would make after thee: thy preſence makes a croud, a Church: thy converſe maketh a cloſet, or ſolitary wood or field, to be kin to the Angelical Chore. The creature were dead, if thou wert not its life; and ugly, if thou wert not its beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and inſignificant, if thou wert not its ſenſe. The ſoul is deformed, which is without thine Image; and lifeleſs, which liveth not in love to thee, if love be not its pulſe, and prayer, and praiſe, its conſtant breath: the Mind is unlearned which readeth not thy Name on all the world, and ſeeth not <hi>HOLINESS TO THE LORD</hi> engraven upon the face of every creature. He doteth that doubteth of thy Being or Perfections, and he dreameth who doth
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:59459:261"/>
not live to thee. O let me have no other portion! no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, no love, no life, but what is devoted to thee, employed <hi>on</hi> thee, and <hi>for</hi> thee here, and ſhall be perfected in thee, the only perfect final object, for evermore. Upon the holy Altar erected by thy Son, and by his hands, and his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I humbly devote and offer thee <hi>THIS HEART</hi>: O that I could ſay with greater feeling, <hi>This flaming, lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, longing, Heart</hi>! But the ſacred fire which muſt kindle on my ſacrifice, muſt come from thee; it will not elſe aſcend unto thee: let it conſume this droſs, ſo the nobler part may know its home. All that I can ſay to commend it to thine acceptance, is, that I hope it's waſh'd in precious bloud, and that there is ſomething in it that is thine own; it ſtill looketh towards thee, and groaneth to thee, and followeth after thee, and will be content with gold, and mirth, and honour, and ſuch inferiour fooleries no more: it lieth at thy doors, and will be entertain'd or periſh. Though alaſs, it loves thee not as it would, I boldly ſay, it longs to love thee, it loves to love thee; it ſeeks, it craves no greater bleſſedneſs than perfect endleſs mutual love: it is vowed to thee, even to thee alone; and will never take up with ſhadows more, but is reſolved to lie down in ſorrow and deſpair, if thou wilt not be its <hi>REST</hi> and <hi>JOY.</hi> It hateth it ſelf for loving thee no more; accounting no want, deformity, ſhame or pain ſo great and grievous a calamity.</p>
                  <p>For thee the Glorious Bleſſed GOD, it is that I come to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> If he did not reconcile my guilty ſoul to thee; and did not teach it the heavenly art and work of Love, by the ſweet communications of thy love, he could be no Saviour for me. Thou art my only ultimate end; it is only a guide and way to thee that my anxious ſoul hath ſo much ſtudied: and none can teach me rightly to know thee, and to love thee, and to live to thee, but thy ſelf: it muſt be a Teacher ſent from thee, that muſt conduct me to thee. I have long looked round about me in the world, to ſee if there were a more lucid Region, from whence thy will and glory might be better ſeen, than that in which my lot is fallen: But no Traveller that I can ſpeak with, no Book which I have turn'd over, no Creature which I
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:59459:262"/>
can ſee, doth tell me more than Jeſus Chriſt. I can find no way ſo ſuitable to my ſoul, no medicine ſo fitted to my miſery, no bellows ſo fit to kindle love, as faith in Chriſt, the Glaſs and Meſſenger of thy love. I ſee no doctrine ſo divine and heavenly, as bearing the image and ſuperſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of God; nor any ſo fully confirmed and delivered by the atteſtation of thy own Omnipotency; nor any which ſo purely pleads thy cauſe, and calls the ſoul from <hi>ſelf</hi> and <hi>vanity,</hi> and condemns its ſin and purifieth it, and leadeth it directly unto thee; and though my former ignorance diſabled me to look back to the Ages paſt, and to ſee the methods of thy providence, and when I look into thy Word, diſabled me from ſeeing the beauteous methods of thy Truth; thou haſt given me a glimpſe of clearer light, which hath diſcovered the reaſons and methods of grace, which I then diſcerned not: and in the midſt of my moſt hideous temptations and perplexed thoughts, thou kepſt alive the root of faith, and kepſt alive the love to thee and unto Holineſs which it had kindled. Thou haſt mercifully given me the <hi>witneſs</hi> in my ſelf; not an <hi>unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable perſwaſion</hi> in my <hi>mind,</hi> but that <hi>renewed nature,</hi> thoſe holy and heavenly deſires and delights, which ſure can come from none but thee. And O how much more have I perceived in many of thy ſervants, than in my ſelf! thou haſt caſt my lot among the ſouls whom Chriſt hath healed, I have daily converſed with thoſe whom he hath raiſed from the dead. I have ſeen the power of thy Goſpel upon ſinners: All the love that ever I perceived kindled towards thee, and all the true obedience that ever I ſaw performed to thee, hath been effected by the word of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: how oft hath his Spirit helped me to pray! and how often haſt thou heard thoſe prayers! what pledges haſt thou given to my ſtaggering faith, in the words which prayer hath procured, both for my ſelf and many others? And if Confidence in Chriſt be yet deceit, muſt I not ſay that thou haſt deceived me? who I know canſt neither be deceived, or by any falſhood or ſeduction deceive.</p>
                  <p>On thee therefore, O my dear Redeemer, do I caſt and truſt this ſinful ſoul! with <hi>Thee</hi> and with thy <hi>holy Spirit</hi>
                     <pb n="461" facs="tcp:59459:262"/>
I renew my Covenant; I <hi>know</hi> no other; I <hi>have</hi> no other; I <hi>can</hi> have no other Saviour but thy ſelf: To thee I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up this ſoul which thou haſt redeemed, not to be advanced to the wealth, and honours, and pleaſures of this world; but to be delivered from them, and to be healed of ſin, and brought to God; and to be ſaved from this preſent evil world, which is the portion of the ungodly and unbelievers: to be waſhed in thy Bloud, and illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, quickned, and confirmed by thy <hi>SPIRIT</hi>; and conducted in the ways of holineſs and love: and at laſt to be preſented juſtified and ſpotleſs to the Father of ſpirits, and poſſeſſed of the glory which thou haſt promiſed. O thou that haſt prepared ſo dear a medicine for the clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of polluted guilty ſouls, leave not this unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſoul in its guilt, or in its pollution! O thou that knoweſt the Father, and his Will, and art neareſt to him, and moſt beloved of him, cauſe me in my degree to know the Father; acquaint me with ſo much of his will, as concerneth my duty, or my juſt encouragement: leave not my ſoul to groap in darkneſs, ſeeing thou art the Sun and Lord of Light. O heal my eſtranged thoughts of God! is he my light, and life, and all my hope? and muſt I dwell with him for ever? and yet ſhall I know him no better than thus? ſhall I learn no more that have ſuch a Teacher? and ſhall I get no nearer him, while I have a Saviour and a Head ſo near? O give my faith a clearer proſpect into that better world! and let me not be ſo much unacquainted with the place in which I muſt abide for ever! And as thou haſt prepared a Heaven for holy ſouls, prepare this too-unprepared ſoul for Heaven, which hath not long to ſtay on earth. And when at death I reſign it into thy hands, receive it as thine own, and finiſh the work which thou haſt begun, in placing it among the bleſſed Spirits, who are filled with the ſight and love of God. I truſt thee living; let me truſt thee dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and never be aſhamed of my truſt.</p>
                  <p>And unto Thee, the Eternal Holy Spirit, proceeding from the Father and the Son, the Communicative LOVE, who condeſcendeſt to make <hi>Perfect</hi> the Elect of God, do I deliver up this dark imperfect ſoul, to be
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:59459:263"/>
further renewed, confirmed and perfected, according to the holy Covenant. Refuſe not to bleſs it with thine indwelling and operations; quicken it with thy life; ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiate it by thy light; ſanctifie it by thy love; actuate it purely, powerfully and conſtantly by thy holy motions. And though the way of this thy ſacred influx be beyond the reach of humane apprehenſion; yet let me know the reality and ſaving power of it, by the happy effects. Thou art more to fouls, than ſouls to bodies, than light to eyes. O leave not my ſoul as a carrion deſtitute of thy life; nor its eyes as uſeleſs, deſtitute of thy light; nor leave it as a ſenſeleſs block without thy motion. The remembrance of what I was without thee, doth make me fear leſt thou ſhouldeſt with-hold thy grace. Alaſs, I feel, I daily feel that I am dead to all good, and all that's good is dead to me, if thou be not the life of all. Teachings and reproofs, mercies and corrections, yea, the Goſpel it ſelf, and all the livelieſt Books and Sermons, are dead to me, becauſe I am dead to them: yea, God is as no God to me, and Heaven as no Heaven, and Chriſt as no Chriſt, and the cleareſt evidences of Scripture verity are as no proofs at all, if thou repreſent them not with light and power to my ſoul: Even as all the glory of the world is as nothing to me, without the light by which it's ſeen. O thou that haſt begun, and given me thoſe heavenly <hi>intimations</hi> and <hi>deſires,</hi> which fleſh and bloud could never give me, ſuffer not my folly to quench theſe ſparks, nor this bruitiſh fleſh to prevail againſt thee, nor the powers of hell to ſtifle and kill ſuch a heavenly ſeed. O pardon that folly and wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which hath too often, too obdurately and too unthankfully ſtriven againſt thy grace; and depart not from an unkind and ſinful ſoul! I remember with grief and ſhame, how I wilfully bore down thy motions; pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it not with deſertion, and give me not over to my ſelf. Art thou not in Covenant with me, as my <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier,</hi> and <hi>Confirmer,</hi> and <hi>Comforter?</hi> I never undertook to do theſe things for my ſelf; but I conſent that thou ſhouldeſt work them on me.

effectually in my ſoul, againſt the ſuggeſtions of Satan and my unbelief; and finiſh his healing ſaving work; and let not the fleſh or world prevail. Be in me the reſident witneſs of my Lord, the Author of my Prayers, the Spirit of Adoption, the Seal of God, and the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of mine inheritance. Let not my nights be ſo long, and my days ſo ſhort, nor ſin eclipſe thoſe beams, which have often illuminated my ſoul. Without thee, Books are ſenſeleſs ſcrawls, ſtudies are dreams, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a glow-worm, and wit is but wantonneſs, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency and folly. Tranſcribe thoſe ſacred precepts on my heart, which by thy dictates and inſpirations are recorded in thy holy word. I refuſe not thy help for tears and groans: but O ſhed abroad that love upon my heart, which may keep it in a continual life of love. And teach me the work which I muſt do in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: refreſh my ſoul with the delights of holineſs, and the joys which ariſe from the believing hopes of the everlaſting Joys: Exerciſe my heart and tongue in the holy praiſes of my Lord. Strengthen me in ſufferings; and conquer the terrors of death and hell. Make me the more heavenly, by how much the faſter I am haſtening to heaven: and let my laſt thoughts, words and works on earth, be likeſt to thoſe which ſhall be my firſt in the ſtate of glorious immortality; where the Kingdom is delivered up to the Father, and GOD will for ever be <hi>All,</hi> and <hi>In all:</hi> of whom, and through whom, and to whom are all things, To whom be glory for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>I adde this to warn men of ſome common dangerous er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in this point: ſome think that if they do but feel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more moved with another Miniſters preaching, or more edified with another way of Diſcipline, they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently withdraw themſelves to that Miniſter or Diſcipline, without regard to the Unity and good of the Church where they are, or whatever publick evil follow it. Whereas he that ſeemeth to deny even to his Soul ſome preſent edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the publick good, ſhall finde that even this will turn to his greater edification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſome, on the contrary extream, have got a conceit that till they can finde that they can be content to</hi> be damned for Chriſt, <hi>if God would ſo have it, they are not ſincere. Which is a caſe that no Chriſtian ſhould put to his own heart, being ſuch as God never put to any man: All the tryall that God putteth us to, is but whether we can deny this tranſitory life, and the vanities of the World, and the pleaſures of the fleſh, for the Love of God, and the Hopes of Glory: And he that doth thus much ſhall undoubtedly be ſaved. But to think that you muſt ask your hearts ſuch a queſtion, as whether you can be content to be damned for Chriſt, is but to abuſe God and your ſelves. Indeed both Reaſon and Religion command us, to eſteem God infinitely above our ſelves, and the Churches welfare above our own;
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:59459:266"/>
becauſe that which is beſt, muſt be beſt eſteemed and loved: But yet though we muſt ever acknowledge this inequality, Yet that we muſt never disjoyn them nor ſet them in a</hi> poſitive <hi>oppoſition or competition, nor really do any thing which tendeth to our damnation, upon any pretenſe of the Churches good, is paſt all queſtion. He that hath made the love of our ſelves and felicity inſeparable from man, hath made us no duty inconſiſtent with this inclination, that is, with our humanity it ſelf: For God hath conjoyned theſe neceſſary ends, and we muſt not ſeparate them.</hi>

                  </note> The well-ordered Councils of Biſhops or Paſtors of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Churches, aſſembled together, have been juſtly eſteemed a convenient means of maintaining the concord and peace of Chriſtians, and a fit remedy for the cure of hereſies, corruptions and diviſions. And when the cauſe requireth it, thoſe councils ſhould conſiſt of as many as can conveniently meet, even from the moſt diſtant Churches, which can ſend their Biſhops without incurring greater hurt or diſcommodity, than their preſence will countervail in doing good. And therefore the councils called General in the Dominions of the Chriſtian Roman Emperours, were commendable, and very profitable to the Church, when rightly uſed. But whereas the Pope doth argue, that he is the conſtitutive Head of the whole catholick Church throughout the world, becauſe his Predeceſſors did oft preſide in thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, it is moſt evident to any one, who will make a faithful ſearch into the Hiſtory of them, that thoſe councils were ſo far from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting all the Churches in the world, that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted only of the Churches or Subjects of the Roman Empire, and thoſe that having formerly been parts of the Empire, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued that way of communion when they fell into the hands of conquerors; their conquerors being commonly Pagans, Infidels or Arrian Hereticks.

               </note> 4. The proofs of the <hi>verity of the Chriſtian faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe, (that there is a God) though I have proved it beyond all rational contradiction, yet I have diſpatched it with haſte and brevity: becauſe it is to the <hi>mind</hi> as the Sun is to the <hi>eye,</hi> and ſo evident in all that is evident in the world, that there needeth nothing to the proving of it, but to help the Reader to a rational capacity and aptitude, to ſee that which all the world declareth. The common argument, from the <hi>effects</hi> to the <hi>cauſe,</hi> in all the <hi>entities</hi> and <hi>motions</hi> in the world, is undeniable. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever any Being hath, and hath not originally from it ſelf, or independently in it ſelf, it muſt needs have from another: and that other cannot act beyond its power, nor give that which it hath not either formally or eminently: Therefore he that findeth in the world about him, ſo much <hi>entity</hi> and <hi>motion,</hi> ſo much Intellection, Volition and Operation, and ſo much Wiſdom, Goodneſs and Power, muſt needs know that all theſe have ſome cauſe, which formally or eminently, or in a way of tranſcendency, hath more it ſelf than it giveth to others. I meaſured my endeavours about this ſubject, according as the occaſions of my own ſoul had led me: among all the temptations which have at any time aſſaulted me, I have found thoſe ſo contemptible and inconſiderable as to their ſtrength, which would have made me doubt of the being of a God, that I am apt to think that it is ſo with others. And therefore in the review of this diſcourſe, I find no reaſon to ſtand to anſwer any mans objections, againſt the <hi>Being,</hi> or <hi>eſſential</hi> Attributes or Properties of God.</p>
            <p>And for the ſecond point, (that we all owe to this God our abſolute <hi>Reſignation, Obedience</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and ſo that <hi>Holineſs</hi> is <hi>naturally</hi> our duty) it doth ſo naturally reſult from the Nature of God and Man compared, that I can ſcarce think of any thing worthy of a confutation which can be ſaid againſt it, but that which denieth the Nature of God or Man; and therefore is either confuted under the firſt head, or is to be confuted under the third.</p>
            <p>
               <note n="*" place="margin">When <hi>Machumet</hi> had taken <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> and demanded of the Patriarch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Chriſtian ſaith, <hi>Georg. Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larius, alias Genna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> then Patriarch, wrote that brief ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary which you may find in <hi>Mart. Cruſius</hi> his <hi>Turco Graec. l. 2. Hiſt. Eccleſ. p. 10, &amp;c.</hi> which very well openeth the myſtery of the Trinity, and of Chriſtianity, with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven reaſons of it.</note> As for the fourth particular, contained in the ſecond Tome, (the truth of the Goſpel) I find not any reaſon to defend it more particularly, nor to anſwer any more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:59459:275"/>
than I have done: for in proving the truth, I have proved all the contradictory aſſertions to be falſe; and I have anſwered already the greateſt objections: and after this, to anſwer every ignorant exception of unſatisfied per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, againſt the ſeveral paſſages of the Scripture, would be tedious, and not neceſſary to the end of my deſign. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I perceive not that any conſiderable number are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with doubtings of the truth of the Chriſtian faith, in a prevalent degree, who are well convinced of thoſe ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent verities of the <hi>Deity,</hi> and of the <hi>natural obligation</hi> and <hi>neceſſity</hi> of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and of the <hi>Immortality of the ſoul,</hi> or of a <hi>future life</hi> of reward and puniſhment; and that live in any reaſonable conformity to theſe natural principles which they profeſs. For when natural evidence hath ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently convinced a man, that he is obliged to <hi>be holy,</hi> in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute <hi>obedience</hi> and <hi>love</hi> to his <hi>Creator,</hi> through the <hi>hopes</hi> and <hi>fears</hi> of another life; he is very much prepared to cloſe with the deſign and doctrine of the Goſpel, which is ſo far from contradicting this, that it doth but confirm it, and ſhew us the way by which it may moſt certainly be brought to paſs.</p>
            <p>And therefore my obſervation and experiences conſtrain me to think, that there is no point which I have inſiſted on, which ſo much calleth for my vindication, as the <hi>third,</hi> about the <hi>Life to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know there is a ſort of over-wiſe and over-doing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, who will tell their followers in private, where there is none to contradict them, that the method of this Treatiſe is perverſe, as appealing too much to natural light, and over-valuing humane reaſon; and that I ſhould have done no more but ſhortly tell men, that All that which God ſpeaketh in his word is true; and that <hi>propria luce,</hi> it is evident that the Scripture is the Word of God; and that to all God's Elect he will give his Spirit to cauſe them to diſcern it: and that this much alone had been better than all theſe diſputes and reaſons: but theſe over-wiſe men, who need themſelves no reaſon for their Religion, and judge accordingly of others, and think that thoſe men who reſt not in the authority of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhould reſt in theirs, are many of them ſo well acquainted with me, as not to expect that I ſhould trouble

For of men ſo called, it is but a ſmall part who at all gainſay this weighty truth. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of <hi>Plato</hi> the Divine Philoſopher, with the <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans,</hi> the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> the <hi>Cynicks,</hi> and divers other Sects, are ſo much for it, that indeed the moſt of them go too far, and make the ſoul to be eternal both <hi>à parte arte,</hi> and <hi>à parte poſt:</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> doth conclude from its <hi>ſelf-moving power,</hi> that it is certainly eternal and divine: Inſomuch that not only <hi>Arnobius,</hi> but many other ancient Chriſtians, write ſo much againſt <hi>Plato</hi> for holding the ſoul to be <hi>naturally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal,</hi> and aſſert themſelves, that it is of a middle nature, between that which is <hi>naturally immortal,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plotinus <hi>his laſt words were</hi> (<hi>as</hi> Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry <hi>ſaith in his life</hi>) [I am now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning that which is Divine in us, to that which is Divine in the Univerſe.]</note> and that which is meerly mortal, that he that doth not well underſtand them, may be ſcandalized at their expreſſions, and think that he readeth the Philoſopher defending the ſouls immortality, and the Chriſtian oppoſing it. And though <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s opinion be queſtioned by many, yet <hi>Cicero,</hi> who lived in time and places wherein he had better advantage than we to know his meaning, doth frequently affirm, that he was in the main of <hi>Plato</hi>'s mind; and that the <hi>Academicks, Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> and <hi>Stoicks</hi> differed more in words than ſenſe; chiding the <hi>Stoicks</hi> for their ſchiſm or ſeparation, in ſetting up a School or Sect as new, which had almoſt nothing new but words.

            <p>It is only then the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> and ſome novel <hi>Somatiſts</hi> that I have now to anſwer, who think they have much to ſay againſt the ſeparated ſubſiſtence and immortality of mans ſoul, which I may reduce to theſe objections following.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> without any more, may do all that which you aſcribe to <hi>incorporeal ſubſtances</hi> or <hi>ſouls</hi>: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you aſſert them without ground. II. To confirm this, the bruits have <hi>ſenſe, imagination, thought</hi> and <hi>reaſon,</hi> by <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>motion</hi> only, without immortal or incorporeal ſubſtances: therefore by ſenſe, imagination, thoughts or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, you cannot prove that man hath more. III. Forms are but <hi>Accidents,</hi> that is, Qualities, or the mode of matter, and not <hi>Subſtances</hi> different from matter: therefore it is ſo with humane ſouls. IV. The ſoul dependeth upon matter in its operations, and acteth according to it, and not without it: therefore it is material, and conſequently mortal. V. No immaterial ſubſtance moveth that which is material, or is the principle of its operations: but the ſoul moveth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as the principle of its operations: <hi>ergo.</hi> VI. If in our dreams the thoughts do operate only according to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental irregular motion of the ſpirits, and ſometime be ſo unactive, that we do not ſo much as dream, then the ſoul is nothing but the ſaid active ſpirits, or ſome material cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible thing: but, &amp;c. <hi>ergo.</hi> VII. Senſe is a more perfect apprehenſion than Reaſon: therefore Bruits, which have ſenſe, have as noble and perfect a kind of ſoul as man; or at leaſt reaſon is no proof of the immateriality of ſouls. VIII. Senſation and Intellection are both but Reception, and and the ſoul is but a patient in them: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is not a ſelf-moving, and ſo not an incorporeal ſubſtance. IX. Nothing is in the underſtanding but what is firſt in the ſenſe: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the underſtanding can reach no further than to ſenſible things: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is it ſelf of no higher a kind. X. Corporeal objects move the ſoul: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is corporeal. For things material cannot work upon that which is immaterial. XI. If the ſoul were incorporeal, it would know it ſelf to be ſo: but it is not only ignorant of that, but hath no true no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but meerly negative, of immaterial beings. XI. That
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:59459:277"/>
which is generated is corruptible: but the ſoul is generated, as is proved by <hi>Senertus,</hi> and many others. XIII. <hi>Quicquid oritur interit</hi>; that which is not eternal as to the paſt dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is not eternal as to the future duration: but all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians maintain, that the ſoul is either created or generated, and not of eternal duration, as to what is paſt: and all the Philoſophers, or moſt who took it to be eternal as to future duration, went on that ground, that it was ſo antecedently. XIV. You give us none but moral arguments for the ſoul's immortality. XV. Nay, you confeſs, that the ſoul's eternal duration cannot by you be proved by any natural evidence; though you think you ſo prove a life of Retribution. XVI. The ſoul and body are like a candle, where oyl, and week, and fire, (which are all) are in <hi>flexu continuo,</hi> and as there is not the ſame individual flame this hour as was the laſt, ſo neither have we the ſame individual ſouls: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are uncapable of a life of Retribution hereafter. XVII. If the ſoul be a durable ſubſtance, (as we muſt confeſs no ſubſtance is annihilated) it is moſt likely to come from the <hi>anima mundi,</hi> or ſome univerſal ſoul of that orb or ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem of which it is a part, and ſo to return to it again, as the beams to the Sun; and ſo to ceaſe its individuation, and conſequently to be uncapable of a life of Retribution. XVIII. The <hi>Platoniſts</hi> who hold the ſouls immortality, (and ſome <hi>Platonick</hi> Divines too) have ſo many fopperies about its vehicles, regions and tranſmutations, as maketh their principal doctrine the leſs credible. XIX. If the ſoul ſhould continue its individuation, yet its actings will be nothing like what they are in the body; nor can they exerciſe a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of what they did in the body, as having not the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial ſpirits and nerves, by which memory is exerciſed: and therefore they can have no proper retribution, eſpecially pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, for any thing here done. XX. The belief of the immortality of the ſoul doth fill men with fears, and take up their lives in ſuperſtitious cares for a life to come, which might be ſpent in quietneſs, and in publick works: and it fills the world with all thoſe religious ſects and controverſies, which have ſo long deſtroyed Charity and Peace.</p>

               <p n="2">2. I find Philoſophers ſo little agreed among themſelves, that it greatly diminiſheth their authority and requireth a man who is juſt to his reaſon, to make a very accurate trial before he fall it with any of their opinions.

And like idle Boys, who tear out all the hard leaves of their books, and ſay they have learn'd all when they have learnt the reſt; ſo do they cut off and deny the nobleſt parts of nature, and then ſweep together the duſt of agitated Atoms, and tell us that they have reſolved all the Phaenomena in Nature.</p>

               <p>Perceiving all theſe general Reaſons to diſtruſt this ſort of Philoſophers above others, though I reſolve to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial, I cannot willingly be ſo fooliſh, as to over-look their diſadvantage in the preſent cauſe.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The particular reaſons which diſſwade me from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the <hi>Epicurean</hi> ſufficiency of <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> are theſe following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They all (with whom I have now to do) are conſtrained to confeſs an <hi>incorporeal intellectual ſubſtance</hi>; even that <hi>there is a God,</hi> and that <hi>GOD</hi> is ſuch. <hi>Epicurus</hi> himſelf doth not deny it, yea, ſeemeth to ſpeak magnificently of God, and in <hi>honour</hi> to him would excuſe his providence from the mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of inferiour things. For, 1. They know that <hi>matter</hi> did not make it ſelf; and <hi>motion</hi> is but its mode: and therefore <hi>matter</hi> cannot be made by its <hi>own motion.</hi> Its <hi>being</hi> is in order of nature before its <hi>motion.</hi> And <hi>matter</hi> is in it ſelf ſo dull a thing, (and by the adverſaries ſtripped of all <hi>forms,</hi> which are not cauſed by <hi>motion</hi>) that if it were ſaid to be from <hi>eternity</hi> in its <hi>duration,</hi> they will confeſs it could be but as an eternal effect of ſome nobler cauſe. So that at the firſt word they grant, that <hi>matter</hi> hath an <hi>incorporeal</hi> cauſe. 2.

                  </note> And the paſſive <hi>matter</hi> yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, is ſuppoſed by themſelves to be void of all antecedent moving power. So that they are all fain to ſay, that God made the <hi>matter,</hi> and gave it the firſt puſh. And ſo all <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>motion</hi> is reduced to a <hi>firſt efficient,</hi> who is <hi>incorporeal</hi>: And therefore an <hi>incorporeal being</hi> is acknowledged.</p>

For <hi>Matter is in fluxu continuo,</hi> as they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject themſelves anon: We have not the ſame ſleſh and bloud to day which we lately had: and the <hi>motion</hi> of this inſtant is not the ſame with the <hi>motion</hi> which ſucceedeth in the next: So that no man's ſoul, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently no man, is long the ſame: and ſo (as I have ſaid after) Kings will loſe their titles to their Crowns, and all men to their lands, as being not the ſame who were born heirs to them. And there muſt be no rewards or puniſhments, unleſs you will reward and puniſh one for another's faults: And they need no more to fear the pain or death which will befall them, than that which befall their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, becauſe it is not the man that now is who muſt undergo it. Nor ſhould any man have a wife or child of his own one year together. If they like not theſe conſequents, let them either prove that Identifying <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> are permanent, or grant that ſome other permanent thing doth identifie the perſon.

                  </note>2. I meet with none of them who dare deny this God to be <hi>an intellectual free Agent</hi>; ſo that though it be granted them, that <hi>intelligere, velle</hi> be not in God the ſame thing <hi>formally</hi> as it is in man; yet is it ſomething which <hi>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently</hi> muſt be ſo called; man having no fitter conception or expreſſion of it, than from theſe acts of his own ſoul. <hi>Epicurus</hi> will not make God defectively ignorant, impotent, or bad. When themſelves divide all things into ſuch as have <hi>underſtanding,</hi> and ſuch as have none; of which part do they ſuppoſe GOD to ſtand? Things that are void of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, (formally or eminently) are below the dignity of things that have underſtanding. So that they confeſs there is exiſtent an <hi>incorporeal, intelligent, free Agent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. As they confeſs that this <hi>intellectual Agent</hi> is the firſt cauſe both of <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>motion,</hi> ſo they cannot deny that he <hi>ſtill cauſeth both,</hi> by his <hi>continued influx</hi> or cauſing effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy. For there can be <hi>no effect</hi> without a <hi>cauſe</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the cauſe ceaſeth, the effect muſt ceaſe. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial part of a <hi>moral cauſe</hi> may ceaſe, and yet the effect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. But that moral cauſation continueth which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to the effect. The Parent may die while the child ſurviveth: but there is a continued cauſe of the life of the child, proportioned to the effect. <hi>Matter</hi> is not an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent being. To ſay that God hath made it ſelf-ſufficient and independent, is to ſay that he hath made it a God.
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:59459:281"/>
Suppoſe but a total ceſſation of the Divine emanation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux and cauſation, and you muſt needs ſuppoſe alſo the ceſſation of all Beings. If you ſay that when God hath once given it a Being, it will continue of it ſelf, till his power anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate it: I anſwer, if it continue without a continuing cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, it muſt continue as an independent ſelf-ſufficient being. But this is a contradiction, becauſe it is a creature; GOD is no <hi>effect,</hi> and therefore needeth no <hi>cauſe</hi> of ſubſiſtence: but the creature is an <hi>effect,</hi> and cannot ſubſiſt a moment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>continued cauſe.</hi> As the beams or communicated light cannot continue an inſtant, if there were a total ceſſation of the emanation of the luminary, becauſe their <hi>being</hi> is meerly dependent: and they need no other poſitive annihilation, beſides the ceſſation of the cauſation which did continue them. It was from one of <hi>your own Poets</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> cited, <hi>[In him we live, and move, and have our being, for we are his off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring.]</hi> And nothing is more abhorrent to all common reaſon, than that this ſtone or dirt, which was <hi>nothing</hi> as ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday, ſhould be a <hi>God</hi> to it ſelf, even one independent ſelf-ſufficient being, as ſoon as it is created; and ſo that God made as many <hi>demy-gods</hi> as <hi>atoms.</hi> We ſee paſt doubt, that <hi>one</hi> creature cannot ſubſiſt or move without <hi>another,</hi> on which it is dependent; how much leſs can any creature ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt or move without its continued reception of its <hi>Creator's influx.</hi> If you could ſuppoſe that for one moment there were <hi>no God,</hi> you muſt ſuppoſe there would be <hi>nothing.</hi> If I thought any would deny this, beſides thoſe inflated vertigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous brains, that are not to be diſputed with, I would ſay more for the illuſtration of it.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But though matter ſubſiſt not without a continued divine cauſation, or emanation, or efficacious volition; yet mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may continue when all divine cauſation of it ceaſeth: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when God hath given it one puſh, that cauſeth a motion, which cauſeth another motion, and that another, and ſo</hi> in infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum, <hi>if there were no ſtop.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If this were ſo, it muſt be on ſuppoſition of a <hi>vis motiva communicata vel impreſſa:</hi> for if there had been no ſuch, the firſt motion would have not been, or all have preſently ceaſed for want of a continued cauſe. As there is no motion <hi>ſine vi motiva,</hi> ſo none can be communicated, but
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:59459:282"/>
by the communication of that <hi>force.</hi> Action is not nothing: nor will be cauſed by nothing: As the <hi>delapſus gravium</hi> would preſently ceaſe, if we could cauſe the <hi>pondus</hi> or <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi> to ceaſe; ſo is it in all other motions. If there be no <hi>vis</hi> or <hi>ſtrength</hi> communicated along with the motion, there would be nothing in that motion to cauſe another motion, nor in that to cauſe another. (And if it were by way of <hi>traction,</hi> if the cauſe ceaſe which is the <hi>prima trahens,</hi> all the motion ceaſeth: and ſo alſo if it be by way of <hi>pulſion</hi>) So that in <hi>every motion,</hi> there is ſomething more than <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>motion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. All motion (of things below within our reach) hath many <hi>impediments:</hi> and therefore would ceaſe, if the firſt cauſe continued not his powerful efficacy.<note place="margin">If the doctrine of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> only were true, there would never be any true mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles in the world, but all things go on from motion to motion as the firſt touch did put them into a neceſſity: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as (however the world hath been deluded by many fictions, yet) many certain miracles there have been. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the removing of the mountain by ſaith mentioned by <hi>M. Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Venetus, J. 1. cap. 18.</hi> be true or not, and the non-diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate bodies in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> mentioned in <hi>Mart. Cruſius</hi> his <hi>Hiſt. Eccleſ. Turco graec. l. 2.</hi> with mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of the likes which moſt Hiſtorians have, &amp;c. Yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that there have been ſome ſuch, hath been fully proved unto many.</note> It is tedious and needleſs to enumerate inſtances.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>moving power</hi> of the nobleſt creatures, is not <hi>purely active,</hi> but partly <hi>paſſive</hi> and partly active, and muſt receive the influx of the higheſt cauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before it can act or commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate any thing. Therefore as ſoon as the firſt <hi>mover</hi> ſhould ceaſe, the reſt would be ſoon ſtop'd, though ſome active power was communicated to them. As we ſee in a Clock when the poiſe is down, and in a Watch when the ſpring is down; the motion ceaſeth firſt where it firſt began.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Can you conſtrain your reaſon to imagine, that God is the ſole principal active cauſe, for the firſt touch, and, as it were, for one minute, or inſtant, (while he cauſeth the firſt <hi>motus</hi>) and is an unactive <hi>being,</hi> or no cauſe ever after, (ſave only <hi>reputativè,</hi> becauſe he cauſed the firſt.) This is to ſay, that God was God till he made the world, and ever ſince he hath done nothing, but left every atom or creature to be <hi>God.</hi> Is God ſo mutable, to do all for one inſtant, and to do nothing ever after?</p>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>infiniteneſs</hi> and <hi>perfection</hi> of God fully proveth, that all continued motion is by the continuance of his effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency. For it is undeniable, that he who made all things is <hi>every where,</hi> or preſent to all his creatures, in the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate proximity. And it is certain, that he cannot but <hi>know</hi> them all: and alſo that his Benignity maintaineth all their beings and well-beings; and therefore that he is not an <hi>unactive being</hi>; but that his <hi>power</hi> as well as his <hi>wiſdom</hi>
                  <pb n="503" facs="tcp:59459:282"/>
and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> is continually in act. How ſtrangely do theſe Epicureans differ from <hi>Ariſtotle?</hi> who durſt not deny the Eternity of the World, leſt he ſhould make God an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active Being <hi>ad extra,</hi> from Eternity till the Creation? When-as theſe men feign him to have given but one inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous puſh, and to have been <hi>coetera otioſus,</hi> or unactive from Eternity.</p>
               <p>Seeing then it cannot by ſober reaſon be denyed, that <hi>God</hi> himſelf is by a continued Cauſation, the Preſerver and intimate <hi>firſt mover</hi> of all things, it muſt needs thence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>motion</hi> are ſtill inſufficient of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: and that this is to be none of the Controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us: but only whether it be any <hi>created Nature, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> or <hi>other Cauſe,</hi> by which God cauſeth <hi>motion</hi> in any thing, or all things? or whether he do it by his <hi>own imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Cauſation alone</hi> without the uſe of any ſecond Cauſe, ſave meer motion it ſelf? ſo that the <hi>inſufficiency</hi> of <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> to continual alterations and productions, muſt be confeſſed by all that confeſs there is a God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is alſo manifeſt in the effect, that it is not a <hi>meer motion</hi> of the <hi>firſt Cauſe,</hi> which appeareth in the <hi>being</hi> and <hi>motions</hi> of the Creature. There is apparently a tendency in the Creatures motion to a <hi>certain end,</hi> which is an <hi>attractive Good</hi>; and there is a certain <hi>Order</hi> in all motions to that end; and certain <hi>Laws,</hi> or <hi>Guidances</hi> and <hi>overrulings,</hi> to keep them in that Order: ſo that <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> do emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently appear in them all, in their beings, natures, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, excellencies, order and ends, as well as <hi>Motion</hi> the effect of <hi>Power.</hi> 1.

               <p>But I ſuppoſe it will be granted me, that the firſt <hi>mover</hi> doth more than <hi>meerly move,</hi> the effects of Wiſdom and Goodneſs being ſo legible on all the World; but you'l ſay, that to do it <hi>wiſely</hi> and to attain <hi>good ends</hi> by it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is but the <hi>modus</hi> of action with the effect, and therefore <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>motion rightly ordered</hi> may be nevertheleſs ſufficient to all effects. To which I anſwer, that the Creatures motion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth not only that the Creator <hi>move</hi> them, but that he place and order them, and move them <hi>rightly,</hi> and that he remove and overcome impediments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore there is neceſſary in the firſt mover, both <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> as well as <hi>Power:</hi> And neither his <hi>Power, Wiſdom</hi> or <hi>Love</hi> are Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comotion in himſelf. And this much being proved, that in
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:59459:284"/>
every <hi>motion,</hi> there is Divine <hi>Power, Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> which is more than <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>motion</hi> it ſelf, I proceed next to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,</p>
               <p n="5">5. Do you think there is any thing exiſtent in the World, beſides <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>motion,</hi> or not? As to meer ſite, and figure and other ſuch order or modes of <hi>matter,</hi> I know you will not deny them to have now a being as well as <hi>motion.</hi> But is there no <hi>different tendency</hi> to <hi>motion</hi> in the parts of matter? Is there not in many Creatures a <hi>Power,</hi> an <hi>Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> or <hi>aptitude</hi> to <hi>motion,</hi> beſides <hi>motion</hi> it ſelf? Is there not a reaſon <hi>à priore</hi> to be given, why one Creature is more agile and <hi>active</hi> than another? and why they act in their various wayes? Why is <hi>fire</hi> more active than <hi>earth?</hi> and a <hi>Swallow</hi> than a <hi>Snail?</hi> If you ſay, that the different <hi>ratio motus</hi> is in ſome <hi>extrinſecal</hi> agent only which moveth them, you will hardly ſhew any poſſibility of that, when the <hi>ſame Sun,</hi> by the <hi>ſame virtue</hi> (or motion as you will ſay) is it that moveth all: And if it were ſo, you muſt go up to the firſt Cauſe, to ask for the different motions of thoſe movers; when our enquiry now is <hi>de natura moventium &amp; motorum Creatorum?</hi> If you ſay, that it is the <hi>Ratio recipiendi</hi> in the different <hi>magnitudes</hi> or <hi>poſitions</hi> of the parts of <hi>matter,</hi> which is the cauſe of different motions; I would know, 1. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this difference of <hi>magnitude</hi> and <hi>figure</hi> and <hi>ſite,</hi> being <hi>now</hi> antecedently neceſſary to different motions, was not ſo <hi>heretofore</hi> as well as now? If you ſay, No, you feign with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proof a ſtate of things and order of Cauſes, contrary to that which all mens ſenſe perceiveth to be <hi>now exiſtent?</hi> And who is the wiſer Philoſopher? he that judgeth the courſe and nature of things to be, and have been what he now findeth it, till the contrary be proved? or he that findeth it one thing, and feigneth it ſometime to have been another without any proof? That which is <hi>now</hi> antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to diverſity of motion, it's like was ſo hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. 2. And then how could one ſimple equal act of God, ſetting the firſt matter into motion, cauſe ſuch an inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in motions to this day, if it be true that you hold, that only that which is <hi>moved</hi> or in motion it ſelf can move? and that motion is all that is neceſſary to the diverſity? 3. Either the firſt <hi>matter</hi> was made ſolid in larger parcels,
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:59459:284"/>
or all conjunct, or in Atomes: If it was made firſt in <hi>Atomes,</hi> then <hi>Motion</hi> cauſed not Diviſion. If it was made <hi>conjunct</hi> and <hi>ſolid,</hi> then motion cauſed not <hi>conjunction</hi> and <hi>ſolidity.</hi> And if the <hi>firſt diviſion,</hi> or <hi>conjunction, ſite</hi> and <hi>figure</hi> of <hi>matter</hi> was all antecedent to <hi>motion</hi> and without it, we have no reaſon to think that it is the ſole Cauſe of all things now.</p>
               <p>But ſurely <hi>quantity, figure</hi> and <hi>ſite,</hi> are not all that <hi>now</hi> is antecedent to motion. Doth not a man feel in himſelf a certain <hi>Power,</hi> to ſudden and voluntary motion? He that ſate ſtill, can ſuddenly riſe and go: And if you ſay, that he performeth that ſudden <hi>motion</hi> by ſome <hi>antecedent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> I anſwer, that I grant that; but the queſtion is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>that alone?</hi> or whether a <hi>Power</hi> diſtinct from mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelf, be not as evidently the Cauſe? For otherwiſe the antecedent motion would proceed but according to its own proportion: It would not in a minute make ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and great an alteration. I can <hi>reſtrain</hi> alſo that <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> which ſome antecedent motion (<hi>e.g.</hi> paſſion) urgeth me to? Surely this <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>doing</hi> or not <hi>doing,</hi> is ſomewhat different from <hi>doing</hi> it ſelf. A <hi>power</hi> of <hi>not-moving</hi> is not motion.</p>
               <p>And what is the <hi>Pondus</hi> which <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> doth adde to <hi>magnitude</hi> and <hi>figure</hi> as a third pre-requiſite in Atomes? I perceive he knoweth not what to make of it himſelf. But in concluſion it muſt be no natural Gravity by which the <hi>parts</hi> are inclined to the <hi>whole</hi> in themſelves, but the meer effect of <hi>pulſion</hi> or <hi>traction,</hi> or both. At the firſt he was for <hi>both conjunct, pulſion</hi> of the Air, and <hi>traction</hi> of the Atomes from the Earth: But of this he repented, as ſeeing <hi>impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionem aeris nullam eſſe:</hi> and was for the traction of Atoms alone. (Than which, his Friends conceit of the pulſive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sun in its Diaſtole or whatever other motion, is the cauſe, doth ſeem leſs abſurd.) But that man that would have me believe that if a Rock were in the air, or if <hi>Pauls</hi> Steeple ſhould fall, the deſcent would be only by the traction of the <hi>hamuli</hi> of inviſible Atomes, (or by the pulſion of Air and Sun conjunct) muſt come neerer firſt, and tell me how the <hi>hamuli</hi> of atomes can faſten upon a marble rock? and how they come to have ſo much ſtrength as to
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:59459:285"/>
move that rock (which no man can move in its proper place) if there be no ſuch thing as <hi>ſtrength</hi> or power beſides actual motion? and why it is that thoſe <hi>drawing atomes</hi> do move ſo powerfully Earthwards, when at the ſame time it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that as many or more atomes are moving <hi>upwards</hi> by the Suns attraction, and more are moved circularly with the Earth? why do not theſe ſtop or hinder one another? and why doth not the Rock as well go upward with the aſcending atomes? And when the Rock deſcendeth, doth it carry down none of the aſcendants with it? As likely as for the deſcendants to carry down it. Are thoſe atomes that carry down the Rock, more powerfull than an hundred thouſand men, who could not lift it up at all; much leſs ſo ſwiftly? And why do not the ſame (partial) atomes, bear down a Feather, or the Birds that fly quietly in the air? And why feel <hi>we</hi> not the power of their motion <hi>upon us?</hi> How eaſily can ſome men believe any thing, while they think that their increaſe of wiſdom lyeth in believing no more than evidence conſtraineth them to? If <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> his inſtance of the Load-ſtone put under the ballance to increaſe the <hi>pondus</hi> of the Iron, prove any thing, it will prove ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than a traction of the hooked atomes, even the traction of <hi>Nature</hi> that needeth no hooks.</p>
               <p>And mark,<note place="margin">Thoſe that fly to this <hi>ingenita diſpoſitio vel pondus,</hi> will in other words grant that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, form or quality which they deny. And thoſe that grant no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to move but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer motion, muſt needs make ſome degrees of motion daily to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh in the World, one thing or other ſtill ceaſing its motion; and all motion within our knowledge having ſuch conſtant impedition, that before this time we may think all things would have ſtood ſtill, if their opinion were true. If they ſay that the Sun or ſome ſuperior Movers renew the motion of things inferior, I grant it; But that is becauſe it hath a moving nature: For if they ſay, that the Sun it ſelf hath not the leaſt impedition to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the degrees of its motion, they ſpeak not only without any proof, but contrary to our obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all things known, and to their own opinion, who make the Air impeditive to other motions, and the <hi>effluvia</hi> of other Globes to be impeditive to the Sun.</note> I pray you, what <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> granteth, when he ſaith [<hi>

It is granted us then that when a moveable or active being is ſtopt from motion, it doth not thereby loſe its <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile</hi> or active nature or diſpoſition: And ſo, that it is not only <hi>motion</hi> that cauſeth motion; But that there is <hi>in ato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis mobilitas ingenita,</hi> which continueth when the motion
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:59459:285"/>
ceaſeth. You'l ſay perhaps, that he meaneth only a <hi>paſſive receptivity</hi> by which one thing is eaſier moved by an exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior cauſe than another. But you miſtake him: for he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not <hi>mobilitas ingenita</hi> only paſſively, but alſo actively, and therefore ſaith, that <hi>[it endeavoureth to move and free it ſelf.]</hi> And lib. 5. c. 2. he ſaith, <hi>[Non motus ſed impetus, ab initio perſeverat; vel niſus perpetuus.]</hi> which is as much as I deſire now.

               <p>And indeed, it doth not only overpaſs our Reaſon, but contradict it, that meer <hi>ſubtilty</hi> of matter, or <hi>ſmallneſs</hi> of particles, ſhould be all the cauſe of motion that is found in the matter it ſelf. Muſt we believe that an <hi>Alcohol impal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palile</hi> of Marble or Gold, if it could but be anatomized more, would be as moveable as fire; or would thereby turn to fire it ſelf: or as active as the Vital and Intellectual Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; yea turned to ſuch a thing it ſelf: If all matter was <hi>Atomes</hi> at firſt, then all was <hi>fire,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> was of <hi>one kinde,</hi> and equally moveable: And what hath made the difference ſince? And if you will feign that God made ſome parts Atomes, and ſome parts more groſs; or that he diſtinguiſhed matter <hi>ab initio into Carteſius his materia ſubtilis, globuli aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rei,</hi> and groſſer matter, why may not we better ſay, that the ſame Creator hath diſtinguiſhed matter by different <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> and <hi>powers,</hi> which we finde them poſſeſſed of? And by what proof do you diſtinguiſh matter into thoſe three degrees, or ſorts, any more than into two, or four, or ſix, or ten, or ten hundred? who can chooſe but ſhake the head, to ſee wiſe Philoſophers thus impoſe upon the world? and at the ſame time ſay, It is the firſt duty of a man that would be wiſe, to believe no more than by evidence he is forced to? Yea, and at the ſame time to ſay, Theſe are but our Hypotheſes, which ſaith one, I acknowledge to be falſe, and ſaith another, I cannot ſay is true: and yet they are our foundation; and from theſe our Philoſophical Verities reſult; which muſt make you wiſe, who muſt believe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without proof.

Is not this <hi>inclination</hi> then ſomewhat different from motion? If you tell me again of nothing but the inviſible tractive hooked atomes, I adviſe you to involve a thouſand pound of Lead in a ſufficient Caſe of Feathers, which it ſeems are charmed from the power or touch of atomes, and try then whether it be no heavier than the Feathers are? The ſame I may ſay of a Spring of Steel which is wound up in a ſtanding Watch, or other Engine. There is no proof of any motion: and yet there is a <hi>Conatus</hi> different from motion. You'l ſay perhaps that the particles in the Steel are all in motion, among themſelves: but when will you prove it? and prove alſo that they are ſo in the Lead or Rock that by Gravity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth to deſcent? and prove alſo that the particles are moved by an extrinſick mover only, and have no principle of motion in themſelves?</p>
               <p>Moreover, what think you is the nature of all our <hi>Habits?</hi> Is there nothing in a <hi>Habit</hi> but actual motion?

Let a Muſician, an Aſtronomer, a Phyſician, try! whether they will not, return more expert than an Ideot? what then is this <hi>Habit?</hi> It is not <hi>actual motion</hi> it ſelf? Elſe it would be totally extinct when the motion is but for an hour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted. If you ſay, that there is <hi>other</hi> motion in us ſtill, to renew it: I anſwer, why ſhould that other, (<hi>e.g.</hi> the motion of the Lungs or Heart, or the Circulation of the blood) make you an Artiſt the next morning, any more than your Neighbour, if that were all? You'l grant, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that a Habit is ſomewhat diſtinct from <hi>Motion,</hi> but it is the <hi>Effect</hi> of it only, and one of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> which we ſay that <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>motion</hi> are ſufficient for.

I anſwer, Do you deny that <hi>a Habit</hi> doth it ſelf conduce to <hi>future motion,</hi> or not? If not, it is no Habit: If yea, then as to <hi>future actions</hi> there is more than matter and motion needfull: and the Principles are more: And then what reaſon have you to contradict us, who finding ſome Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in Nature which conduce to motion as much and more than Habits do, do aſſert ſuch Principles? And how know you that former motion proceedeth not from ſuch Natures, or Principles, when you confeſs that <hi>later</hi> motions do ſo? If you ſay that <hi>Habits</hi> are nothing but a <hi>Curſus motuum,</hi> as of water that by running in a certain Channell is inclined to run that way again: I anſwer, They are certainly ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that remain when the action ceaſeth; and therefore are an <hi>Inclination ad agendum,</hi> as well as a <hi>curſus actionum</hi>; And they are ſomething that are active Principles, and not only ſo many Channels which the Spirits have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the brains and nerves: Otherwiſe the numberleſs variety of objects would ſo furrow and channel the brain that they would conſume it, (as <hi>gutta cavat lapidem, &amp;c.</hi>)</p>

done, of the true cauſe of ſenſe in matter and motion. They know our argument, but I could never yet underſtand how they anſwer it. We ſay that <hi>Nihil dat quod non habet, vel formaliter vel eminenter.</hi> (All the objections againſt this <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xim</hi> they may find anſwered (beſides others) in <hi>Campanella, de ſenſu rerum.</hi>) <hi>Atoms,</hi> as <hi>matter,</hi> have no ſenſe: they ſmart not, they ſee not, they feel no <hi>delight,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Formaliter</hi> you will not imagine that they have ſenſe: and they cannot have it. <hi>eminenter,</hi> being not above it, but below it; and ſhewing us nothing that doth tranſcend it, or is like it. And <hi>motion</hi> is no ſubſtance, but a mode of matter, and therefore hath it ſelf no ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Object <hi>Doth not</hi> Campanella, Teleſius, <hi>&amp;c. argue, that all things have ſenſe?</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Their fanaticiſms are no part of our Phyſical Creed. 2. They mean, when all is done, but this much, that there is ſome Image or Participation of Life in Inanimates, of Senſe in Vegetatives, of Reaſon in Senſitives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Intellection in Rationals. 3. As it is ſaid in the <hi>Myſtic. Aegypt. &amp; Chald. Philoſ.</hi> aſcribed to <hi>Ariſtotle, [Et ſi quibuſdam videtur quod elementa habent Animam, illa eſt aliena adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titiaque eis. Cumque ſint viva, vita illis eſt accidentaria, non naturalis: alioquin forent inalterabilia.] l.</hi> 12. <hi>c.</hi> 11. So the <hi>Sticks</hi> deifi'd the fire, and made it Intellectual; but it was not as it is <hi>matter,</hi> but as they ſuppoſed it animated with an intellectual form. So many of the ancients thought, that the Angels were compounded of an <hi>intellectual form</hi> or <hi>ſoul,</hi> and of a <hi>fiery</hi> or <hi>aethereal body.</hi> But it is only the body that we are now enquiring of. Have <hi>atoms</hi> ſenſe? doth <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter feel</hi> or <hi>ſee</hi> as ſuch?</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>We ſay not that all matter or atoms have ſenſe, but only ſome part of it, which by motion is ſubtilized.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Still <hi>nihil dat quod non habet</hi>; you grant then that <hi>matter</hi> as <hi>ſuch</hi> hath no ſenſe at all. Elſe the argument would hold <hi>ad omnem.</hi> And if it have none as <hi>matter, motion</hi> can give it none as <hi>meer motion</hi>; for motion hath not ſenſe to give. Let motion attenuate the matter, and ſubtilize it, it is but <hi>matter</hi> ſtill; and it can be no leſs than atoms. Therefore ſhew us how <hi>materia ſubtilis,</hi> or <hi>atoms,</hi> ſhould <hi>feel</hi> or <hi>ſee,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the <hi>ſubtility</hi> or <hi>parvity,</hi> and by its magnitude or groſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

loſe that ſenſe. Tell us <hi>how</hi> and <hi>why</hi> the change of meer magnitude and figure ſhould make a thing <hi>feel</hi> that felt not before. If you difference not <hi>matter</hi> by ſome <hi>natural</hi> difference of <hi>forms,</hi> or <hi>properties</hi> and <hi>virtues,</hi> you will never ſpeak ſenſe in proving ſenſe to be in <hi>matter,</hi> by meer ato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mizing it, or moving it. The alkohol of Marble feeleth no more than the ſolid ſtone; nor the air than the earth, for any proof that we have of it. The boys that whip their tops, and the women that turn their wheels ſo ſwiftly, that the motion ſhall not be diſcerned,<note place="margin">Sane ignis, aër, aqua, terra, ſuapte natura carent anima: &amp; cui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque horum adeſt anima, hoc vita utitur peregrina: Alia vero praeter haec nulla ſunt corpora. <hi>Plotin.

What the learned Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> hath ſaid of this againſt Mr. <hi>Hobs,</hi> I refer you to peruſe, and excuſe me for tranſcribing it. <hi>Scaliger, Sennertus,</hi> and many others, have heretofore challenged theſe Philoſophers, to ſhew the world how <hi>atoms</hi> by <hi>motion,</hi> or elements by mixture, can get that ſenſe which neither <hi>matter, motion</hi> nor <hi>mixture</hi> have; but we can meet with no account of it yet worth the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: not by <hi>Carteſius,</hi> not by <hi>Regius</hi> or <hi>Berigardus,</hi> not by <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> nor any other that we can get and read. How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfactory is it to tell us that <hi>facultas ſentiendi &amp; movendi, quae anima ſenſitiva vulgo dicitur, eſt partium animalis in ſpiritus, nervos &amp; alia ſenſoria, &amp;c. talis attemperatio &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formatio, qua animal ab objectis variis motibus affici poteſt</hi>; as <hi>Regius, l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 267. This is an eaſie ſolving of the Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena indeed. But <hi>qualis eſt illa contemperatio? &amp; quomodo poteſt contemperantia inſenſibilium, ſenſibile conſtituere? Nonne dat iſta contemperatio quod non habet?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Perhaps you will ſay with him in <hi>Cicer. de Nat. Deor.</hi> that by <hi>this argument God muſt be a Fidler, becauſe he maketh men that are ſuch. Anſw.</hi> By this argument no fidler, nor any other man, hath more wiſdom than God, or can do that which God cannot do: but becauſe God is <hi>above</hi> him in his skill, doth it follow that the names which ſignifie hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane imperfection muſt be put on God? Can God enable a man to that which he is not <hi>able</hi> to do himſelf, and can he give that which he hath not to give?</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>None of the parts of a clock can tell the hour of the day, and yet all ſet together can: and none of the letters of a book are Philoſophy, and yet the whole may be a learned ſyſtem:
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:59459:288"/>
and no atoms in a Lute can make melody, as the whole can do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is but to play with words. In all theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances the whole hath nothing of a higher kind in nature than the ſeveral parts, but only a compoſition by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution of each part. The clock telleth you nothing but <hi>per modum ſigni</hi>; and that <hi>ſignum</hi> is only in the <hi>ſound,</hi> or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>motion.</hi> And <hi>ſound</hi> and <hi>motion</hi> belongeth to the whole, by vertue or contribution of the parts, and is not another thing above them. And that the motion is ſo ordered, and that man can by it collect the time of the day, is from the power of our underſtandings, and not from the matter of the engine at all. So the book is no otherwiſe Philoſophy at all, but <hi>per modum ſigni:</hi> which <hi>ſignum</hi> is related to <hi>mans under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> both as the <hi>cauſe</hi> and <hi>orderer,</hi> and as the <hi>receiver</hi> and <hi>apprehender.</hi> So that the letters do nothing at all, but paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively ſerve the mind of man. And ſo it is in the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: the ſtrings do but move the air, and cauſe the ſound which is in the ear: that this is <hi>melody,</hi> is cauſed only by the <hi>mind</hi> of man, who firſt <hi>frameth,</hi> and then <hi>orderly moveth</hi> them, and then <hi>ſuo modo</hi> receiveth the ſound, and maketh melody by the aptitude of his apprehenſion. If you had proved that Clock, or Book, or Lute do make themſelves, and order and uſe themſelves, and know the time, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand or delight in themſelves, you had done ſomething. But by the deceitful names of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> and <hi>Melody,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the bare natural ſound and ſign, with that <hi>ordering</hi> and that <hi>reception,</hi> which is the priviledge of a <hi>mind,</hi> is unfit for a Philoſopher.</p>

               <p>But to talk no more of <hi>probabilities</hi> to you, we have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain proof that man is an <hi>intellectual free agent,</hi> whoſe ſoul you can never prove to be corporeal, and whoſe power of <hi>intellection</hi> and <hi>volition</hi> is diſtinct from corporal motion. And we have proof that there are ſuperior <hi>Intelligences</hi> more noble than we, by the operations which they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed upon things below.</p>
               <p>And what ſhould move you (who ſeem not to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much Divine, and who ſeem to obſerve the order and harmony of the creatures) to imagine, that God doth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alone, without any inſtrument or ſecond cauſe, <hi>move</hi> all the corporeal matter of the world? If you are ſerious in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that God <hi>himſelf</hi> doth move and govern all, why do you queſtion, whether he make uſe of any nobler natures next him, to move things corporeal. And why do you againſt your own inclinations, make every action to be done
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:59459:290"/>
by God alone? I doubt not but he doth all: but you ſee that he chooſeth to communicate honour and agency to his creatures. He uſeth the Sun to move things on earth. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you believe that corporeal beings ſtand at ſo infinite a diſtance from his perfections, you may eaſily judge that he hath ſome more noble; and that the nobleſt are the moſt potent and active and rule the more ignoble: as you ſee the nobler bodies (as the Sun) to have power upon the more ignoble. Therefore to violate the harmony of God's works, and to deny all the ſteps of the ladder ſave the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, is but an unhappy ſolving of Phaenomena.</p>
               <p>Nay, mark what you grant us: you confeſs God to have <hi>Power, Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> and that he is incorporeal, and moveth all: and you confeſs that man hath in his kind <hi>Power, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> and <hi>Will</hi>; and is there any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that's liker God? If not, do you not allow us to take theſe faculties for <hi>incorporeal?</hi> and that thoſe are ſo that are higher than we?</p>
               <p n="8">8. And you ſeem to us by your Philoſophy to write of Nature, as the Atheiſt writeth of God; inſtead of explaining it, you deny it. What is <hi>Nature</hi> but the <hi>principium motus &amp; quietis? &amp;c.</hi>

                  <pb n="520" facs="tcp:59459:291"/>And ſo you level all things in the world: you deny all ſpecifick forms, or natural faculties and virtues.

               <p>Yea, you make all motion to be violent, and deny all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per natural motion at all: for that which hath no active principle of motion in its nature, hath no proper natural motion as diſtinct from violent.</p>
               <p>Hereby alſo you deny all <hi>vital powers</hi>: you make a living creature and a dead to differ but in the manner of motion; (which whether you can at all explain, we know not) why may not the arrow which I ſhoot, or the watch which I wind up, be ſaid to live as well as you? It hath matter and motion; and ſome inanimates (the Air and Fire) perhaps have as ſubtil matter and as ſpeedy motion, as is in you. Why doth not the wind make the air alive, and the bellows the fire? In a word, you deny all Intelligences, all Souls, all Lives, all Natures, all active Qualities and Forms; all Powers, Faculties, Inclinations, Habits and Diſpoſitions, that are any principles of motion: and ſo all the natural excellency and difference of any creature above the reſt. A ſhort way of ſolving the Phaenomena.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, with <hi>Nature</hi> you deny the being of <hi>Morality.</hi> For if there be no difference of Beings, but in quantity, figure, motion and ſite; and all motion is Locomotion, which moveth by natural neceſſitating force, than a man moveth as a ſtone, becauſe it is irreſiſtibly moved, and hath no power to forbear any act which it performeth, or to do it otherwiſe than it doth. For if there be no <hi>power, habits</hi> or <hi>diſpoſitions,</hi> antecedent to motion, but <hi>motion</hi> it ſelf is all, then there is one and the ſame account to be given of all actions, good and bad, I did it becauſe I was irreſiſtibly moved to it, and could no more do otherwiſe than my pen can chooſe to write. There is then no virtue or vice, no place for Laws and moral Government, further than they may be tacklings in the engine which neceſſitateth: whatſoever is done amiſs, is as much imputable to God the firſt mover, as that which
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:59459:291"/>
is done-well. If you ſhoot an arrow which killeth your friend, the arrow could not hinder it: if you make or ſet your watch amiſs, though one motion cauſeth another, yet the errour of all is reſolved into the defect of the firſt cauſe. They that killed <hi>Henry</hi> the 3. and <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. Kings of <hi>France,</hi> may ſay, that as the knife could not reſiſt the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their hand, ſo neither could they the motion of the ſuperiour cauſe that moved them, and ſo on to the firſt. No Traitors or Rebels can reſiſt the power which acteth them therein, any more than the duſt can reſiſt the wind which ſtirreth it up. And ſo you ſee what cometh of all the Government of God and Man, and of all Laws and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Juſtice and Injuſtice, Right and Wrong. And how little cauſe you have to be angry with the Thief that robbeth you, or the man that cudgelleth you, any more than with the ſtaff. But of this I refer you to the foreſaid writing of Biſhop <hi>Bromhal</hi> againſt Mr. <hi>Hobs,</hi> allowing you to make the moſt you can of his Reply.</p>
               <p>We are certain by the <hi>operations</hi> of things, that there is a difference in their <hi>natural powers</hi> and <hi>virtues,</hi> and not only in their quantity, figure and motion. God hath not made only homogeneal undifferenced matter: there are plainly now exceeding diverſities of natural excellencies, virtues and qualities in the things we ſee. And he that will ſay that by motion only God made this difference at firſt, doth but preſumptuouſly ſpeak without book, without all proof to make it credible, and taketh on him to know that which he knoweth that he knoweth not. Is not the <hi>virtue</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> of things as laudable, as their quantity and motion? Why then ſhould we imagine ſo vaſt a diſproportion in the image of God upon his works, as to acknowledge the <hi>magnitude</hi> and <hi>motion</hi> incomprehenſible, and to think that in <hi>virtue</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> they are all alike, and none is more noble or more like himſelf than a clod of earth? We ſee that the <hi>natures</hi> of all things are ſuited to their ſeveral uſes. <hi>Operari ſequitur eſſe,</hi> Things act as they <hi>are.</hi> There is ſomewhat in the <hi>nature</hi> of a bird, or beaſt, or plant, which is their fitneſs to their various motions. If only motion made that fire to day, which yeſterday was but a ſtone, why doth not the ſtrongeſt wind ſo much as warm us? or why doth
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:59459:292"/>
it ſo much cool us? Why doth not the ſnow make us as warm as a fleece of wool? the wool doth move no more than the ſnow, and the matter of it appeareth to be no more ſubtil. Indeed <hi>man</hi> can give to none of <hi>his works</hi> a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> a <hi>life</hi> or <hi>virtue,</hi> for the operation which he deſireth. He can but alter the magnitude, and figure, and motion of things, and compound and mix them, and conjoyn them: and theſe <hi>Epicureans</hi> ſeem to judge of the works of God by mans. But he who is <hi>Being, Life</hi> and <hi>Intelligence,</hi> doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly animate his noble Engines, and give them <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> and <hi>vertues</hi> for their operations; and not only make uſe of <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>weight</hi> where he findeth it, as our Mechanicks themſelves can do. Debaſing all the nobleſt of Gods works, is unbeſeeming a true Philoſopher, who ſhould ſearch out the <hi>virtues</hi> and <hi>goodneſs,</hi> as well as the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>But I have been longer in anſwering this firſt Objection, than I can afford to be about the reſt, unleſs I would make a Book of this, which I call but the Concluſion. I will adde but this one thing more; That in caſe it were granted the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> that the ſoul is <hi>material,</hi> it will be no diſproving of its immortality, nor invalidate any of my former argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for a life of retribution after this. To which purpoſe conſider theſe things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That where <hi>matter</hi> is ſimple and not compounded, it hath no tendency to corruption. Object. <hi>Matter is diviſible, and therefore corruptible, how ſimple ſoever. Anſw.</hi> It is ſuch as <hi>may</hi> be divided, if God pleaſe, and ſo the ſoul is ſuch as God <hi>can</hi> deſtroy. But we ſee that all parts of matter have a wonderful tendency to <hi>unity,</hi> and have a tendency to a <hi>motus aggregativus</hi> if you ſeparate them. Earth inclineth to earth, and water to water, and air to air, and fire to fire. 2. All Philoſophers agree to what I ſay, who hold that <hi>matter</hi> is eternal, either <hi>à parte ante,</hi> or <hi>à parte poſt.</hi> For if <hi>matter</hi> be <hi>eternal,</hi> the <hi>ſoul's materiality</hi> may conſiſt with its <hi>eternity.</hi> 3. Yea all without exception do agree, that there is no <hi>annihilation</hi> of <hi>matter</hi> when there is a diſſolution. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the ſoul be a ſimple uncompounded being, though <hi>material,</hi> it will remain the ſame. This therefore is to be ſet down as granted us, by all the Infidels and Atheiſts in the world, that <hi>man's ſoul,</hi> what ever it is, <hi>is not annihilated
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:59459:292"/>
when he dieth, if it be any kind of ſubſtance material or imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial.</hi> And they that call his <hi>temperament</hi> his ſoul, do all acknowledge, that there is in the compoſition ſome one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant principle, more active or noble than the reſt; and of the duration of this it is that we enquire, which no man doth deny, though ſome deny it to be <hi>immaterial.</hi> But this will be further opened under the reſt of the Objections. The reaſons of my many words in anſwering this Objection, I give you in the words of a late learned Conciliator, <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophiae Platonicae explicationi diutius immorati ſumus, quod res maximas &amp; cognitione digniſſimas complectatur.

But our converſe with them doth teach all men to judge of their natures, as between both theſe extremes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by ſtudy and learning they learn to know leſs than they did before, and do but ſtudy to corrupt their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and obliterate things that are commonly known.

the Vegetatives have ſomething <hi>like</hi> to <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and the Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives have ſomething <hi>like</hi> to <hi>reaſon:</hi> but it doth not follow that therefore it is the <hi>ſame.</hi> But this is ſo copiouſly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of by very many, that I ſuperſede my further labour about it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If it were ſo, that the <hi>apprehenſions</hi> of a bruit might be called <hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Intellection,</hi> yet the difference betwixt it and humane <hi>Intellection</hi> is ſo great, as may eaſily prove to thoſe that have their reaſons in free uſe, that they are ſeveral ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of creatures, made for ſeveral uſes and ends. And none of the twenty Arguments which I uſed, are at all debilitated by this. If a bird have reaſon to build her neſt, and to feed her young, yet ſhe hath none to build Cities and Caſtles, nor to uſe Navigation, nor any of the Arts: much leſs to ſet up Government by Laws, and to write Syſtems of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy and other Sciences; and leaſt of all to enquire after God, the cauſe of all things, or to hope for bleſſedneſs in another life, or to eſcape a future miſery, or to be ruled in this life by the intereſt of another. Beaſts think not of God, nor of lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, ſeeking him, pleaſing him or enjoying him, or of being judged by him. I know the perverſe wrangler will ask me, How I know this? And I can anſwer him no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than thus: As I know that a Stone doth not ſee or feel, or that my Paper doth not talk; becauſe they <hi>manifeſt</hi> no ſuch thing: And theſe are all operations which they that exerciſe, are apt to manifeſt; and things that in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are unapt to be long hid. <hi>Campanella,</hi> who hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>de ſenſu rerum,</hi> to prove Bruits Rational, and Plants ſenſible, hath yet in his <hi>Atheiſmus Triumphatus</hi> written more for the excellency of humane nature and the Souls im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality; than any Infidel can ſoundly anſwer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And how prove you, that the Souls of Bruits exiſt not, after death?<note place="margin">See Sir <hi>W.

And are you ſure that no <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is <hi>indiviſible</hi>? And that no ſpiritual incorporeal ſubſtance is quantitative, extended, or diviſible? It now goeth for current that <hi>Light</hi> is a <hi>Body</hi>: And <hi>Patricius</hi> that ſo judgeth, doth take it to be indiviſible <hi>in longitudine radiorum,</hi> and to be penetrable; and that it can penetrate other bodies. And it's hard to be ſure that Diaphanous bodies are not penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated by Light. I know <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> and others think that it paſſeth but through the pores of the Glaſs or Chryſtal: But I have heard of no Engyſcope that hath perceived pores in Glaſs. In Cloth they are certainly diſcernable, and large, and numerous, when yet the Light doth not penetrate it as it doth the Glaſs: <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> ſaith, the reaſon is, becauſe the pores of the Glaſs and other diaphanous bodies, are all one way, ſo that the Light is not intercepted by their irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity: And he giveth us a proof of his opinion, becauſe that if you ſet white Papers on each ſide the Glaſs, there will be umbels on one ſide, and light reflected on the other.

The <hi>fiery nature</hi> ſeemeth as <hi>Patricius</hi> ſaith to be ſome middle thing between <hi>corporal</hi> and <hi>incorporeal.</hi> And I much doubt whether <hi>Materia</hi> be a <hi>ſummum genus</hi>; and whether the <hi>loweſt degree</hi> of <hi>things incorporeal,</hi> and the <hi>higheſt degree of things corporeal,</hi> (ſuppoſe fire, or that which is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Sun) do differ ſo much more than <hi>Graduals,</hi> as that mortals can ſay, that one of them is <hi>penetrable</hi> and <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible,</hi> and the other not. There have been ſome Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers that have thought that <hi>ſenſibility</hi> was as fit an attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to characterize <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Bodies</hi> by, as any other; But then they meant not by <hi>[ſenſible]</hi> that which <hi>Man</hi> can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by ſenſe: But that which is a fit object for <hi>ſenſes</hi> of the ſame kinde as mans, ſuppoſing them elevated to the greateſt perfection that they are capable of in their kinde.

               <p>For my part I profeſs, that as my underſtanding is fully ſatisfied by the operations and effects, that there are ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible potent ſubſtances, which we call <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Spirits,</hi> ſo it is utterly unſatisfied in the common properties of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrability</hi> and <hi>Impenetrability, Extenſion,</hi> or <hi>diſcerptibility,</hi> and <hi>indiſcerptibility</hi> or <hi>indiviſibility,</hi> as the Characters to know them by.

And I remember not what apt word we have inſtead of <hi>matter</hi> to ſupply its place in Latine, which taketh not in the notion of the <hi>Form</hi>: For the word <hi>Matter</hi> ſignifieth no real Being, but only a partial inadequate Conception of Real Beings <hi>quoad hoc,</hi> which have all ſomething more which is eſſential to them.

At leaſt <hi>ſome agreement</hi> there is; and of <hi>Spirits</hi> which are of <hi>different forms</hi> or <hi>ſpecies,</hi> there muſt be ſome <hi>one name</hi> for that in which they ſtill agree. If you ſay that it is in <hi>[ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance]</hi> you muſt then take <hi>ſubſtance</hi> as we do <hi>matter</hi> for an <hi>inadequate conception,</hi> or only the <hi>pars inteligibilis</hi> of a being as without the <hi>form</hi>; But that is not the common acception of it; nor is it then fit for the place aſſigned it <hi>in ordine praedicamentali.</hi>

               <p>From all this I am not about to injure any mans under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, by building my Concluſions upon any queſtionable grounds: I do but right your underſtandings ſo far, as to remove all uncertain foundations, though they be ſuch as ſeem to be moſt for the advantage of my Cauſe, and are by moſt made the great reaſons of the Souls Immortality.

               <p>To come neerer to the application of what is ſaid to the preſent Objection. 1. The Souls of Men and Bruits, we ſee do not differ <hi>in genere entis,</hi> nor <hi>in genere ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi> nor <hi>in genere principii vitalis,</hi> nor <hi>in genere ſentientis</hi>; 2. The <hi>matter</hi> of both, whether it differ as Metaphyſical and Phyſical, or how, is much beyond our knowledge. 3. The great diverſity of <hi>Operations,</hi> doth ſhew the great diverſity of their <hi>Powers</hi> and forms, and inclinations. 4. This ſheweth the diverſity of their uſes and ends for which they were created. 5. It is certain, that no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Principle in either of them is annihilated at death. The Souls of <hi>Bruits</hi> have the ſame <hi>nature</hi> after death as they had before, and the <hi>Souls</hi> of men have the <hi>ſame nature</hi> as before. They are not transformed into other things. 6. Therefore about both of them, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left of doubt or controverſie, but only 1. About the perpetuated <hi>Individuation,</hi> 2. The <hi>future Operations</hi> (and ſo the <hi>habits</hi>); viz. 1. <hi>Whether</hi> the <hi>Souls</hi> of <hi>men</hi> or <hi>bruits,</hi> or both, do loſe their <hi>individuation,</hi> and fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Element</hi> of their <hi>kinde?</hi> 2. <hi>Whether they operate after death</hi> as now? There is nothing elſe about their Immortality that common Reaſon can make a queſtion of. And for the <hi>Souls</hi> of <hi>Bruits,</hi> whether they remain <hi>Individuate,</hi> or return to a common <hi>Element</hi> of their kinde, is a thing <hi>unknown</hi> to us, becauſe unrevealed; and unrevealed, becauſe it is of no uſe and concernment to us. Our <hi>own caſe</hi> concerneth us more, and therefore is more made known to us by God. As will further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in that which followeth.</p>

it is granted us, and is certain, that in all <hi>mixed beings,</hi> there is a difference of the conſtitutive parts: as the <hi>fiery nature</hi> (ſuch as the <hi>Sun</hi> is of) is <hi>active</hi> in compariſon of the other three Elements, which to it are <hi>paſſive</hi>; ſo the <hi>vital prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> in <hi>bruits</hi> is <hi>active, powerful</hi> and <hi>regent,</hi> as to the reſt of the compounding parts. And it's certain, that the name of a <hi>[form]</hi> is by contenders taken, ſometime for that <hi>regent active principle</hi> or <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> (be it what it will) and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time for the <hi>temperament</hi> reſulting from all the parts. In Engines where there is no principle or part which is notably predominant, the name of the <hi>[form]</hi> is given to the <hi>ordered conjunction</hi> of all the parts. So in a <hi>Watch,</hi> the <hi>ſpring,</hi> though the beginning of motion, is not ſo fitly called the <hi>form</hi> of the watch, as the <hi>order of the whole frame.</hi> But in living things, there is more room for a competition between the <hi>regent part</hi> and the <hi>temperament,</hi> which of them ſhould be called the <hi>form.</hi> Now it is undeniable with all men, that both in men and bruits, that <hi>regent principle</hi> is a <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> and that the <hi>contemperation</hi> or <hi>order</hi> of the <hi>parts</hi> is but their <hi>mode,</hi> and maketh no other kind of being than <hi>Ordo Civitatis vel Reipublicae</hi> is, which ceaſeth upon the diſſolution.

He that will conſider them well may ſuſpect, that they mean as I conjecture. An active power or principle being the chief cauſe of operations, alterations and diſcrimination, is the thing that they all mean by all theſe names. And the followers of <hi>Democritus,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> and <hi>Carteſius,</hi> do not improbably argue that it is ſome <hi>ſubſtantial being</hi> which maketh that change or effect upon our <hi>ſenſes,</hi> which as <hi>there received</hi> is a <hi>quality.</hi> So that unleſs Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> can better tell us what <hi>lux, &amp; calor,</hi> are, than by calling them <hi>Qualities,</hi> he hath given the underſtanding no ſatisfaction at all.

               <p>I conclude, that for all that is here ſaid, and whether you call them our <hi>forms</hi> or not, (as you <hi>may</hi> or <hi>may not,</hi> in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſenſes) <hi>humane ſouls</hi> are thoſe parts of man which are <hi>ſimple, pure, inviſible, active, powerful ſubſtances</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being not annihilated, muſt needs ſubſiſt in their ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated ſtate.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I have already ſaid, that if you proved the ſoul material, it would not prove it <hi>mortal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As the <hi>body</hi> hath various <hi>operations,</hi> ſo it is moved by various <hi>principles</hi> or <hi>powers.</hi> As to <hi>locomotion,</hi> and perhaps <hi>vegetation,</hi> the <hi>materia ſubtilii,</hi> or fineſt <hi>atoms,</hi> as you will
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:59459:303"/>
call it, or the <hi>fiery matter</hi> in the ſpirits, as I would call it, is an active being, which hath a natural power to move it ſelf and the reſt. But whether that motion do ſuffice to <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,</hi> is undecided. But certainly there is another inward principle of motion, which <hi>guideth</hi> much of the <hi>locomotive,</hi> and over-ruleth ſome of the <hi>natural motion,</hi> by a <hi>peculiar action</hi> of its own, which is called <hi>Intellection</hi> and <hi>Volition,</hi> as I have proved before. When I go to the Church, when I write, or talk, the ſpirits are the neareſt ſufficient principle of the <hi>motion</hi> as <hi>motion</hi>: but as it is done in this <hi>manner,</hi> to this <hi>end,</hi> at this <hi>time,</hi> with theſe reaſons, it is from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual principle.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And thus I deny the major Propoſition. And I prove the contrary. 1. God is the firſt principle of all motion in the world, and the firſt cauſe of material motion, and yet is not material. 2. What the lower and baſer nature can do, that the higher and nobler hath power to do, <hi>(ſuppoſitis ſupponendis)</hi> therefore if a body can move a body, a ſoul can do it much more.</p>
               <p>But, ſaith <hi>Gaſſendus, Cauſis ſecundis primum agendi prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipium eſt Atomorum varia mobilitas ingenita, non incorporea aliqua ſubſtantia.

Et quum eſt ſentiens, vegetans, praeditaque vi corporum motrice atque adeo corporea eſt, elicere actiones corporeas, &amp;c.</hi> And of Angels and Devils he ſaith, <hi>That it is known by faith only that they are incorporeal, and perhaps God gave them extraordinary bodies, when he would have them move or act on bodies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, 1. Who gave thoſe atoms their <hi>ingenite mobility,</hi> and <hi>how?</hi> You ſay that <hi>captum omnem fugit ut
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:59459:304"/>
quippiam aliud moveat, ſi in ſeipſo immotum maneat.</hi> If ſo, then it ſeemeth, that either God was moved when he moved atoms, or that he never moved them. How then came they to be moved firſt? But you confeſs that God put into them their mobility.

If the reaſon why incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal ſpirits cannot move bodies be that which you alledge, (becauſe only a body can be applied to a body to make im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on it) then God can leſs move a body than man's ſoul can; becauſe his pureſt eſſence is more diſtant from corporeal groſsneſs than our ſouls are. At leaſt, the reaſon would be the ſame. And to ſay that God is every where, and of infinite vertues, maketh him nevertheleſs a Spirit: and created ſpirits (if that be enough) may have power or vertue enough for ſuch an effect. Doubtleſs if God move bodies, the ſpirituality of an agent hindereth not the motion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But why ſhould it <hi>captum omnem ſuperare,</hi> that a <hi>nobler</hi> and more potent nature can do that, which a more ignoble can do? Becauſe I cannot know how a ſpirit by contact can apply it ſelf to matter, ſhall I dream that therefore it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of moving bodies? Clean contrary, I ſee that matter of it ſelf is an unactive thing: and were it not that the noble active element of fire, (which as a lower ſoul to the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive matter, and a thing almoſt middle between a ſpirit and a body) did move things here below, I could diſcern no motion in the world, but that which ſpirits cauſe, except only that of the <hi>parts to the whole,</hi> the aggregative motion which tendeth to reſt. The difference of underſtandings is very ſtrange: it is much eaſier to me to apprehend, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all motion ſhould come from the pureſt, powerful, active, vital natures, than that they ſhould be all unable to ſtir a ſtraw, or move the air, or any body.</p>

To which may be added, that <hi>Abſtractive Knowledge</hi> is either <hi>per ſpeciem propriam,</hi> or <hi>per ſpeciem alienam:</hi> In this life the Soul knoweth its own acts either <hi>Intuitively</hi> or by an act, if poſſible, yet <hi>neerer</hi> to its <hi>eſſential power,</hi> that hath no uſual diſtinguiſhing name.

                  <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> might have thought on it, whether it be not an <hi>Idea in the Intellect,</hi> if not <hi>without</hi> the <hi>phantaſie,</hi> at leaſt <hi>over and above</hi> the <hi>Idea</hi> in the <hi>Imagination,</hi> when he denieth that there is any ſuch Intellective Idea's.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p>Yet after all this, I am much of their mind, who think that it is not actual knowledge that is born with us; nor is there any true Idea or picture of any thing innate in our underſtandings; and I think that if <hi>per poſſibile vel impoſſibile,</hi> you ſuppoſe a man born without any one ſenſe, that he would have had no actual knowledge at all, (though that is uncertain.)

But all this only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, that the ſenſes reception is the way to the intellection of things ſenſible; and that it was a neceſſary <hi>occaſion, ſine qua non,</hi> to the perception of our <hi>own intellectual act,</hi> becauſe thus neceſſary to the <hi>act it ſelf</hi>: But not that any <hi>Idea</hi> of our <hi>own Intellection,</hi> or any of <hi>all the things</hi> fore-inſtanced, was received through the ſenſes.</p>

If you well conſidered, that you know in any reſpect little more of things corporeal, and in ſome reſpects much leſs.

The ſame I may ſay both of <hi>Qualities</hi> in general, and of all other in particular, except <hi>figure,</hi> which
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:59459:310"/>
properly belongeth not to the predicament. Of all the reſt there is the like diſagreement; even <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place,</hi> which truly are <hi>nothing</hi> but <hi>entia rationis,</hi> are debaſed by you in the firſt place, and are two of <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> his four predicaments. About the number either of <hi>principles</hi> or <hi>elements,</hi> there is no agreement; no nor what any one of the elements are: Who hath told us what is the form of <hi>earth,</hi> or <hi>water,</hi> or <hi>air,</hi> or deſcribed them otherwiſe than by their qualities? And then differ you as much about thoſe qualities. Who hath told us any thing of the <hi>naked matter</hi> or <hi>form</hi> of <hi>fire</hi> (ſuch as the Sun and Luminaries are)? any otherwiſe than by its <hi>acts,</hi> and <hi>powers</hi> or vertues of <hi>Motion, Light</hi> and <hi>Heat,</hi> as we deſcribe to you the <hi>ſoul</hi> of man. And if you go to the inviſible part of matter, it would make a man rather <hi>ſick</hi> than <hi>wiſe,</hi> to read men <hi>provincias dare atomis,</hi> as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſpeaketh; and to think with what bold unreaſonable ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they <hi>number them,</hi> as ſhaped and figured; and figure and ſhape them to the uſes which they have feigned for them, and then uſe them and conduct them, and vary their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as confidently and ſeriouſly, as if they had given us any proof of any of this, and indeed expected to be believed. Nay, we muſt know how the <hi>corners</hi> of atoms (pardon the contradiction) came to be filed or worn off by motion, and ſo reduced to greater ſubtilty. And <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> after all the fabrick which he buildeth upon atoms, ſaith, <hi>[That atoms have not of themſelves a moving force, but from God's firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. §.</hi> 1. c. 8. p. 280. <hi>Non quod Deo neceſſe fuerit creare ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orſim atomos, quas deinceps in partes grandiores, grandioreſque ex his, mundus conſtaret, compingerit; ſed quod creans materiae maſſam, in corpuſcula exolubilem, atque adeo ex corpuſculis tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam minimis extremiſque particulis compoſitam, concreaſſe illi ipſa corpuſcula cenſentur.</hi> ib. So that they know not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed whether God created <hi>matter</hi> firſt in <hi>atoms</hi> disjunct, or in more large and bulky parts: and ſo whether <hi>motion</hi> did <hi>divide groſſer</hi> and <hi>greater parts</hi> into atoms, or whether it coagulated atoms into greater bodies. But the ſum is, that they only affirm, that what ever bodies God made, they are diviſible into <hi>atoms,</hi> that is, into parts by man indiviſible. A great myſtery ſure, that the whole is diviſible into ſmaller parts! And what the nearer is any man by this, for the
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:59459:310"/>
diſcerning of any of their wild hypotheſes? In a word, God hath given man knowledge for his benefit and uſe, to the ends of his being and life: and ſo far as we have uſe for it we may know all things about us; but to humour our wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton fancies he is not obliged. And becauſe we have more uſe for the faculties of our ſouls, than for fire and water, or any outward thing, he hath given us the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſureſt</hi> knowledge of them; whatſoever ſelf-contradicting <hi>Somatiſts</hi> ſay, to depreſs this knowledge, and advance that knowledge of Bodies, which their own diſagreements do confute. Sure I am, if that be a probable opinion which hath divers learned men for it, almoſt all things are probable in Philoſophy: and if that be <hi>improbable</hi> which hath multitudes of learned men againſt it, almoſt all things are improbable.</p>

If by <hi>[corruptible]</hi> you mean that which hath <hi>[à poſſe perire]</hi> or a <hi>certainty</hi> of periſhing, if God uphold it not, I grant it of the whole Creation. But if you mean that which in <hi>its nature</hi> is ſo <hi>fitted</hi> to <hi>diſſolution, periſhing</hi> or <hi>decay,</hi> as that God ſeemeth to <hi>intend</hi> it to ſuch an end; or muſt <hi>miraculouſly preſerve</hi> it, or elſe it will periſh; or that which <hi>eventually will periſh,</hi> then we muſt not ſo eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The word <hi>[generated]</hi> is of ſo great ambiguity, and <hi>generation</hi> it ſelf a thing ſo little underſtood by mortals, that this <hi>reaſon</hi> doth but carry the controverſie into the dark, and argue <hi>ab obſcuriore &amp; minùs noto</hi>; which is the way of a wrangler, and not of one that would reveal the truth. Either <hi>generation</hi> is the production of ſome new <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> not exiſtent before ſo much as in its <hi>matter</hi>; or it is only the <hi>compoſition</hi> of pre-exiſtent ſubſtances. If it be the later, then you may prove the poſſibility and probability of the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the frame, and ſeparation of thoſe ſeveral ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. But you will confeſs your ſelves, that each part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:59459:311"/>
its proper nature ſtill; and that if one were a more noble and active element than the reſt, it is not annihilated, but remaineth ſo ſtill without debaſement. Therefore if their opinion were true, who hold the pre-exiſtence of that pureſt part of man which we call his ſoul, (either in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon element, or individuate) no reaſon can think that the diſſolution doth any more than ſeparate the parts of man, and return that ſoul to its pre-exiſtent ſtate; where ſtill it will be as noble a creature as it was here.</p>
               <p>But if <hi>Generation</hi> do produce a <hi>ſubſtance de novo,</hi> which did no way pre-exiſt, then it is either a <hi>corporeal ſubſtance,</hi> or a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> or <hi>incorporeal:</hi> which ſoever it be, can you give any reaſon <hi>why this ſhould periſh</hi> at the diſſolution, any more than if it had pre-exiſted? If the <hi>nature</hi> of it be the ſame, why ſhould not the <hi>duration</hi> be the ſame? one of the two you will confeſs it, either a <hi>corporeal ſubſtance</hi> or an <hi>incorporeal,</hi> if it be at all a ſubſtance: and you confeſs that no <hi>ſubſtance</hi> is annihilated, or periſheth, otherwiſe than by diſſolution of parts. If the reaſon of your <hi>major</hi> be, becauſe the thing generated hath a beginning, and did <hi>oriri de novo,</hi> ſo did all <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>ſubſtances</hi> that be created. Or if you ſuppoſe them all from eternity, yet do but ſuppoſe them to be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and have had a beginning, and yet to be the ſame as <hi>if they had been eternal,</hi> and you will ſee that there will be the ſame reaſon to prove their continuance, as long as their <hi>nature</hi> and their <hi>dependance</hi> on <hi>God</hi> are both the ſame.</p>
               <p>But it may be you will form your objection better, and ſay, that <hi>Generation produceth no new ſubſtance, but only a compoſition, order and temperament of pre-exiſtent ſubſtances: But ſouls are generated:</hi> Ergo, <hi>They are no ſubſtances, but the order or temperament of pre-exiſtent ſubſtances.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I never ſaw any thing like a cogent proof of the <hi>major:</hi> and moſt Chriſtians think you can never prove the <hi>minor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>ſubſtance</hi> may be called <hi>new,</hi> either becauſe it is made of <hi>nothing,</hi> as in <hi>creation,</hi> or becauſe it ariſeth to its natural ſtate of perfection <hi>ex ſemine vel natura foecunda,</hi> where it was only <hi>virtually</hi> and <hi>ſeminally</hi> before.</p>
               <p>Before you can prove your <hi>major</hi> even in the firſt ſenſe, you muſt be better acquainted with the <hi>nature</hi> of God, and
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:59459:311"/>
of Spirits, and of Generation, than you are: I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine what ſhew of proof you can bring to prove, that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally no generation cauſeth a ſubſtance totally new, unleſs you will go to Scripture, (which you believe not) and plead from <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 1. that <hi>God then ended all his works, and therefore doth create no more.</hi> But, 1. He may cauſe them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally <hi>de novo,</hi> without ſuch a creation as is there ſpoken of: for he may by a ſtabliſhed Law of Nature adjoyn his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing influx to the act of a creature, (ordinarily) and ſo difference it from that proper creation. 2. No man can prove that God hath there ſaid one word to aſſure us, that he will never create any thing hereafter. Cannot a workman look on his houſe, and ſee that it is well done, and ſay, I have finiſhed it, without obliging him never to build another, nor to make any reparations of that as there is cauſe? May not God create a new Heaven and Earth? may he not create a new Star, or a new Plant or Animal, if he pleaſe, without the breaking of any word that he hath ſpoken? For my part, I never ſaw a word which I could diſcern to have any ſuch ſignification or importance. The argument from <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 1. is no better than theirs, who from Chriſt's <hi>conſummatum eſt</hi> do gather, that his death and burial which followed that word, were no part of his ſatisfactory meritorious humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, there have been both Philoſophers and Divines, who have thought, that God doth <hi>in omni inſtanti,</hi> properly create all things which he is ſaid to conſerve: of whom the one part do mean only, that the being of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is as dependant on his continual cauſation, as the life of the branches is on the tree: but that the <hi>ſame ſubſtance is continued,</hi> and not <hi>another daily made.</hi> But there are others who think, that all creatures who are <hi>in fluxu continuo,</hi> not <hi>per locomotum,</hi> but <hi>ab entitate ad nihilum,</hi> and that they are all but a continual emanation from God, which as it paſſeth from him tendeth to nothing, and new emanations do ſtill make ſuch a ſupply, as that the things may be called the ſame; as a River, whoſe waters paſs in the ſame Channel. As they think the beams or light of the Sun doth <hi>in omni inſtanti oriri &amp; feſtinare ad nihilum,</hi> the ſtream being ſtill ſupplied with new emanations. Were it not for the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:59459:312"/>
throw of individuation, perſonality, rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that hence ſeemeth to follow, this opinion would ſeem more plauſible than theirs, who groundleſly prohibit God from cauſing any more new beings.</p>
               <p>But though, no doubt, there is <hi>unto</hi> all <hi>beings,</hi> a continual emanation or influx from God, which is a continued cauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it may be either <hi>conſervative</hi> of the being firſt cauſed, or elſe <hi>reſtorative</hi> of a being continually in decay, as he pleaſe: for both ways are poſſible to him, as implying no contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; though both cannot be about <hi>one and the ſame</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the ſame reſpect, and at the ſame time. And our <hi>ſenſe and reaſon</hi> tell us, that the <hi>conſervative</hi> influx is his uſual way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But it is commonly, and not without reaſon, ſuppoſed, that generation produceth things <hi>de novo</hi> in another ſenſe: not <hi>abſolutely,</hi> as creation doth; but <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting the <hi>ſeminal virtue into act,</hi> and into perfection. New individuals are not made of <hi>new matter</hi> now created; but the corporeal part is only pre-exiſtent matter, <hi>ordered, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded</hi> and <hi>contempered:</hi> and the <hi>incorporeal part</hi> is, both <hi>quoad materiam ſuam metaphyſicam, &amp; formam vel naturam ſpecificam,</hi> the exaltation and expurgency of that into <hi>full and perfect exiſtence,</hi> which did before exiſt <hi>in ſemine virtuoſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When God had newly created the firſt man and woman, he created in them a propagating virtue and fecundity: this was, as it were, <hi>ſemen ſeminis:</hi> by this they do firſt <hi>generare ſemen ſeparabile:</hi> which <hi>ſuppoſitis ſupponendis,</hi> hath a fecundity fit to produce a new <hi>ſuppoſitum vel perſonam</hi>; and may be called a <hi>perſon ſeminally</hi> or <hi>virtually,</hi> but not <hi>actually, formally</hi> and <hi>properly:</hi> and ſo this perſon hath power to produce another, and that another in the ſame way. And note, that the ſame <hi>creating word,</hi> which ſaid, <hi>Let there be light</hi>; and, <hi>Let us make man</hi>; did ſay alſo to man, as well as to other creatures, <hi>Increaſe and multiply:</hi> not, [<hi>create new ſouls</hi> or <hi>bodies</hi>] but by generation, <hi>[Increaſe and multiply]</hi> which is the bringing of many <hi>perſons</hi> out of two, and ſo on, as out of a <hi>ſeminal pre-exiſtence</hi> or virtual, into <hi>actual formal exiſtence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He knoweth not the myſteriouſneſs of this wonderful work of God, nor the ignorance of mankind, who knoweth not that all <hi>generation</hi> of <hi>man, bruits</hi> or <hi>plants,</hi> hath much
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:59459:312"/>
that is to us unſearchable. And they that think it a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to a Philoſopher, not to undertake or pretend to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the juſt cauſes of this and all other the Phaenomena in nature, do but ſay, <hi>I will hide the diſhonour of my ignorance by denying it</hi>; that is, by telling men that I am ignorant of my ignorance, and by aggravating it by this increaſe, and the addition of <hi>pride, preſumption</hi> and <hi>falſity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This much is certain, 1.

<pb n="560" facs="tcp:59459:313"/>
that it is the ſame nature, though it always work not to actual vegetation, for want of prepared matter.

               <p n="7">7. In the production of <hi>vegetatives</hi> by generation it is evident, that as the <hi>fiery active nature</hi> is the <hi>neareſt cauſe efficient,</hi> and the <hi>paſſive</hi> is the matter and recipient.

The <hi>calor naturalis telluris,</hi> which may be called, as Dr. <hi>Gilbert</hi> and others do, its <hi>ſoul</hi> or <hi>form</hi>; which is to the ſeed as the <hi>anima matris</hi> is to the infant. And all theſe three, the <hi>fiery nature</hi> of the <hi>ſemen,</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and of the <hi>calor naturalis telluris,</hi> are <hi>generally</hi> the ſame: and by their agreeableneſs do meet in co-operation for generation.</p>

And if you will better read them over, you will finde that my Arguments are both Phyſical and Moral: For I argue from the Acts or <hi>operations</hi> of the Soul to its <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi>; And from its <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> to its ends, with many ſuch like, which are as truly Phyſical <hi>media,</hi> as if I argued from the nature of <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> that one if not hindered will aſcend, and the other deſcend.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is a fooliſh thing to carry great and certain Truths into the dark, and to argue againſt them <hi>à minus notis,</hi> from meer uncertainties. As to your ſimile, I confeſs that the Oyl of your Candle is ſtill waſting, ſo is the wick; but not that <hi>new</hi> is added to make it another thing, unleſs it be a Lamp.

<pb n="570" facs="tcp:59459:319"/>
than you know. So alſo if you argue from the Vegetative life of a Tree: Whether the <hi>ſame Principle</hi> of Vegetation (enlarging it ſelf) continue not to the end to individuate the Tree, though all the paſſive Elements (Earth, Water, and Air) may be <hi>in fluxu</hi> and a tranſient ſtate? It is certain, that ſome fixed Principle of Individuation there is, from whence it muſt be denominated the <hi>ſame.</hi> The water of the haſty River would not be called the <hi>ſame River,</hi> if the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel which it runs in were not the ſame: Nor your Candle be called the ſame Candle, if ſome of the firſt Wick or Oyl at leaſt did not remain, or the ſame fire continue it, or the ſame Candleſtick hold it.

               <p n="2">2. But doth not the light of Nature, and the concurrent ſenſe and practice of all the World confute you? and tell you that if you cannot underſtand what the Individuating Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is, yet that certainly ſome ſuch there is and doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. Why elſe will you love and provide for your own Children, if they be not at all the ſame that you begat, nor the ſame this year as you had the laſt? Why will you be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged on the Man that did beat you, or hang the Thief that robbed you, or do Juſtice on any Murderer or Male-factor, ſeeing that it is not the ſame man that did the deed? If he tranſpire as much as <hi>Sanctorius</hi> ſaith, and his ſubſtance diminiſh as much in a day as <hi>Opicius</hi> ſaith, certainly a few dayes leave him not the ſame as to thoſe tranſitory parts. Surely therefore there is ſomething which is ſtill the ſame.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That the <hi>Soul</hi> which we ſpeak of is a <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> is paſt all controverſie: For though, as I have ſhewed, there is truely an <hi>order</hi> or <hi>temperament</hi> of the parts, which he that liſteth may call the <hi>form,</hi> the <hi>life,</hi> the <hi>ſoul,</hi> or what he pleaſe; yet no man denyeth but that <hi>there is</hi> alſo ſome one part which is more <hi>ſubtile, pure, active, potent,</hi> and <hi>regnant</hi> than the reſt; and this is it (whatever it is) which I call the Soul. We are agreed of the Thing; let them wrangle <hi>de no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> who have nothing elſe to doe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this ſubſtance (no ſubſtance elſe) is not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated, as I have ſaid, is paſt diſpute.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Therefore there is nothing indeed in all this buſineſs which is liable to Controverſie, but this point of <hi>Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> which this Objection mentioneth; (and that of <hi>action</hi> and <hi>operation</hi> following.) And I muſt confeſs that this is the only particular, in which hereabouts I have found the temptation to error to be much conſiderable. They that ſee how all waters come from the Sea, and how Earth, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Air, and Fire, have a potent inclination of union, and when the parts are ſeparated, have a <hi>motus aggregativus,</hi> may be tempted to think it a probable thing, that all Souls come from, and return unto a Univerſal Soul or Element of which they are but particles. But concerning this, I recommend to the ſober Reader theſe following Conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">Read the Note in the Margin of the laſt Leaf.</note> There is in Nature more than a probability that the <hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> Soul (whatever particular Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtems or Globes may have). For we finde that <hi>Perfection</hi> lyeth ſo much in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> and as all things are <hi>from One,</hi> ſo as they go out <hi>from One,</hi> they go into Multiplicity, that we have great cauſe to think, that it is the <hi>Divine Prerogative</hi>
                  <pb n="572" facs="tcp:59459:320"/>
to be <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſalis.</hi> He is the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſalis</hi> in Entity, Life, Intelligence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As he hath made no one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of all the Univerſe (no nor of all the Earth) nor no one Head of all the Church, that is not God (whatever the <hi>Roman</hi> Vice-god ſay) nor hath given any one a <hi>ſufficiency</hi> hereto; (whatever a ſelf-Idolizer may imagine of himſelf;) ſo he hath not given away or communicated that Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, which ſeemeth proper to the Deity, to be an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Minde,</hi> and conſequently an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> Parent, and King, yea more, to be <hi>Omnia in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>no.</hi> Having no ſort of proof that there is any ſuch thing, finding it ſo high and Divine a Prerogative, we have little reaſon to believe that there is any ſuch thing at all in being.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you mean therefore no more than an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Soul</hi> to a particular Syſteme, or <hi>Vortex</hi> in the World, that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal</hi> will be it ſelf a <hi>particular Soul,</hi> Individuated, and diſtinct from other Individuals. And indeed thoſe very Elements that tempt you, might do much to undeceive you. There is of Fire a <hi>ſpecifical</hi> Unity, by which it differeth from other Elements; but there is no univerſal aggregation of all the parts of Fire. The Sun which ſeemeth moſt likely to contend for it, will yet acknowledge, individual Starrs and other parts of Fire, which ſhew that it is not the whole. The Water is not all in the Sea: we know that there is much in the Clouds, whatever there is elſewhere (above the Clouds). We have no great cauſe to think, that this Earth is <hi>Terra <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſalis</hi>: I confeſs, ſince I have looked upon the Moon through a Tube, and ſince I have read what <hi>Galilaeus</hi> ſaith of it, and of <hi>Venus,</hi> and other Planets, I finde little reaſon to think that other Globes are not ſome of them like our Earth. And if you can believe an <hi>Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duation</hi> of <hi>Greater Souls,</hi> why not of <hi>Leſſer?</hi> The ſame reaſons that tempt you to think that the Individuation of our Souls will ceaſe, by returning into the <hi>Anima Syſtema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis vel Solis,</hi> may tempt you to think that the <hi>animae ſyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum</hi> may all ceaſe their Individuation by returning into God (and their <hi>exiſtence</hi> too.)</p>
               <p n="3">3. If this were left as an unrevealed thing, you might take ſome liberty for your Conjectures. But when all the Twenty Arguments which I have given, do prove a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:59459:320"/>
Individuation and Retribution, it is deceitful and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to come in with an unproved dream againſt it, and to argue, <hi>ab ignoto,</hi> againſt ſo many cogent arguments.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And we have proved ſupernatural revelation to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond this, which is evidence more than ſufficient to bear down your unproved conjectures.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If it had been doubtful whether the ſouls <hi>individuation</hi> ceaſe, (and nothing of all the reſt is doubtful) yet this would not make ſo great a difference in the caſe as ſome imagine; for it would confeſs the <hi>perpetuity of ſouls,</hi> and it would not overthrow the proof of a Retribution, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe four things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the parts are the ſame in union with the whole, as when they are all ſeparated. Their <hi>nature</hi> is the ſame, and as <hi>Epicurus</hi> and <hi>Democritus</hi> ſay of their atoms, they are ſtill diſtinguiſhable, and are truly <hi>parts,</hi> and may be <hi>intellectually</hi> ſeparated: the ſame individual water which you caſt out of your bottle into the ſea, is ſomewhere in the ſea ſtill; and though contiguous to other parts, is diſcernable from them all by God. The <hi>Haecceity,</hi> as they ſay, remaineth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the love of individuation, and the fear of the ceaſing of our individuation, is partly but put into the creature from God <hi>pro tempore,</hi> for the preſervation of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals in this preſent life. And partly it is inordinate, and is in man the fruit of his fall, which conſiſteth in turning to SELFISHNESS from GOD. And we know not how much of our recovery conſiſteth in the cure of this <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi>; and how much of our perfection in the ceſſation of our indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duate affections, cares and labours. Nature teacheth many men by Societies, to unite as much as poſſible, as the means of their common ſafety, benefit, and comfort: and earth, water, air, and all things, would be aggregate. Birds of a feather will flock together. And love, which is the uniting affection, eſpecially to a friend who is fit for union with us in other reſpects, is the delight of life. And if our ſouls were ſwallowed up of one common ſoul, (as water caſt into the ſea is ſtill moiſt and cold, and hath all its former proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſo) we ſhould be ſtill the ſame; and no man can give a juſt reaſon why our ſorrows or joys ſhould be altered ever the more by this.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="574" facs="tcp:59459:321"/>3. And God can either keep the ungodly from this <hi>union</hi> for a puniſhment, or let them <hi>unite</hi> with the <hi>infernal</hi> ſpirits, which they have contracted a connaturality with; or let them, where ever they are, retain the venom of their ſin and miſery.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And he can make the Reſurrection to be a return of all theſe ſouls, from the Ocean of the univerſal nature, into a more ſeparated individuation again. I only ſay, that if it had been true, that departing ſouls had fallen into a common element, yet on all theſe reaſons, it would not have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown our arguments for a life of full retribution. God, that can ſay at any time, [This drop of water in the Ocean is the ſame, that was once in ſuch a bottle] can ſay, This particle of the univerſal ſoul, was once in ſuch a body, and thither can again return it. But the truth is, no man can ſhew any proof of ſuch a future aggregation.</p>
               <p>And to conclude, the Scripture here cleareth up all the matter to us, and aſſureth us of a continued Individuation yet more than <hi>Nature</hi> doth, though the <hi>natural evidences</hi> before produced are unanſwerable.</p>
               <p>And as for the ſimilitude of <hi>Light</hi> returning to the Sun, it is ſtill an arguing <hi>à minus noto:</hi> we know not well what it is: we know not how it returneth: and we know not how the particles are diſtinguiſhable there. They that confeſs ſouls to be <hi>indiviſible</hi> (though the individuals are all numerically di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct) muſt on the ſame ground think that two or many <hi>cannot</hi> by union be turned into <hi>one,</hi> as they hold that <hi>one</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be turned into <hi>two,</hi> or into ſeveral parts of that one divided.</p>

               <p>I name their reaſons, that you may be charitable in your cenſures; but the truth is, they talk of unrevealed or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain things, which do but trouble the heads of Chriſtians to no purpoſe, who may live better, and ſpeed better, by following the naked precepts of Chriſtianity, and hoping for ſuch a glory as Chriſt hath plainly deſcribed, without prying into that which doth leſs concern them to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with.</p>

               <p>When I look over and about me, I find it a thing quite paſt my power to think, that the glorious parts above us are not repleniſhed with much nobler creatures than we. And therefore if the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> and the ancient <hi>Platonick</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church, did all think that they lived in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Angels, and had much to do with them, and that the ſuperiour intelligences were a nobler part of their ſtudies than meer bodies, they ſhall have the full approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my reaſon in this, though I would not run with them into any of their preſumptions, and uncertain or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound conceits.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The greateſt and beſt things are liable to the worſt abuſes. Thus you may argue againſt Reaſon, that it doth but fill mens brains with knaviſh craft, and enable them to do miſchief, and to trouble the world, and to live themſelves

in cares and fears, &amp;c. Upon many ſuch reaſons, <hi>Cotta, in Cic. de Nat. Deor.</hi> doth chide God for making man a rational creature, and ſaith, he had been happier without it. And were it not for this wit and reaſon, we ſhould have none of theſe evils which you have here now mentioned. Why then is not reaſon as well as Religion on that account to be rejected?</p>
               <p>On the ſame reaſon, Philoſophy and Learning may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, (as it is with the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moſcovites.</hi>) What abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſects, and voluminous contentions, and tired con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming ſtudies have they cauſed? witneſs all the volumes of Philoſophers and School-men.</p>
               <p>On the ſame account you may cry down Kings, and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Government, and Riches, and all that is valued in the world: for what wars and bloudſhed hath there been in the world for Crowns and Kingdoms? what hatred and contention for honour and wealth? If you could make all men ſwine, they would not ſtir for gold or pearls; or if they were dogs, they would not fight for Kingdoms: and if they be blind and impious worldlings, they will not be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous about Religion, unleſs to <hi>dis-ſpirit</hi> it, and to reduce it to the ſervice of their fleſhly intereſt, (which is the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites zeal.) No man will contend for that which he va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lueth not.</p>
               <p>But, 2. Conſider, that though dogs will not fight for Crowns, they will fight for bones, and ſome times need men of reaſon to ſtave them off. And though ſwine fight not for gold, they will fight for draff, and burſt their bellies if they be not governed. And though unbelievers and Atheiſts trouble not the world to promote Religion, they ſet Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, Towns, and Countries, and Kingdoms together by the ears for their worldly pelf, and fleſhly intereſt. Enquire whether the wars of the world be not moſt for <hi>carnal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,</hi> (even where Religion hath been pretended:) and hearken in <hi>Weſtminſter-hall,</hi> and at the Aſſizes, whether moſt of the contendings there are ſuch as are cauſed by Religion, or by the love of the world and of the fleſh. And where Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſeemeth to be a part of the cauſe, it is the Atheiſts and ungodly that are commonly the chief contenders; who think it not enough to hope for no life to come themſelves,
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:59459:324"/>
but they cannot endure other men that do it, becauſe they ſeem wiſer, and better, and happier than they, and by their holineſs gall their conſciences and condemn them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The extremity of this objections impudency appeareth in this above all; that it is moſt notorious, that there is no effectual cure for all the villanies of the world but true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and ſhall the cure be made the cauſe of that diſeaſe? 1. Read and judge in Nature and Scripture, whether the <hi>whole matter</hi> of Religion be not perfectly contrary to the vices of the world. Will it trouble Kingdoms, or diſquiet ſouls, to love God above all, and to honour and obey him, and be thankful for his mercies, and to truſt his promiſes, and to rejoice in hope of endleſs glory: and to love our neighbours as our ſelves, and to do no injuſtice or wrong to any: to forbear wrath and malice, luſt, adultery, theft and lying, and all the reſt expreſſed in this treatiſe. 2. Is it not for <hi>want</hi> of Religion that all the vices and contentions of the world are? Would not men be better ſubjects, and better ſervants, and better neighbours, if they had more Religion? Would not they lie, and deceive, and ſteal, and wrong others leſs? Do you think he that believeth a life to come, or he that believeth it not, is liker to cut your purſe, or rob you by the high way, or bear falſe witneſs againſt you, or be perjured, or take that which is not his own, or any ſuch unrighteous thing? Is he liker to live as a good ſubject or ſervant, who looketh for a reward in heaven for it, or he that looketh to die as a beaſt doth? Is he liker to do well and avoid evil, who is moved by the effectual hopes and fears of another life, or he that hath no ſuch hopes and fears, but thinketh that if he can eſcape the Gallows there is no further danger? Had you rather your ſervant, that is truſted with your eſtate, did believe that there is a life to come, or that there is none? Nay, why doth not your objection militate as ſtrongly againſt the thief's believing, that there will be an Aſſize? For if the belief of an Aſſize did not trouble him, he might quietly take that which he hath a mind to, and do what he liſt: but this fills his heart with fears and troubles. 3. Compare thoſe parts of the world (<hi>Braſil</hi> and <hi>Soldania,</hi> &amp;c.) which believe not a life to come,<note place="margin">

What is there of any ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual power, to reſtrain that man from any villany which he hath power to carry out, or policy to cover, who doth not believe a life to come. 5. And if you believe it not, what will you do with Reaſon, or any of your faculties, or your time? How will you live in the world, to any better pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, than if you had ſlept out all your life?

                  </note> And to that end do not charge Chriſtianity with any School-mans or other confident perſons private opinions, nor ſuppoſe Chriſt or Scripture to determine any thing, which they do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. 1. Chriſtianity and Scripture do not at all deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, whether the whole Univerſe was created at the ſame time when this our Heaven and Earth was: But only that the Syſteme or World, which we belong to, the Sun, and Moon, and Starrs, and Earth were then created. Nay, a great part of the ancient Doctors, and of the moſt learned late Expoſitors on <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. do expound the Heavens which God is ſaid to create as being only the viſible Heavens, and not including the Angels at all. And others ſay, that by <hi>[In the beginning]</hi> is meant <hi>ab initio rerum,</hi> and that the <hi>Heavens</hi> there meant being the Angelical Habitations, and the Earth as without form, were both <hi>ab initio rerum</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſix dayes Creation, which began with the making of Light out of the pre-exiſtent Heavens or Chaos. I think not this opinion true; but this liberty Chriſtian Doctors have taken of differing from one another in this difficult point. But they utterly differ about the time of the creation of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels (on <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. and on <hi>Job</hi> 1.) and conſequently whether there were not a World exiſtent, when <hi>this World</hi> was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Or if any that ſeeth more than I, can prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, yet it is certainly a thing undetermined by Scripture and in the Chriſtian Faith, whether there were any Worlds that had begun and ended before this was made: That God is the maker of Heaven and Earth, and of all things viſible and inviſible, is moſt certain: But whether this Heaven and Earth, which now is, was the firſt which he hath made, is a thing that our Religion doth not at all meddle with. They that with <hi>Origen</hi> affirm, that there were antecedent worlds, are juſtly blamed on one ſide, not for ſpeaking things falſe, but <hi>things uncertain</hi> and unrevealed, and for corrupting Chriſtianity by a mixture of things alien and doubtfull. And
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:59459:326"/>
thoſe who affirm that there were no antecedent worlds, are as much culpable on the other ſide, if not more, on the ſame account and upon further reaſons. On the one ſide, we know that God needeth nothing to his own felicity, but is perfectly ſufficient for himſelf; and that he createth not the World <hi>ex neceſſitate naturae</hi> as an agent which acteth <hi>ad ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timum poſſe.</hi> And on the other ſide we know, that though he hath a <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of ſelf-perfection, unſpeakably more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than his <hi>Benignity</hi> as <hi>Related</hi> to <hi>man</hi> (not that one Property in God is to be ſaid more excellent than another in it ſelf, but that <hi>quoad Relationem</hi> there is an <hi>infinite</hi> diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> in Himſelf, and his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> only as <hi>Related</hi> to his <hi>Creatures,</hi> and meaſured by their intereſt), yet we confeſs that his <hi>Fecundity,</hi> and <hi>Benignity</hi> is included in his own <hi>Goodneſs</hi>; and that he delighteth to <hi>do Good,</hi> and is communicative; and that he doth Good <hi>ex neceſſitate vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntaria, ex naturae perfectione,</hi> without coaction; it being moſt neceſſary that he do that which his Infinite wiſdom ſaith is beſt: (which made <hi>Th. White de Mundo</hi> ſay, that God did <hi>neceſſarily make the World, and neceſſarily make it in time, and not</hi> ab aeterno, <hi>and yet all this moſt voluntarily, becauſe he doth neceſſarily do that which is beſt in the judgement of his Wiſdom.</hi>) And we deny not that if a man will preſume to give liberty to his Reaſon to ſearch into unrevealed things, that it will ſeem to him very improbable, that he who is <hi>Actus purus,</hi> of Infinite Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs, and who now taketh pleaſure in all his works, and his delights are with the Sons of men, ſhould from all Eternity produce no Creature till leſs than 6000 years ago; when a thouſand years with him are but as a day; and that he ſhould reſolve to have Creatures to all Eternity, who as to future dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be ſo like to Himſelf, when from all Eternity he had no Creature, till, as it were, five or ſix dayes agoe! Chriſtians are apt to have ſuch thoughts as theſe as well as you, when they look but to rational probabilities. But they hold that all theſe matters, whether there were ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent worlds, and how many, and of what ſort, and of what duration, whether this was the firſt, are matters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revealed, which they ought not to trouble the world or themſelves with prying into, or contending about: And they

               <p n="3">3. And if it be unrevealed in Scripture, whether before this there was any other World, we muſt confeſs it unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed whether there were any emanant or created Entity, which God did produce from <hi>all Eternity</hi> conſidered <hi>quoad durationem</hi> only. For the Scripture ſaith no more of one than of the other. And if there were <hi>one moment</hi> (dividing Eternity only imaginarily) in which there had been <hi>nothing but God,</hi> we muſt equally confeſs an <hi>Eternity</hi> in which there was nothing but God: becauſe Eternity hath no begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But Chriſtianity aſſureth us of theſe two things, 1. That certainly there is no Being beſides God but what was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, produced or totally cauſed by Him: And that if any Creature were eternal as to duration, yet it is <hi>after God</hi> in <hi>order</hi> of <hi>being</hi> as <hi>cauſed by Him,</hi> as the <hi>ſhadow</hi> is after the <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> and as the beams and light are after the Sun; or rather as the leaves would be after the life of the Tree, if they were conceived to be both eternal: One would be an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Cauſe, and the other but an eternal Effect. 2. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that this preſent World containing the Sun, and Moon, and Heavens, and Earth, which are mentioned <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 1. is not <hi>from Eternity.</hi> And indeed Reaſon it ſelf doth make that at leaſt very probable, as Revelation makes it certain. Which will appear when I have opened the Philoſophers opinions on the other ſide.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Among your ſelves there are all theſe differences, (and ſo we have ſeveral Caſes to ſtate with you). 1. Some think that this preſent Syſteme of <hi>compounded beings</hi> is from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. 2. Others think, that only the Elements and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and all ſimple Beings are from Eternity. 3. Others think that <hi>Fire</hi> or Aether only as the Active Element is from Eternity, or the incorruptible matter of the Heavens. 4. Others think that matter and motion only were from Eternity. 5. Others think, that only ſpiritual purer beings, Intelligences or Mindes were from Eternity, and other things
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:59459:327"/>
produced immediately by them. 6. And there have been thoſe Heathen Philoſophers, who held that <hi>only God</hi> was from Eternity.</p>
               <p>Among all this variety of opinions, why ſhould any one think the more doubtfully of Chriſtianity, for denying ſome of them, which all the other deny themſelves? Is it a likely thing that any individual mixt body ſhould be eternall, when we know that mixt bodies incline to diſſolution? and when we ſee many of them <hi>oriri &amp; interire</hi> daily before our eyes? And if Man and Beaſt as to each individual have a beginning and end, it muſt be ſo as to the <hi>beginning</hi> of the ſpecies; for the ſpecies exiſteth not out of the Individuals, and ſome individual muſt be firſt; (And as Bp. <hi>Ward</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth againſt Mr. <hi>Hobs,</hi> If the World be eternal, there have infinite dayes gone before, <hi>e. g.</hi> the birth of Chriſt: and then the whole is no greater than the parts, or infinity muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of finite parts.) The Heavens and the Earth therefore which are <hi>compounded beings,</hi> by the ſame reaſon are lyable to diſſolution,<note place="margin">Read in <hi>Bib. Pat.</hi> the diſpute of <hi>Zachary Mitilene</hi> with <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monius</hi> and a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian about the Worlds Eternity.</note> as man is; and therefore had a beginning. So that the truth is, there is no rational probability in any of your own opinions, but thoſe which aſſert the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſome Simple Beings, as <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Intelligences,</hi> or an <hi>Anima <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſalis.</hi> Now conſider further, that if ever there was a moment when there were no Individuals, or mixt Beings,<note place="margin">How neerly the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees</hi> opinion agreed with the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> ſee in <hi>Nemeſius de Anim.</hi> pag. <hi>487, 488, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> (but only ſome univerſal Soul or Matter) then there was an <hi>Eternity</hi> when there was nothing elſe: (For Eternity hath no beginning): And then will it not be as ſtrange to your ſelves, to think that God ſhould from all Eternity delight himſelf in <hi>Matter</hi> unformed (if that be not a contradiction) or in an <hi>Anima ſimplex &amp; unica,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any of all the variegated matter, and beings which we now finde beſides in Nature, as that he ſhould eternally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelf with Himſelf alone? If all individuals of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound beings were not from Eternity, what was? Either the Egge or the Hen muſt be firſt: (as the old inſtance is.) If you will come to it, that either <hi>Anima unica,</hi> or <hi>Atoms</hi> unformed were eternal, why ſhould not God as well be without theſe, as be without the <hi>formed Worlds?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What ſhall a preſumptuous minde now ſay to all theſe difficulties? why return to modeſty: Remember that as the

               <p>And what is the end of all that I have ſaid? Why to tell you that our Religion doth not only ſay nothing of former worlds, but, 2. that it alſo forbiddeth us to ſay, Yea or Nay, to ſuch queſtions, and to corrupt our minds with ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſearches of unrevealed things. And therefore that you have no reaſon to be againſt the Scripture on this account; for it doth not determine any thing againſt your own opinion, if you aſſert not the eternity of this preſent world or ſyſtem; but it determineth againſt your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, in medling with things which are beyond your reach.</p>
               <p>And withall it giveth us a certainty, that as in one Sun there is the <hi>Lux, Radii &amp; Lumen</hi>; ſo in one God there is <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>holy Spirit; eternally exiſtent and ſelf-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi>; which quieteth the mind more than to think of an eternity of an <hi>Anima</hi> or <hi>Materia,</hi> which is not God.</p>
               <p>All this I have here annexed, becauſe theſe Philoſophical ſelf-deceivers are to be pitied, and to have their proper help: And I thought it unmeet to interrupt the diſcourſe with ſuch debates, which are not neceſſary to more ſober Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but only for them who labour of this diſeaſe: and I know that when they read the firſt leafe of the book, which proveth that man hath a Soul or Mind, they will riſe up againſt it with all the objections which <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hobs,</hi> &amp;c. aſſault the like in <hi>Carteſius</hi> with, and ſay, <hi>You prove not this Mind is any thing but the ſubtiler part of Matter, and the temperament of the whole:</hi> To whom I now anſwer, 1. That it is not in that place incumbent on me, nor ſeaſonable to prove any more than I there aſſert. 2. But I have here done it for their ſakes, more ſeaſonably, though my diſcourſe is entire and firm without it.</p>
               <p>And I deſire the unbelieving Reader to obſerve, that I

                  <hi>and as his own perfection, is, in the order of our conceptions, much higher than his Benignity or Goodneſs, as related to the good of man.</hi> I have read ſome late ſelf-eſteeming Writers, (who love not to be named by way of oppoſition) who have undertaken the defence of the <hi>Epicurean</hi> hereſie, that <hi>Pleaſure</hi> is formally both man's fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, and his ultimate end: but their reaſonings for it are not half ſo handſome and adapted to deceive, as the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of <hi>Torquatus</hi> in <hi>Cicero, de finib.</hi> is; which indeed may ſeem very plauſible, till <hi>Cicero</hi>'s excellent Anſwer is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with it. It is a fair pretence to ſay, That a good man is pleaſed with nothing but that which is good, and that true pleaſure is to be found eſpecially in virtue, and that temperance and chaſtity ſhould be more pleaſant, than exceſs and luxury; and yet that the beſt men, when they do any great and excellent work, do therefore do it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it pleaſeth them. But the truth is, that <hi>Bonum qua bonum eſt objectum voluntatis; good</hi> and <hi>appetibile</hi> are the ſame: it is firſt <hi>good</hi> becauſe it <hi>pleaſeth us,</hi> but it <hi>pleaſeth us,</hi> becauſe it is eſteemed by us to be <hi>good.</hi> And the greateſt <hi>good</hi> ſhould greatheſt pleaſe us, becauſe it is firſt the greateſt good: And as God in himſelf is infinitely better than any delight or felicity of ours, ſo is he therefore to be more the object of our delight. And as the good of the world,
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:59459:333"/>
or of Kingdoms, or of thouſands, is better than the pleaſure of one individual perſon, ſo ſhould it be <hi>better loved,</hi> and more <hi>delighted</hi> in. For if Good as Good be appetible and delectable, then the <hi>greateſt Good</hi> muſt have the greateſt love and pleaſure. And nature it ſelf telleth us, that he that would not rather be annihilated than the world ſhould be annihilated, or would not loſe his life and honour, to ſave the life, and honour, and felicity of King and Kingdom, is no good member of Civil Society, but a perſon blinded by ſelfiſhneſs and ſenſuality. Therefore man hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing above himſelf, and his own pleaſure, to ſeek and to take pleaſure in. How far you can congruouſly ſay, that you <hi>take pleaſure in your pleaſure,</hi> and ſo make your own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the object, yea, the only ultimate object of it ſelf, I ſhall not now ſtay to enquire. But certain I am, that though our <hi>love,</hi> which is our <hi>complacency</hi> in the beloved <hi>object,</hi> is our <hi>actus finalis,</hi> yet is it not the <hi>objectum finale</hi> to it ſelf; but <hi>God</hi> himſelf, the infinite Good, is that <hi>final Object</hi>; and the <hi>Publick Good</hi> is a more noble and excellent object than our own. And though it be truly our <hi>felicity</hi> to <hi>love God,</hi> yet we <hi>love him not chiefly</hi> becauſe it is <hi>our felicity to love him,</hi> but becauſe he is <hi>chiefly Good</hi> and <hi>Lovely</hi>; and then in the ſecond inſtant, we love our own love, and delight even in our own delights. Indeed the <hi>ſenſitive life,</hi> as ſuch, can ſeek nothing higher than its <hi>own delight:</hi> but the <hi>rational life</hi> is made to intend and proſecute that end, which reaſon telleth us <hi>is beſt,</hi> and to prefer that before <hi>our ſelves,</hi> which is <hi>better</hi> than <hi>our ſelves.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Epicurean</hi> opinion, which maketh Pleaſure our higheſt end, doth ſhew that the Sect is ſenſual and bruitiſh, and have brought their reaſon into ſervitude to their appetites and luſts. And nature it ſelf doth abhor the notion, when it is brought into the light; and will hear him with ſome horrour who ſhall ſpeak out and ſay, <hi>[God is not to be chiefly loved for himſelf, nor as he is beſt in himſelf, nor as my ultimate objective end, but only to be loved next my ſelf, as a means to my felicity or pleaſure, as meat, drink, eaſe, and ſport, and luſt are. And virtue or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is not to be loved chiefly for it ſelf, that is, as it is the Image of God, and pleaſing to him, but as it conduceth to my pleaſure.]</hi> As <hi>Cicero</hi> excellently noteth, there is a great deal
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:59459:334"/>
of difference between theſe two; [<hi>To love vertue as vertue, and ſo to take pleaſure in it becauſe it is virtue</hi>;] and <hi>[To love virtue for pleaſures ſake, more than for its own:]</hi> For he that doth ſo, muſt ſay as <hi>Cicero</hi> chargeth <hi>Epicurus</hi> plainly to ſay, that <hi>Luxury is not to be diſcommended if it be not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant:</hi> for the <hi>end</hi> is the meaſure and rule to judge of all the <hi>means.</hi> If pleaſure as pleaſure be beſt, then to him that ſo continues it, to live more <hi>pleaſedly</hi> in whoredom, and drunkenneſs, and theft, and murder, than in godlineſs and honeſty, it will be better ſo to do: And <hi>virtue,</hi> and <hi>luſt</hi> or wickedneſs, will ſtand in competition only in the point of pleaſure. And then, which think you will have the greater party, and what a caſe would mankind be in? I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that the well ſtudying the excellent diſcourſe of <hi>Cicero</hi> on this point, and the reaſons which the <hi>Stoicks</hi> and the reſt of the Philoſophers give againſt the <hi>Plebeian Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,</hi> (as <hi>Cicero</hi> calleth them) may much conduce to help many Divines themſelves to a righter underſtanding of the ſame controverſie, as in Theology they have otherwiſe worded it, <hi>Whether God or our own felicity be moſt to be loved?</hi> (And yet without running into the fanatick extreme, of <hi>ſeparating the love of God and our ſelves, and calling men to try whether for his glory they can be willing to be damned.</hi>) Only when you read the Philoſopher ſaying, that <hi>virtue in</hi> and <hi>for it ſelf</hi> is to be <hi>loved</hi> as our felicity; elucidate it by remembring, that this is, becauſe that vertue in it ſelf is the Image of God, and by our <hi>felicity</hi> they mean the <hi>perfection of our natures,</hi> in reſpect of the end for which we were made. And that as the excellency of my <hi>knife</hi> or <hi>pen</hi> (yea, or my <hi>horſe</hi>) is not to be meaſured by their <hi>own pleaſure</hi> but their <hi>uſefulneſs to me,</hi> becauſe I am their <hi>end</hi>; ſo is it, as to man's perfection, as he is made for God, and related to him, (for all that he hath no need of us, ſeeing he can be pleaſed in us.) Thus this Philoſophical controverſie is coincident with one of the greateſt in Theologie.</p>

Page 13. <hi>He will not contend if you ſay, that it is by divine faith, that we believe the words to be true which are Gods; and by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane faith by which we believe them to be the words of God.</hi> He ſaith, that <hi>Faith hath no degrees: but is alway equal to it ſelf: to believe is to aſſent, and to doubt is to ſuſpend aſſent</hi>; Ergo, <hi>where there is the leaſt doubt, there is no faith; and where there is no doubt, there is the higheſt faith</hi>; Ergo, <hi>Faith is always in the higheſt, and is never more or leſs: And yet it may be called ſmall when it is</hi> quaſi nulla, (that <hi>quaſi</hi> is to make up a gap) <hi>in reſpect of the ſubject, or at leaſt hardly yielded; and in regard of the object, when few things are believed.</hi> Page 26. He maketh the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> to be <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> (that is, <hi>Fanaticks</hi>) <hi>becauſe they ſay, that they know the Scripture by the Spirit</hi>: (as if <hi>ſubjectively</hi> we had no need of the Spirit, to teach us the things of God; and <hi>objectively</hi> the ſpirit of miracles and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification were not the notifying evidence or teſtimony of
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:59459:335"/>
the truth of Chriſt.) The ſame name he vouchſafeth them that hold, <hi>That the Scripture is known by univerſal tradition to be God's word, and every mans own reaſon muſt tell him (or diſcern) the meaning of it.</hi> And he concludeth, that <hi>if every one may expound the Scripture, even in fundamentals, then every man may plead againſt all Magiſtrates, in defence of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or any other crime, as a rational plea; and ſay, Why ſhould you puniſh me for that which God hath bid me do.</hi> As if God would have no reaſonable creature, but bruits only to be his ſubjects. As if a man could knowingly obey a Law, which he neither knoweth, nor muſt know the meaning of; and is bound to do he knoweth not what. And as if the Kings ſubjects muſt not underſtand the meaning of the fifth Commandment, nor of <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>Honour thy father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>; and, <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher powers, and not reſiſt.</hi> Or as if Kings muſt govern only dogs and ſwine, or might make murder, adultery, idolatry and perjury, the duty of all their ſubjects when they pleaſed, becauſe none muſt judge of the meaning of God's Law by which they are forbidden: or as if it were the only way to make men obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to Kings and Parents, to have no underſtanding that God commandeth any man to obey them, nor to know any Law of God that doth require it: or as if all our <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> were not to be ſo uſeful to us as a ſign-poſt; nor we were not to learn of them or of our Parents any thing, that God either by nature or Scripture ever taught us: or as if a child or ſubject, who is required to learn the meaning of his Ruler's Laws, to judge of them <hi>judicio pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatae diſcretionis,</hi> were thereby allowed to mis-underſtand them, and to ſay that they command us that which they forbid us; and becauſe the King forbiddeth us to murder, he alloweth us to ſay, You propoſed it to my underſtanding, and I underſtand it that you bid me murder, and therefore you may not puniſh me. As if he that is bound to judge by a bare diſcerning what is commanded him, and what for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, were allowed to judge, <hi>in partem utramlibet,</hi> that it is or it is not, as pleaſe himſelf. As if when the King hath printed his Statutes, he had forfeited all his authority by ſo doing, and his ſubjects might ſay, <hi>Why do you puniſh us for diſobeying your Laws, when you promulgated them to us as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:59459:335"/>
creatures to diſcern their ſenſe?</hi> Will it profit the world to write confutations of ſuch ſtuff as this? or muſt a man that is not condemned to Stage-playing or Ballad-making, thus waſte his time? Do the people need to be ſaved from ſuch ſtuff as this? If ſo, what remedy, but to pity them, and ſay, <hi>Quos perdere vult</hi> Jupiter <hi>hos dementat, &amp; ſi populus vult decipi, decipiatur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet to do no more wrong to the Scriptures, than to Councils, and Bulls, and Statutes, and Teſtaments, and Deeds, and Bonds, he concludeth, <hi>Of all writings whatſoever, that by the meer words of the writer you cannot be certain of his ſenſe; though they be common words, and you take them in the common ſenſe.</hi> So that if any doubt ariſe about my words, if I reſolve it by writing I cannot be underſtood; but if I ſpake the ſame ſyllables by word of mouth, it would ſerve the turn. As if no man could be ſure of the ſenſe of any Law, or Teſtament, or Bond, or Covenant, which is committed to writing, nor of any expoſition of them, if once it fall under Pen or Preſs. As if God's writing the Ten Commandments had left them unintelligible, in compariſon of his ſpeaking them. Then farewell all Hiſtorical certainty. Hath every ſingle Prieſt himſelf any aſſurance of the ſenſe of the Council, the Canons, the Popes Decreetals and Bulls, but by the way of writing? And ſo the poor people muſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the Church, believe only that Prieſt that orally ſpeaketh to them, though he have no certainty of the matter himſelf. If this doctrine be made good once, it will ſpoil the Printers trade, and the Clarks, and Courts of Record, and the Poſt-Office too.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>page</hi> 51. he maketh the <hi>conſent of the univerſal Church to be the only ſure communication of Chriſtian Doctrine in the Articles of Faith; yea, the conſent of the preſent age concerning the former:</hi> (But how the conſent of the whole Church ſhall be certainly known to every man and woman, when <hi>no writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can certainly make known any mans mind,</hi> is hard to tell a man that expecteth reaſon.) And that you may ſee how much the ſubject of this Treatiſe is concerned in ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, he addeth, that <hi>If the Church had at any time been ſmall, its teſtimony had been doubtful; but</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it teſtifieth of it ſelf that Chriſtians were never few,</hi> and therefore it is to
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:59459:336"/>
be believed. But we will have no ſuch prevaricating defences of Chriſtianity. The major is the Infidels erroneous cavil; the minor is a falſe defence of the faith. The Church never ſaid that Chriſtians were <hi>never few</hi>: it hath ever confeſſed the contrary, <hi>that once they were few</hi>; and yet it hath proved againſt the Infidel, that <hi>its teſtimony was not doubtful,</hi> having better evidence of their veracity than numbers.</p>
               <p>You may perceive by theſe ſtrictures upon this one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, what an endleſs task it would be to write confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of every man that hath leiſure to publiſh to the world his opinions, which are injurious to the Chriſtian verity. And therefore no ſober Reader will expect, that I or he muſt be ſo tired, before he can be ſatisfied and ſetled in the Truth.</p>
