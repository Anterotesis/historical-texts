            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, their Corne-Mills neither can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly be sensible of the losse of this so little wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Because some of them have the whole Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver running wast by them, they being erected vpon a by-cut to avoyd the danger of too much water, as my Lord <hi>Shando's</hi> Mills by <hi>Harfield,</hi> whose Millers yet with the rest, pretended to feare that they also hereby should want Water.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Because others have the sixe Rivers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, which meet above <hi>Ux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> with the addition of a seventh streame, which falls in below <hi>Uxbridge</hi> to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47466:6"/>
serve but two Mill-cuts onely, as namely my Lord <hi>Pagets</hi> tenants of <hi>Juer</hi> and <hi>Thorney</hi> Mill upon one cut, and <hi>Drayton</hi> Mill upon the other cut, which yet are but of in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent value, the Rent of the one being but about <hi>16. l.</hi> per annum, the other <hi>25. l.</hi> per annum: and the third <hi>40. l.</hi> per annum, so that they have little cause to feare want of water, for the discharge of their imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> Thirdly, because others have the sixe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Rivers which meet above <hi>Uxbridge</hi> for <hi>3.</hi> Mill-cuts, as the five Millers by <hi>Ux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> and so all the rest of the complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, from <hi>Uxbridge</hi> to <hi>Thames,</hi> (excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting onely one Mill or two at the most) have likewise the foresaid 6.

                  <hi>4.</hi> Fourthly, because they have such plenty of water that they permit Ditches and wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring trenches to lye continually open which steales away their water from their Mills.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It plainly therefore appeares, that these Corne-Mills cannot by this worke, bee brought to want water, seeing they that have least water have sixe Mill streames at the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47466:7"/>
least, to serve three mill Cuts at the most; and yet those Mills above, which stands but upon the single streame, have all plenty of Water, many of them more employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and pay greater Rents then most of these, who have double their water to raise lesse Rent.</hi>

                  <hi>5.</hi> And lastly for their Paper-mills, which are but seaven in all, and stand vpon the foresaid Cuts. The water taken for this Worke cannot possibly bee missed by them, vnlesse it bee for the time of a Moneth or two in a dry Summer, when perhaps it may for that short time hinder the working of some few Hammers; And for satisfaction of this, or any other damage whatsoever, there is the very same care taken in this Act, as hath beene in other Acts, wherein, for the publique benefit of Navigation, the undertakers have had full power given them to pull downe even Corne-mills.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And so all Objections being (as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived) fully answered.
