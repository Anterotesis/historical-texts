         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
Contentious Apostate,
AND HIS
BLOW REFELLED.</head>
            <p>SInce <hi>Francis Bugg</hi> to Excuse the shameful Disturbance and
Malicious Interruption he and his Abettors made at our
Publick Meeting at <hi>Milden-hall</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> the day and year
aforesaid, intended by our Friends for the Worship and
Service of Almighty God, the said <hi>F. B.</hi> his pretence is this, <hi>viz.
That they might not thrust me out of the Meeting (as their Practice at</hi>
London <hi>has often been) I got a Justice</hi>'s <hi>Warrant, resolving that if they
would not let me stay, I would silence</hi> G. W. <hi>for that day, which after
he perceived, he sat down quietly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whence pray observe: 1st. F. B. <hi>got the Warrant.</hi> It seems 'twas
upon his Information to the Justice, and what the Information was
the Warrant shews. 2dly, For what end could he therein turn
Informer to obtain the Warrant? was it only to secure himself
from being thrust out of our Meeting? No, for no sober person
need fear that: Or was it to disturb the Meeting, and for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to Domineer and Insult, and Magisterially Command the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
<hi>to take away</hi> Geo. Whitehead, and <hi>Execute his Warrant,</hi> as
(Persecuter-like) he divers times did? The Constable not Submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to <hi>F. B.</hi> therein: <hi>Constable</hi> (quoth he) <hi>do your Office, or I'll
Complain of you.</hi> The Warrant it self, and <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s Insolent and
Turbulent Behaviour at that Meeting will easily Evince his Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and Excuse before cited, to be unjust and groundless, as is
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44422:3"/>
his Instance of <hi>one sober Woman whom they commonly thrust out, and
sometimes keep Prisoner,</hi> &amp;c. p. 2. Whereas this his <hi>sober</hi> Woman is
known to be a Turbulent, Wilful (and partly Discomposed) Person,
a Rayler, a Scold, a Striker, a Fighter, who also hath torn and
pulled a Friend (or Friends) by the Head, Hair; ask <hi>Joseph North,
Dennis Dodman,</hi> and some other Friends about <hi>Spittle-Fields,</hi> &amp;c. of
her Behaviour. And <hi>F. B</hi>'s Alledging the <hi>Tryal</hi> of <hi>Peers</hi> is very
Improper in this case; for it is all one as to tell us that Mad or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
folks may not be Restrained from doing Mischief and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Disturbance without the Tryal of a Jury: No sober Man would
have thus Impertinently Argued.</p>

                  <p>HAving received Information that there is a Meeting intended
to be Holden within the Precincts of your Town (either upon
the Morrow, or within some short time after) under pretence of a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Worship, in different Form from the Religion Establish't, in a place
not Licensed, and by persons not qualified to hold the same, and who are
under a great Suspicion of being disaffected to the Government.</p>
                  <p>These are in their Majesties Names to Authorise and Require you, and
every or any of you, to cause the said Persons and every of them to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
forthwith before me or some other Justice of the Peace of this County
to Answer to the said Information, and to be dealt with therein according to
the Law, and for your so doing this shall be your sufficient Warrant. Given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my Hand and Seal at <hi>Downham</hi> in the said County the <hi>29th</hi> day of
<hi>April,</hi> in the <hi>3d</hi> Year of their said Majesties Reigns, <hi>Anno. Dom.</hi> 1691.</p>
                  <p>The Name of the Justice who granted the Warrant, is here
Omitted, because we esteem him wronged by Misinformarion; and
also that when he understands the Envy and Abuse of <hi>F. B.</hi> Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the Warrant, and what Impious and Wicked use he made
thereof by Maliciously Interrupting and Disturbing a Religious
Meeting; we hope the Justice (on more mature Consideration) will
be so Ingenuous and Tender as to wish he had not Granted <hi>F. B.</hi> any
such Warrant against an Innocent Peaceable People, and that he
may rather Reprehend <hi>F. B.</hi> for being too Busie and Turbulent to
his quiet Neighbours: For he must needs understand that if there
was a failure or omission (on our Friends part at <hi>Milden-hall</hi>) in not

yet that the Intent of the Government and Law is, that we should

without any such Disturbance or Molestation as <hi>F. B. &amp;c.</hi> made.</p>

and the substance of what past between him and his Teacher
<hi>Js. Archer</hi> on the one part, and <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> &amp;c. on the other, the
30th day of the 2d Month called <hi>April,</hi> 1691, at the Publick Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-House

breathing unto the Lord in Spirit, and then after a short

Obey him.] Prayer ended, <hi>F. Bugg</hi> began Disturbance again, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

Writ most or the greatest part of that Book, and shall not disown
it; and for the other, <hi>Innocency against Envy,</hi> I also own it, the
Errors of the Press excepted; and this Answer I give, that thou
mayst not go away with a Lye, and say that I am afraid to own
my own Books, nor any think that I am afraid to Answer thee, for
I have Discoursed many Greater and Wiser Men than thou art, who
have shewn a great deal more Civility than thou hast done.</p>

Books against Friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> contrary to Conviction, as having
expressed some trouble he was in for the same, and that if it had
not been for <hi>Jo. Thrift</hi> (an abetter of his) he had not done what
he did; saying, she should have Burnt all his Papers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with
other Words. To which he made little Answer, but gave her the
Lye openly; but many present did believe she spoke Truth, and in
the fear of God, from a necessity laid upon her at that time.</p>

                  <p>after several Reiterations of his gross Lye, that <hi>G. W.

with Reviling Detractions and Personal Reflections, <hi>G. W.</hi> called
to the Priest thus, <hi>viz.</hi> Thou that art his Teacher or Minister, I

                  <p>Q. Detect. <hi>The first point under Consideration is, how I came to be a Member of their Society</hi> (i. e. of the
Quakers.)</p>
               </sp>
               <p>
                  <q> In the Beginning they Taught that all Men were Inlightned
according to <hi>John</hi> 1. 9. and that this Light wherewith Christ
had Inlightned them was sufficient, if obeyed, to lead to Salvation;
and that it was the work of the Ministers of Christ to turn the
Peoples minds from Darkness to Light, and from the Power of
Satan to God: Affirming that this Light was a sufficient Teacher,
Leader and Guide to every Believer, without the help of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Prescriptions, Forms, Orders and Decrees of Men. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these and the like Notions I became perswaded to make Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
of their Doctrine; and when I came to see and observe their
Practice, Conversations and Deportments in the begining, and
what simplicity and plainness attended their Ministry, I was
still more <hi>Confirmed</hi> that it was a <hi>Dispensation of the Love of God
sent as a Visitation to Mankind;</hi> and being thus perswaded, I was
resolved to bear the Cross, and did utterly despise the shame
that attended them and their Message, and was not behind any
of my Equals, both in Doing and Suffering for the Testimony
thereof, as some amongst them can still bear me Witness; and
in this manner we went on for many Years, and Loved one
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44422:5"/>
another with <hi>Love Vnfeigned;</hi> and <hi>doubtless God blessed our Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
with the comfortable Enjoyment of his Presence,</hi> and gave us
Favour in the sight of men, and not a word of Conformity was
heard amongst Us <hi>for many Years together,</hi> nor no Lording over
each others Consciences; but as every man was perswaded <hi>by the
Lord,</hi> so he was frequently Exhorted to walk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <speaker>G. W.</speaker>
                  <p>The Question in Controversy between us is, Whether the
People called Quakers he Apostate from the Truth, or <hi>F. Bugg?</hi>
Which may be Resolved from his own Book here; since his Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
he owns the said People to have been once no other than the
People of God, sound in Doctrin and Practice in Christian Love
and Society, and that God blessed our Meetings with the <hi>Comfortable
Enjoyment</hi> of his Presence: At which time the People called Quakers
were Dissenters from the Church and Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> and
<hi>F. Bugg</hi> then with them, and he writ then against the Priests and
their Covetousness and Oppression, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F. B.</speaker>
                  <p>I am sorry for that.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                  <p>He is now of another Judgment.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G. W.</speaker>
                  <p>When he so writ in the Commendation of the People
and Society called Quakers, he was turned from them to the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> whom he (as well as the People called Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers)
had Dissented from; and when Dissenters were in the Truth,
according to his own now Confession positive and high Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them; from whence I infer, That if he himself and the
Quakers were once (for many years together) not Apostates, but
in the Truth when Dissenters, he must needs now be the Apostate
in his Conforming to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> contrary to their
Practice and Testimony when no Apostates, for he cannot be in
the Truth now and then too; if right, or in the Truth then, he is
not right now; if he saith he is right, or in the Truth now and
not then, this is to contradict his own Testimony of the Quakers
and himself, as having been a Christian Society, and the People
of God, (yea, and that for many years, as he saith); so that if
right then, he cannot be right now (as aforesaid) being turned
from what he was, and owned then: I would have him Answer
and clear himself of this Dilemma if he can.</p>
                  <p>But instead of Answering, he set to Reading on in his Book; for
that was much of his shift to evade and take up time in Reading in
his own Books and Pamphlets, instead of giving fair Answer or
civilly Reasoning the Case.</p>

                  <speaker>G. W.</speaker>
                  <p>Seeing <hi>F.</hi> B. undertakes not to wind himself out of the
Dilemma, see if thou that art his Minister can do it for him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> Mr. <hi>Bugg</hi> is now of another Judgment than he was, as <hi>Paul</hi>
was when Converted; before he thought he might do many things,
even against the Name of Jesus, but he was of another Judgment
when Converted.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G. VV.</speaker>
                  <p>This instance will not hold parallel with the Case of
F. <hi>Bugg,</hi> his is not a Conversion as <hi>Pauls</hi> was; <hi>Paul</hi> did not say
he was in the Truth (or a Christian) before Converted; but <hi>F. Bugg</hi>
as good as saith he and the Society of the Quakers were once the
People of God, and enjoyed his Comfortable Presence when Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters
from the Church and Clergy of <hi>England;</hi> but now contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
he is turned to them (and Conformed) and from the Society
called Quakers, I do not see how either he himself or thou canst
clear him or bring him from under the Dilemma. Is <hi>F. B.</hi> of another
Judgment concerning the People called Quakers now, than he was
when he writ this Book in 1686, wherein he highly Commends of
the Society called Quakers?</p>
               </sp>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> He is now of another Judgment.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G. W.</speaker>
                  <p>Then he was of two different Judgments since he was
Conformed to the Church of <hi>England:</hi> Come <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> what sayst
thou? Dost thou now disown what thou hast writ in Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the People called Quakers in 1686?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F. <hi>B.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>No, I own what I then Writ.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>G. W.</speaker>
                  <p>Then <hi>F. Bugg</hi> and his Minister contradict each other;
he is of another Judgment, saith the Minister: No, I am not, saith
<hi>F.</hi> B. I own what I writ.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F. <hi>B.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>The Presence of God may be among other Societies, as

                  <speaker>G. W.</speaker>
                  <p>By the same rule his Conformity is so indifferent, that he
may as well joyn with any of those other Societies whom he never
so highly commended of as he hath of the People called Quakers;
his Apostacy is apparent, he cannot clear himself of the Dilemma
before Rehearsed upon his own Confession, which is plain an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
as to Man, from his own Confession, which no doubt was
from inward Conviction.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> He's Apostate from you, but not from the Truth.</p>

                  <speaker>G. W.</speaker>
                  <p>What saith <hi>F. B.</hi> to it, could he be in the Truth, both

alter his Judgment every two or three Years; and thus he may
write Books, and contradict them again; then what Credit is to
be given unto his Books or Scribling against the Quakers? The
cause of his turning from us (as he pretends) is, that there are
Canons or Rules among us, required to be observed, and he assigns
us only two of those Canons: First, Not to forsake our usual Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in times of Persecution. 2dly, Twice Publication of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
before our Mens and Womens <hi>Distinct Meetings.</hi>

               <p>2dly, The intent and end our Womens Meetings, is good

of a Christian Care, with respect to Widows, Fatherless, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And our Proposing Marriages twice to both our Mens

of Parents and Guardians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is a Just and Righteous end,
which I hope you will not deny; our Method herein hath been laid
before the Civil Government, and approved of as Laudable and
more safe than the Method of those Priests of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
who Marry persons Clandestinly without the knowledg and

being burdened in Conscience with <hi>Canons, Rules, Laws,</hi> &amp;c.
among us, as if he were now joyned to a Church that hath no
Canons or Rules; but I think you have more than we, though we
have Good and Warrantable Canons or Rules and due Methods in
Discipline, which we will stand by in the Face of all Opposers;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44422:7"/>
but if Canons or Rules be the Burden of <hi>F. B.</hi>'s Conscience, then
he should have gone into some Society that hath no Canons, Rules,
nor outward Methods; and I know no such Religious Society but
they have both Rules and Methods in Discipline, but the Ranters
have not; so <hi>F. B.</hi> might have gone among them, and not have
been burthened with Canons, Rules and Methods, wherein he might
have been more consistent with himself as to his Reason for his
forsaking our Religious Society.</p>

                  <p>Dost thou really believe that <hi>F. Bugg</hi> was as Innocent as
a Dove in his Dealing, as he did by <hi>Samuel Cater?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No Answer to this.</p>
                  <p>Some time was also spent about <hi>Joshua Bang</hi>'s his requiring Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of <hi>F.</hi> B. for manifestly Injuring him in Print, which he
could not Deny, but made no Satisfaction for the Injury done.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, <hi>G. W.</hi> gave publick Testimony in the Name of the Lord
to clear himself and Friends from Popery, and from being Popish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affected; And in opposition to <hi>F.</hi> B's Malicious and Slanderous
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44422:7"/>
Charge and Reproaches, tending to render him and his Friends
Odious and Obnoxious to the Government and People, too large
here to insert particularly.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Samuel Knowles</hi> he said not much, he appeared somewhat
Insignificant, but only to help forward the lightness and laughter
of some People present, by his own Levity, lifting up his Eyes and
Hands as one in Admiration (and credulous of <hi>S. B</hi>'s infamous
Charge and Reproaches against the Quakers) who being afterward
Reprehended for his Levity and ill Example therein; he Excused it
as well as he could, with his <hi>smiling Countenance,</hi> which he Natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
had, (as he said.)</p>
                  <p>The foregoing Narrative hath been kept in reserve until <hi>F. Bugg</hi>
appeared first in Print, as it was expected he would.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Isaac Archer,</hi> thou having thus far appeared an Abettor and
Assister of <hi>F. Bugg</hi> in his Fruitless Quarrel and Contention against
Us, and he being one of thy Flock and Church, we may take it for
granted, that he hath secret Incouragement from thee to divulge his
Malicious defaming Pamphlets and Books against Us, and his Work
therein will not only become his own Load and Burthen, but thine
also, if thou wilt not please to stop him from his Invective Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and Printing against Us (the People of God called Quakers)
or otherwise manifest thy publick dislike thereof, for his Work
is therein scandalous to Religion, and he shall be loaden
with his own Iniquity; he will never bring Honour to thee, or to
thy (or your Church's) Interest. It's apparent that thou and he are
not one in Principle, whilst he owns the Doctrin and Practice of the
People called Quakers in their <hi>Antient Splendour, according to his own
Confession.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I may also remind thee of thy Position, the 13th of the 2d Month,
1688. at our publick Meeting at <hi>Milden-hall,</hi> i. e. <hi>That</hi> Judas <hi>his
Transgression by which he fell from his Ministry, was his Hanging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>
(not betraying his Lord and Master) <hi>and that a wicked man may
be a Minister of the Gospel, and ought not to be separated from:</hi> Against
which Doctrin I left a note of these quotations for thee, 1 <hi>Tim. 3.
2, 3, 4, 7. 1 Pet. 5. 2, 3, 4, Titus 2. 7. 2 Cor. 6. 3, 4, 5, 6.

               <hi>FRancis Bugg</hi> who for some Years walked in Friendly Community and

some time, under pretence of siding with the <hi>Christian Quaker</hi> against
the <hi>Apostate Quaker,</hi> and having also wrote several Books on that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
with subtil and various Endeavours to make Division, Strife and
Debate amongst Vs; He the said <hi>F. B.</hi> did on the <hi>30th</hi> of the <hi>2d</hi> Month,
1691. appear in our Meeting with a Warrant in the hands of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable,
abetted by <hi>Isaac Archer</hi> and <hi>Samuel Knowles,</hi> two Priests, the
former of this Parish, the latter his late Curate, accompanied with
many of their Hearers, to whom he hath joyned himself in their Church
Society, turning his back as well upon his Christian Quaker, as of his
Apostate Quaker (as he calls some) whose Countenance there, sufficiently
manifested him what manner of Christian he was as to his deportment
and Religion, to the Satisfaction of several who had retained some better
thoughts of him, than that he only Counterfeited the <hi>Christian Quaker,</hi>
under a Malicious Disguise and Subtil Design to make Division, Strife
and Contention amongst us, though some believed otherwise then. And at
the said Meeting he offered <hi>G. W.</hi> a Paper, which he refusing to accept
at his Hand, <hi>F. B.</hi> said that it contained three Charges: Concerning
which, we Declare, That though at the fore-end of that Meeting <hi>G. W.</hi>

but also upon a Reflection of <hi>F. B.</hi> on him as not owning <hi>Judgment Fixt,</hi>
did say, the he owned all his Hand or Name was set to, Errours of the

One Blow More.</head>
            <div type="section">
               <p>HE saith <hi>he was resolved to go to the Meeting well Prepared,</hi> which
it seems, was with a Constable and Warrant, as before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by an undue Information as well as Envious, against the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
met, as being under a <hi>great suspicion of Disaffection to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi>
That for his <hi>offering to meet us to Prove matters of Fact,
his Challenge he here again renews on a Months notice,</hi> p. 2. whereby he
has Granted that he has not yet proved matters of Fact against
us; we have his Clamourous Accusations and Charges without
Proofs; still he's more loud in's Charges than in's Proofs, as was
publickly told him.</p>
               <p>That <hi>F.</hi> B. offered <hi>G. W.</hi> a Paper containing this Charge follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>offering publickly</hi> (he saith) <hi>to prove it,</hi> [which he neither did nor
can do.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1st, That</hi> G. VV. is a Deceiver of the People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> A false Accuser of the blessed Martyrs, charging their Doctrin
to be Corrupt, tending to Practical Ranterism, and thereby siding with
the Papists against the Protestants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly,</hi> That he is a favourer or an excuser of such Principles and
Practices as border upon Blasphemy and Idolatry.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G. VV.</speaker>
                  <p>did and still doth utterly deny these Charges as False,
Slanderous and Malicious, they remain still to prove, which <hi>F.</hi> B's
<hi>says so,</hi> doth not.</p>
                  <p>1. Wherein is <hi>G. VV.</hi> a Deceiver of the People in point of Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin
or Conversation? He utterly and Conscientiously denies the
Charge, having faithfully served the Lord in good Conscience from
his Youth upward, and rejoyceth that he is counted worthy to be
thus Reproached for Christ Jesus, as his Ministers of old were,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 8.</p>
                  <p>2. Wherein doth he accuse the blessed Martyrs, and charge their
Doctrin to be Corrupt? This Charge is General as well as in the
Plural. What Doctrin agreed upon and generally held by the
blessed Martyrs, did <hi>G. W.</hi> ever so Accuse? But only <hi>F.</hi> B's Misap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of the Words, which he saith were Dr. <hi>Barnes,</hi> viz. <hi>That
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44422:9"/>
all outward works be things indifferent, and may be used and also left</hi>
Pray where did the blessed Martyrs agree upon or hold this Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,
as stated by our Adversary? I am sure 'tis neither safe nor
sound without some such distinction, as all outward works <hi>not evil
in themselves, or not prohibited by the Law of God,</hi> be things so indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
as aforesaid.</p>
                  <p>3. His third Charge is as notoriously False and Malicious as the
rest: The occasion whereof was my only Questioning him about
two Letters, which he saith were sent to <hi>G. F.</hi> by <hi>J. C.</hi> and <hi>J. A.</hi>
How proves he they are theirs as Cited, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> I do not believe they
are, as I told him publickly, both which shewed my dislike of them,
as Cited, especially the latter; besides there's now more ground
to question the Citations, since <hi>F.</hi> B. that varied in his last from his
first in several Passages, leaving out divers words; and he hath
not yet proved either of them true: I suppose if he hath not
forged the said Letters, he hath taken them upon Trust, as he
would have the Reader and us take them from him upon his own
Credit and bare Affirmation, which is of very little value to us:
Thus he frequently imposes, and commonly refers us to his own
<hi>Scurrilous</hi> and <hi>Abusive Pamphlets,</hi> as if his own Authority and <hi>Ipse
Dixit</hi> must bear down all opposition to his bare and proofless Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations.</p>
                  <p>That G. W. <hi>did not own the Book wholly, Entituled</hi> Innocency against
Envy, <hi>and refused to own either in part or in the whole,</hi> his Book Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled,
<hi>Judgment Fixed,</hi> are both false, for before the Meeting was
ended, he openly owned both, the Errors of the Press excepted,
though unwilling at first to Answer <hi>F.</hi> B. to that or any other
Question, because he desired the Meeting might be kept quiet and
free from Contention, but could not obtain it, because of <hi>F.</hi> B's
Turbulent and Abusive Contention and Clamorous Reviling.</p>
                  <p>To prove that <hi>G. W. did both refuse to own his Book</hi> (Judgment
Fixed) <hi>and Answer the Charge before cited,</hi>

               <stage>
                  <hi>F.</hi> B. produces this Certificate, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </stage>
               <p>WE whose Names are under written do Testify, That on the <hi>30th</hi> of
<hi>April, 1691. George Whitehead</hi> did refuse to own his Book,

               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:44422:9"/>
               <p>1. This Certificate is very unfair, partial, and unjust in both,
as I could produce many more Witnesses to the Contrary, if I
should go or send about to get hands; for that I did publickly
own the said Book, <hi>Judgment Fixed,</hi> and the other also that very
day and place (the Errors of the Press excepted) some time before
the Meeting was ended, as many can Witness: That at first I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
for some time to Answer <hi>F. B.</hi> but refused not to own my said
Books, or to answer his Charge at a more convenient time, which
I did before parting, but would not presently be forced nor
frighted thereunto by his peremptory demands and threats (with
<hi>Constable and Warrant</hi>) his imperiously imposing upon me, I did
not think my self bound immediately to Answer at his demand, and
in his time, but took my own time and method to give Answer.
This is the very truth of the Case.</p>
               <p>2. That I did not only Answer his said Charge by way of Denial,
but all the rest of his abusive and proofless Accusations and Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
in general.</p>
               <p>And my Negation was sufficient, whilst his Affirmations were
unproved, and yet in many things he was answered by such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
as he was not able to refute. I had no cause to be <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
or Cowardly from a Guilty Conscience, nor ashamed of</hi> S. Cripe
(in his being concerned with me) as <hi>F. B.</hi> most falsly insinuates,
p. 2, 3. And at length, against his abusive Clamours, <hi>That</hi> G. W.
<hi>was disaffected to the Government; Jesuitically siding with the Papists
against Protestants,</hi> &amp;c. This proposition was fairly made and urged
by me the person abused, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q> That seeing <hi>F. B.</hi> hath thus publickly and highly reproached
me touching the Government, <hi>as disaffected to the same, Popish,
Jesuitical,</hi> &amp;c. I do sincerely offer, that if <hi>F. B.</hi> or any that
take his part (his Minister or any other) hath any thing to
charge me with, relating to the Civil Government, or any
Complaint, Suggestion, or Jealousy against me touching the
same, according to his said Reproaches, if he or they will let
me have a Lawful Summons (after I am at <hi>London</hi>) to appear
before the Secretary of State, or any of the Lords of the
King and Queen's Council, I shall (God willing) meet him or any
of them face to face, and Vindicate my own Innocency against
his Malicious Charge.</q> But to this <hi>F. B.</hi> and his Party gave no
answer; only <hi>S. Knowles</hi> said <hi>they would consider of it.</hi> And indeed
<hi>Isaac Archer</hi> and he might have been more Ingenuous than to sign
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44422:10"/>
such an unjust Certificate as they have done, upon <hi>F. B</hi>'s Instigation;
it will no way redound to their Reputation or Credit.</p>
               <p>Again <hi>F. B.</hi> proceeds with his Clamours, charging us with being
<hi>Deluders</hi> with <hi>Abominable Lyes, Manifest Forgeries</hi> and <hi>Gross Perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;</hi>
one instance whereof he <hi>may Recite,</hi> as he saith, out of our
Book, <hi>Innocency against Envy,</hi> in Answer to his <hi>Quakers Detected,</hi>
p. 3. Where he saith, <hi>We have grosly abused his Intention, and by
leaving out five words,</hi> (viz. <hi>in the beginning they taught) have made him
speak what is for our turn,</hi> saying, <hi>that he confesses to our Doctrin,</hi> viz.
<hi>That all men are enlighted by Christ,</hi> according to John 1. 9. <hi>And to the
Sufficiency of this Light of Christ to lead to Salvation, without the
help of Mens outward Prescriptions, Forms,</hi> &amp;c. p. 3. That he did
plainly confess to our Doctrin herein, is true still; and our leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out those five words, doth not lessen his Confession, nor will
his now saying, <hi>We have grosly abused his Intention,</hi> be any just ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse;
but both idle and evasive, as if his intention were not to
confess that Doctrin or our Ministry (which we still hold) <hi>as in the
beginning we taught,</hi> whereas he hath contrariwise granted, <hi>that he
was still the more confirmed that it was a Dispensation of the Love
of God sent as a Visitation to Mankind; and being thus perswaded, he
was resolved to bear the Cross, and did utterly dispise the Shame that
attended us and our Message,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And that in this manner</hi> (he saith) <hi>we went on for many years, and
Loved one another with Love unfained, and doubtless God blessed our
Meetings with the comfortable Enjoyment of his Presence; and as every
man was perswaded by the Lord, so he was frequently exhorted to walk.</hi>
See his <hi>Quakers Detected,</hi> p. 3. before cited more at large; from
all which, pray observe how plainly he hath confessed, since he
was Conformed to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the year, 1686. both
to the Truth of the Quakers Doctrin, Ministry, Society, Blessed
Meeting, and Immediate Teaching of the Lord, which he saith was
in the beginning, as if now they were Declined; however it was
since they were a People Religious and Christian Society, and he
<hi>one</hi> among them (according to his own confession) and both these
People called Quakers, while in such Purity and Blessedness, yea, and
<hi>Ancient Splendor</hi> also, (as he saith p 14. of his <hi>One Blow,</hi> &amp;c.) were
all Dissenters from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and bore Testimony
against the Clergy, and Priests, and Tythes, their Covetousness,
Oppression and Persecution; but now <hi>F. B.</hi> (and not the People
called Quakers) is turned back to the Priests whom he testified
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44422:10"/>

and both sound in Doctrin and Practice (who still persevere in
their Testimony.) But <hi>F. B.</hi> is Fallen, Back-sliden and Apostatiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from his Testimony which he bore among the said People,
therefore he is the Apostate and not we; and yet as a self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
person even since his Conformity is made to confess to
the Truth of our Doctrin, Conversation and Sotiety, as it was
in the beginning, and for many years together, when he owned us:
But now he walks quite contrary in his Conformity and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing,
so that he cannot be Right now, if he was ever Right
among us. But if he saith he is now of another Judgment, as
his Minister <hi>J. Archer</hi> would have him, instancing <hi>Paul</hi>'s saying,
He thought he might do many things against the Name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
but was of another Judgment when Converted; then this is
to condemn <hi>F. B</hi>'s own Testimony to the Truth of our Doctrin
and Conversation, which he hath given since he turned to the
Clergy and Church of <hi>England;</hi> and I could not find that either
<hi>F. B.</hi> or his Minister could clear him of this Dilemma, if ever he
was in the Truth while he was among the People called Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
or in Society with them, he must be in Error now in his
turning back to the Priests and Church of <hi>England;</hi> but if he and
his Teacher will conclude that he was always in Error while
among the People called Quakers, but now Converted and in
the Truth; This is to Condemn his own Testimony aforesaid,
Printed in the Year, 1686. <hi>Quakers Detected,</hi> p. 3. where since a
Member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he hath confessed to the
Doctrin, Ministry, Christian-Conversation, Love and Society of
the People called Quakers, and their blessed Meetings in the
beginning, and for many Years; so that take it which way he
or his now Minister will, he is under a manifest Snare, he is
self-Condemned, and his slight evasion will stand him in no
stead, <hi>viz. That he is far enough from confessing to our present Doctrin
and Conversation; and saying, that though he did set forth what we held in
the beginning, yet that we teach the contrary now;
and what though</hi> Rome <hi>was once a glorious Church</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">So the <hi>Quakers</hi> were once a glorious Church, by this comparison, and both then and now clearly Dissenters from the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

                  <hi>endued with sound Doctrin, and many other excellent
Ornaments; yet by Innovatians and Mischievous Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
she is utterly Deserted.</hi> And his saying,
<hi>There is great difference between my saying in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
that they taught sound Doctrin,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and saying
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44422:11"/>
the same now.</hi> p. 4. These Evasions and Shifts will not cover nor
excuse him, nor warrant his Temporising, and turning to the
Priests and Church of <hi>England,</hi> contrary to that Doctrin and
Testimony which he saith we Taught in the beginning, but still
he appears <hi>a self-condemned Person,</hi> guilty of <hi>deep Hypocrisy</hi> therein,
acting contrary to manifest conviction in his own Conscience;
for wherein he falsly suggests <hi>we now Teach and Act contrary to what
we did in the beginning;</hi> he should rather have endeavoured to find
out some other People whose Doctrin and Conversations are
both sound and agreeable, as he confesseth the Quakers were
in the beginning; or to consist better with himself, he should see
if he could find out some other glorious Church endued with
sound Doctrin and excellent Ornaments, (but then it must be
without either Canons, Rules or Discipline) that is neither the
People called Quakers, nor the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which he
Testified against when he was in Society with the Quakers in
their <hi>Ancient Splendour,</hi> according to his own confession, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
he is still in the Mire, and yet to seek, <hi>being in</hi> Egypt, <hi>sold
thither.</hi> As he saith, <hi>Quakers Detected,</hi> p. 8. and therefore no
real Convert of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> while he would make
the People believe that he is for the Quakers in their <hi>Doctrin</hi> and
<hi>Practice, when most Glorious and Splendid,</hi> and yet continues a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> contrary to both.</p>
               <p>But dare <hi>F.</hi> B. in Conscience now say that he is more Just,

            <div n="1" type="article">
               <head>The first, against the Quakers late Doctrin, viz.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the beginning they taught that all Men were Inlightned according
to</hi> John 1. 9. <hi>And that this Light wherewith Christ had Enlightned
them, was sufficient, if obeyed, to lead to Salvation without the help of
outward Rules, Laws and Directories of</hi> Mens <hi>Prescribing; but now they
teach the contrary</hi> (saith he) and wherein contrary? <hi>They have De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
such out of Vnity who discountenance Womens Meetings,</hi> &amp;c.
Wherein we have but his own <hi>say so,</hi> or proofless Affirmation
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44422:11"/>
that this is a contrary Teaching to the former. In the beginning
we Taught that all Men are Enlightned by Christ, and so do we
still; and that this Light of Christ is sufficient to lead unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
if obeyed without outward Rules, Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of <hi>Men's</hi>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prescribing
or making, or without Human Prescriptions; and so
we say still, this Light is sufficient; and yet by this Light re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
dark and envious Opposers of Women's Godly Meetings (ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
in the Name and Light of Christ Jesus by his Power)
which have been among us many years, before <hi>F. B.</hi> left us,
even in such times, wherein he has granted us to be in <hi>our Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Splendor, a Glorious Church,</hi> &amp;c. yet now in contradiction to
himself, is both an Opposer of our Women's Meetings, and an
Adversary to our Christian Discipline and good Order; else why
does he oppose the Doctrin of the Light within thereunto? And
that such Opposers are both Disobedient unto (and out of) the
Light and Unity of Christ's Church, and consequently in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
is as certain, as <hi>he that saith he is in the Light, and hates his
Brother, is in Darkness,</hi> as <hi>F. B.</hi> is, in his dark Opposition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Proof or Reason; he might as well have argued thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
That if the Light of Christ within, be sufficient to lead unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
if obeyed without Human Laws; then it is a contrary
Doctrin, to testifie against the Spirit of Envy, Division and
Darkness; but the Light of Christ is sufficient, <hi>Ergo.</hi> Let him
bring a better Argument upon his own Article and Opposition
if he can, and his Fallacy will easily appear as it doth.</p>

               <head>His Second Article, Charging us with Popish and Antichristian
Practice,</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is both False and Slanderous;</hi> In his falsly accusing us with <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
on each others Consciences, for the strict Observation of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's
Meetings, as contrary to</hi> what in the Beginning we Taught
against Imposition upon another Man's Conscience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor hath
he proved any Imposition upon our Friends Consciences in this
Case, either to observe, or act without or contrary to Inward
Conviction or Perswasion by the Light of Christ within: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Charge without Proof, is a blind Imposition. But saith
he, <hi>They are for Nonconformity Record out of the Vnity,</hi> &amp;c. He
should have said rather, that some for Opposition and Gainsaying
of good Order and Discipline (as that of <hi>twice Publication</hi> of
Marriages before Solemnized) agreed upon and practised by the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44422:12"/>
Church of Christ among us, have <hi>therein</hi> (or in that matter) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
themselves out of Unity (and if some such have been so

such Opposition or Breach upon any due or necessary Method,
Order or Discipline, agreed upon by them, or in a Christian Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
which they pretended to be Members of; and such gain no
Reputation by such Advocates as <hi>F. Bugg.</hi> And further the true
State of the Case in Opposition to his False and Partial, is this:
In the Beginning we declared against <hi>Human Impositions on Men's
Consciences, and against Persecution thereupon also,</hi> and so we do still;
and yet it is no Contradiction, to be for the strict Observation of
Faithful Women's Meetings, sometimes distinct from the Men;
where they are perswaded by the Light of Christ so to Meet,
being gathered by the Power and in the Name of Jesus Christ,
(which cannot be an Effect of my Imposition contrary to good
Conscience) and for those good Ends and Services propper to
them, which <hi>F. B.</hi>'s new Minister could not deny, when those
good Ends were Demonstrated.</p>

               <head>His Third Article against their Deportment and Carriage,
Runs thus.</head>
               <p>
                  <q>In the Beginning <hi>G. W.</hi> and many others came through
the County in plain Habit walking on Foot, Content with
mean Accommodation, apt to Teach, not given to Filthy Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre,
often Visiting the Sick, the Poor as well as the Rich,
Working often on their Trades, that they might not be Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable;</q>
                  <hi>But now they are grown Great and High, and instead of a
plain Gray Cloth Coat and short Hair, they are now Cloathed with
the finest of the Fleece, the best of Hair Camlets, well-set Periwigs;
instead of going on Foot, they generally have the best Horses they can
get; yea, some of them have their Coaches, Callashes, Foot-boys and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to attend them, and instead of Cold Water,</hi> the <hi>best of
Spirits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Observe what Commendation he still gives of us <hi>as in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,</hi>
but now what a Story he hath told, to prove us declined
in our Conversation; but still short of proving us <hi>Apostate and
New Rome,</hi> &amp;c. As to our Deportment and Carriage, we have
plain Habit still, and are content with mean Accommodation; and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44422:12"/>
some of us can and do Drink Water, as we have occasion: <hi>We
have learned both to Abound and to Want,</hi> Phil. 4. 12. But for the
<hi>best of Spirits instead of Cold Water,</hi> it is a false Insinuation, as
well as Non-sense; Who can drink the best of Spirits instead of
Water? And we covet no Man's Meat, nor Drink, nor Gold, nor
Silver, nor Apparel, but Preach the Gospel freely as ever; yet are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated
to Ride on Horse-back sometimes, because not so able
to Walk on Foot, as in the Beginning: And some have better
Cloaths than at first, for some had their Cloaths torn among
Bryers and Thorns, by the Woolfish Persecutors and Followers
of Persecuting Priests; others their Cloaths much Worn, by lying
in Prisons upon Straw, Boards, Floors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for their Christian
Testimony; and they could not always wear their old Cloaths,
they must sometimes have new ones; these are no Proofs of their
Desertion or Apostacy. And for Periwigs <hi>well set</hi> or <hi>ill set,</hi> we
do very little affect or care for them, we like no extravagant or
unnecessary ones, though probably some who have lost their own Hair,
either by hard Imprisonment or Sickness, or by outward Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Infirmity or Age, may have necessity to wear some short
Wigs, to keep their Ears from Deafness, and Heads and Necks
from Cold, who otherwise had rather be without them. Now if
<hi>F. B.</hi> or any other should judge such as guilty of Pride or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy
therein, when their Consciences in the sight of God witness
the contrary; such his and their Judgment would be very Unjust,
and judged of God and his Truth, as well as extravagant, ranting
and unnecessary Wigs.</p>
               <p>And as for Coaches, Callashes and Foot-boys, we know of few
among us keep them, to be sure not <hi>G. W.</hi> nor others that came
out when he did in 1654. though probably some few, that are
come to own the Truth since, that have Estates answerable do
keep Coaches, for the necessary Accommodation of themselves and
Families, to carry them to Meetings (and where they have
occasion) which can be no Proof of their Apostacy neither, but
rather the contrary; that their Zeal is such, they spare no Cost
to accommodate their Families to Meetings.</p>

                  <q>This Confession, That in the Beginning we were apt to Teach, not

take 50 l. <hi>per Annum</hi> for Preaching, or any of them 30 l.
for Writing the said Manuscript either? He hath been already
Reprehended for this Lye of 50 l. <hi>per Annum,</hi> unjustly charged

               <p>They sometimes Taught that Reflecting upon Persons, was a
mark of a false Prophet, and never the way to beget to God,
<hi>quoting G. F's.</hi> great Mystery, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 237. and that to call
Names for Religion, were no Christians of Christ's making.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He has dealt unfairly by</hi> G. F. <hi>in his Citation, leaving
out his first words,</hi> viz. The work of the Ministers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
was not to reflect upon Persons or Creatures, but struck at the
Power which Captivated the Creatures, <hi>which intends not to strike at
the Creature distinct from that Power that Captivates it; and to
prove that we Practise contrary, he quotes a Book,</hi> Truth's Defense,
<hi>calling a Minister, i. e.</hi> Camelford, filthy Beast, Impudent, Enemy of
God, <hi>&amp;c. And E. B. for calling</hi> Bennet, Reprobate, Child of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Blasphemer, <hi>&amp;c. And another Book Entituled</hi> A threefold
Estate of Antichrist, for calling the Priests of the World Theeves
and Robers, Antichrist's Liers, Viperous Generation, Babylon's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
Ravening Wolves, Greedy Dumb Dogs, <hi>&amp;c. To all which
I thus briefly Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. That personal Reflections and calling Names meerly for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
is neither the way to beget to God nor Christian; but
Reflections and Names suitable to the ill Qualities, ill Natures
and corrupt Practices of Persons. This is not to strike at
the Creature distinct from that power that Captivates it, but
chiefly at that power of Darkness in its own birth and deprav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Generation; And such Reflections or Names are not given
for Religion sake; but because of some Persons Depravity and
Degeneration. <hi>F. B.</hi> knows that some in the Scripture are
called both <hi>Bulls, greedy dumb Dogs, ravening Wolves, generation of
Vipers, Serpents, evil Beasts, Antichrists, Reprobates,</hi> &amp;c. And I
would ask <hi>F. Bugg</hi> if he did not Believe the covetous Priests
of the World were such, when he was in Society with the
People called Quakers, and owned them both in Doctrin and
Practice in their Antient Splendour and Glory, as he hath
since confest they once were? I suppose within that time
wherein he walked amongst them for many years, (I suppose
above Twenty) and when he himself writ against the said
Priests, did not he then think that many of them deserved
such Characters as before mentioned, and in Scripture given to the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44422:14"/>
false Prophets, false Shepherds, and covetous Watch-men of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael?</hi>
And it is further observable, that those Books mentioned and
charged by <hi>F. B.</hi> as <hi>Truths Defence, E. B.</hi> against <hi>Bennet, Three-fold
Estate</hi> of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and <hi>Samuel Fisher</hi>'s <hi>Rusticus,</hi> were first
printed many years ago, and in such times as <hi>F. B.</hi> no doubt,
owned the People called Quakers to be in their Primitive Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
Splendor and Soundness, both in Doctrin and Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
especially in those many years he walked among them, and
owned them; why did he not tell the World what years those
said Books were first printed in, which now he has accused?
that his Inconsistency and Self-contradiction might more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have appeared, in his commending and condemning a People
for things Writ by some of them, even when they were so
commendably owned, and highly approved of by the self same
Judge or Person, even <hi>F. B.</hi>

Lambs Defended from Satan's Rage,</hi> against <hi>John Pennyman</hi>'s en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
Invective, falsly styled, <hi>The Quakers Vnmasked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:44422:15"/>
3dly. I do not believe that one of our Ministers said to the
Court at <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> That <hi>if the Spirit of the Lord God in them,
led them to Fight, I had nothing against it, or that we Recorded
any such thing in our Book of Foreign Letters,</hi> as <hi>F. B.</hi> saith:
I know no such Record, nor do I believe it till I see it; and
if I do, we shall disown it, as none of our Doctrin nor
Principle.</p>
               <p>4thly. <hi>F. B.</hi> hath another strange Story against <hi>S. Fisher,</hi> viz.
<hi>That he said he believed or expected that the People called Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
would be Instrumental <hi>by Force</hi> (with others) to turn out or
overturn the then Government, and that</hi> this he spake to Mr. <hi>Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>good
(after the Rising of the Fifth-Monarchy Men) and Mr.</hi> Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyman,
<hi>as I am Informed; pray ask them if they do not remember it,</hi>
p. 10. Thus far <hi>F. Bugg.</hi> I have shewed <hi>Jo. Osgood</hi> this Story,
and asked him about it, and his Answer is this, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>I
do not remember that <hi>S. Fisher</hi> spoke them, or such
words, and I do not believe he did; and I am not apt
to believe he spoke such Words, for if he had, I should
have opposed them.</q> Wherefore we have Reason to think,
this was some forged Story against <hi>S. F.</hi> who was a peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
harmless Man, and that this Apostate may be ashamed
to charge the Dead, and the Memories of the Living, with old
defaming Stories.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>5thly. After he hath pretended his Concern for</hi> many called
Quakers both of his near Relations, and many of the Hearers being
honest People (<hi>as he Confesses</hi>) but have their Eye too much to
such Teachers and Leaders as <hi>G. W.</hi> and his Brethren, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 11.
<hi>He insinuates</hi> a want of Vnion, in affection to the present Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and saith, not one Epistle, not one publick Prayer, <hi>&amp;c. i. e.</hi>
for King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary, which is more than he knows
or can demonstrate. His envious and unjust Insinuations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
have been already answered in our half Sheet in Print,
Entituled,</hi> The Quakers Answer to a Scandalous Libel, styled,
A Letter to the Quakers, <hi>which he hath since owned by offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to prove what we deny in it,</hi> B. Rams. <hi>p. 19. And also
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44422:15"/>
in our late Answer to his</hi> B. Rams, <hi>he doth but reiterate the
same thing over and over against us; and then to colour over
his envious and injurious Insinuations against us, touching the
Government, he tells us thus,</hi> viz. But I will not insist too much
upon this point, lest you say I expose you, and would set the King
against you, which is not my desire, as well as below the dignity of
his Person and Station.</p>
               <p>Thus when he hath endeavoured to expose us to all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
and Infamy he can, and to render us <hi>Disaffected</hi> and
Obnoxious to the Government, he can thus Hypocritically pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
'tis not his desire to set the King against us. O false
hearted Man! What better Tendency is thy envious work
of! 'Tis well 'tis below the Dignity of the King's Person
and Place, to be influenced by the Malice of such Apostates
as thy self, or by such false and infamous Characters, unjustly
cast upon us, as <hi>Disaffected to the Government, New</hi> Rome <hi>Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Harlots, Deluders, Deceivers, Jesuitical deep Hypocrisie,</hi> &amp;c.
And yet <hi>thou wouldst be glad we would publickly Address the King
and Queen, and pray for them publickly and heartily, and therein
be Example to our Hearers, who are honest People.</hi> p. 11, 12.
Wherein thy Hypocrisie and Inconsistency against us (being set
together) Runs thus, <hi>viz. Thou Painted Harlot, thou New</hi>
Rome, <hi>thou Antichrist, Deep Hypocrite, Deluder and Deceiver,
disaffected to the Government,</hi> &amp;c.—<hi>Pray Publickly and
Heartily for King</hi> WILLIAM <hi>and Queen</hi> MARY.
And is this thy Affection and Friendship to the King and
Queen? These may evince thy Folly, Confusion and Madness
against an Innocent People, whom thou hast causelesly Deserted
and unjustly Defamed. We grant 'tis our Christian Duty
to <hi>Pray for all Men, for Kings,</hi> &amp;c. But where are all
required by Christ or his Apostles, to pray for them <hi>by
Name?</hi> Or charged as Offenders, for <hi>not Naming</hi> Persons
in our Prayers? <hi>May not</hi> we pray acceptably, unless we tell
God the Name of those we <hi>pray for?</hi> Surely we need not a
False Hearted Apostate to dictate our Prayers to us. Thy
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44422:16"/>
Hypocrisy and self-Contradiction also appears, in one while
seeming to be against Personal <hi>Reflections</hi> and <hi>calling Names,</hi>
&amp;c. And another while calling the People called Quakers, <hi>Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Harlot, New</hi> Rome, Rome's <hi>Sister,</hi> &amp;c. which to excuse, among
other false Allegations and Defamations, thou givest this for one
Reason, <hi>viz. By their valuing their own Traditions above the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
p. 12. which is a notorious Lye, and utterly denyed by us
as the rest of thy Lyes and filthy abuses are, with thy Lying
conceited Rimes against us, being not worth Reciting.</p>
               <p>I leave thee and thy Works of Darkness and Envy, to the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Judgments of the Heart-searching God; and thy Judgment
lingereth not, and thou shalt be Rewarded according to thy
Evil Deeds; it is high time for thee to seek Repentance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou be cut off, for thy Day hasteneth; if thou wilt not
be Humbled nor Repent, Remember thou hast been, and art
Admonished and Warned: And with what Face or Conscience
canst thou finally appeal to God, <hi>as knowing thou hast no Maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
intent, nor nothing of Revenge;</hi> or to pretend to be, <hi>or Write
without Prejudice or Malice?</hi> And art not thou Joyned to such
as say Prophecying and immediate Revelation are Ceased?
How then comest thou to take upon thee to Prophecy, <hi>That our
Mountain shall be laid wast, and that we shall become like a wast
howling Wilderness, Dead, Dry and Barren?</hi> Which is thy own
Condition, thou art Dead, Dry and Barren, and yet presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
to be a Judge or a Prophet, against others more Righteous
than thy self; our Mountain is the Mountain of the Lord, it is
Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> that shall never be removed, nor laid wast, and it is
Exalted above the Top of <hi>Esau</hi>'s Mountain, and in vain dost
thou strive against the Lord's Mountain; thou art not only
Fighting and Striving against Man or Men, but against the Lord,
his Truth and Power, which is and will be too strong for thee;
thy great Iniquities are before him, and thy Secret Sins are set
in his sight, even in the Light of his Countenance, and both
thy Secret and Open Wickedness is seen and Judged by the
Lord; look at home, examin and consider thy own corrupt,
perverse and crooked Ways, and seek Repentance, if a place
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44422:16"/>
may yet be found for thee, which I sincerely wish, if it may
yet stand with the good Pleasure of All-mighty God to Grant
it: And consider if thou hast not cause to fear thy day hasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
