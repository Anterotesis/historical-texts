            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Full and True RELATION Of a Maid living in <hi>Newgate</hi>-Street, in <hi>London</hi>: Who was Buried on Saturday, <date>the 27 of this inſtant <hi>December,</hi>
               </date> and taken up (ſuppoſed to be alive) the 30 of the ſame, being Buried near <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> Hoſpital, in the Church-yard of the ſame.</head>
            <p>STrange and Wonderful are the Workings of Almighty God, as this preſent Example may Teſtify, of a perſon who lived in <hi>Newgate</hi>-Street, in the quality of a Servant, whoſe Name was <hi>Grace Aſhburne,</hi> a <hi>Hartfordſhire</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who was bound an Apprentice to the Wife of one Mr. <hi>Beachcroft,</hi> a Taylor, who now lives in <hi>Kings-head</hi> Alley in <hi>Newgate</hi>-Street. The Wife of the perſon aforementioned was to Inſtruct her in her Art and Trade, which was to the Calling of a Hood and Scarfe maker, which ſhe did for a conſiderable time, although by relation of the Neighbourhood, with many dry rubs and blows (which might poſſibly haſten her untimely End) although I ſhall not affirm it. This perſon, the Subject of my Diſcourſe was Buryed on <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> Eeve laſt, and was heard by ſeveral Neighbors moſt lamentably to Groan and Cry out in her Grave, to the great Aſtoniſhment of the Neighbourhood; who upon Complaint occaſioned her to be taken out of her Grave, after ſhe had been (like <hi>Lazarus,</hi>) Buried four days, being taken up on <hi>Tuesday</hi> the 30 Inſtant: Upon her firſt taking out of the Grave, ſeveral Credible perſons affirm, That ſhe was not only warm, but breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to the great Aſtoniſhment of the Beholders; Upon which her Father (who is now a Priſoner in the <hi>Fleet</hi>) cauſed her to be taken up as aforeſaid, where <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ome Hundreds of Spectators have been to view the Dead Corps, amongſt the Multitude I my ſelf was one, who dare affirm this, That ſhe had a Colour as freſh as a Roſe, nay more freſh than can poſſibly be conceived, yet on her Arms ſhe hath ſeveral bruiſes, and a Scar on her Head, which was Reported to have been given her by her unkind Maſter (through her Miſtreſſes perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) ſome Months before her Death (as they would have it believed.</p>
            <p>Having been expoſed to publick view for ſeveral Hours, at a penny a piece Charge, at a Smiths Shop in the Long Walk, near <hi>Chriſts Church</hi> Hoſpital: She was once more carried to her Laſt home (the Grave,) where the Jury ſat on her, who found the Caſe ſo foul, that through ſome means, (what I will not ſay) they were contented to defer their Evidence, or bring in their Verdict until the Twenty Third of Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary (next enſuing,) which is the utmoſt day limited for their Verdict.</p>
            <p>Her Father (or at leaſtwiſe, the Father of this Dead Corps) (now in the Fleet) having formerly taken No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the ill uſage of his Daughter, although he could not be active in his own perſon (being confined) yet he employed ſeveral perſons to enquire after the ſame, who brought him ſuch a Relation that the Corps was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately taken up for ſatisfaction of the World, who will not (as is ſuppoſed) be ſo eaſily confirmed in the belief of her Maſter and Miſtreſſes Innocence, but that it may be proved further next Seſſions.</p>
            <p>The Jury who ſat upon this Maid being Sixteen in Number, knew not what to ſay in the Buſineſs; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through favour, affection or otherwiſe they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred there Verdict for ſo long time let the Reader Judge,</p>
            <p>This is certain and nothing but Truth, That in the time of this Maids Servitude ſhe was much abuſed, but being no Judge my ſelf, I will no ways determine whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this haſtned her end, or ſhortned her days; I refer this to God Almighty.</p>
            <p>Although both Maſter and Miſtriſs were very harſh to her, as themſelves cannot diſown, unleſs they will Contradict the whole Neighbourhood, yet going under the Repute of an honeſt Man, and a Taylor; I ſhall not be ſo bold, as to tell the World he ſent her to her Long Home, though all the whole World beſides ſhould ſo.</p>
            <p>But to conclude, for certain the poor Wench is Dead, and her Maſter is living, and her unkind Dame too, who each of them live in one Houſe (for it is pity they ſhould be par<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed) in <hi>Newgate</hi> Street, in <hi>Kings head Alley,</hi> where any perſon may be Informed of the Truth of this Relation, if a Lye do not give Check to their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>For a Truth, this I dare affirm, the poor Girl was abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and many times hath in the hearing of ſeveral, wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſelf <hi>Rather to be buryed alive, than to live under ſuch hard and ſevere uſage,</hi> and how her Prayers have taken ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect let the World Judge.</p>
            <p>Reader, this in a Word is the Naked Truth of this Relation, I might (I Confeſs) Lengthen it out to a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pitch, but not being willing to deviate from the leaſt Tittle of Truth, I have given thee in ſhort the whole Buſineſs at large, if it like thee, ſo; if not, tell me ſo, and I ſhall be ſatisfied.</p>
