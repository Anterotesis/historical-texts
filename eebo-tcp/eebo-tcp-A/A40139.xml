            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>CONCERNING</hi> Daily Sacrifies and Offerings.</head>
            <p>THe Prieſts under the Law daily offered Sacrifices; but Chriſt our High Prieſt need not daily, as thoſe Prieſts, offer Sacrifice for his own Sin, and then for the Peoples, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 7.16, 28.) For Chriſt did once offer up himſelf, who is made, not after the Law of a carnal Commandment, but after the power of an endleſs Life, who is ſet down at the Right-hand of God, and ſo cannot be offered as an Offering and Sacrifice any more, who aboliſhed the changeable Prieſt-hood, with all its Offerings and Sacrifices, by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and Offering of himſelf once for all.</p>
            <p>And ſo it is ſaid, <hi>I am come to do the will of God</hi>; to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the firſt, namely Prieſt-hood and Covenant-Offerings, and eſtabliſh the Second, by the which Will we are Sanctified through the Offering of the Body of Jeſus, (Mark) Chriſts Body is offered up once for all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10.</p>
            <p>And ſo Chriſt is Entered into Heaven it ſelf, not that he ſhould offer himſelf often, as the High-Prieſts did, for then muſt Chriſt often have Suffered, but he hath put away Sin by the Sacrifice of himſelf once for all; ſo Chriſt was once offered to bear the Sins of many, <hi>and unto them that look for him, ſhall he appear the Second time without Sin unto Salvation,</hi> as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.25, 26, 28.</p>
            <p>So here you may ſee Chriſt is not often offered up as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, or an Offering for the Sins of the whole World, then had he often Suffered: But after Chriſt had offered up one Sacrifice for Sins for ever, he ſat down at the Right-hand of God; <hi>And by this one Offering Chriſt hath Perfected forever them that are Sanctified.</hi> So here you may ſee, it is one Offering, and one Sacrifice, once for all, not offering Chriſt many times, nor often.</p>
            <p>And in <hi>Hebrews,</hi> 12.12, 14. The Prieſts under the Law, they offered Offerings, but Chriſt offered up himſelf, who had power to lay down his Life, and take it again, ſo it was not Prieſts that offered Chriſt up; for after Chriſt had offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up one Sacrifice and one Offering for Sins, by which Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and Sacrifice <hi>He perfected forever them that are San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, and ſat down at the Right-hand of God,</hi> who ever Lives to make Interceſſion for his People.</p>
            <p>And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Offerings and Sacrifices thou wouldeſt not, but a Body haſt thou prepared me, to do thy Will</hi>; by the which Will we are Sanctified through the offering up of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt once for all, as before, and ſo he did not often offer up his Body as a Sacrifice for all, for then muſt he often have Suffered, as before; but now once (mark once) hath he appeared to put away Sin by the Sacrifice of himſelf, and not by offering or ſacrificing of himſelf often; for as it is ſaid, Chriſt having ſomewhat to offer, that is, he offered up himſelf, his Body, once for all Sins, and the daily ſacrifice, and made an end of the daily Sacrifices, as in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. Wherein you may ſee he cauſed the daily Sacrifices and Oblations to ceaſe, when he was cut off, not for himſelf, but for the People, who by one Offering and Sacrifice of himſelf, end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the daily Offerings and Sacrifices. And therefore all are to look unto him the one Offering and Sacrifice once for all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit, and a broken and contrite Heart,</hi> and theſe are the Sacrifices <hi>That God will not diſpiſe, Pſal.</hi> 51.1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. And <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>Let my Prayer be ſet before thee as Incenſe</hi> (mark as Incenſe) <hi>and the Lifting up of my Hands as the evening Sacrifice</hi> (mark as the Evening Sacrifice) Now here you may ſee, <hi>David</hi> ſaw beyond the outward Offerings and Sacrifices, for he deſires that his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er might be as Incenſe, and his lifting up hands as the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sacrifice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.2. And <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Wicked is an abomination to the Lord; but the Prayers of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright-hearted is his Delight, Prov.</hi> 15.8.</p>
            <p>Here you may ſee, you that are Wicked, your Prayers and Sacrifices are not accepted, <hi>And to do Juſtice and Judgment is more acceptable to the Lord then outward Sacrifices, Prov.</hi> 21.3. So here you may ſee, it is not offering Sacrifice only with a company of words, nor outward things, but a practizing Judgment and Juſtice.</p>
            <p>And Chriſt ſaith to the outward <hi>Jews,</hi> that were in their outward Offerings and Sacrifices, and their long Prayers; Chriſt ſaid unto them, <hi>I will have Mercy and not Sacrifice,</hi> and bid them go learn what that meaneth: For the Lord ſaid, <hi>I deſired Mercy, and not Sacrifice, and the knowledg of God more then burnt Offerings, Mat.</hi> 9.13. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.6. So here you may ſee Mercy and the knowledg of God is beyond outward Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and Sacrifices.</p>
            <p>For as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Chriſt hath Loved us, and hath given himſelf an Offering and Sacrifice for us to God, for a ſweet ſmelling Savour, Ephe.</hi> 5.2. So you may ſee Chriſt hath given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an Offering and Sacrifice for us to God, and the Saints now do not offer up Chriſt, who hath already offered up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (mark himſelf) but they are to preſent their Bodies a Living Sacrifice, holy acceptable to God, which is their reaſonable Service. This the Apoſtle writ to the Church of Chriſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> which ſame is the Duty of all Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>And the Apoſtle ſaith to the Church of Chriſt the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> by him (namely Chriſt) Let us offer the Sacrifice of praiſe to God Continually, that is the fruit of our Lips, giving thanks unto his Name, and do good and Communicate, for with ſuch Sacrifices God is well pleaſed: <hi>For even Chriſt our Paſſover is Sacrificed for us,</hi> as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Peter,</hi> in his General Epiſtle, told the Church of Chriſt, that they were built up <hi>A Spiritual Houſhold, a holy Royal Prieſt-hood, to offer up Spiritual Sacrifices acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (mark by Jeſus Chriſt to God.)</p>
            <p>Now all the true Chriſtians are a Royal Prieſt-hood, and a ſpiritual Houſhold, and with the Spirit they are to offer up ſpiritual Sacrifices; theſe are they that are accepteble to God by Jeſus Chriſt in the new Teſtament and new Covenant; ſo the Apoſtle did not ſay they ſhould offer up Jeſus Chriſt, but <hi>Offered Sacrifice to God by Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; for Chriſt had offered up himſelf once for all.</p>
            <p>And you may ſee how the <hi>Jewes,</hi> when they forſook the Lord, they joyned themſelves to <hi>Baal Peor,</hi> and did Eat the Sacrifice of the Dead, which was forbidden of the Lord, and provoked him to Anger, that his Plague broke out upon them, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.28, 29.</p>
