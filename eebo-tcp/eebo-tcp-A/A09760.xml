            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT Honourable my very good Lord, Sir Edward Denny, Knight, Baron of Waltham, grace and peace.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Honorable, beeing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to preach the last Lent, I deliuered so much as filled vp the ordinarie time of an hower. But that was scarse halfe this sermon. I vttered no more, to auoyd the offence of the hearer; I write no lesse, to procure the profit of the reader. For as tediousnes without regard of due time, especially in so high a presence, soonest offendeth: so fullnes, where the reader may peruse more or lesse at his pleasure and leysure, best of all edifieth. Therefore I thought good in publishing this sermon rather to enlarge it to the comprehension I had conceiued and meditated in my mind, then to scant it according to that strict compasse of time which I was tied to in the pulpit. For by this meanes all that will vouchsafe to looke into it may make their profit thereby. They which were present by veiwing the whole, whereas they heard but halfe: they which were absent, by hauing the preachers meaning, though they be vnacquainted with his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. And yet perhaps it may please God to blesse this poore excercise to diuers heavenly minded men in such sort, as they may take occasion by some things
<pb facs="tcp:6253:3"/>
here intimated, not onely to conceiue more then they find directly specified, but also to be more diumely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired and sweetly affected, then it pleased God to vouchsafe mee of his grace, either at the preaching or penning of it. Howsoeuer, seeing this discourse exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth principally to repentance and patience in the time of sicknes, and to a preparation of our selues by a good life vnto a happie death, which is a doctrine most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie in this great mortalitie, that hath lately bin, &amp; is yet feared: especially also for that the greater part of it I neuer preached any where, but onely penned in my study, I thought my selfe so farr bound in dutie to this blessed church wherein we liue, as not to hide it in a napkin, but according to the Apostles rule, if I haue found comfort my sefe by some meditations here opened, then to comfort them that are afflicted by the same comfort wherewith we our selues haue bin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted of God. And bethinking mee of one vnder whose protection it might passe in publick, I thought best to make bold with your Lordship. For though all sorts peraduenture may be fitted with some thing or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this plaine sermon, which they may make vse of, yet those I am sure will conn me most thanks for my well-meaning endeauour, which haue had most expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and triall of Gods louing mercie in this kind. Now your good Lorship hauing bin deliuered more then once or twice from dangerous sicknesse, haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned such patience, such meekenes, such vnfeined re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, such true mortification, such assurance of Gods loue, such confidence in Christ, such other good vertues of a right sanctified spirit, by this fatherly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation of the Lord which is not wanting euen often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to his dearest children, as you could neuer haue
<pb facs="tcp:6253:3"/>
learned, at leastwise in the same measure, in health. Besides, I haue bin so especially beholding to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, euen since you were first of S. Iohns college, that I could not satisfie my selfe with the inward dutie and thankfulnes towards you which I haue euer faithfully laid vp in my brest, except I also shewed the same by some such outward testimonie, as might cleare me to you and the world of vngratfulnes. Wherefore I doe so presume to dedicate this small labour to your good acceptance, as withall I hartely desire all those that shall receiue edisication thereby, to pray together with me for the continuance of your Lord-ships good health and wellfare, that long you may euen in this world enioy this your late honorable addition, and all other good gifts of God, and fauours of our gracious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraygne, to the benefit of this Church, and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.

               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Othing is more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some then the seruice of God, and loue of vertue: nothing more full of griefe and sorrow, then sinne. Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not heauie <note n="a" place="margin">1. Ioh. 5.3.</note>: yea his yoke is easie, and his burden light <note n="b" place="margin">Matth. 11.30.</note>. On the other side, how deepely sinne woundeth the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conscience, the heathen Orator confesseth, saying, I will not buie repentance so deare <note n="c" place="margin">
                  <hi>Non emam tanti poenitere. Demosth.</hi>
               </note>. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to that of the Apostle, What fruit haue you of those things, whereof you are now asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med? For the ende of those things is death <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 6.21.</note>. Looke how the Israelites wearied themselues in clay and bricke, without any profit or reward;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:6253:5"/>
nay whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had don there very best, they were by Pharaos taske-masters well beaten for their paines <note n="e" place="margin">Exod. 5.14.</note>: euen so the world, the flesh, the deuill, as rigorous taske-masters incite men to sinne, but all the reward they yeeld them, is onely mortall and immortall griefe. And as the sea roareth and fometh, and neuer is at rest<note n="f" place="margin">Esa. 57.20.</note>; after the same sort, the wicked are like the raging sea, foming out their owne shame<note n="g" place="margin">Epist. Iud. 13.</note>, and neuer rest, till hauing made shipwracke of faith <note n="h" place="margin">1. Tim. 6.9.</note>, they be drowned in perdition and destruction. They which worship the beast, haue no rest day nor night<note n="1" place="margin">Reuel. 14.11.</note>. Now what beast so cruell as sinne? which not onely killeth the bodie, as a beast doth, but sleieth the soule<note n="i" place="margin">Sapien. 1.11.</note>, yea it destroieth both bodie and soule in hell <note n="k" place="margin">Matth. 10.20.</note>. Therefore this indeede is the beast, which depriueth all those that serue it, of libertie and rest. Of whome the Prophet Ieremie writeth thus; <note n="2" place="margin">Ier. 9.5.</note> They haue taught their tongues to speake lies, and they take great paines to doe wickedly.</p>
            <p>This, holy King Dauid had good experience of. Namely, that in sinne, there is nothing but sorrowes and paines. For lying here sicke in his bed <note n="l" place="margin">Hereupon I entitle this sermon, The sicke-mans couch.</note>, and feeling this same sicknes to be a stroak of Gods heauie hand for his offence, he cries God heartily mercie, and saies, Haue mercie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, O Lord, for I am weake: O Lord, heale me, for my bones are vexed. My soule also is sore troubled, but Lord, how long wilt thou delay? Now that his soule is sore troubled, he prooueth in this present verse; I am wearie of my groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:6253:5"/>
euery night I wash my bed, and water my couch with my teares. The soule must needes be sore troubled, which is so grieuously tormented. Especially in the words of my text, by three no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table amplifications, he sheweth how serious and syncere his repentance is. First, saies he, Not onely I wash, but also I <hi>water:</hi> secondly, Not onely my bed, but also my <hi>couch:</hi> thirdly, Not only with my gronings, but also with my <hi>teares. I water my couch with my teares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These will be very godly and ghostly medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. The rather, in this time of lent. Onely the worst, I doubt, will be mine. For that hauing discoursed at large of this doctrine els where <note n="m" place="margin">In the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon entitled, The meane in mourning.</note>, I can not now cull out the choisest matter, but must be fain to gather together such fragments as were then left. <hi>I water my couch with my teares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first amplification is in this word, I <hi>water.</hi> Not onely I <hi>wash,</hi> but also I <hi>water.</hi> The faithfull sheepe of the great shepheard, goe vp from the <hi>washing</hi>-place euery one bringing forth twinns, and none barren among them <note n="3" place="margin">Cant. 4.2.</note>. For so Iacobs sheep hauing conceiued at the <hi>watering</hi>-troughs, brought forth strong and particoloured lambs<note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 30.38.</note>. Dauid likewise, who before had erred and stray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like a lost sheepe <note n="o" place="margin">Psal. 119. <hi>vlt.</hi>
               </note>, making here his bed a <hi>washing</hi>-place, by so much the lesse is barren in obedience, by how much the more he is fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in repentance. In Salomons temple stood ten Caldrons of brasse, to <hi>wash</hi> the flesh of those beasts, which were to be sacrificed on the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note n="p" place="margin">1. Reg. 7.38.</note>. Salomons father, maketh a <hi>water</hi> of his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:6253:6"/>
teares, a cauldron of his bed, an alter of his heart, a sacrifice, not of the flesh of vnreasonable beasts, but of his owne bodie, a liuing sacrifice, which is his reasonable seruing of God <note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 12.1.</note>. Now the Hebrewe word <note n="4" place="margin">
                  <hi>Askch.</hi>
               </note> here vsed, signifies properly, To cause to swim, which is more, then simply to <hi>wash.</hi> And thus the Geneua translation rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it, I cause my bed euery night to swim. So that as the preists vsed to swim in the molten Sea<note n="5" place="margin">1 Reg. 7.47.</note>, that they might be pure &amp; cleane, against they performed the holy rites and seruices of the temple: in like manner the princely prophet <hi>washeth</hi> his bed, yea he swimmeth in his bed, or rather he causeth his bed to swim in teares, as in a sea of greife and penitent sorrowe, for his sinne. Neither were this so much to be wondered at, but that he frames the amplification thus; Not onely I <hi>wash,</hi> but also I <hi>water.</hi> Watering in scripture is attributed to sundry things. The holy ghost watereth. Except a man be borne again of <hi>water,</hi> and of the holy Ghost <note n="r" place="margin">Iohn. 3.5.</note>. Because the holy ghost purgeth and cleanseth like water. The word watereth. Paul planteth, Apollo <hi>watereth,</hi> but God giueth the encrease <note n="s" place="margin">1. Cor. 3.6.</note>. Baptisme water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Which was prefigured in the <hi>water</hi> of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahs floode <note n="t" place="margin">1 Peter. 3.21.</note>, and more plainly in the <hi>water</hi> that came out of Christs side <note n="u" place="margin">Iohn. 19 34.</note>. Repentance water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. As in this place; <hi>I water</hi> my couche with my teares. Out of Eden went a riuer to water the garden <note n="6" place="margin">Gen. 2.10.</note>: but Dauids eyes gush out many riuers of water <note n="x" place="margin">Psal. 119.130.</note>, to <hi>water</hi> his couch with his teares. As in Sicilia there is a fountaine called <hi>Fons Solis,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:6253:6"/>
out of which at midday when the sunn is nearest floweth cold water, at midnight when the Sunn is farthest off, floweth hot <hi>water</hi> 
               <note n="y" place="margin">

            <p>Hence we may learne two speciall points for our instruction. One is, that our repentance must be continuall. For the Psalmist hauing said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <note n="9" place="margin">

We read it commonly in the Psalme thus; The mouth of all wickednes shall be stopped <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 107.42.</note>. Which is true, first in this life. Where seeing before their eyes so many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Gods prouidence and protection o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his children, if they will not praise him, yet they shall be enforced, will they nill they, at leastwise to hold their peace, and not blaspheme him.

But it might as well out of the originall be translated thus; <note n="c" place="margin">

               </note>The mouth of all wickednes is stopped. For foolish men are plagued for their offences, and because of their iniquities <note n="d" place="margin">Vers. 17.</note>.

Therefore many times their fruitfull land maketh he barren for the wickednes of them that dwell therein <note n="f" place="margin">Vers. 34.</note>. Yet so foolish are they, that they will not once open their mouth to confesse, either their owne wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, or Gods goodnes. Their mouthes are so stopped, that they will neither crie to the Lord in their trouble, that so they may be deliuered
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:6253:7"/>
from their distresse, nor yet when they are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, praise the Lord for his goodnes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders that he doth for the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of men. The stopping of their mouth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, both sinne in them, and punishment to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. A double sinne, because they open it not, to crie vnto the Lord for deliuerance, or to reioyce in the Lord, and to praise him after deliuerance. A double punishment, because for their not pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing God, their mouthes shall be so stopt that yet they shall not blaspheme him; and for their not dispraising themselues, and confessing their sinnes, and repenting, and crying to God for pardon, they shall haue nothing, though they would neuer so faine, at the last to say for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. Wherby we see that wicked me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s mouths shall be stopped, because they haue bin stopped. Seeing if they had bin open in this life to accuse their own selues for their sinns, then they should be open also at the day of iudgment, beeing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused by the Lord. But, because they haue bin stopt here to couer their sinne, therefore they shall be stopt hereafter to discouer their shame. Now if the wicked shall haue hard hap hereafter, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their mouths shall be stopped, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they haue had hard hearts here, where their mouths haue bin stopped: then consequently, the godly must at no time stop, either their mouthes from confessing, or their eyes from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayling their sinnes.

               </gap>oofe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for vs, that that sinne, which we knowe well is alreadie released by the Lord, should yet still be confessed by vs. For by this means, the merits of Christ are continually imputed vnto vs, which wee by our sinnes had iustly deserued to be depriued of. And moreouer, though in some sort we be sure of pardon alreadie, yet the daily exercise of true repentance maketh our vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and election more and more sure vnto vs <note n="e" place="margin">2 Pet. 1.10.</note>. In this sense the Psalmist sayes againe <note n="19" place="margin">Psalm. 32.5. <hi>Notum facia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, non abscondi.</hi>
               </note>, I will acknowledge my sinne, &amp; mine iniquitie I haue not hid. I haue not stopt my mouth, and I will not stop my mouth: I haue not hid mine iniquity, &amp; I wil not hide mine iniquity; a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. As it is here also, I haue bin weary, and I will be wearie; I haue watered, and I will water: <hi>I water my couch with my teares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other point which we may hence learn is this, That our repentance must alwaies be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a purpose of new obedience. I haue bin wearie of my gronings, sayes he. That he is sure of, and that is past. But though he haue bin weary, yet indeed he is not wearie, seeing he purposeth twice as much as he hath performed.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:6253:8"/>
For for one performance <hi>Laboraui,</hi> that is past, here are two purposes, <hi>Lauabo</hi> and <hi>Rigabo,</hi> that are to come. I haue done it allready, saies he, so so: but if I liue longer, I will doe it oftner, and better. I will wash my bed, and <hi>I will water my couch with my teares.</hi> So that the greatest righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes of the saints in this life, consisteth rather in a daily deploring of their sinnes, &amp; in a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full purpose to amend, then in any eminent and absolute perfection <note n="f" place="margin">

Not that wee ought to serue God by halfes as it were, with purposes &amp; intents, but that hereby the vnperfitnes of our obedience may appeare, which though it be as much as wee can doe considering the weakenes of our abilitie, yet it is not halfe so much as wee ought to doe, considering the excellencie of Gods lawe. Wherefore I shew now, not what should be, but what is, because the best obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ours that is, is not so much as the lest part of that which should be. Harken I pray you attentiuely to that which S. Paul writeth <note n="20" place="margin">Rom. 7.19.</note>; To will is present with mee: but I find no meanes to performe that which is good. For the good which I would doe, that doe I not: but the euill which I would not doe, that doe I. Now if I doe that I would not, it is no more I that doe it, but sinne that dwelleth in mee. Where the Apostle plainly distinguisheth betwene these two, to will good, and to performe good. And the one he saith is present with him, but the other he can no where find. Now if so chosen a vessell <note n="g" place="margin">Acts. 9.15.</note>, will much more good, then he can performe, then
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:6253:9"/>
questionles wee that are farre inferiour, please God, rather by a willing purpose to doe good, then by any full performance of that which wee purpose. Againe, whereas he saies; If I doe that I would not, it is no more I that doe it, but sinne that dwelleth in me; he meaneth not to excuse or extenuate his fault any way, but to shew, that the principall scope and intent of his heart is to serue the lawe of God, howsoeuer contrarie to his intent by the violence of his flesh, he bee drawne to serue sinne. And therefore he saies, The good which I would, that doe I not; but the euill which I would not, that doe I. Insinuating hereby, that the regenerate man, beeing not wholy flesh nor wholy spirit, but partly flesh and partly spirit, as he is spirit would doe that good, which as he is flesh he doth not, &amp; as he is flesh doth that euil, which as he is spirit, he would not. Which makes him also say,<note n="21" place="margin">Act. 24.16.</note>

But out of the compasse of his Apostolical calling, he dares not warrant, that he hath a cleare conscience euery manner of way, but only that he studieth or endeauoreth to haue a cleare conscience. So his fellowe-disciple Barnabas exhorteth them of Antioch that with purpose of heart, they would cleaue vnto the Lord <note n="23" place="margin">Act. 11.23.</note>. For as long as we liue in

Notwithstanding at least wise in purpose of heart it is good for vs to shake off all sinne, &amp; only to hold vs fast vnto god <note n="l" place="margin">Psalm. 73.28.</note>.

So that Dauids <hi>Statuo</hi> is all one with Pauls <hi>Studeo.</hi> And therfore though we may perhaps, and, alas, doe dayly (god for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue vs) transgresse these righteous iudgments, yet our holy oath, our solemne vowe, our assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red promise, our steadfast resolution, is, I hope, I am sure ought to be, to the contrary.

Seeing the best thing that is in vs, is no great performance of any good, god wot, but only a ready will to doe good: a studious indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to haue a cleare conscience: a purpose of the heart to cleaue vnto the lord: an applying of the heart, to fulfill gods statutes: a setled deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to keepe gods words: a steadfast reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to keepe gods righteous iudgments.

            <p>The second amplification is in the word, my <hi>couche.</hi> Not only my <hi>bed,</hi> but also my <hi>couche.</hi> The bed is a place of rest. Especially that florishing <hi>bed</hi>

springs aboue, and the springs beneath. This same blessing and gift Dauid likewise had here obtayned of God. For his washt bed was a spring aboue, and his watred <hi>couch</hi> a spring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath. Euen as the oyntment, vpon Aarons head was a spring aboue, vpon the skirts of his garments a spring beneath: and the teares, vpon Maries face were a spring aboue, vpon Christs feet a spring beneath: and the sweate, vpon our Lords body was a spring aboue, vpon the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a spring beneath. So here, I say, is, <hi>irriguum supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and <hi>irriguum inferius,</hi> a spring aboue, and a spring beneath: I wash my bed, and <hi>water my couch with my teares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence we may learne one very excellent good lesson. That we ought in the same kind and sort as we haue sinned, if it be possible, to make some part of amends for our sinne. Dauid had haynously transgressed against God vpon his couch, where he committed adultery. Therefore that in the selfe same place, where before he had bin ouercome by the deuill, he might erect an eternall monument of his victorie and triumph ouer the deuill, he saies here; <hi>I water my couch with my teares.</hi> In the very same couch God is as highly now honored, as he was before offended. Because Dauid did before pollute it by adultery, but now he doth sanctifie it by repentance. So the Israelites <note n="33" place="margin">Exod. 35.22.</note>, once pluckt off their earings to make a golden calfe: but anon after, repenting them, they offered their earings to the building of the temple. And so with the same Iewels,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:6253:11"/>
wherewith they did erect Idolatrie, now they maintaine Gods seruice. Zacheus <note n="34" place="margin">Luc. 19.8.</note> beeing a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, no doubt got much of his goods by plaine briberie and extortion: but not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he restored all againe foure-fold, and spent of his wealth very frankly and bountifully to giue Christ a friendly welcome, and kind enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment in his house. That sinnefull woman<note n="35" place="margin">Luc. 7.38.</note>, of whome I spake euen now, neuer tooke halfe so much delight in entising her louers with her beautifull lockes, as now shee is glad with all her heart to wipe the very feete of our Sauiour with them. A worthie example of this we haue in our owne stories. Archbishop Cranmer <note n="y" place="margin">See Master Fox his booke of M<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And so he tooke a holy reuenge of himselfe, as S. Paul wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs <note n="z" place="margin">2.

One, which he put himselfe to, by burning first his right hand: the other, which the Papists put him to, by burning afterward his whole bodie. And so that constant and faithfull right-hand of his, neuer so much dishonoured God by his subscription with inke to the bill, as it did honour God by his inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with blood in the fire. The Apostles wordes are generall, <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 6.19.</note>As you haue giuen your members seruants to vncleannes to commit iniquitie, so now giue your members seruants vnto righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes in holines.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:6253:12"/>
One is this; The putting out of the eyes is not a bridle to restraine incontinencie, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a marke to descrie it. For he that doth so, in a manner openly confesseth, concupiscence so raigneth in him <note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 6.12.</note>, that he can by no kinde of meanes resist it, but by a violent boaring out of his owne eyes. The other is this; The fault is not in the eye, but in the heart. Therefore to put out the eye, is to make cleane but the outside of the platter<note n="g" place="margin">Luc. 11.39.</note>.

            <p>Hence wee may gather two very profitable notes, worthie of our remembrance. The first is, That euery new act of sinne must be bewailed by a new act of repentance. Not that it is possible for vs to reckon vp or euen so much as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member all and euery of our sinnes, but that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing hartely repented of those, or of that sinne which most dangerously hath wasted &amp; al-most destroyed our conscience, then wee ought at the last to say with the Psalmist, <note n="y" place="margin">Psal. 29.12.</note> Who can tell how oft he offendeth? O cleanse thou me from my secret sinnes. This same holy prophet, euen when he was in the state of grace, defiled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with an other mans wife. Yet he slept not ouerlong in this sinne, but being awaked by the prophet Nathan, and more thoroughly by this sicknes which was gods messenger vnto him, he renewed his repentance, <hi>and watered his couche with his teares.</hi> So must we. For it is nothing but a slander which the church of Rome casteth vpon vs, that forsooth we should teach, a man whose person is iustified by faith in Christ committing some foule act, is neuer a whit the worse for it. Nay, our doctrine is this, That such an one hath hurt himselfe two waies. In respect of his owne guiltines; and in respect of Gods righteousnes. For the first; though God for his part doe not
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:6253:15"/>
breake off the purpose of adoption, and adiudge him to wrath, and therefore he is not guiltie of condemnation for sin; yet he is simply guiltie of sin, &amp; hath grieuously wounded his owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. For the second; though God again hath par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned all the sins of his elect, euen those that are to come, by his decree, by his promise, by the valewe and price of his sonnes merits, yet abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and actually he doth not apply this pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the apprehension and feeling of the sinners fayth, till he recouer himselfe, and renewe his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Marry this we teach, that god vphoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his chosen children so by faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that it is vnpossible any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should die in finall impenitency. But that sweet sanctifiing spirit which dwelleth in them, is still busy like a bee as we say, and neuer leaues stinging them, &amp; stirring them vp to repentance, and working them like waxe as it were, till as much as it was before greiued for their auersion by sin, so much it be after delighted for their conuersion by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of life. Therefore as all they neede not to doubt a whit of their saluation, who after they haue fallen a sleepe in sinne, awake betimes, <hi>and water their couch with their teares:</hi> so I assure you (Holy Brethren) theire case is dangerous &amp; desperate, nay they are in a cursed case, which will not be awaked, but lie still sleeping &amp; sno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in sin. Seeing no pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can be procured, but where repentance is renewed. For god doth not giue vs rules to keepe, and breake them himselfe. Now his rule is this; <note n="51" place="margin">Luc. 17.4.</note> Though thy brother sinne
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:6253:16"/>
against thee seuen times in a day, &amp; seuen times in a day turne again to thee, saying, It repenteth me; thou shalt forgiue him. Therefore as I am bound to forgiue my brother in deed, though he doe not aske me forgiuenes, but I am not bound to goe to him and tell him, I forgiue him, except he first come to me and tell me He repents, but if he doe thus, then am I bound also to tell him I forgiue him: so the lord though in the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous degree of his fatherly adoption he haue sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vp the remission of all our sinnes, yet he doth not open the bagg, and shew the treasures of his mercy to vs ward in it, till he see vs become new men. For then he hath bound him selfe by his louing promise, and hath giuen vs his word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he will forgiue vs our sinne. At what time soeuer a sinner repenteth, saith he <note n="z" place="margin">Ezech, 18.21.</note>, and water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his couche with his <hi>teares,</hi> I will remember his iniquities no more. Naaman the Syrian was willed to wash himselfe seauen times in Iordan. <note n="52" place="margin">2. Reg. 5.10.</note> Why seauen times? was not one time enough? Yes surely. For him it was enough, but not for vs. For that was done, rather for our example, then for his benefit. Seeing his malady was only a leprosie: but our soule is leprous with sinne. And therefore if he for one leprosie wasnt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe seauen times, how much more ought we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery time we sinne to be sorry for it, and if wee doe not wash our selues seauen times for one sinne, yet at the leastwise to wash our selues sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen times for seauen sinnes, seeing the most iust
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:6253:16"/>
of vs all, as Salomon witnesseth <note n="a" place="margin">Pro. 24.16.</note>, may seauen times fal in one day? Or rather many men in the world haue not only seauen deadly sinnes, but euen seauen deuills in them <note n="b" place="margin">Luc. 8.2.</note>, which they can no waies wash out, but by bitter weeping, and watering their couch with their <hi>teares.</hi> To the angel of Ephesus thus saith the spirit <note n="53" place="margin">Reuel. 2.5.</note>, Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and doe the first workes, or els I will remooue thy candlesticke out of his place. So that if we let our sinne stand still, our candlesticke shall be remooued: but if we would haue our candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticke stand still, our sinne must be remooued. We must repent and doe the first workes, not those which we must repent of, but those which wee are fallen from. Wonderfull are the words of the Apostle; God hath committed the word of reconciliation vnto vs, therefore we are Christs embassadours, and God entreating you as it were by vs, wee beseech you in the name of Christ, that you would be reconciled to God <note n="54" place="margin">2. Cor. 5.20.</note>. What, may some man say, were not the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians reconciled alreadie? wherefore then is the Apostle so earnest about nothing? I but they doe not vnderstand the Apostle which make this obiection. He knew well enough they were reconciled before. But he knew as well, the best of vs all can not stand in Gods fauour one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute of an hower without a good mediatour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For since our first reconciliation to God, we haue so often offended his maiestie, that if we doe not plie him with humble supplications, and daily
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:6253:17"/>
Petitions, and heartie repentance, and vnfained teares, he and wee can not possibly be friends. And therefore the Apostle calls vpon the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians so earnestly, and cries to them, and saies, Take heede, Feare God, Offend him not, Ye can get nothing by falling out with him, But in case ye haue bin ouertaken with any sinne <note n="c" place="margin">Gal. 6.1.</note>, ye haue an aduocate with the father <note n="d" place="margin">1. Iohn. 2.1.</note>, Flie vnto him for succour, If you be wise be reconciled to God as soone as you can, God entreateth you: (O mercifull Lord, dost thou sue &amp; seeke to vs? and is there any thing in the world that we can pleasure thee in? can our goodnes reach vnto thee <note n="e" place="margin">Psalm. 16.2.</note>? and dost thou entreat vs? yea saies he) God entreateth you, and wee his Ambassadours in the name of Iesus Christ beseech you, that you would be reconciled to God. Be reconciled to God, and though you haue offended him ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so much, he will be reconciled to you. As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure your selues, you may lay your life of it, he will presently turne vnto you, if you in true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance will turne vnto him, and water your couch with your <hi>teares.</hi> For so this our Prophet did no sooner confesse his fault, but Nathan proclaimd his pardon <note n="55" place="margin">2. Sam. 12.13.</note>. Whereupon he himselfe also hath these words <note n="56" place="margin">Psal. 32.5.</note>, I said I will confesse my wickednes vnto the Lord, and thou forgauest the iniquitie of my sinne. As the Lyonesse ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bin false to the Lyon, by going to a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard; and the Storke consorting with any other besides her owne mate, wash themselues before they dare returne home: in like manner the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:6253:17"/>
here, before he can be reconciled to God, after this great breach by adulterie and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note n="f" place="margin">2 Sam. ii.4. &amp; 15.</note>, is faine to wash his bed, and to water his couch with his <hi>teares.</hi> But here a question may arise: If the faithfull be subiect, neither to aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall condemnation when they doe sinne, nor yet to finall impenitencie when they haue sinned, what neede they at all, either auoide sinne for which they shall not be condemned, or els ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten their repentance, of which they shall not be depriued? This question consisteth of two parts. The one touching condemnation: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther touching impenitencie. To the former part I say as before, Though there be sinne in them, yet there is no condemnation to them, which are in Christ Iesus <note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 8.1.</note>. But how? This is no thanks to them that sinne, thereby making themselues guiltie of sinne, and as much as in them lieth subiect also to condemnation for the same: but onely to God, who wrappeth vp all the sinnes of his children in the bowels of his deare sonne, that they appeare not in his sight to condemne them, either in this world or in the world to come. As Shem went backward and couered his fathers nakednes <note n="h" place="margin">Gen. 9.23.</note>: so God casteth our sinnes behind his backe, and doth not impute them to vs. Howbeit though condemnation neede not be feared, yet there are reasons enough besides to perswade all those to hate sinne, that loue God. One is, because God doth vsually with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the outward signes of his fauour from them which forget their dutie towards him. The
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:6253:18"/>
whole booke of Iob is proofe sufficient. Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in one place <note n="i" place="margin">Iob. 7.20.</note> he saith; I haue sinned, what shall I doe vnto thee, O thou preseruer of men, why hast thou set me as a marke against thee, so that I am burden to my selfe? And Dauid <note n="k" place="margin">Psal. 44.24.</note>, Why standest thou so farre off, O Lord, a and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thy selfe in the needefull time of trouble? For as Ioseph made himselfe strange to his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and spake vnto them roughly <note n="l" place="margin">Gen. 42.7.</note>, though he loued them well enough: euen so the Lord, though he take not his mercie from his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet he chastiseth their iniquities with roddes, and their sinnes with scourges <note n="m" place="margin">Psal. 89.33.</note>. An other is, because the faithfull sinning loose the inward feeling of Gods fauour. As Iob testifieth in these words; Thou writest bitter things against me, and thou wilt consume me with the sinnes of my youth <note n="n" place="margin">Iob. 13.26.</note>. And Dauid, O giue me the comfort of thy helpe againe, and establish me with thy free spirit <note n="o" place="margin">Psal. 51.12.</note>. He wanted not Gods helpe, nor his spirit, but yet he was so discouraged and cast downe in his owne conscience, that he felt not the comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tast of Gods helpe, nor the blessed freedome of his spirit. And euen so generally, the godly sinning, though they quench not the spirit alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <note n="p" place="margin">1. Thes. 5.19.</note>, yet by greeuing it they feele such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation in their soules, as if they were quite cast out of fauour with God. To the latter part of this question I answer, that the sinnes of the godly are therefore with repentance, because the graces of God are without repentance <note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 11.29.</note>. And as it is vnpossible that they which sinne in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:6253:18"/>
of the spirit, should be renewed by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance <note n="r" place="margin">Hebr. 6.6.</note>: so it is vnpossible that they should not be renewed by repentance which sinne of infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as all the faithfull doe. For though the flesh haue the vpper hand one while enforcing them to sinne, yet the spirit will get the masterie an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwhile, making them heartily sorie for their sin. Neuertheles great reason is it they should not abuse the patience of God mouing them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance <note n="s" place="margin">Rom. 2 4.</note>, but rather that they should instantly stirr vp this gift of God in them <note n="t" place="margin">2. Tim. 1.6.</note>, to which they are sure at length the course &amp; motion of Gods spirit will bring them. For first, what a horrible thing is it, either for God to withdrawe his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly and fauorable countenance from vs, or for vs to haue a hell as it were in our owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, both which as I haue already shewed, doe necessarily followe sinne? Besides, seeing all the good wee get by sinne is repentance and greife, farre better it is to begin betimes to repent, and so forthwith to enioy the comfortable feeling of Gods mercifull pardon, then by deferring our repentance, still to be tormented with the horrour of our guilty conscience. Moreouer, the end is not a barre against the meanes, but rather a great furtherer &amp; setter of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on forward. We being therefore sure we shall repent at the last, ought neuer a whit the lesse to vse the meanes as soone as we can, by ceasing to doe ill, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to doe well <note n="u" place="margin">Esa. 1.17.</note>. Euen as S. Paul, though he knew certainly he should not perish in that ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke, yet he vsed the best meanes he could to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:6253:19"/>
saue his life <note n="x" place="margin">Act. 27.44.</note>. Lastly this is one maine difference betweene the wicked and the godly, that they hauing their consciences seared with a hot yron <note n="y" place="margin">1. Tim. 4.2.</note>, and being past feeling <note n="z" place="margin">Eph. 4.19.</note>, goe on still in sinning without any sence of sinne <note n="a" place="margin">

               </note>: but these, hauing their sences exercised to discerne betweene good and euill <note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 5.14.</note>, neuer rest if they be hurt with the sting of sinne, till they be eftsoones salued &amp; healed by Gods mercie. For as the Swallowe perceiuing himselfe almost blind, presently see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth out the herbe Chelidonia <note n="c" place="margin">Celandine</note>: and the Hart feeling himselfe shot with an arrowe sticking in him, forthwith runneth to the hearb Dictamnus <note n="d" place="margin">Ditany.</note>: right so doe the godly. Take Ezechias for an example of a Swallowe. All that is in mine house haue they seene, there is nothing among my treasures that I haue not shewed them <note n="e" place="margin">2. Reg. 20.15.</note>. There he is blind. For the more treasures the King of Babels ambassadours sawe, the more was Ezechias blinded with ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in shewing them. Like a crane or a Swallowe, so did I chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I did mourne as a doue. I shall walke weakly all my yeares in the bitternes of my soule <note n="f" place="margin">Esa. 38.14. &amp; 15.</note>. Heres the Chelidonia. For this bitternes of his soule, doth cure the blindnes of his soule. Take Iob for an example of a Hart. The arrowes of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty are in me, the venome whereof doth drinke vp my spirit, and the terrors of God fight against me <note n="g" place="margin">Iob. 6.4.</note>. There he is shot. For if he had not bin strooken before with the arrowes of his owne wickednes, hee should neuer haue bin strooken thus with the arrowes of Gods cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:6253:19"/>
I abhorre my selfe and repent in dust &amp; <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>shes <note n="h" place="margin">Iob. 42.6.</note> Heres the Dictamnus. For this abhorring of himselfe is a recouering of himselfe: and the sooner he repents in dust and ashes, the sooner is he freed from all his sinnes, and from all the punishments due to the same. But now some man may further obiect and say, He is not yet fully satisfied for this latter part, because talke as long as wee will, all these inconueniences which come, as hath bin declared, by perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in sinne, are either no bridle at all, or els not so strong a bridle to restraine men from sinne, as if they be perswaded, they may by sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning quite and cleane loose all iustifying grace, and so may be finally impenitent when they dye. But he which will put forth this doubt must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that the children of God are led by the spirit of God <note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 8.14.</note>. And the spirit though not in the same degree, yet in the same sort worketh in all those that haue bin, are, or shall be sanctified <note n="k" place="margin">2 Cor. 4.13. <hi>Eundem spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi>
               </note>. Who as they serue God not for any seruile feare of loosing their faith, or of dying in impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency, or such like, but onely for pure loue of his maiestie: so they can neither will nor choose, but being bitten with sinne they must needs in their soules and consciences feele the smart of it. Therefore S. Paul saith, The flesh lusteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, and these are contrarie one to the other, so that yee cannot doe the same things that yee wold <note n="l" place="margin">Gal. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.17.</note>. For if the faithfull would doe Gods will in earth as it is in heauen, and serue him as obediently
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:6253:20"/>
&amp; as perfectly as the good angels doe, they can not, because still in them the flesh lusteth against the spirit: and so againe, if they would sinne with full consent, or with an obstinate pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to continew in sinne, as the euill angels doe, they cannot doe this neither, because still in them the spirit lusteth against the flesh. Which spirit though it may for a time bee shut vp as it were, yet it will find meanes well enough at length to shewe it selfe. Thus E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihu saith; The spirit within me compelleth me, Behold my belly is as wine which hath no vent, and like the newe bottles that burst. Therefore will I speake, that I may take breath <note n="m" place="margin">Iob. 32.19.</note>. As Elihu then kept silence some while euen from good wordes, though it were paine and greife to him; but at the last the fire kindling and his heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hot within him, spake with his tongue <note n="n" place="margin">Psal. 39.3.</note>: so the spirit of god in all the elect of god, is like wine put into a bottle, which will haue a vent to spurge out, or els it will burst the bottle; or like fire rakt vp in embers, which will haue a passage to burne out, or els it will consume the whole house <note n="o" place="margin">1. Iohn. 3.9.</note>. And therfore Saint Iohn likewise saith; Whosoeuer is borne of God doth not sinne: for his seede remaineth in him, neither can he sinne, because hee is borne of God. Marke yee this well. The Apostle thinketh it not enough to say, He doth not sinne: but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth moreouer, He cannot sinne. Whats that? To wit, presumptuously without feare, hee doth not sinn: and desperately without remorse,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:6253:20"/>
he can not sin. He can not sinne, I say, presumtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, as Pharaoh did: desperately, as Caine did: malitiously, as Iudas did: blasphemously, as Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian did: He cannot, he cannot sinne thus. Why so? Because the seede of God remaineth still in him. And whats this seede of God? It is the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, of which S. Paul said euen now; The spirit lusteth against the flesh, and these are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie one to the other, so that ye cannot doe the same things that ye would. Ye doe not sinne, nay ye can not sinne as the flesh would haue you; ye can not doe the same things that ye would: but ye doe, nay ye can not choose but doe many times as the seede of God remaining in you, and as the spirit of God lusting in you, would haue you. So that this is a legall kind of preaching to say; Take heede you sinne not: ye may happen so to loose your faith: to loose all the iustifying grace which God hath giuen you: to be for euer excluded out of the kingdome of heauen. This is to be said to vassals, to drudges, to slaues; not to sonnes. To sonnes this may be better said <note n="p" place="margin">Hebr. 12.5. <hi>vobis vt filiis.</hi>
               </note>; Take heede ye sinne not: God hath adopted you and giuen you the earnest of his spirit <note n="q" place="margin">2. Cor. 5.5.</note>.

In one word, (ye holy ones of God, I speake now to you all, beloued) he which standes much vpon this obiection, hath no faith, no repentance, no iustifying grace at all in him.

               </note> that thirty years old he was when he was raised vp, &amp; thirty yeares more he liued after he had bin rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vp. So that halfe his life he spent in sinne: the other halfe in repentance for sinne. But I haue a little forgot my selfe. Yet it will be no great fault, (right Honorable, and beloued in our Lord,) if it will please you to pardon it. I should haue obserued to you in the first place, how Christ was earnestly requested to raise vp the first <note n="n" place="margin">Mark. 5.23.</note>; but raised vp the two last of his own accord <note n="o" place="margin">Luc. 7.13. &amp; Ioh. 11.11.</note>: &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwise, how for the two first their freinds only wept<note n="p" place="margin">Mar. 5.38. &amp; Lu. 7.13.</note>; but for the last, besides his sisters and frends, Christ also wept exceedingly<note n="q" place="margin">Iohn. 11.35.</note>. These are very important matters, and properly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the point in hand. For seeing the young maiden by sinning in consent had lesse offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Christ, he would not haue troubled himself about her, but vpon intreatie of others: but the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:6253:24"/>
two last, the one an actuall, the other a customa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sinner, which were in a more dangerous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, he came-to beeing brought by the bowels onely of his owne mercie, and raised them vp: on the other side, the two first hauing sinned, the one in thought, the other in deede, did not so much mooue Christ as Lazarus, which was growne to a custome in sinning both waies; and therfore for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent their friends only should weepe, but for this last he wept and tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled his owne selfe very much. So that the first he neither restored of his owne accord, nor yet wept for her: the second he restored of his owne accord, but wept not for him: the third he both restored of his owne accord, and also wept for him. Why so? The reason is this. The young maidens sinne, the lesse it hazarded her owne soule, the lesse it grieued Christs soule, and so the lesse he had a care, either to cure it, or to rue it: the young mans sinne, being neither so small as the maydens, nor so great as Lazaruses, Christ raysed him vp of his owne accord because he was more then a sinner in thought, and yet wept not for him because he was lesse then a sinner in custome: Lazarus sin, the more ranke and deadly it was, the more did it require the skill and loue of such a Phisition, as by his passion could mend it, &amp; by his compassion would moane it. Where we must obserue with Saint Augustine, that our blessed Sauiour did not take on thus grieuously, for himselfe so much, or for Lazarus, as for vs. He groaned in the spirit: he was troubled in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:6253:24"/>
he wept: he groned againe: he lifted vp his eies: he prayed feruently: he cryed with a loude voyce. So that here he might well haue said with David; I am weary of my groanings: and, <hi>I water my couche with my teares.</hi> But wherefore did he groane thus, weepe thus, cry thus, pray thus, lift vp his eies thus, lift vp his voyce thus?

them againe: what doe I? whether goe I? what will be the ende of this? when thou saiest thus, then Christ groaneth, because thy faith groaneth. By the voyce of thy groaning may be gathered good hope of thy rising. If this faith be in thee, Christ groaneth in thee. If faith be in vs, Christ is in vs. Thus farr S. Augustine. In conclusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then; If Christ winking at lesser sinnes, or at least not so much lamenting them, did out of all measure bewayle Lazarus case, betokening those that haue bin long dead in trespasses and sinnes, though it pertained not directly to himselfe: how much more good Lord, ought I, which am a farr more haynous sinner then ever Lazarus was, as my sinnes, mine owne sinnes I say, for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber are more then the hayres of my head<note n="t" place="margin">Psal. 40.30.</note>, and for greatnes haue reached vp to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For in the lawe, the greatnes of the sinne was esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated according to the condition of the sinner. The priuate mans sinne was little: the princes sinne great: all the peoples sinne greater: the preists sinne greatest of all. Therefore for each of these was ordained a seuerall sacrifice <note n="64" place="margin">Leuitic. 4.</note>. For the priuate man and the prince, a goate. But for him a shee-goate <note n="x" place="margin">Vers. 28.</note>: for this a hee-goate<note n="y" place="margin">Vers. 23.</note>.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:6253:25"/>
and the preist, a young bullocke.

Now as a young bullock is a greater sacrifice then a goate: so the priest doth vndergoe a greater penance and more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen shame the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all the people. Besides, of all these, their offence that sinned ignorantly, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted not so great as theirs that sinned wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. And therefore they were to offer a ram worth two shekels <note n="b" place="margin">Lev. 5.15.</note>; but these a ram of what price the preist would appoint <note n="c" place="margin">Liu. 27.12.</note>, according to the measure and estimation of the sinne <note n="d" place="margin">Leui. 6.6. <hi>Iuxta aestimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem mensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramque peccati</hi>

Cor. 11.31.</note>, in repenting as hartely as we sinned haynously, in washing our bed, and <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring our couch with our teares?</hi> Euen this our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet sheweth also very good euidence for this same doctrine els where. Haue mercie vpon me, O Lord, saies he, after thy great goodnes, and according to the multitude of thy mercies doe away mine offences. Wash me thoroughly from my wickednes, and cleanse me from my sinne <note n="66" place="margin">Psal. 51.2.</note>. The goodnes of God is alwaies like it selfe, neyther great nor little but absolutely infinite. Therefore it is neuer a whit the greater for our compting it not little, nor neuer a whit the lesse for our counting it not great: but though wee compt it great yet it is still as little as it should be, and though we compt it little yet it is still as great as it can be. So that the Psalmist in tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Gods goodnes great, setteth foorth the greatnes, rather of his owne badnes, then of gods goodnes: confessing his owne sinne indeed to be great, and so consequently Gods goodnes likewise to be great, but yet in this respect only, not because it can take any encrease of greatnes into it selfe; but because it can giue increase of gladnes to him, who for a great sinne is almost ouerwhelmed with as great a greife. The same may be said of Gods mercies, that they are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther many nor few, but as his goodes is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible, so his mercies are innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:6253:26"/>
Neuerthelesse the Prophet stickes not to say; According to the multitude of thy mercies, doe away mine offences. As if he should haue said; According to thy mercies, doe away the multitude of mine offences. The multitude then, to speake properly, is not of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, but of mine offences, and yet seeing the mercies of God are as many as all mine offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, nay a great many more then all the offences of all the world, therfore he me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tions a multitude of Gods mercies. Because nothing can asswage the multitude of sorrowes which arise in my heart<note n="h" place="margin">Psal. 94.19.</note>, for the multitude of my offences, but the multitude of Gods mercies. The multitude of mine offences asking indeede, as on Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe a multitude of mercies, so on my behalfe a multitude of <hi>teares.</hi> And therefore he saies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so; wash me thoroughly: or as it is in the latin translation<note n="67" place="margin">

               </note>, wash me yet more. Wash me and wash me: and yet more: againe and againe; wash me thoroughly from my wickednes, and cleanse me from my sinne. For euen as a vessell that hath bin tainted with poison, or some infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious liquor, will not be cleane with once wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing, but must be often scalded, and thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly washed, before it will be sweete: so hauing heretofore possessed my vessell in impuritie <note n="i" place="margin">1.

And
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:6253:27"/>
indeede though I can not wash my selfe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly, yet I am sure thou hast washt mee tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly, because I haue repented me thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

For the raising of Lazarus which hath bin dead fowre daies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth the greatest groning and weeping: the greater sinne, as of the Priest, or voluntarie, or such like, requireth the greater sacrifice: if I haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted great wickednes, except I shew great repentance, I cannot obtaine great mercie: if I haue bin thoroughly defiled, except I be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly washed, I can not be thoroughly clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.

            <p>To returne then where I left, and so to make an ende; S.

But howsoeuer they may seeme to be, they are I graunt very hyperbolicall. Yet so, as the meaning of them is plaine enough. As if he
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:6253:27"/>
should haue saide; I doe not indeede cause my bed to swimme in showers of teares; neither doe I melt my couch with floods of teares: but yet if euer any man had done so, or if it were possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble any man could doe so, then my repentance is so great, and my teares so aboundant, that I thinke verily whosoeuer is one I should be an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which should cause my bed to swim, and my couch to melt, seeing, Euery night I wash my bed, and <hi>water my couch with my teares.</hi> Therefore they which can gather no good meaning out of these words, doe consider, neither how fearefull the wrath and indignation of God is, nor yet how horrible is the sense of sinne.

This if the Emperour had knowne, he would rather haue bought Dauids <hi>couch</hi> that he might not haue slept for bewayling his sinnes, then this banckrupts bed that hee might haue slept notwithstanding all his cares. For these, these, euen our sinnes, these are the debts which so trouble and torment the soule, that a man were better haue many common wealthes in his head, yea the cares of all the world in his head, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be disquieted &amp; distracted with them. Wherefore, deare christians, if we be in good health, let vs be thankfull to God for it, &amp; let vs accoumpt it a speciall blessing without which all worldly blessings are nothing, and let vs vse it as all other good gifts of God to his glorie &amp; the good of one an other. If contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it please the Lord at any time to visite vs with sicknes, let vs not in this case despaire nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But first, whatsoeuer other causes wee may conceaue, let vs ingeniously acknowledge one cause of our sicknes to be our sinnes. For if wee would preuent the iudgements of god by timely repentance, and iudge our selues, wee should not be iudged of the Lord. But because men will not when they are in health thinke of him that giueth health, therefore oftentimes they are sick, and now and then also fall a sleepe <note n="q" place="margin">1. Cor. 11.30.</note>. For euen as malefactors which will not by gentle meanes confesse their heinous crimes, are by racking or
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:6253:28"/>
such like tortures enforced to confesse: so when grieuous sinners can see no time to repent, God in his iustice, or rather indeede in his great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, doth as it were racke them vpon their couch with sicknesses and bodily paines, that they may be constrained to confesse their sinnes, and so may be freed of two sicknesses, their bodies sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and their soules sicknes both at once. O hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, happie men are they, which when they are young, remember their Creator before they be old <note n="r" place="margin">Ecles. 12.1.</note>: and when they are in health confesse their sinnes, and forsake them before they be sicke <note n="s" place="margin">Prov. 28.13.</note>. And yet, good louing brother, if thou happen to be sicke, be not in any case, as I said before, be not altogether discouraged by it. But in the next place, remember that thy sicknes is nothing else, but Gods fatherly visitation to doe the good, and especially to mooue thee to repentance. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten a little.

The Centurion beleued though Christ came not vnder the roofe of his house, but spake the word only, his seruant might be healed well enough: and doest thou thinke Christ cannot heale thee except he come in person, &amp; stand by thy bed side, and take thee by the hand, and raise thee vp? For shame away with such infidelitie. This is a thousand times worse then all the sicknes of thy body. Nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther assure thy selfe, if god say but the word, thou shalt soone recouer, and haue thy health better then euer thou hadest, and liue many happie and ioyfull daies after. Therefore mind thou only that which belongeth to thee: that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to God meddle not with it, but leaue it wholly vnto him. It is thy part to bewaile thy former sinnes, and in bewailing them <hi>to water thy couch with thy teares,</hi> to crie to the Lord for mercie and forgiuenes, to resolue with thy selfe stedfastly hereafter, if it please God to giue thee thy health againe, to lead a new life.

to thee, and therefore this thou must me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate of, and employ thy selfe about day and night: but whether thou shalt recouer or not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer, that belongeth to God. That rests altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Gods pleasure and will. If thou doest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer, thou hast thy desire. Or rather perhaps thou hast not thy desire. Seeing the holiest and best men of all incline neither this way nor that way, but wholly resigne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, as in all other things, so especially in this case to Gods will <note n="p" place="margin">

               </note>. Or if they determinately desire any thing, it is for the most part, to be dissolued, and to be with Christ <note n="q" place="margin">Philip. 1.23.</note>. But suppose thou desire to recouer, and recouer indeede. Then as thou obtainest thy desire: so thou must performe thy promise. The promise which thou madst when thy bodie was grieued, with sicknes and paine, when thy soule was oppressed with heauines, when thou <hi>wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redst thy couch with thy teares.</hi> And what was that promise? Namely, as I said before, that if it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed god to giue thee health againe, thou wouldst loue him more sincerely, serue him more obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, tender his glory more dearly, follow thy calling more faithfully, then thou hast done. If thou haue offended him with pride, to humble thy selfe heareafter: if with dissolutenes, to be so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber heareafter: if with couetuousnes, to be libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heareafter: if with conuersing with the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, to abandon their company heareafter, &amp; to say as it is in this Psalme; Depart from me ye workers of iniquitie, for the lord hath heard the voice of my weeping. This if thou conscionably
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:6253:31"/>
&amp; constantly performe, then in a good hower (as we say) and in a happy time thou didst recouer. But suppose thou desire to recouer, and yet, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thy self see any liklihood, nor god see it good thou shouldst recouer. Then harty repentance &amp; <hi>watering thy couch with thy teares</hi> is most of all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary. That the feare of death may not affright thee, but being truly penitent at thy departure, thou mayst be sure to depart in peace <note n="r" place="margin">Luc. 2 29.</note>. And so God graunting not thy will but his will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may indeede graunt both thy will and his will.
