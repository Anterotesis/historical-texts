            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE DECLARATION OF Commiſſary Generall BEHR, Againſt divers ſlanders and lies ſpread abroad againſt him.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas by ſome malicious and ill diſpoſed perſons ſeverall ſlanders and calumnies have beene by Letters and otherwiſe ſpread abroad againſt me and my reputation, in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry particulars:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, that J have ſaid, that in caſe the Parliament and his Excellency the Earle of</hi> Eſſex <hi>ſhould be at variance, J would fight for the Earle againſt the Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, that J have detracted, by ill Language, from the Honour and reputation of the Scottiſh Nation in generall; and in particular, from the Honour of his Excellency the Lord Generall</hi> Leſley.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, that J have laid baſe aſperſions upon the whole Nation of the Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, that J have behaved my ſelfe ſo Poultron-like, as that in the head of a Brigade J have ſuffered my ſelfe to be baffled, without offering that juſt defence appertaining to the reputation of a Souldier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the Law of God and nature, and by the particular obligation of Military duty I am forced unto ſome Apology for my ſelfe, albeit it troubleth me to ſpeake for mine owne private, when I muſt be doing for the publique. But I will ſay but little.</p>
            <p>When I firſt entered into this ſervice, and ever ſince, I have had no end but unto which I and the reſt of the Army were directed by the State for the defence of Religion and Liberty, againſt the common Enemy: it being impoſſible that ſuch a miſchievous thought ſhould riſe in my heart, as what to doe in a falling out betwixt the Parliament and the Earle, while the common deſigne of the State is ſo honourably and faithfully carried on by his Excellency.</p>
            <p>Neither am I guilty to my ſelfe of ſo much barbarity in manners, and perverſneſſe in judgement, as to ſlander the glory of the Scottiſh Nation, purchaſed by them in ſo many valorous and Noble actions, and atteſted by the common report and eſteeme of <hi>Europe.</hi> And in particular of Generall <hi>Leſley,</hi> whoſe conſtancy, valour, and fidelity, hath beene ſo highly honoured by the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and of whoſe actions ſo good a memory is left in my native Countrey of <hi>Germany,</hi> I having had the honour not onely to be a fellow-ſouldier and Commander in that Army, but a ſpectator alſo, and a witneſſe of his atchievements.</p>
            <p>Nor can I diſcover in my ſelfe that height of impudency, as to dare defame the Engliſh Nation, which carrieth throughout the World ſo high a luſtre of Glory and Renowne, eſpecially in this time and occaſion, while by this Noble Nation I have the honour done me to be imployed in ſo important a charge, for the defence of the State.</p>
            <p>To the laſt calumnie I can ſay nothing, but muſt referre my behaviour unto the report of thoſe Gentlemen and Souldiers, who upon our march to and from <hi>Gloceſter</hi> were in the Brigade.</p>
            <p>But of all theſe calumnies and lyes in generall I am bound to ſay, that they are invented, forged, and vented by men ill affected to the common good, who for ſiniſter ends endeavour to ſow diviſion, and to rend in ſunder the happy union of the two Nations: of which raveling ſome beginnings are already diſcovered in divers Commanders who have laid downe their Commiſſions in his Excellencies Army, upon no other ground, but that it ſtandeth not with their honour to ſerve where the robber of their Nations honour is tolerated.</p>
            <p>I proteſt before the Almighty God, and all men of Honour, that in theſe particulars, and in any other that may have reference to theſe, I am maliciouſly and undeſervedly circumvented, baſely ſlandered, and falſely belyed. And if any one ſhall be ſo forward as to take upon him the maintenance of any of theſe, I hereby offer my ſelfe ready to give him all the ſatisfaction which with life and honour a Souldier and Gentleman is bound to do.</p>
