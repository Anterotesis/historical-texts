            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F a man ſhould look on all <hi>Books,</hi> ſince there were any, he ſhall finde that few Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have been ſo fortunate in their Writings, but they have left ſomewhat for thoſe that ſhould come after them to except againſt; and ſo conſequently few have been tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Poſterity, without the caſtigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and cenſorious remarks of other men; and theſe not proceeding from envious emulation, but from ſober and ſerious <hi>enquiry</hi> after <hi>Truth.</hi> But if any have been thought ſo tranſcendent, as to have been able to eſcape theſe, yet whether Poſterity have not been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus'd by a ſervility of imitation of them, or precipitate ſuperſtruction on them, is much to be queſtion'd. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, all theſe kinde of Labors
<pb facs="tcp:119773:5"/>
have ever been encourag'd and reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſuch, as have both as to Religion and Policy not meanly oblig'd Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde: Nor indeed can we look on thoſe that decry ſuch endeavors, but as ſuch as ſeek Fig-leaves to cover ſome ſecret Errors, or are too fondly ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor'd of their own opinions. <hi>Truth,</hi> as it is a <hi>Mettal</hi> that cannot be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited, ſo doth it not <hi>decline,</hi> but <hi>endure</hi> the ſevereſt teſt, and reckons its triumphs by its tryals, which do not conſume, but refine it. <hi>Nature</hi> certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is not grown old to feebleneſs and ſterility; or if it produce now as great ingenuities as it hath formerly, can it poſſibly be, that ſhe will not finde employment for them? otherwiſe a <hi>Traditional</hi> acquieſcence were as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable as all the <hi>Diſquiſitional</hi> recherches after <hi>Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What excellent diſcoveries are there daily found out, even in things wherin our ordinary ſubſiſtence is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, which yet we are not content onely to embrace, but endeavor to
<pb facs="tcp:119773:5"/>
improve and advance? And why may not the ſame thing happen alſo in <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,</hi> which is of that extent, that ſhe is not limited but by the univerſe? It is indeed our weakneſs and our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs together, to attribute to ſome men that <hi>Authority</hi> over our <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> which our Paſſions are not able to recal; nor are we eaſily reduced to hearken to others, who ſhall tell us truer things, though different from what we knew before.</p>
            <p>But how little do we herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how often <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Humanity</hi> may lodge in the ſame Inn; whereas <hi>Infallibility</hi> is a thing, that, in this World, hath not what the Foxes, nor the Fowls of the Air have, neither hole nor neſt. It is a Negative <hi>Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute</hi> of the <hi>Divine Majeſty,</hi> one of the <hi>Regalia</hi> of <hi>Omnipotency,</hi> which it is <hi>Treaſon</hi> in any thing that is <hi>Humane</hi> to aſſume. <hi>Religion</hi> it ſelf, which of all things hath the greateſt participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of, and correſpondence with the <hi>Divine Being,</hi> is hardly allow'd <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:119773:6"/>
when we look on it with relation to the Humane diſpenſation thereof. <hi>Hereſies, Schiſms, Errors,</hi> &amp;c. are not certainly the Motes that render that great <hi>Beauty</hi> the fairer; but the <hi>Black Patches,</hi> the <hi>Imperfections,</hi> and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of our <hi>Humanity,</hi> and the then conſequent preſumption of our <hi>Error.</hi> Now if this happen in that affair, wherein our precious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls are embark'd; what may we expect in things which have onely an alliance and conjunction with our external happineſs?</p>
            <p>But as it happens in <hi>Religion,</hi> that the moſt eminent <hi>Hereticks</hi> have been men of excellent Learning and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments; ſo it muſt be ſuppoſed, that thoſe onely can be <hi>Hereticks</hi> in <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> who are indeed great <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,</hi> and ſuch as imagined in themſelves, that they had ſomething to acquaint the World that ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſh it more then any thing it knew before. But he that undertakes ſuch a thing, ought to conclude with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb facs="tcp:119773:6"/>
that he intends to quarrel with the common opinion, and therefore ought to preſuppoſe whatſoever may make good the ground of the received <hi>Tenets,</hi> which muſt be taken away to facilitate the charge of a new, and, before, unheard of Aſſertion. It is no eaſie matter for one man to foreſee what a many may be able to object; and yet this was the caſe of the great Author of the DISCOURSE <hi>concerning the conduct of our Reaſon,</hi> &amp;c. the truly great DES CAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TES, the prodigy of his Age, and whoſe departure hence ſo ſoon is yet the regret of the <hi>Philoſophical World.</hi> But being withal but a <hi>Man,</hi> it were an injury to the <hi>Divinity</hi> to think him <hi>inerrable;</hi> we may well place him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Heroes,</hi> but not among the <hi>Gods.</hi> Nor ought any man to think it a thing any ways injurious to him, to reflect on what he hath done, ſince it is a thing he is ſo far from declining, that it is his invitation, as who thought that Learning gained no ſmall advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
<pb facs="tcp:119773:7"/>
by communication and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and hath obliged the world with his Labors, with this Caution, that others by their experiments might advance his diſcoveries. Some there have been, who have wreſtled the World out of ſome tenet of <hi>Publick Faith,</hi> who yet in ſome other things, have that weakneſs which is the moſt adequate attribute of mankinde; and that it hath far'd thus with our great Author, may partly appear by theſe REFLECTIONS on his DISCOURSE. I am in ſome doubt, whether he might have ſeen them before he died, much more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the publiſhing of his Diſcourſe, (it being his cuſtom to communicate all things to be ſtrictly examined by his Friends and Correſpondents, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he committed them to the Preſs) for however he might haply think them ſlight, yet certainly we ſhould ſomewhere have met with his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As for the Author of theſe <hi>Reflections,</hi> I cannot do him ſo much
<pb facs="tcp:119773:7"/>
honor as tell the World his name, for I never knew it, having met with them accidentally in a <hi>Manuſcript.</hi> If I have done him right (as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) in the Tranſlation I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd what I undertook. If any man will <hi>reflect</hi> upon theſe <hi>Reflections,</hi> he is at liberty, and will ſhew himſelf a <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> by engaging Ingenuities into thoſe Olympick exerciſes, where the prize is TRUTH.</p>

               </gap>. And ſeeing he proſtitutes them in their nakedneſs, without the leaſt ſhadow of proof, he is unjuſt according to his own rule: For how can he expect I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them as true, when he hath tyed me to this general rule, <hi>viz.</hi> Never <hi>to admit any thing into perſwaſion, but by the ſufficient evidence of Reaſon?</hi> And though he have made a handſom ſuperſtructure of doctrine upon them, (as may, and ought to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged)
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119773:9"/>
yet have they no dependance on thoſe principles, nor is any thing that is ſaid advanc'd out of any deſign to prove them. But I ſhall not at the preſent give you my particular opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, but ſhall content my ſelf to ſend you certain <hi>REFLECTIONS</hi> on the ſame Authors <hi>DISCOURSE</hi> of a <hi>Method,</hi> as he calls it, <hi>for the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiding and conduct of our</hi> Reaſon, <hi>in the diſcovery of truth in the</hi> Sciences. The Piece, reſembling the great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor that brought it forth, muſt be noble and excellent; and if there be any thing deficient, it is the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, in regard he proteſteth that he hath only advanced it as a propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which he expoſes to the battery of other mens judgments. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatever I ſhall ſay of it, ſhall carry that reverence as ſhall witneſs I have done no violence to that deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved reſpect which the world beares him, and ſhall calmly give my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, which is that he himſelf deſires all men ſhould do, who any

in the Sciences hath been mightily advanced; That he hath been ſo liberal as to communicate this <hi>Method</hi> unto us, that we might judg of it.

It hath been ever generally obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that thoſe men who either out of reſtleſneſs of humor, or contempt of what is paſt, have been moſt buſie and agitating in the introduction of any new doctrines or opinions, have ever obſerved this rule, to make their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances very gradual at the firſt, and to temper their propoſitions with ſo much plauſibility, as a doctrine which comes to quarrel with the common Tenent can bear, ſo for a while to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the ſpirits of thoſe they have to deal with. But Monſieur <hi>des Cartes,</hi> to my great aſtoniſhment, begins his <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> with a <hi>Paradox<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> which not only cauſes the Reader to make a halt at the firſt ſtep, but is withall ſo ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly proved, that I wonder it could proceed from one who admits nothing for current but what hath undergone the grand teſt of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and deſies all perſwaſion which is not induc'd by ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragability and demonſtration.</p>
               <p>But that we ſhall here firſt examine, ſhall be theſe two Queſtions, which are
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119773:11"/>
eaſily ſtarted out of the foregoing words.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Whether Reaſon, ſound judgment, or right underſtanding be equally diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether there be not ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in that aſſertion of his; <hi>That there is nothing in Philoſophy which is not doubtful?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since we muſt confeſs that all things that God hath made are good, we cannot without a quarrel with his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence doubt, but that <hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>right underſtanding,</hi> or as the Author cals it elſwhere, <hi>The faculty of right judging and distinguiſhing truth from falſhood,</hi> is excellently well divided and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted among men. This is one reaſon produc'd by the Author for the proof of the firſt queſtion; but how ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we ſhall ſee anon: At preſent it ſhall ſuffice to ſay, that it doth not hence follow, that right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is <hi>equally</hi> diſtributed. The omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence of God may be as much or more acknowledg'd and admired in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119773:12"/>
the great inequality which there is of right underſtanding among men, as if it were equally weigh'd to everyone. And therefore this propoſition lies o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the battery of
<list>
                     <item>1. The common opinion of all men.</item>
                     <item>2. Experience.</item>
                     <item>3. The Author himſelf.</item>
                  </list>
Firſt, That it croſſes the common o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, we need but conſider what we ſay of thoſe men whom we deſire to commend or prefer before others: we ſay they are <hi>rational, knowing, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi> men; or they are ſuch as can <hi>judg</hi> or <hi>distinguiſh</hi> ſo rightly of things, that they will not be eaſily ſurpriſed by miſrepreſentations. Now, if the right underſtanding were equal in all, this manner of ſpeaking were imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and ridiculous, and would ſignifie as much, as if being to commend a <hi>Beauty,</hi> we ſhould ſay that ſhe had two eyes, and that her noſe were in the midſt of her face.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it ſtands not the charge of Experience, we are only to look on our
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119773:12"/>
ſelves as men. Some have ſuch and ſuch endowments and excellencies, others have others: Some are of a quick and nimble ratiocination; others are ſo dull and flegmatick, that they ſeem not to reaſon at all; and theſe are they which <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his Politicks calls <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as if nature for want of ratiocination had deſigned them for ſlaves and ſubjects to others. There are others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that are more <hi>diſcourſive</hi> and <hi>understanding</hi> by the ſimple libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of <hi>Nature,</hi> then ſome others, who with all the aſſiſtance and advantages of <hi>Books, Study, Precepts,</hi> &amp;c. can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arrive to mediocrity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Author in this very point is as unfortunate as other men that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Paradoxes; that is, when they have rack'd their wits and inventions to make good a Paradox, they in treating of ſome other queſtion inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly contradict their former Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis. For in another place of this diſcourſe he ſayes, <note n="*" place="bottom">Pag. 9. according to the Engliſh Tranſlation, printed 1649.</note>That <hi>Philoſophy</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:119773:13"/>
                  <hi>us the means to ſpeak of all things with probability, and makes herſelf to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired by the least knowing men.</hi> Here while he is wrapt into the exaltations of thoſe reaſonings which <hi>a man of right understanding</hi> may naturally ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to, he preſuppoſes that all have not that right underſtanding. Beſides he alſo allowes that mens knowledge or right underſtanding may admit of <hi>compariſon</hi> (which utterly deſtroyes <hi>equality)</hi> and according as it is <hi>more</hi> or <hi>leſs</hi> in men, accordingly do they more or leſs admire Philoſophy. In another <hi>(pag.</hi> 11.) he ſays, <hi>That thoſe who have the ſtrongest reaſoning fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and who beſtdigeſt their thoughts to render them more cleer &amp; intelligible, are more fit to perſwade then great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Rhetorick.</hi> Here he admits &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauds the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of reaſoning fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, which he certainly would not, did he not ſuppoſe there were ſome <hi>weaker</hi> reaſoning faculties; and this I think makes againſt the equality of Right underſtanding. Nor doth he
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119773:13"/>
only commend the ſubtle ratiocinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which a man of right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or a right judging man may have, but elſwhere, viz. <hi>pag.</hi> 25. he confeſſes that <hi>ſome have reaſon and modeſty e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to judge that they are leſs able to diſtinguiſh truth from falſhood then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and that they ought much rather to follow others mens opinions then ſeek after better themſelves.</hi> In another place he ſays, <hi>Some men are ſtupid, dull and inſenſible.</hi> If this does not evince a graduality of underſtanding in men, I know not what does; or elſe we muſt ſay that ſtupid and dull men are very good underſtanding, and very right judging men.</p>
               <p>Now to prove this equal diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of right underſtanding, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> beſides what is above alleadged, inſiſts on two other reaſons. The firſt immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows his propoſition in theſe words: <hi>For that every one believes himſelf ſo well ſtored with it, that even thoſe who in all other things ſeem the hardeſt to</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:119773:14"/>
                  <hi>be pleas'd, ſeldom deſire more of it then they have.</hi> This reaſon to me ſeems to want many grains to make it weight; for a diſtribution may be very good and well done, though all are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with their ſhares. But that which he ſubjoins, I much more wonder at, where he ſays, that <hi>'tis not likely all men ſhould be deceiv'd in this;</hi> but that this is the very thing <hi>that witneſſes that the faculty of right judging and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truth from falſhood (which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called reaſon or underſtanding) is naturally equal in all men.</hi> But to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this, I deny that all men are ſo well contented with their portions of right underſtanding; nay it may be affirm'd that they would willingly have more if they could; nor want there thoſe, were the diviſion to be made again, who would be glad of more then they have, though they do not openly complain of their defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie at the preſent. Beſides, there are many that will not complain, only to avoid the contempt which may be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:119773:14"/>
conſequential to the want of right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: As we ſee divers who are very ſenſible of their poverty and exigencies, and privately bewail their wants, who yet ſet the beſt face on it to the world, becauſe they will not be ſlighted and treated below themſelves. 'Tis upon this account, that it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to women to wear black patches, and to hide their other deformities by all the artifice humane invention can furniſh them with.</p>
               <p>The other reaſon which the Author makes uſe of, ſeems at firſt ſight to be more forcible to his purpoſe. For, <hi>pag.</hi> 4. he ſays, That <hi>Reaſon or right underſtanding is the only thing which makes us men, and diſtinguiſheth us from Beaſts;</hi> and this he believes <hi>to be entire in every man.</hi> To which my anſwer peremptorily is this, That <hi>right underſtanding</hi> is not that which makes us men, as he affirms; for we may be men without it; and I believe no man will deny but that the ſtupid, the dull, nay the diſtracted are equally men with others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:119773:15"/>
But to diſperſe thoſe clouds of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations which may darken this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, we are to diſtinguiſh the cauſe and principle of this Rationation from the ſtate or condition wherein a man ought to be when he is to execute his functions. He that hath his eys bound about with a cloth, can make no uſe of them till the cloth be taken away: In like manner he that hath good legs is not in a condition to walk if he be fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, unleſs you take away the fetters. The principle then of this ratiocinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the Philoſophers call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is that which diſtinctively makes us men, and in that I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that all men are equal; but <hi>right underſtanding</hi> is not abſolutely that principle, but is the ſtate or condition wherein our underſtanding ought to be for to exerciſe its functions. Now for an interemptory concluſion to this point, I need ſay but this, That the ſtate or condition before mentioned, which is the conſtitutive and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive difference between man and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:119773:15"/>
beaſt, hath no dependance on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but on the diſpoſition and temperament of the Body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there being a great diverſity, it will follow, that the Author, to prove an equal diviſion of right underſtanding among men, ſhould have built it upon this Paradox, That the diſpoſition and temperament of all mens bodies is one and the ſame.</p>
               <p>Before I break open the other que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, I ſhall beg the Authors favor to tell him, that though he had made it his deſign to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bring Philoſophy into diſrepute as much as lay in his power, yet cannot he do it without commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and that more then he intended. For firſt of all, he confeſſes that by the aſſiſtance of it <hi>He hath diſcovered his own ignorance,</hi> that is to ſay, it hath been his <hi>Collyrium</hi> whereby he hath ſeen the difficulty which is in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of the knowledge of things. But there are many degrees of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. For the preſent it ſhall ſuffice us to obſerve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there is a kind of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:119773:16"/>
groſs beaſtly ignorance, which Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy abhors; and another kind which in reſpect of this may be ſaid to be knowing, and ſuch as wherein Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy many times leaves us. The firſt is in thoſe who are utterly ignorant of the ſtate of a Queſtion; the ſecond is in thoſe that know it well enough, but finding that many things may be brought both for, and againſt it, they are not convinc'd whether opinion to cleave to. As for example, to make a ſquare to a circle, would be thought by thoſe that are not acquainted with the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> a very eaſie thing to do, and that a Carpenter or a Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layer would not ſtick at it; but a good Mathematician will tell you he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe it, nay haply will queſtion whether it can be done at all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Author confeſſes that <hi>Philoſophy affords us the means to ſpeak of all things with probability.</hi> If it do ſo, then certainly it hinders us from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing propoſitions that are ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous or impertinent. To which I may
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:119773:16"/>
adde this, that as in conſultation or deliberation, though we cannot be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of the ſucceſs of what we deſign, we ought not to hold our arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs, but put that in execution which ſeems moſt conformable to reaſon; ſo in the ſpeculative Sciences we muſt not always ſuffer our minds to be gravel'd in an indifferencie or <hi>aequilibrium</hi> as to all opinions like Scepticks, but em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace that which carries with it moſt probability.</p>
               <p>But what ſhall we ſay of the proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure of the Author in this caſe? As ſoon as he had gone through the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courſe of Philoſophy in the Schools, becauſe he found not the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction he expected, he perſwades himſelf, that there is nothing in all <hi>Philoſophy</hi> which is not <hi>diſputable,</hi> and by conſequence not <hi>doubtful;</hi> and thereupon quits the reading of all books of Philoſophy, <hi>reſolving to ſeek no other knowledge but what he could find in himſelf and the great vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of the world.</hi> But is not this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:119773:17"/>
a little too precipitate? I would gladly ask him, whether when he had finiſhed his courſe of Philoſophy, he had read all <hi>Aristotles</hi> works leiſurely, and with that attention of mind which were requiſite, and with the neceſſary helps for the underſtanding of them? When he had done this, whether he had conſulted <hi>Alexander, Themiſtius, Simplicius, Philoponus,</hi> and other <hi>Greek</hi> Philoſophers, for their opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning what he thought of moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, to ſee whether they agreed among themſelves, and with their great Maſter? I am confident he will not affirm that he had done all this at that time. Beſides that, I know theſe books are not ſo common among young Students, nay many times their Tutors and Profeſſors read them not but upon the reputation of others.</p>
               <p>But let us put the caſe, that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> and his diſciples ſhould never have done any thing but gull'd us, I doe not perceive how a man could thence infer that there is nothing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:119773:17"/>
in all Philoſophy, before he had read <hi>Plato's</hi> works, were it only to ſee whether the Antiens had with juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon entitled him <hi>divine:</hi> but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally before he had decipher'd his <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeus,</hi> to ſee if there were any thing more ſolid in that then in the works of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> And when both <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> ſhould have been deceived, had it been amiſs, or was it not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to have ſifted the Philoſophy of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> as alſo that of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> before the pronouncing of this ſevere ſentence againſt all Philoſophy? Not to mention, that it had not been any crime to have turn'd over the writings of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> to ſee on what princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> he had built his <hi>Phyſicks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to rip up the bottom of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: If the Author had contented himſelf to ſay that there were but few things in Philoſophy that were certain and indiſputable, he would have had that advantage of ground of me, that I durſt not have ſet upon him; but ſince
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:119773:18"/>
he flies ſo high as to declare abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and without any exception, that there is not any thing in all Philoſophy which is not doubtful, I think there needs no great forces to encounter with him.</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſay nothing of the certainty and clearneſs of the Demonſtrations of <hi>Geometry,</hi> becauſe he ſeems not to reckon it as any part of Philoſophy; but as for <hi>Logick,</hi> he doth her the honor to make her one of the children, or at leaſt the handmaid of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy. When I ſeriouſly conſider it, I cannot but wonder how he ſhould, without any exception, ſay that there were nothing certain in Philoſophy. For not to ſpeak of the other parts of <hi>Logick,</hi> thoſe very precepts which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> gives us of <hi>Oppoſition, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,</hi> and the <hi>Tranſpoſition</hi> of the three Figures of <hi>Syllogiſms,</hi> and the manner how to reaſon in any of them, and of the <hi>Reduction</hi> of the Syllogiſms of the ſecond and third figures to the firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all which are as firm and <hi>indiſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:119773:18"/>
as any <hi>Demonſtrations</hi> of <hi>Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> and ſo generally received, that no man hath hitherto call'd them into the leaſt queſtion: And to produce one concluſive proof hereof, let us ſee what the Author himſelf confeſſes <hi>pag.</hi> 28. of his Diſcourſe, where he ſays, <hi>That Logick contains divers moſt true and good Precepts, aud teaches us to ſpeak with judgment of the things we are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To paſs from <hi>Logick</hi> to <hi>Moral</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, which foraſmuch as it may be treated of two manner of ways, the one <hi>Parainetick,</hi> the other <hi>Dogmatick,</hi> the former he honours with thoſe elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies and commendations it deſerves; but for the latter, he taxes it with a deficiencie as to the teaching of the vertues, and lays it to his charge, that many times it beſtows that fair name on what might more properly be term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Inſenſibility, Pride, Deſpair, or a Parricide. Wherein I confeſs I have no great quarrel with him, if we ſpeak of the moral Philoſophy of the <hi>Stoicks</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:119773:19"/>
which indeed ſometimes would make us too inſenſible, ſometimes equals us to God, nay in a manner prefers us before him. But as for <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in the writings he hath left us of this part of Philoſophy, he hath ſo excellently well deſcrib'd the Vertues and Vices, and hath been ſo fortunate in it, that there are very few things to be carp'd at in him, unleſs it be this one grand omiſſion, Not to have left any one word of mans duty towards God. As for his <hi>Politicks,</hi> it cannot be denied, but that the rules and maxims he gives are fallible, the nature of the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch as will not admit infallibility: yet ſhall I not ſtick to ſay, that he that ſhall find nothing in them that ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies him, is a man of a very odd ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</p>
               <p>But it may be it is his <hi>Phyſicks</hi> that the <hi>Author</hi> particularly quarrels at. I muſt indeed confeſs that it is like a great Forreſt, where there are ſo many croſs paths, that it is no hard thing for a man to loſe his way in them.

It is the pleaſure of God to keep Nature under a cloud undiſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the more to oblige us to humility by a ſenſe and an acknowledgment of our ignorance. Yet all this ſuppos'd and granted, it is not to be thought that ſo many great and eminent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages, who made it their only buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their ſeveral ages to ſtudy and find out Nature, ſhould have taken all that pains to no purpoſe, and after all their purſuit to have diſcovered no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119773:20"/>
at all. And it is on the other ſide an injurious and diſhonorable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteem of reverend Antiquity, and an overweening opinion of our ſelves, to imagine that one of us now living, contracting all ſtudy into himſelf, and thence directing it to the great vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of the world, (which yet muſt be acknowledg'd to have been equally open at all times and in all ages) can without the leaſt external aſſiſtance or advantage doe more then all others, though furthered and advanced by mutual helps and endeavours. Nor ſhall I ſtick to ſay, that the faireſt ſtones of this our Authors new build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will be found to be ſuch as he ſhall have reſerved out of the rubbidge and ruines of <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Phyſicks.</p>
               <p>Nor is it hard to make this appear, if by a pattern we may judge of the whole peece. For let a man but read his explication of the Motion of the Heart, which we have in the fift Part of this Diſcourſe; There he would maintain the moving of the Heart to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:119773:20"/>
proceed from the heat which is within it. Now this great point, which he conceives to be grounded upon the evidence of Reaſon, is borrowed from <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> But that we may exempt ſo great and eminent a perſon from the indiſcretion of holding any thing which is inconvenient or incoherent, I am perſwaded that, however he may ſpeak of the Philoſophy taught in the <hi>Schools,</hi> as ſlightingly and diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſly as may be, he intended to aſſume no more then I am willing to grant him.</p>
               <p>But to come yet a little nearer, let it be granted that there is nothing but what is doubtful in Philoſophy, yet the Author proves this aſſertion but very weakly. <hi>There is nothing,</hi> ſays he, <hi>in Philoſophy which is not diſputable,</hi> therefore <hi>nothing which is not doubtful.</hi> Do we not know that there are many who endeavour to perſwade others to what they themſelves believe not? And there want not thoſe who will <hi>diſpute</hi> about what they nothing at all

To which I ſhall add thus much to make it overweight; That to ſay that <hi>any thing is doubtful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome men doubt of it,</hi> argues a not full underſtanding of the definition of <hi>doubtful.</hi> For as all that's admitted into the creed and approbation of ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain men, is not for that reaſon eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed probable, but only that which hath paſs'd the approbation and allowance of the moſt learned, or greateſt part of the wiſeſt and moſt knowing men, or at leaſt the moſt eminent among them.</p>

               </p>
               <p>It muſt indeed be acknowledged, that this deſign is high and noble; and it is extremely to be wiſhed, that one particular man had at firſt laid the foundations of Philoſophy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently built it up to its perfection. Nor can I but with the Author hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſh, that ſome one man would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the <hi>reformation</hi> of Philoſophy, whereof he having conceiv'd ſo noble and heroick a deſign, I wiſh him ſo much life, and that vigor of body and mind, as that he may ſee it accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. But in caſe he leave his work imperfect, can he expect any better handling from thoſe that ſhall come after him, then he hath afforded thoſe that have gone before him? Is it not probable that ſom eminent wit, like his own, may even in his edifice find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what which his underſtanding ſhould not admit for good contrivance, and conſequently would not oblige him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:119773:23"/>
to his deſignations, but after his example would build upon new foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.</p>
               <p>But whereas he ſays, that being a <hi>private perſon,</hi> he doth not undertake the reformation of the Sciences, nor intends to invert the eſtabliſhed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of the Schools for the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them; he ſhould have remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that not only thoſe who actually embroil a State into ſeditions and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders are guilty of treaſon, but alſo thoſe who by libellous writings ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate the preſent government there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. If therfore there be reaſon to blame any particular man that ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take raſhly to reform the Schools, he ſurely cannot be altogether exempt from cenſure, who ſhall, <hi>Medea</hi>-like, cut in peeces the Philoſophy common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and univerſally received in the Schools, and not propoſe any means to recompoſe it.</p>
               <p>But to come to an examination of the particular charge he hath againſt <hi>Logick,</hi> we muſt in every Art or Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119773:23"/>
diſtinguiſh the truth and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of its precepts from the uſe of them. He doth not condemn any of its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of falſhood, nor indeed could have done with reaſon, but he cenſures the moſt part as ſuperfluous and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. If he had contented himſelf to have ſaid that there were many ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, I ſhould not have had much to ſay to the contrary; for I acknowledg that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had ſometimes reaſon to compare <hi>Logick</hi> to a feaſt of Crabs, where there is much ſhell, and little meat, but that little is both delicate and wholſom. But if this be admitted of <hi>Logick,</hi> all other Arts and Sciences will fall under the ſame laſh. Thoſe hardy daſhes and circumvolutions, and the cadences of the Pen, wherewith Writing-maſters do incircle the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies they give to their Scholars, are of little or no uſe at all; and I have heard ſay, that thoſe who learn Academical Horſmanſhip are taught many tricks, which haply they will never have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to make uſe of in a battel; yet
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:119773:24"/>
both theſe have their ſeveral, though it may be inſenſible helps and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages. By the ſame reaſon may Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſelf be taxed with ſuperfluity, becauſe men muſt ſow, thraſh, win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now and grind the grain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before it can be made into bread for their nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And after all this, neither the bread nor any thing elſe we eat is ſo clearly converted into nouriſhment, but that there muſt be ſome excrement<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> This doctrine ſhould alſo reduce the houſes of great men to a wonderful ſimplicity, if they ſhould be indulged nothing which were ſuperfluous, and were not of preſent uſe, nor ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of more diſhes of meat on their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles then were neceſſary for the pure ſatisfaction of thoſe they have to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain.</p>
               <p>But above all, I am ſomewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed that the Author ſhould ſay, that the <hi>Syllogiſms</hi> and other inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Logick</hi> ſhould ſerve us to no other purpoſe then to diſcourſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out judgment of thoſe things whereof
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:119773:24"/>
we are ignorant. Certainly he cannot forget that Logick gives us this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, <hi>That we ſhould not admit as prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of a ratiocination, any Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which were not true, or at leaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.</hi> Now I cannot believe, that to diſcourſe probably of a thing, is the ſame thing as to ſpeak of it without judgment. If therefore one that hath read Logick, diſcourſe without judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a thing whereof he is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, the fault is not to be imputed to Logick, but to the Logician; and 'tis the ſame caſe as when a muſty cask ſpoils good wine.</p>
               <p>Moreover, how can he deny but that the <hi>Syllogiſms</hi> aſſiſt us in what we are to learn, and not only enable us to teach others what we already know? Can we attain the Sciences without Reaſoning, or can we reaſon without Syllogiſms? Thoſe demonſtrations of <hi>Geometry,</hi> by the means and aid whereof he hath learn'd ſo much, are they not Syllogiſms? But he will ſay, Nature hath taught ns to reaſon:
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:119773:25"/>
But it doth not thence follow, that the Precepts which Nature hath furniſhed us with for the direction and conduct of our reaſoning, are ſuperfluous and unprofitable. By this kind of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he ſhews us by his own example that we do not reaſon well. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are we ſo much the more obliged to thoſe wiſe men and Philoſophers, who reflecting both on their own and other mens reaſonings, have obſerved the faults which might happen in them, and have left us inſtructions to ſhun them.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place, it ſeems to me very ſtrange, that he ſhould ſay that Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſms ſhould aſſiſt us rather in expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating to another what one knows, then to learn what one knows not; for to explicate to another what one knows, is nothing elſe but to ſuppoſe it to another in ſuch a manner as that he may learn it. But it being granted, that Syllogiſms ſtand us in no ſtead but to explicate that to another which we know, it follows they are
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:119773:25"/>
helpful to him that doth learn of us: But it may be rahter ſaid, that as the ſame light ſerves me to ſhew ſomething to another which I ſee my ſelf, and ſerves him to perceive that which I ſhew him, ſo may it be ſaid of Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſms.</p>
               <p>But can we believe he is ſerious with us, when he would only oblige us to four Precepts of <hi>Logick,</hi> ſeeming to eſteem the reſt as worth nothing; ſince it will appear that theſe four precepts cannot be put in practice, but only by ſuch as have learned for the moſt part all the other which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and his Interpreters have delivered? I may with as much reaſon ſay, that for a man to approve himſelf to be a good and able <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> he ſhall need ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve but theſe three precepts; To expel diſeaſes, abate the violence of their ſymptoms, and never undertake the cure of any incurable diſeaſe. But now to put theſe precepts in practice, it muſt firſt be enquired what are the cauſes of every diſeaſe whereto man is
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:119773:26"/>
ſubject, as alſo what their ſymptoms are, by what remedies they are to be overcome, and by what means it may be known whether the Patient be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate or no, which I take it is a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of longer breath. It is certain there is nothing ſo unworthy a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, as to be too credulous; and therefore <hi>Epicharmus,</hi> with much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſaid, <hi>Nervos atque arcus ſapientia eſſe, nihil temerè credere.</hi> Now there are two ſorts of Propoſitions, whereof a man may arrive to a clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct knowledge. Some are clear and evident in themſelves, as being the firſt; others have need of proof: As it is in bodies, ſome are perceiv'd by that light which they have in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as the Sun and the Fire; others, that they may be ſeen, have need of ſome exterior light, and ſuch are all colour'd and illuminous bodies. The firſt Propoſitions, as they are but few in number in every Science, ſo they cauſe us no great trouble, but are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all thoſe that are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:119773:26"/>
at diſcretion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in which ſtate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing propoſed to us by our maſters, and we underſtanding only the ſenſe of them, and conſidering it attentively, they force us to acknowledg them for true. The number of the Propoſitions of the other kind is infinite; and though they depend of the firſt by certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catenations which are moſt ſtrong, nay, ſuch as are impoſſible to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, yet the links of that chain where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are ty'd together, are in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner imperceptible, unleſs it be to thoſe who are very clear-ſighted; and the reaſonings whereby we diſcover them are called <hi>Demonſtrations.</hi> Whence it may be inferred, that that which makes the greateſt difficulty in the Sciences, is to find out the demonſtrations of this ſort of Propoſitions, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed methodically in the ſearch of them: Whence it is to be inferr'd, that it muſt be known what Demonſtration is, and how many ſorts there are of it, and what are the qualities and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their Principles. And this is
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:119773:27"/>
it that <hi>Aristotle</hi> teaches us in his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalyt. posterior.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For what concerns the <hi>Diviſion</hi> he ſpeaks of; it is certainly a thing very neceſſary, to divide the matters which we would treat of into many words, that ſo we the more eaſily come to a clear underſtanding of what we are to enquire into. As we find there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of cutting our meat before we put it into our mouths, and beſides of chewing it with our teeth, ſo to eaſe our ſtomachs, which otherwiſe would have the harder task to digeſt it. But it is a hard matter to divide well; and for that reaſon <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Phaedr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> ſaid, that if he met with one that could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide well, he would follow his ſteps as thoſe of ſome God; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The ſearch of truth would therefore be ſo much the harder to one that hath not learn'd the art to divide; for a thing muſt be divided into as many words as it may poſſibly, and the denumeration of the parts muſt be perfect. Otherwiſe it will be
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:119773:27"/>
all one, as if at a table where there were much Fowl, they ſhould intreat one to carve, who ſhould underſtand ſo little in carving, as that by reaſon of his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the joynts, he ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to cut athwart the bones.</p>

will content our ſelves with what the force of truth hath wreſted from the Author himſelf; who having forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en his Hypotheſis of the uncertainty of the judgment of the Senſes, is ſtrangely ſurpris'd: For in the laſt part of this Diſcourſe he ſpeaks of nothing ſo much as of thoſe <hi>experiences</hi> which are neceſſary for the perfection of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, and profeſſes <hi>that he hath need of an infinite number more then he hath, which he could not compaſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aſsiſtance of ſome other.</hi> And elſwhere, he invites all thoſe who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs any tenderneſs or affection to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, <hi>to communicate unto him thoſe which they have made.</hi> Now I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe <hi>experiences</hi> are not reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but ſenſitive obſervations. How came he to know that the heart hath motion within it ſelf, if not by the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? And to what purpoſe doth he take ſo much pains to teach us to make ſpectacles for to aſſiſt us in the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the ſtars, if after all our ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazing we may not give any credit to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:119773:30"/>
our ſenſes? To what hath been ſaid, I dare preſume to add thus much; That to reject altogether the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Senſes, is to be ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and injurious to God and nature who have beſtowed them on us, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly out of a deſign and knowledge that they were neceſſary, and that we ſhould find employment for them. For every ſenſe hath its proper and peculiar object, whereof it is the ſole and abſolute Iudge without appeal. As for inſtance, it is only the Sight that can judge of colours, and reaſon in that judgment concurs not nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes any thing at all. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Hearing only diſtinguiſhes the divers tones and accents of the voice, and the greateſt wit in the world could never doe it by ever ſo many reaſonings.</p>
               <p>But, ſayes he, <hi>the Senſes deceive us ſometimes;</hi> and to ſtrengthen his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument I will adde, That whoſoever is once convinc'd of having borne falſe witneſs, may never again be
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:119773:30"/>
admitted to bear any. To which it is eaſie to anſwer. For if they deceive us ſometimes, they afterwards un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive us again, and ſuffer us not to continue long in our error. They are not like the falſe witneſſes who wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly and willingly ſpeak againſt their conſciences, but would always ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a true teſtimony if they could, and they always can do it, when the queſtion is of their proper objects; for all that wherein one of our ſenſes is deceived, is not its particular ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>For there are ſome objects which are common to divers ſenſes, as Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, Figure, Motion and Reſt, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Multitude, Continuity or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuity. There are moreover ſome things which conſidered in themſelves cannot move the Senſes, which yet are ſenſible, by how much as they have a relation to thoſe things, which of themſelves and according to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per nature operate on the Senſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:119773:31"/>
I ſay therefore, that thoſe things which operate not by election, but by that invincible inclination which they receive from Nature, and as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it in the Schools, <hi>ex neceſsitate naturae,</hi> do always operate as ſtrongly as they can, and they are by Natnre provided of thoſe forces which ſhall be ſufficient to make them attain the end whereto they aſpire in operating. But it is moſt evident that our Senſes do not operate by election or choice, but by that invincible inclination which Nature hath beſtowed on them; and conſequently Nature having aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to each of them its proper and peculiar object, whereof it ſhould be alone able to diſcern, it is impoſſible but that they ſhould judge thereof, if there happen not ſome hinderance or impediment in their operations.</p>
               <p>Theſe hindrances are either internal or external: Inrernal I call the defaults and indiſpoſitions of the Organs; the external can conſiſt but in two things; the one, when the object is at too great
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:119773:31"/>
a diſtance, and that the organ which it ſhould ſmite is out of its juſt reach, and that the object is not repreſented but as it were ttanſiently, ſo that the ſenſe hath not the leiſure to diſcern it. The other is, when the ſpace between the ſenſe and the object is not well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed; as when we look through a coloured glaſs, or when the air is not clear enough. Whence it may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd, that it is impoſsible that our ſenſes ſhould deceive us in the diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their proper and particular objects, if their organs are well diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and that the objects are well and duly repreſented unto them, and laſtly when the ſpace is in the requiſite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. If therefore the eye when it is hurt doth not perfectly diſcern the colours, we muſt expect the judgment it ſhall make of them when it is well. If it cannot diſtinctly diſcern them by the light of a candle, or in the twilight, we muſt ſuſpend our cenſure till we ſee how it will judge of them when it hath full day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>light. And if it be not able to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:119773:32"/>
diſcern the objects when they are at too far a diſtance, we muſt endeavour to bring them nearer to it. When therefore the ſenſe is to judge of its proper object, it is the charge of the intellectual faculty to judge whether there want not any of the requiſite conditions; and if any of them be awanting, it ought to ſuſpend its ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction until there be a concurrence of them altogether. The underſtanding therefore never pretends to any juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over the ſenſes, unleſs it be that it enjoins them to repeat their judgments about their proper objects, which hinders not at all but that they are always the ſoveraign Iudges there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: As when the King enjoins the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament to take a review of any buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which before had paſt their votes, he doth not by that action take away from it the quality of a ſoveraign Court.</p>
               <p>Whereas he ſays, that becauſe thoſe things which we imagine being aſleep are falſe, we can have no aſſurance but
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:119773:32"/>
that thoſe thoughts which we have when we are awake are alſo to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected as equally falſe, we ſhall exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it more fully anon.</p>
               <p>For the preſent we ſhall take into conſideration, how the chief corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of this Philoſophy is laid. He ſays, that he hath at laſt obſerved this truth, <hi>I think,</hi> therefore <hi>I am,</hi> to be ſo firm, that it only deſerved to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd for the firſt principle of his Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy. However I take no great pleaſure to pnnctiliate and criticize a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout words, yet I cannot but take notice by the way, that it is not hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly nor properly ſpoken to call this either a <hi>verity</hi> or <hi>principle.</hi> For there are certain truths which he himſelf for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally diſtinguiſhes, making uſe of ſome for the demonſtration of others. Therefore to ſpeak properly, this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, <hi>I think,</hi> is a principle, and <hi>I am,</hi> is a propoſition: <hi>I think,</hi> is the firſt principle; and <hi>I am,</hi> is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion which he thence infers. Yet can I not be aſſured that this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:119773:33"/>
                  <hi>I think,</hi> may be made a firſt principle, according to the Author's own doctrine, ſeeing all the force of the conſequence depends on another principle mentioned afterward, that is to ſay, on this univerſal propoſition, That for <hi>to think, there is a neceſsity to be.</hi> Methinks an excellent Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſitian, ſuch as is the Author, ſhould not have put it down nakedly for a firſt principle, for the truth of it doth not proceed from its own nature, or from the ſpecifical difference of <hi>think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> but generally every action what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever preſuppoſes the exiſtence of the Agent. He ſhould therefore, in my judgment, have gone a little higher to the mother-truth (as I may ſo call it) and ſay, that <hi>to act, there is a neceſsity to be.</hi> Juſt as when we would clear the pretenſion of any mans ſucceſſion, we aſcend upwards, and examine whence he derives his right. Moreover the Reader may take notice, that in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the propoſition, <hi>I think,</hi> for a firſt principle, he unawares founds
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:119773:33"/>
his Philoſophy upon the teſtimony of the Senſes. For notwithſtanding that to judge of the truth or falſhood of a Propoſition, it is neceſſary to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand well the terms whereof it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, yet I would withall gladly ask him what he means when he ſayes, <hi>I think;</hi> and I am confident that he will not deny, but that the firſt knowledge which he hath had of the difference between <hi>me</hi> and <hi>thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> hath proceeded from the <hi>Senſe.</hi> Laſtly, this way of reaſoning, <hi>I think,</hi> therefore <hi>I am,</hi> cannot any way be acknowledg'd for a Demonſtration; becauſe this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, <hi>I think,</hi> is not more clear and evident, then the concluſion which he draws from it; for as my <hi>exiſtence</hi> hath preceded my <hi>thinking,</hi> ſo the aſſurance which I have of my <hi>exiſtence</hi> is upon the credit and teſtimony of my <hi>Senſes,</hi> and that without any aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of my Reaſon, and before I had made any reflection at all on my thoughts. But the Author being in this manner aſſured of his exiſtence,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:119773:34"/>
he undertakes to ſhew wherein the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and eſſence of man conſiſts. <hi>Seeing</hi> ſays he, <hi>I can fain that I had no body at all, and that there were no world, and that there were no place wherein I was; yet I cannot imagine I ſhould be able</hi> to think, <hi>unleſs</hi> I were. And thence he would infer, that <hi>his thinking was the only means wherehy he was aſſured of his being;</hi> and from thence, ſays he, <hi>I learned that MY SELF,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>my Soul, whereby I am what I am, was a ſubſtance whoſe eſſence conſiſts only in</hi> thinking, <hi>and which, as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its being, doth not depeud of any thing that is material.</hi> Nay, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances yet farther, where he affirms that <hi>the Soul is more eaſily known then the Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this ratiocination methinks there are many things lie very open to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Firſt he ſeems to <hi>Platoniſe,</hi> and to make the ſoul of a man to be the man, without alledging any thing for the proof thereof. If that be granted, we cannot call a man a rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:119773:34"/>
ſince the ſoul cannot be call'd a creature. By the ſame reaſon we may not ſay that a man is mortal, ſeeing the ſoul is immortal. But though ſometimes the ſoul of a man be called the man, yet is it not properly ſpoken, but Synechdochically, which is a manner of ſpeaking whereby we give the name of the whole to ſome part, eſpecially to the more principal part. And it is in this ſenſe that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the 10 book of his Ethicks ſays, that the underſtanding of a man, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is principally the man: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſayes he, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And if the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture in one place ſayes, <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in paradice,</hi> it ſayes in another, that <hi>God formed man of the dust of the earth,</hi> and that he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into the earth. For if in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of theſe paſſages the denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of man be given to the ſoul, as the more noble part, in the latter the name of man is attributed to the body, though it be the more ignoble part: And it is in this ſenſe that we ſay that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:119773:35"/>
ſuch a one is interr'd, meaning that his body is ſo. But this error were in ſome ſort tolerable in ſome other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who ſhould not make ſo ſevere a profeſſion, not to acknowledge any thing upon the account of any mans authority, how great ſoever he may be, as the Author pretends to doe, though <hi>Plato</hi> had obtained that eſteem and opinion of infallibility amongſt the Ancients, that <hi>Cicero</hi> bluſh'd not to ſay, <hi>That he ſhould not be aſham'd to erre with Plato.</hi> But this aſſertion methinks is more ſtrange, That the whole nature or eſſence of the <hi>Soul</hi> conſiſts in <hi>thinking.</hi> If the eſſence of the Soul conſiſted altogether in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it hath thence forward neither exiſtence nor eſſence. Moreover, if thinking, which is the action of the ſoul, be not a thing different from its eſſence, the ſoul muſt be thought to have attained the higheſt degree of ſimplicity, which appertains not but to the higheſt intelligence, and by conſequence we may ſay that <hi>Anima eſt actus purus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:119773:35"/>
But granting that it were true that the whole eſſence of the ſoul conſiſted only in <hi>thinking,</hi> yet we may ſay that the proof which the Author brings for it is weak and inſufficient; for from this principle, That thinking is the only thing which aſſures us of the eſſence of the ſoul, it does not follow that the whole eſſence of the ſoul is nothing elſe but thinking, unleſs it muſt be alſo granted that I cannot aſſure my ſelf of the exiſtence of any thing but by that thing wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts its eſſence; which is a propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo remote from reaſon, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Author will not preſume to maintain it. Moreover he lays down for a Principle a Propoſition which I cannot by any means grant him, which is, that <hi>thinking</hi> is the only means whereby I can aſſure my ſelf of the <hi>exiſtence</hi> of my ſoul. I would gladly know of him whether theſe reaſonings, <hi>I rejoice, I love, I hate, I fear,</hi> therefore <hi>I am,</hi> be not as firm and immoveable as that of his, <hi>I think,</hi> therefore <hi>I am?</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:119773:36"/>
For when <hi>I rejoice,</hi> or when <hi>I love,</hi> I am aſſur'd that <hi>I think:</hi> And theſe propoſitions, for to <hi>rejoice</hi> I muſt needs <hi>be,</hi> and to <hi>love</hi> I muſt needs <hi>be,</hi> are as certain as this, <hi>To think</hi> I muſt needs <hi>be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond part of his doctrine of the eſſence of the ſoul, to wit, that <hi>it depends not on the body, nor on any other material thing,</hi> is true; but the reaſon whereby he pretends to prove it, is not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory. For from that ſuppoſition, that I can imagine that my ſoul is not clothed with any body, there doth not follow any other thing, but that it depends not of the body by any eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential and abſolutely neceſſary depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. For there is another kind of dependance between natural things, which yet God by his omnipotence may diſſolve; ſuch is the dependance of my life on the air which I breathe, on the earth which bears me up, as alſo of the other elements which concur to my compoſition. Now that which hath puzzled the Philoſophers in this
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:119773:36"/>
buſineſs, hath not been to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſoul of a man depends in ſuch a manner on the body, that it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether impoſſible that it can ſubſiſt without it; but to prove by demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration clearly and evidently, that it can naturally ſubſiſt, and that in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it doth ſubſiſt after its ſeparation from the body. And here it was that the Author ſhould have ſhewn whether he knew any thing more then others who have entangled themſelves in that queſtion. Nay further, when I ſhould have granted him that the <hi>eſſence</hi> of the ſoul were nothing but <hi>to think,</hi> the controverſie were not thereby decided, becauſe our thoughts ordinarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the body; in as much as we cannot think on any thing, if the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, which is faſten'd to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan of the Body, do not repreſent to the underſtanding the image of ſome material thing, as we ſhall prove anon.</p>
               <p>The laſt part of his diſcourſe of the eſſence of the ſoul hath this aſſertion;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:119773:37"/>
That <hi>the ſoul is more eaſily known and diſcovered then the body:</hi> A Paradox which he offers not to prove by any reaſon at all. If all what is above ſpoken were granted him, yet could he not from thence draw this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but the contrary rather, that is, that men have but a very confuſed knowledge of their bodies, even before they have once conſidered whether they have any ſouls or no. And as to the diſtinct and perfect knowledge of the ſoul, I do not think the Author will preſume to boaſt he hath attain'd it.</p>
               <p>In the next place he makes it his task to find out and determine that which is requiſite in a Propoſition to make it true and infallible, and gives us this rule, <hi>That thoſe things which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the moſt clearly and moſt diſtinctly are all of them true.</hi> The clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct knowledge which we can have of a Propoſition, conſiſts in two points. The firſt is, when we conceive clearly and diſtinctly the parts whereof it is
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:119773:37"/>
compoſed. The ſecond, when we clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive their alliance and union, or their antipathy and incompatibility. If the Author ſpeak of the former manner of conceiving, I ſhall preſume to declare his rule utterly falſe; for we can as well, and as clearly conceive the parts of a Propoſition that is falſe, as thoſe of one that is true. As for example, I have a clear and diſtinct knowledge of the parts of this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, though it be a falſe; <hi>Latus &amp; diameter Quadrati ſunt commenſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilia.</hi> But if his meaning be of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond manner of conceiving and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his rule ſignifies no more then this, <hi>viz.</hi> That thoſe Propoſitions which we conceive clearly and diſtinctly to be true, are indeed and really true, whereof never any man yet doubted. But it were only to fight with ſhadows to beſtow any further examination on this rule of the Authors, ſince he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf confeſſes elſwhere, That <hi>there is great difficulty to diſcern certainly thoſe Propoſitions which we conceivc moſt</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:119773:38"/>
                  <hi>clearly and diſtinctly.</hi> For every man that is fully convinced that ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is true, how falſe ſoever it may be, will ſay that he conceives it clearly and diſtinctly in one of theſe two manners.</p>
               <p>But the Author proceeds, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains us with an eſſay of his Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy concerning the nature of God: wherein I muſt ingenuouſly confeſs I have found no more ſatisfaction then in what he hath delivered of the nature of man. And here he advances this Propoſition, making it his buſineſs to find out whence he had learned to think anything more perfect then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and at laſt he evidently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers, that it muſt have proceeded from ſome nature that were effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally more perfect then his own, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Idea ſhould be infus'd into him; and in a word, that that Nature can be no other then God, becauſe, ſaith he, <hi>that I could not entertain within my ſelf the Idaea of a Being more perfect then my own, and that that which is</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:119773:38"/>
                  <hi>more perfect cannot proceed from that which is leſs perfect.</hi> Now from hence in my opinion it ſhould rather have been inferr'd, that the contemplation of things which were leſs perfect then himſelf, ſhould have given him occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to examine whether there were not ſome nature more perfect then his own. For conſidering that the Plants are more perfect then inanimate creatures, and among animals Dogs and Horſes are more perfect then Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh, and Men arrive to a higher degree of perfection then all the other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; he might by the conſideration of ſuch a dependence have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to conſider and examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there were not yet ſome other nature more perfect then this rational nature of ours: And to bring him to this, he needed but only have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared himſelf with the other creatures. For, I conceive my ſelf to <hi>know</hi> ſome things, and I <hi>doubt</hi> of many others, nay there are an infinite number of things whereof I am utterly <hi>ignorant.</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:119773:39"/>
There are others in the world who know leſs then I do, and there are thoſe alſo who know much more; but there is not any man who doubts not of ſomewhat. Now this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration I ſhould think ſufficient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite any rational ſoul to examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there were not ſome intelligent nature altogether exempt from all <hi>error, doubt and ignorance,</hi> and that for to advance into ſuch an examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there ſhould be no need that God ſhould infuſe into me the Idaea of any thing more perfect then my ſelf, nor ſhould I have wanted any more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular aſſiſtance of God in this, no more then in any other ratiocination. For as it is as natural to us to lift up our eyes to heaven to contemplate the ſun and moon, as to look down upon the earth; in the ſame manner, it is as natural for a man to endeavour to find out the moſt perfect nature in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, as to entertain his mind with things below; juſt as when we ſee a river, it is as natural for us to ſeek out
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:119773:39"/>
the ſource from whence it ſprings, as the place where it diſembogues it ſelf. But it being admitted that the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition were true, yet is the proof of it weak and inſufficient: for though it be true, that <hi>a thing which is more perfect cannot depend of a thing which is leſs perfect,</hi> yet it is not equally true that the Idaea of a nature more perfect then mine may not depend on mine; for the Idaea which I have of a thing which is more perfect then my ſelf, is not more perfect then I. All the Idae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a's whereof my mind is ſuſceptible, whenceſoever they proceed, are but accidents are repreſentations, and therefore cannot come into the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, as to perfection, with the rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal ſoul, which is a ſubſtance. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, if to know God, it be neceſſary that he muſt have infuſed into us ſome Idaea of his nature, I demand whether he have beſtowed that Idaea on all, or only on ſome in partieular? If he have beſtow'd it equally on all, how comes it to paſs that ſo many have ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:119773:40"/>
thoughts of God, and ſo diſproportionable to his nature? If this indulgence of heaven reaches but ſome in particular, it makes nothing to the preſent purpoſe, it being here a queſtion of Philoſophy, and not of viſions, inſpirations, revelations, or any other ſuch lights.</p>
               <p>But how then ſhall we ſatisfie or convince the Author in this point? Certainly it cannot be, but he well underſtands the doctrine of the Schools touching the neceſſity which the Underſtanding hath of the ſenſes and the imagination, in all things whereof it undertakes the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Or is it that he diſſembles it, out of the averſion which he bears to that more then any other Tenet of the Schools; and does as the <hi>French</hi> do, who can never be perſwaded that the plot of a Play is well laid, if a <hi>Spaniard</hi> be not introduc'd in ſome extravagant and ridiculous poſture? Hower it may be, I doubt not to make it appear that he hath not had reaſon to ſpeak ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageouſly;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:119773:40"/>
nay, and what is more, that all the Idaea's which we have of the nature of God, do but too much betray and diſcover the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the nature whence they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; ſo far are we from having any cauſe to affirm that God ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe them into us.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour cals God <hi>Creator, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver, Lord, Judge, Revenger, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder,</hi> &amp;c. But all thoſe attributes do not diſcover what he is in himſelf, but only denote him ſuch as he expreſſes himſelf towards us, and conſequently make no repreſentation of his eſſence, ſeeing he may be without us. We call him moſt good, moſt wiſe, almighty, and in like manner attribute to him all the other perfections, which are not in us but imperfectly: but in ſo doing we imploy divers thoughts to repreſent, that all theſe in him are but one; and further to rectifie all theſe Idaea's and notions, we muſt adde, that he is all theſe incomprehenſibly. So that the moſt proper notions we can have of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:119773:41"/>
him are negative, as that he is inviſible, incomprehenſible, infinite, incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: All which give us to underſtand what he is not, but acquaint us not what he is. For as concerning the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative notions we have of him, a day will come when we ſhall find how groſs and ruſtick they were, and ſhall do as <hi>Tityrus</hi> in <hi>Virgil,</hi> who when he came to ſee <hi>Rome,</hi> condemned all the Idaea's which he had conceived of it before, ſaying,
<q>
                     <l>Urbem quam dicunt Romam, <hi>Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baee,</hi> putavi</l>
                     <l>Stultus ego huic noſtrae ſimilem, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>As for the reſt of his ratiocinations concerning God, they ſeem to me good and ſolid: but I muſt withall tell him, he is not the firſt Author of them, but <hi>Scotus</hi> and moſt Authors who have written of Metaphyſicks have made uſe of them. If he have borrowed them of others, he is juſtly cenſureable, ſince he affirms that he
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:119773:41"/>
found nothing that was firm and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in Philoſophy. If he have been ignorant that any others before him had made uſe of them, he muſt needs acknowledg that he hath been guilty of ſome precipitation in condemning the writings of the Philoſophers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any previous peruſal of them.</p>
               <p>In the fifth Section, where he ſpeaks of Geometrical truths, I have not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved any thing remarkable; unleſs it be, that in ſpeaking of a Sphere, he hath unawares let ſlip this, <hi>That all the parts are equally diſtant from the centre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſixth Section, he ſays that the reaſon why there are ſo many who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelves that there is much difficulty to know God and the Soul, is becauſe they are ſo accuſtomed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to conſider any thing but through the imagination, that they conclude that whatſoever is not imaginable, is not intelligible: Which is manifeſt, ſays he, in that the Philoſophers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves hold, <hi>That nothing enters into the Underſtanding, which before had not</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:119773:42"/>
                  <hi>paſs'd through the Senſe.</hi> Where it is to be obſerved, the Idaea's of God and the Soul have never been admitted. To which he adds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That thoſe who would make uſe of their imagination to comprehend them, are of the ſame opinion.</p>
               <p>Although it be on all ſides confeſs'd that the ſoul of man is immortal, yet in regard it is, in ſuch a manner as it is, joyned to the body, the ſoveraign fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty thereof, which we call the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect or the underſtanding, cannot, in its operations, be without ſome depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the ſenſes &amp; the imagination. And that is it which hath given occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Philoſophers to ſay, that <hi>there is nothing in the understanding, which hath not before been in the ſenſe;</hi> and that the underſtanding doth not know nor comprehend any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aſſiſtance of the imagination. As concerning the former of theſe Maxims, I could wiſh that thoſe whoſe authority firſt brought it into reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had bethought themſelves of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:119773:42"/>
ſome other manner of expreſſion, and that they had contented themſelves to have ſaid with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that he which had no ſenſe could never comprehend any thing. But the interpretation which they give of it is indubitably true. Now in my judgment there is nothing leſs becoming a Philoſopher, then to be too nice and critical about words, when it is fully agreed about the things themſelves. The authors therefore of this Maxim, <hi>That there is nothing in the underſtanding,</hi> &amp;c. did not mean thereby, that there is nothing intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible but what is ſenſible, but hold forth two things for us to obſerve. The firſt is, that the underſtanding cannot think of any thing, unleſs ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what have before ſmitten the ſenſes; and conſequently, that the firſt thoughts of the underſtanding have for their object ſomething that is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. For the underſtanding, before it have conceived any thing, being of it ſelf indifferent as to all ſorts of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, it cannot be determined to one
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:119773:43"/>
object rather then to another, but by the mediation of the ſenſes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing is, that the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which we have of ſenſible things do produce in us others, being as it were the ſeed which is caſt into the ground, nay leads us to the knowledg of immaterial things which are not under the reach of our ſenſes. And ſo by conſequence, all the Notions and Idaea's which the Underſtanding can have of the nature of God and the ſoul, and all other things which fall not under our ſenſes, have had their conception of theſe former, after the ſame manner as the Concluſions are ſaid to be in their principles, or a great tree with its fruit and its leaves may be ſaid to be contained in a kernel. Now the underſtanding multiplies its firſt diſcoveries two manner of ways, that is to ſay, by Abſtraction, as when from the notion of Individuals, which are material and ſenſible, it advances to the occult cauſes of things; and when in Geometry, from a ſmall number of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:119773:43"/>
principles it draws ſo many admirable concluſions.</p>
               <p>As concerning the ſecond Maxim, it is capable of two interpretations. The firſt is, that nothing is intelligible but what is imaginable; or, that the underſtanding cannot conceive any thing, whereof the imagination doth not furniſh it with a repreſentation. The ſecond is, that ſo often and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the underſtanding is buſied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout any thing, the imagination alſo acts its part by preſenting it with the image of the ſame thing or ſome other. And this ſenſe, and not the other, is held by the Schools of this opinion. Now this ſenſe may yet be divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two; the firſt is, that the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native faculty always accompanies the Underſtanding, as a Dog follows his Maſter every where, though he be not every foot called to that duty, nay ſometimes whether the Maſter will or no, ſo far is it from that there ſhould be a neceſſity. And that is it which <hi>Philoponus</hi> ſayes; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:119773:44"/>
The other is, that the underſtanding cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend any thing without the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the imagination. Now here we are to make a difference between the ſtate of the Underſtanding while it is as it were in its apprentiſhip, and its ſtate of perfection: For the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticks hold, that to the learning of any thing, the Underſtanding ſtands in need of the Imagination. But ſome of them have been of opinion, that the Underſtanding may arrive to ſuch a degree of perfection, that it may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence with this aſſiſtance of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. Like as the ſcaffolds are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, while the walls of an edifice are a raiſing; but thoſe being once perfected, there is not any further need of them, nay they hinder the outward appearance of the walls: Or as young ſwimmers make uſe of bladders for ſome while, whereof they afterwards ſlight the aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>By this time it may be eaſily diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:119773:44"/>
whether the Author have dealt juſtly with the Schoolmen in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. For if there are ſome people who underſtand not any elevation of their ſpirits above ſenſible things, and who believe that that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is not imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, is conſequently not intelligible; the Schools reprove them as much as may be; and the manner how it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that whatſoever enters into the underſtanding, hath before been in the ſenſes, cannot be any more ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy called into doubt. As to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection which he propoſes in the laſt place, where he ſays, that <hi>to make uſe of our imagination to comprehend imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial things, were as if to hear ſounds we ſhould make uſe of our eyes,</hi> is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great difficulty avoided: for who doth not ſee the diſparity that is between theſe things? Of the outward ſenſes, ſome have not been made to exerciſe the functions of the others, and their proper and peculiar objects are different; ſo that what is diſcerned by any one, falls not under the diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:119773:45"/>
of another. But the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath been beſtow'd on man for the ſervice of the Underſtanding; and though the imagination cannot advance to whatever is intelligible, yet the underſtanding judges of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is imaginable. Now this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, That <hi>the imagination aſsists us in the comprehenſion of immaterial things,</hi> may be interpreted two manner of ways; whereof the one is true, the other falſe. For, to ſee my ſelf, I make uſe of my eyes, not of a looking-glaſs, yet I ſee my ſelf in the glaſs, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it I cannot behold my ſelf. In like manner, for to comprehend immaterial things, I make uſe of my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and of my imagination too, but in divers manners; for 'tis by the help of my underſtanding th at compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them, and not by the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but my underſtanding would not be able to comprehend them without the aſſiſtance of my imagination, nay ſtands me in no ſtead, if the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould not repreſent to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:119773:45"/>
ſtanding the Idaea's of material things. For when I caſt my eys on the Picture of the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to me no more then the linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his face, my mind goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that, and entertains it ſelf with his generous and heroick actions. I ſee no more in a book but <hi>figures, letters</hi> and <hi>characters;</hi> but my mind contents not it ſelf with that, but is carried to the conſideration of the words and things which thoſe letters are deſigned to ſignifie. In like manner, when I read the fables of <hi>Aeſop,</hi> I do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in the literal ſenſe, as children uſe to do, but I thence make moral inferences. Why therefore ſhould we ſay that the repreſentation of a material thing preſented to the underſtanding by the imagination, may not be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to it, to make it underſtand an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material thing? From what hath been ſaid it may be eaſily gathered what is the true and natural cauſe why imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial things are not ſo eaſily known as material. For, the underſtanding not
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:119773:46"/>
being able to comprehend any thing without the imagination, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations wherewith it conſtantly furniſhes the underſtanding being but the images of material things, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that it is more eaſie to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend material things then immaterial: juſt as when one propoſes a riddle, the explication is difficult, but the literal ſenſe is eaſily underſtood.</p>
               <p>In the ſeventh Section he continues to diſcredit the teſtimony of our ſenſes, and calls the aſſurance they give us of the exiſtence of our bodies, a <hi>moral</hi> aſſurance. A moral aſſurance is that which is grounded upon moral reaſons, or ſuch as a man muſt content himſelf withal in moral matters, although thoſe reaſons are not receivable in <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick.</hi> Now I think I may ſay, without incurring the cenſure of an unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able man, That the teſtimony of our ſenſes, when our reaſon doth not any ways contradict it, is more ſatisfactory then a hundred moral reaſons, and is receivable in Phyſick; nay, which is
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:119773:46"/>
more, is the foundation thereof, as we have ſhewed before. As for example, I am obliged to believe what a many perſons of credit (who have no deſign to ſurpriſe or deceive me) do unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly affirm they have ſeen; this is to me a moral aſſurance that ſuch a thing is true; but I ſhould be more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitably aſſured, if I had ſeen the ſame thing with my own eyes. In like manner, becauſe I have not known nor heard of any diſhoneſt actions in ſuch a man whom I have long converſed with, I have a moral aſſurance that he is an honeſt man: but the aſſurance that I have that he is crooked-nos'd, or that he is of a red complexion, is without compariſon greater, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well be called moral. But, ſays the Author, <hi>the ſenſes do not give us a metaphyſical aſſurance of things.</hi> Now there is a threefold aſſurance. The <hi>moral</hi> aſſurance is the leaſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in things, and that is when we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not contradict a thing without ſome injury done to good manners, although
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:119773:47"/>
we know well enough that it is poſſible the thing may be otherwiſe. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt is that which the Author cals <hi>meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical,</hi> which alſo may be called <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical.</hi> There is yet another which we may call <hi>phyſical,</hi> and that is, when we know that a thing muſt abſolutely be ſo or ſo, becauſe it is impoſſible it ſhould be otherwiſe then we affirm it to be, that is to ſay, when we know that according to the courſe of nature, and without the intervention of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, the thing cannot be otherwiſe. As I am aſſur'd, if I put my hand into the fire, and continue it there ſome while, it will be burned: And that the Sun never goes backward, nor ever ſtands ſtill.</p>
               <p>But to proceed, after he had thus invalidated the teſtimony of our ſenſes, and made the aſſurance which we have of what they dictate to us very weak and uncertain, he hath obſerved that a man <hi>may imagine being aſleep, that he hath another manner of body, and that he ſees other kinds of ſtars, though there</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:119773:47"/>
                  <hi>be no ſuch thing.</hi> And in conſequence of this he aſſerts, That the greateſt wits that ever have been in the world could not give any rational account whence men came to know, that <hi>the thoughts which we are entertain'd with being aſleep, are more falſe then our others, ſeeing that oftentimes they are as lively and expreſs'd as the others,</hi> unleſs it be in preſuppoſing the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God. But we ſee what he means by this queſtion, namely, that the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of it ſhould depend upon this rule, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>thoſe things which we moſt clearly and diſtinctly know, are all true.</hi> Which Rule yet he confeſſes is not infallible out of any reaſon; but becauſe that thoſe idaea's and notions, inaſmuch as they are clear and diſtinct, proceed from God, who is all wiſdom and all perfection; and when there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in them ſomewhat of obſcurity or confuſion, they proceed from us, becauſe we are not arrived to ſuch a degree of perfection: And ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, by how much they are more
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:119773:48"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:119773:49"/>
clear, by ſo much are they the more true; and if there be any falſhood, it muſt be onely ſaid of thoſe notions which have ſomwhat of obſcurity or confuſion. Having therefore thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Rule, he anſwers the Queſtion in this manner. <hi>Whether we ſleep, or whether we wake, we ought not to ſuffer our ſelves to be perſwaded to any thing but by the evidence of our own Reaſon, and not of our imagination or our ſenſes.</hi> 
                  <q>And becauſe our ratiocinations are not alwayes ſo evident and perfect while we ſleep as they are while we wake, (although ſomtimes our imaginations may be equally, if not more lively and effective) if there be any thing of Truth to be expected in our thoughts, it muſt be found in thoſe which we have when we are waking, rather then in our dreams.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the firſt place, the Author muſt pardon me if I deny him this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, viz. <hi>That becauſe the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which we have when we ſleep are falſe, therefore we may not be fully aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:119773:49"/>
                  <hi>of what our ſenſes dictate to us when we are awake.</hi> For I ſhall preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take occaſion to ſhew that there is no proportion or ſimilitude between theſe two things.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is true, and well adviſed, that we ſhould not ſuffer our ſelves to be perſwaded by our imagination, if it be not it ſelf conformable to Reaſon, or the teſtimony of our Senſes. But ſeeing all that is in us proceeds from God, our imaginations as well as our thoughts; if the thoughts of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding are true ſo far as they are clear and diſtinct, wherefore is it that our imaginations may not by the ſame reaſon be all true, when they are live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, affective and diſtinct?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, where he ſayes, That <hi>our ratiocinations are never ſo clear and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect while we are ſleeping, as when we are waking;</hi> he ſpeaks too generally, for it happens ſometimes that in our ſleep we make moſt excellent ratioci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I conceive it is not enough
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:119773:50"/>
to ſay, that in the time of our ſleep our ratiocinations arrive not to that evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and perfection which they may come to when we are awake; but the reaſon thereof ſhould have been aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For it may ſeem that in the time of ſleep the rational ſoul hath a greater and freer enjoyment of her ſelf, and, as being ſo much the leſs diverted by exterior objects, ſhe ought the better to acquit herſelf of her nobleſt fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>But to treat this matter a little more tenderly, and to penetrate to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, here are three Queſtions ſo linked together, that he that anſwers one of them, anſwers all.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Why the imaginations which we have when we are aſleep, are falſe rather then thoſe we have awake?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Why our imaginations, whether we ſleep or wake, are more likely to be falſe then the judgment of our ſenſes?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Why our ratiocinations are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo evident nor ſo perfect in the time of our ſleep, as in the time of ou<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:119773:50"/>

                  </gap>otheſes then thoſe of the Author, that is, without medling with the exiſtence of God, nor with his nature; ſubmitting my ſelf to the Learned, who may judge whether I have hit the mark or no.</p>
               <p>I ſay then, that our imaginations are rather falſe when we ſleep, then when we wake: becauſe in the time of ſleep, our imagination ſtrays up and down without any thing to guide or conduct it. But when we are awake, our Senſes and our Reaſon hinder it from being extravagant, and either keep it from wandring, or reduce it when it hath. For we have imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of two ſorts: ſome are voluntary, others have no dependance at all on our will, but on ſome other natural cauſes, which are yet naturally in our power. Which cauſes may be reduced principally to three kinds, and they are</p>
               <p n="1">1. The objects which ſmite our ſenſes</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:119773:51"/>
2. The paſſions of our ſouls, and</p>
               <p n="3">3. Certain diſpoſitions of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
               <p>The voluntary imaginations are very frequent to us when we are awake: as when an Architect imagines within himſelf the Idaea of an edifice for to imitate it, or when a Painter imagines ſome chimaera or other fiction to make a picture of pleaſure, or when we apply our imaginative faculty to ſome whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom idaea's, ſuch as may aſſiſt us in the underſtanding of any thing, whereof we have propoſed to our ſelves the contemplation But in our ſleep, we have no voluntary imaginations; for though ſome of our dreams pleaſe us, and others diſpleaſe us and afflict us, we can neither invite the one, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the other. As concerning the imaginations which are not in our power, according to the natural order of things, in the time of our waking, they are but attendants and depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants on our ſenſes. But ſometimes the idaea's of certain things which are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:119773:51"/>
that have rais'd ſtrong paſſions in our minds, caſt themſelves in the way, and do in ſuch a manner poſſeſs and divert the imaginative faculty, that we perceive not what is before our eyes, nor hear the ſounds which ſmite our ears. And in that poſture, our imaginations, though we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, are in a manner dreams. In the ſame manner, the indiſpoſitions of our bodies do work in us ſometimes very ſtrange imaginations, as it daily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in Phrenetick perſons, and ſuch as are hypocondriacal. Now theſe diſorders and irregularities happening while we wake, fall not out very often, nor to all perſons. But while we ſleep, all our imaginations are nothing elſe but illuſions, as when falſe idaea's are repreſented to the imaginative faculty, that is to ſay, the idaea's of things that are not, or in another manner then they are, or ſome other circumſtances: As if a man that is in love ſhould in his ſleep imagine that he ſaw his Miſtreſs, ſuch as ſhe is indeed; but with this
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:119773:52"/>
falſe circumſtance, that ſhe lay cloſe by him, there being no ſuch thing. In like manner, when in ſleeping we imagine and dream of ſomewhat that was paſt the day before, or ſomewhat that ſhall happen the day after, 'tis but an illuſion, becauſe we do not imagine the thing as paſt, but as if it were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and in effect before our ſenſes.</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond Queſtion, I ſay that our imaginations are more likely to deceive us then our ſenſes, becauſe that thoſe things which ſmite our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes muſt be truly real and exiſt; but they are but things in picture, as it were, which ſmite our imaginative fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, when it operates alone and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſenſes; for external things cannot move the imaginative faculty but by the interpoſition of the ſenſes. From hence it may be inferr'd, That when the Senſes are at reſt, the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation muſt neceſſarily be at reſt too, or it muſt contemplate thoſe images which had at other times been repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to it by the ſenſes, thoſe images
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:119773:52"/>
having remain'd imprinted in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, though perhaps the things themſelves which they repreſent have ceas'd to be, or at leaſt are abſent or far diſtant from the ſenſe. There is further this difference between the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginative faculty and the ſenſes, that the ſenſes cannot change any thing in their object, nor in their operation. But when we are awake, and that we would beſet our ſelves to contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the imagination diſpoſes and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciplines the images as we will our ſelves; but when we are aſleep, they are alwayes repreſented in the ſame manner, and in the ſame order as they had paſs'd by the ſenſes; but moſt commonly without order, inconſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and many times making mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous and ridiculous figures, as when the image of a Goat is repreſented with the head of a Lion. It is evident therefore, that however our imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be lively and affective, we never ought to ſuffer our ſelves to be perſwaded by them, but in as much
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:119773:53"/>
as they keep harmony with our ſenſes and with our reaſon; and if they do ſo, it is not a perſwaſion of our imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, but of our ſenſes and our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Nor doth it avail any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, to ſay, That the imaginative faculty is of greater excellence then the ſenſes; for its excellence doth not conſiſt in the truth of what it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, but in the perfection of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation; as it is the excellence of a Painter, not to repreſent any thing in a picture but what is truly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſo, but to repreſent any thing to the life that he hath a mind to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. In like manner hath Nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd the imaginative faculty on man, not for to diſcern what is, or what is not, nor to judge of what is poſſible or impoſſible, but to be ſerviceable and ſubject to the Underſtanding upon the default of the Senſes, which is when it repreſents unto it the images of things paſt or abſent, or abſtracted from our ſenſes.</p>
               <p>From what hath been ſaid it is eaſie
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:119773:53"/>
to anſwer the third Queſtion. For it being once granted, that the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding cannot work without the aid and aſſiſtance of the Imagination; and that all the imaginations which we have when we are aſleep, are falſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their ſubſtance, or at leaſt in ſome circumſtance, they are not ſo fit to be the foundations of good ratioci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, the ſubſequent imaginations having no alliance, nor holding corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with the precedent, hinder the underſtanding to finiſh its work, and before it hath ended one, cauſe it to begin another.</p>
               <p>All that now lies on my hands to examine, is what the Author treats us with in the eighth Section, where he would prove that we ſhould never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer our ſelves to be perſwaded by the evidence of our ſenſes, no more then of our lively and affective imaginations. <hi>Our ſenſes,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>deceive often enough, though we be not aſleep; as when to thoſe that have the yellow jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies all things ſeem yellow; and though</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:119773:54"/>
                  <hi>we ſee the Sun very clearly, we ought not thence to judge that he is no bigger then it ſeems to us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To ruine the reputation of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, he ſhould have ſhewn that they are ſometimes deceiv'd in judging of their proper objects, the organs being ſound and in their natural ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the objects being well and duly repreſented unto them, and the ſpace between well diſpos'd, according to theſe three requiſites I mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: But that he doth not ſo much as offer or pretend to do. <hi>Thoſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>who have the Yellow jaundies ſee all things yellow;</hi> and conſequently the ſight is deceiv'd in diſcerning colours, which are its proper objects. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a proverb of no ſmall ſtanding, that the Yellow jaundies cauſeth all things to appear yellow to them that have it; but ordinarily the reaſon of it is, becauſe Melancholy, which cauſes that the Jaundies diffuſing it ſelf through all the skin, nay even through the white of the eyes, doth faſten on
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:119773:54"/>
the horny tunicle. But let it be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that this common ſaying is always true, I preſume the Author will grant me that the eye is not then in its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral condition. But there is a great deal more to be ſaid. I deny that in the caſe propoſed, the eye is deceiv'd in the diſcerning of colours, for in effect it ſees nothing but what is yellow; it is only deceiv'd in not diſcerning where the yellow is which it ſees. For it is the horny tunicle, which naturally not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any colour, but is abſolutely diaphanous and dy'd with the Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, that cauſes the objects to ſeem yellow; as when we look through a yellow glaſs, everything ſeems yellow, and if the glaſs be red, all things will appear red. In like manner when a web begins to form it ſelf in the eye, we ſeem to ſee little flies in the air, yet they are nothing but thin and obſcure va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors, or clouds which are raiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the horny tunicle and the chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalline humor. And if ſometimes we conceive that we ſee ſomethings which
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:119773:55"/>
are not at all, as it happens to frantick perſons, it is not the ſight which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives us, but the imagination.</p>
               <p>As concerning what he ſays of the greatneſs of the Sun and other celeſtial bodies, what matters it if the ſight be deceived therein, ſeeing the celeſtial bodies are not at the diſtance requiſite to be ſeen diſtinctly. But above all, methinks it is a ſtrange aſſertion which the Author advances, when he ſayes that <hi>the Sun is moſt clearly ſeen:</hi> For, his light is ſo great, that it dazles and ſo overcomes our ſight, that we can ſee it but very confuſedly and imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Too much light is no leſs injurious to the ſight then too little; and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the proper objects of every ſenſe being exceſſive in the higheſt degree, is inſupportable to the organ, and does violence to the temperament, whereby it is what it is.</p>
               <p>To conclude, I would gladly ask the Author whether he hath composd this <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> awake or aſleep? If he have done it aſleep, I would entreat
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:119773:55"/>
him to review itbeing awake, becauſe it is not reaſonable that we ſhould ſuffer our ſelves to be perſwaded to credit his dreams. If he have done it awake, how knows he that he was then awake? It is indeed true, that our Reaſon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates to us that we are awake, when we do effectually <hi>ſee</hi> and <hi>hear,</hi> and have all our <hi>ſenſes</hi> open and attentive to the exterior objects: But that he then <hi>ſaw</hi> and <hi>heard,</hi> and <hi>felt</hi> actually, and not only by imagination, he could not any wayes be aſſured but by the teſtimony of the common Senſe, which judges whether the particular Senſes do their duty or no, as being their centre and mark. If he unravel this skain, he will very much undeceive me,
