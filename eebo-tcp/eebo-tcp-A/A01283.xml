         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

royalme, I coulde not, but for a season, a courtayne drawen betweene my weake eies, and the resplendent beames of your most clere maiestie, folow feruent desire, and humblye offer vnto your hyghnesse, this my rude translation, not doubtynge but as noble Xerxes thankfully receyued an handfull of water, of a poore manne, that so youre princely goodnesse, wolle take in good parte, this myne, what soo euer be, borne, and brought vp vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly, in good wylles howse.</p>
            <p>It hath ben somtyme moued, whether in warre, Polycy of mynde, or Strength of body, shulde do more. but longe expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, hath put this thyng so out of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, that in all battayles, the specialle prayse or disprayse remayneth to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitayne. Yea some men are not affrayde to affirme, that it is moche better to haue an armie, where the Capitayn is a lyon, and all the hoste fearefull dere, than to haue a dere the capitayne, and al the host lyons. Aiax was stronge, Ulysses wise: Homere gyueth moche more praise to the laste, than to the fyrste. Aiax was hardye

Many mo fieldes haue ben lost for lacke of polycie, than for wante of strength. many townes wonne by sleigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, whyche a longe season easilye were kepte ageynst greattest myght, strength, and force. Wherfore seinge present occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion requireth martiall feates to be kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, and strength of bodye to be armed and anymated with wytte and polycie: I entendynge here to serue my countreye, founde nothynge so fytte, for thaccom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyshement of this my purpose, as to set out the Strategemes, sleightes, &amp; craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, vsed by the noblest capytaynes, that all antyke hystories treate of.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage is offred. The noble capitaynes of England, haue oft declared, that they ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell nede any instructions, any bokes, to teach them to towse their enemies: &amp; yet it can hurte no man, to see those thynges practysed, by auncient capitaynes, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che may gyue good occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, both ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to inuente newe polycies, and wysely to vse the olde.

If men be not wery, to playe a thousande tymes at one game, where eyther Fonde pleasure, or Uile gayne, or (whan it is best) helthe of body is sought: can any gentyll man be lothesome, to refreshe his mynde, to help his memorie, to kendle his courage with honeste delyte, of redynge or herynge su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che thynges, as appertayne to thesafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde

of body and goodes? to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasynge of honourable victories, fame, and renoume? The infirmitie of mans nature is suche, that bothe the senses of our body, and also the powers of oure mynde decay, and go to ruine, onles they be dayly refresshed and holpen. The eie is continually holpen, with clere lyghte, with freshe and comely colours, the smel with holsome ayre, and odours delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the taste asketh in his meates and drynkes, a dewe temperature. And as it is here, soo is it in the better parte of man, wytte, vnderstandynge, Memorie, and Inuention, with all the reste, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and ornamentes of the mynde, must be holpen with continuance of redynge, herynge, and reasonynge of mattiers, withoute whiche, they waxe rustye, they canker, and decaye. There is a tyme for al thinges, as Salomon wisely writeth. Whan tyme requyred peace, we talked lyttell of warre. Newe occasyons bryng matters, not thoughte vppon, in place.

Whan tyme byddeth spende, sparynge is great waste. Loue is lewdenesse, whan tyme biddeth hate. Peace is to be refused, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tyme forceth men to warre.

duetie: whiche he caused to make many iourneys, and to beare on theyr backes, as moche vittayles as shulde serue them many dayes: so that he accustomed them to suffer colde and sharpe showres, and to wade ouer waters a fote. Nowe and than he imbrayded them of fearefulnesse and cowardise, breakynge such vesselles in pieces, whiche they vsed more of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycacie, than for nede in theyr expedition. In this behalf, the reproch, that he gaue to the capitaine C.

               <p>Caius Marius, somewhat to ease the armie in carieng their traficke and bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, wherwith they were greatly loded, deuysed their vessels and vittayles into fardels laide vpon staues, vnderset with forkes, whiche made their burthen lygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and they myght more easily rest vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it. Whervpon they were called in pro uerbe, Marius mules.</p>

Than priuily he sent forthe the horsmen, and commaunded theym lyke ennemies to retourne and fiersely sette vpon theyr felowes. Whiche thynge doone, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mytted the battayl to be thus ordred, that they that remayned with hym, as it were prepared to encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter with their enmies, shulde take euery manne what place he wolde, and wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the faint harted felowes drewe backe, the stronge and valyaunt, boldly stepte forth into the forefront: and as he founde theym standynge, so he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunced them in the order of chiualry.</p>
               <p>¶ Lysander of Lacedemonia corrected a certayne man, bycause he strayed from his company. And whan the man sayde, he strayed not from the army to robbe or steale any thynge, he answered, I wolle that thou shewe no spece or lykelyhod of robberye.</p>

Thus he beinge commanded to remoue and go thense, Antigonus caused to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clayme, that no man vnder the age of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeres, shoulde lodge in the house of a sole woman.</p>

               <p>T. Scaurus forbad his sonne to come in his syghte, bycause in the foreste Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentine he gaue place to his enemies, the yonge man pressed with shame of that re proche and infamy, slewe hym selfe.</p>

               <p>Clearchus, chieftayne of the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniens, sayde to his armie, The capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne ought rather to be dredde, than the ennemie: sygnifienge that they, whyche

               <p>By the counsayle of Appius Claudius the senatours decreed, that they whiche were taken by kyng Pirrhus, and after sent home ageine, if they were horsemen, shulde be made fote menne, if they were fote men, shulde be made lyghte harney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed men, &amp; all suche to lodge without the campe, tyll eche of theym, had broughte home two spoyles of theyr ennemyes.</p>
               <p>Otacilius Crassus cons. commanded, that they, whiche taken of Anniball, and crepynge vnder the yocke of reproche, were retourned home, shulde lye without the trenche of the campe, that they being vnfensed, myght accustome them selfes to perylles, and waxe the more bolde and hardy agaynste theyr ennemies.</p>

his bulwark was burned, and his camp taken, to be beaten with roddes, and to be taken in the nomber of the simple soul diours, &amp; to do such dueties as they dyd.</p>
               <p>Whan Marcus Cato, after a token gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, had lowsed from the coste of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, where he had layne a certayne space, and saw one of his souldiours left on the shore, crienge, callynge, and bec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenynge to be taken in: He made about with all his nauy to the shoore agayne, and commaunded the same souldiour to be taken and streyght put to deathe: wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge rather to make hym an exaumple to the other, then that he shulde be slayne of his enemies, with reproche &amp; infamy.</p>

            <head>¶Bycause the pages shulde not be vacant, we haue added these generalle rules of warre, taken out of Vegetius.</head>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N all battayles of expedition this is a sure rule, That what so euer is profytable to the, is hurtefull to thyne aduersarie, and that, that helpeth hym, hyndreth the. Therfore after our enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb facs="tcp:2812:111"/>
mynd and intent we shuld nothing do, or dissemble, but do that onely, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che we iudge profytable for vs. For than thou begynnest to do agaynste thy selfe: whan thou folowest that that he wolde faynest thou dyddest. Ageyne, what soo euer thou enterprisest for thy profite, shal be agaynst hym, if he woll folowe it.</p>
            <p>He that in warre moste laboureth and exerciseth his souldiours in trauayles, that longe to the warres, shall alwayes susteyne leaste perylle and daungier.</p>
            <p>Neuer range out in the front of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle, a souldiour, of whome before thou haste had none open profe.</p>
            <p>It is better to vanquyshe thyn ennemy with neede, with sodeyne inuasyons, or with terror, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with fyghtyng in playne battayle: in the whiche Fortune is wont to beare a greatter stroke than vertue.</p>
            <p>Those counsayles are beste, whyche thyne aduersarie knoweth nothynge of, tyll they be done in dede.</p>
            <p>Occasion or sodeyne happe in battayle helpeth more than vertue or strength.</p>
            <p>In solycitynge and receyuynge of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
<pb facs="tcp:2812:111"/>
whiche faithfully flee vnto the, is great truste: for the fleers from thyne ennemye to the, are to hym more harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, than they that thou sleest.</p>
            <p>It is better to kepe many stronge war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des behynde the forefront, than to sprede to wyde thy warriours.</p>
            <p>It is harde to ouercome hym, that can truly iudge his own strength, and what power his aduersarye hath.</p>
            <p>More auayleth vertue and strengthe than multitude.</p>
            <p>The well chosen place, dothe often ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes more auayle tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vertue or strength.</p>
            <p>Nature bringeth forth few strong men, but wel diuised ordinance maketh many.</p>
            <p>The armye with labour profiteth, with idelnesse, waxeth dull.</p>
            <p>Neuer brynge oute thy souldyours to fyght a battayl, except thou se them hope to haue the vyctorie.</p>
            <p>Sodayne dedes of warre affrayeth the enmies, the vsual featis ar not regardid.</p>
            <p>He that with his people disparpled, pur sueth his enemies vnwisely, may happe to gyue to his ennemie the vyctorie, that

he before had gotten.</p>
            <p>He that prepareth not before, wheate and vyttayle necessarie for his hooste, is vanquyshed without weapon.</p>
            <p>He that hath mo people, and is stronger than his ennemie, let hym make his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde foure square: whiche is the fyrsie maner of assaylinge.</p>
            <p>He that is febler than his foo, lette hym set his ryght wynge ageynst his enmyes lefte wyng, whiche is the seconde maner.</p>
            <p>He that feleth hym selfe strongest in the lyft wynge, let him assayle his ennemies ryght winge, which is the thyrde maner.</p>
            <p>He that hath in bothe wynges stronge souldiours, and well exercised, lette hym sette on bothe wynges at ones, whiche is the fourthe maner.</p>
            <p>He that can beste rule his lyght harnei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, lette hym inuade eyther wynge of his ennemies, settynge the archers in the forefront, whiche is the fyfte maner.</p>
            <p>He that trusteth neyther in the number nor in the strength of his souldiors, and must nedes fyght, let him with his right wynge assayle his ennemies left wynge,
<pb facs="tcp:2812:112"/>
stretchynge out the reste of his army like a spyt or broche. whiche is the. vi. maner.</p>
            <p>He that hath fewer and weaker souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, lette hym so pytche his fielde, that he haue on his one syde a mountayne, a citie, a see, a ryuer, or some other thynge, and this is the seuenth maner.</p>
            <p>He that trusteth in his horsmen, let him ordeyne his fielde in a playne, and let the burthen of the battayle reste mooste on the horsemenne.</p>
            <p>He that trusteth in his footemen, lette hym pytche his felde on a knap or highe grounde, and lette the burthen of the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle reste most on the foote men.</p>
            <p>If thou suspect, that a spye of thyn en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemye lurketh in thyne hoste, command, that euery man be in his owne lodgynge by day light, &amp; anon the spy is perceiued.</p>
            <p>Whan thou wottest, that thy counsaylle is discouered to thyn enmies, than it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth the, to chaunge thy purpose.</p>
            <p>Treate thou with many, what oughte to be done, but what thou wylte doo, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close that to fewe, that ar most faithfull, or els kepe it secrete to thy selfe.</p>

Peyne and drede chastyseth souldiors whan they lye styl, in settynge forwarde, hope and mede maketh them better.</p>
            <p>Good capitayns neuer fyght in a pight fielde, excepte they be dryuen thereto by sodeyne happe or great nede.</p>
            <p>It is a gret wise policy, rather to greue thyn enmie with hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with wepon.</p>
            <p>Let not thyne enmie knowe, with what ordinaunce, in what maner wyse, or how thou intendest to assayl him, lest he p<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare ordynance to withstand or distroy thyne.</p>
