            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </p>
               <p>For the first Question, wee lay downe this Conclusion for a Doctrine of Truth; <hi>That singing of Psalmes with a lively voyce, is an holy Duty of Gods Worship now in the dayes of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> When we say, singing with lively voyce, we suppose none will so farre misconstrue us, as to thinke wee exclude singing with the heart; For God is a Spirit: and to worship him with the voyce without the Spirit, were but lip-labour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which (being rested in) is but lost labour (<hi>Isa.</hi> 29.13.) or at most, profiteth but little, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. But this wee say, As wee are to make melody in our hearts, so with our voyces also. In opposition to this, there be some <hi>Anti-psalmists,</hi> who doe not acknowledge any singing at all with the voyce in the New Testament, but onely spirituall songs of joy and comfort of the heart in the word of Christ.</p>
               <p>¶ 1. <hi>Proofe for the Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first proofe for the truth <hi>is taken from the Commandement of the Lord by Paul,</hi> who instructeth and exhorteth the <hi>Ephesians, To speake one to another in Psalmes and Hymnes and spirituall Songs,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.19. And so in <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Teaching and admonishing one another in Psalmes, Hymnes,</hi> &amp;c. which cannot be done without lively voyce. And so in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.15, 16. The Apostle commandeth the Church of <hi>Corinth, that such as sing in the Church, should not onely sing in the Spirit, but with understanding also:</hi> that is, not onely with their own understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (for all that sung with the Spirit did so) but with the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the hearers, that so he that occupied the place of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, might be edified, and say, Amen, at such giving of thankes. Whence it followeth unavoydably, That singing of <hi>Psalmes</hi> is not onely a making of melody to the Lord with inward grace in the heart, but also <hi>with lively and audible voyce,</hi> which is the point in Question.</p>
               <p>

                        </gap>ect.</hi> 1. This place in the <hi>Corinths</hi> maketh nothing to the cause in hand; For these <hi>Corinthian</hi> Psalmes, were not the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> nor sung by the whole Congregation, much lesse in Meeter and Tunes devised by men, as ours be; but they were spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105681:3"/>
songs, immediately inspired and endited by the Holy Ghost, and sung onely by him that received that gift, as the Spirit gave him utterance.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Neither did wee alledge the place, to prove the singing of <hi>Davids</hi> Psalmes, by the whole Congregation in such like Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Tunes as ours be. These poynts doe all of them belong to the other Questions, which follow to bee handled (God willing) <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n their place. But to this purpose we alledge the place, <hi>That sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Psalmes in the New Testament, is to be dispensed in Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Churches, not onely with inward grace in the heart, making melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to the Lord; but also with outward audible lively voyce:</hi> which is the very point in hand, and which this commandment of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle doth clearely demonstrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>2. <hi>Object.</hi> The Apostle to the <hi>Ephesians</hi> and <hi>Colossians,</hi> doth not say, Sing one to another in <hi>Psalmes,</hi> but speake or preach one to another; or in other word<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Teach and admonish one another,</hi> The <hi>Psalmes</hi> dwelling in their hearts, they were to dispense them in a way of Teaching and Admonishing. But as for singing hee maketh no mention of that, untill he came to teach them the manner of dispensing the words of Christ unto God in the end of the verse. And then indeed hee teacheth them to sing in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, making melody with grace in the heart unto God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Such as tremble at the word (as the framer of this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection professeth himselfe to doe,) they should rather bow their <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>udgements and practise to Scripture and language, then bow the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ence of Scripture to their owne conceptions against the language of Scripture. It is one thing, to <hi>speake one to another in Psalmes, and Hymnes, and spirituall songs,</hi> as is done in singing, another thing to preach and teach one another, out of Psalmes, and Hymnes, and spirituall Songs. It is true, they were to <hi>Teach and admonish one another</hi> out of the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> and the scope of <hi>Paul</hi> will reach that. But if <hi>Paul</hi> had only meant that, to wit, That they should teach and preach one to another out of the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> he would not have said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Speake yee one to another in <hi>Psalmes</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or with <hi>Psalmes:</hi> but out of the <hi>Psalmes</hi> or from the <hi>Psalmes</hi>; for such is the language of the Holy Ghost in expressing such a duty. <hi>Paul</hi> is said to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and testified, and perswaded the <hi>Jewes</hi> out of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and out of the Prophets, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.23. So <hi>Philip</hi> is said to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105681:4"/>
begin to Preach Jesus to the Eunuch, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, from that Scripture in <hi>Isaiah,</hi> or at that Scripture, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.35. He did not Preach Jesus to him in speaking that Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> If that speaking of the <hi>Ephesians</hi> one to another in <hi>Psalmes,</hi> did not hold forth their expounding and preaching in <hi>Psalmes</hi> one to another, but onely the bare reading or singing the letter of the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> This were such a service wherein there in nothing of Christ held forth externally. I speake not of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> (which is full of Christ, as other Scriptures:) but of the outward manner of dispensing it. There is nothing held forth in the singing of it after the usuall manner, but what nature and art may attaine unto. There is no exercise of any spirituall gift held forth in it, as is in all other administrations, which Christ hath ordained.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <q>2. Besides, as such a singing is not a gift of Christ, so neither doth it tend to the glory of Christ. The Church not edified by it: else a Pagan singing with us, might edifie the Church.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <q>3. From both these, it appeareth, That such singing of <hi>Psalmes</hi> tendeth to the dishonour of Christ: seeing it holdeth forth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally no more, then what a carnall man (a man out of Christ) yea a Pagan might expresse.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Singing of Psalmes holdeth forth as much of Christ externally, as reading of the Word, or as the hearing of it read or preached, or as the falling downe upon our knees in prayer, and saying, <hi>Amen,</hi> in the end of it.

and voyce is a morall worship, such as is written in the hearts of all men by nature: As to pray in distresse, so when we are mercy, and have cause of solemne thankesgiving unto God, then to sing Psalmes, which the Holy Ghost by the Apostle <hi>James</hi> approveth and sanctifieth, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.13. Or suppose singing with Instruments were not typicall, but onely an externall solemnitie of worship, fitted to the solace of the outward sences of children under age, (such as the <hi>Israelites</hi> were under the Old Testament, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1, 2, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.) yet now in the growne age of the heires of the New Testament, such externall pompous solemnities are ceased, and no externall worship reserved, but such as holdeth forth simplicitie, and gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; nor is any voyce now to be heard in the Church of Christ, but such as is significant and edifying by signification, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.10, 11, 26.) which the voyce of Instruments is not.</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 4. It is an honour to Christ, and to his grace, not onely when we hold forth spirituall gifts, but also when wee performe Christian duties. And duties performed in Faith (without which prayer it selfe is not accepted) they goe not without a spirituall blessing, though Nature and Art might performe the same for the outward worke. The Trayling of the weapons of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and their Military March, both in silence and shouting, about the walls of <hi>Jericho,</hi> was no greater worke externally, then carnall men and Pagans might have performed as well as <hi>Israelites</hi>; but this being done by <hi>Israelites</hi> in faith and obedience to Gods command, it was mightie through God to cast downe the high and strong walls of <hi>Jericho,</hi> Josh. 6.13.14, 15, 16, 20. And the Apostle look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at this and the like Precedents, setteth forth Faith as that which is prevalent and effectuall in both Testaments, howsoever the worke or worship be externall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

In like manner is it with the reading of the Word, and the hearing of it, as also the silent joyning in Prayer, and concluding it with <hi>Amen,</hi> though all these be such duties as Nature and Art may performe the outward worke of them: yet when the people of God doe performe the same in the faith of Christ, and in the obedience of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, they find a gracious blessing of God. Yea carnall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane persons and Pagans, though they cannot expect the like blessing from their empty outside performances; yet they sometimes taste more sweetnesse and enlargement therein, then flesh and bloud

                  </gap> is more probable, then any reason can wave, that Christ and his Disciples did shut up the Lords Supper with singing one of their Hebrew Psalmes, as the <hi>Jewes</hi> were wont to shut up their Celebration of the Passeover (as their own Records tell us) with singing <hi>Psalme</hi> 111. with the five other Psalmes next following together. But all that I now intend, is to shew that Christ and his Disciples sang together, and therefore with the voyce as well as the heart.</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. True: but then one at least speaketh with an audible and lively voyce, though the rest doe not.

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. If the Disciples did not joyne in singing that Hymne, but onely by silent consent, they might as well be said. To have taken the bread, and blessed it, and broken it, and distributed it, (and so the wine;) for all this Christ did with their silent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.

Had they so done, the Prisoners that heard them might have sung for the outward dispensation such a song of praise to God, as well as they.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Wee doe not alledge this Example of theirs (as hath been often said in like case before) to prove they sang any <hi>Psalme</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> though it stand with good reason, that they joyning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in singing, did rather sing a Psalme (or Hymne) knowne to them both, then any new Song devised by either of them; But what Psalmes are to be sung is another Question, which (by the helpe of Christ) wee shall speake to in the sequell. Neither doe we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their Example to prove, they sang in a devised Meeter or Tune. For themselves being Hebrewes, it is likely they sang the Hebrew Songs in the tunes of the Sanctuary, but that also is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Question, of which we are to speake in his place, when wee come to it. All that we gather from this place now, is, no more then the words doe plainly hold forth, that they sung an Hymne to God, not onely with inward melody of grace in their hearts, but also with outward melody of the voyce; for else the Prisoners could not have heard them.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Against this; it is of no force to object (as some doe) that if they had sung any of the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Asaph</hi> with an audible voyce, then the other Prisoners also might have joyned with them, and have worshipped (externally at least) as well as they.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For the answer is plaine and ready: First, the Prison was in <hi>Philippi,</hi> a City of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> consisting partly of a Colony of the <hi>Romans,</hi> partly of the <hi>Grecians:</hi> no <hi>Jewes</hi> at all are mentioned to be Inhabitants there, much lesse Prisoners at that time. And for Pagans to joyne in singing Hebrew Songs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Hebrew verses and tunes, it seemeth to be farre beyond either their skill, or devotion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, suppose the Prisoners had been <hi>Jewes</hi> (of which there is to hint at all in the Text<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) and suppose those Prisoners hearing the melody of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> and knowing the Song, had joyned in the outward singing of it, and that without any grace in their hearts (none of all which things appeare in the story) yet suppose
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105681:7"/>
all this; shall the unbeliefe of those <hi>Jewes</hi> make the holy worship of these Apostles, and their faith to God, or the faith of God to them, of none effect? <hi>Paul</hi> renounceth and abhorreth such carnall reasonings, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.3.</p>

If you meane onely the gracious rejoycing of the heart, that indeed, though it be requisite to avoyd hypocrisie, yet it is not compleate to reach the full extent of the dutie, the dutie of making a <hi>joyfull noyse with Psalmes.</hi> Our chiefe Singer (of whom you speake,) when he set the Lord, and his own death and resurrection before his, face, (which he was to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe for our sakes) he was not onely glad in his heart, but his glory
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105681:8"/>
also (that is, his tongue) rejoyced in <hi>singing a Psalme</hi> at his last Supper, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.8, 9. with <hi>Math.</hi> 26.30. And therefore it will be a discord from the practise of our chiefe Singer, and so a disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to him, if our hearts sing with joy, but our glory (to wit, our tongues) be mute with silence. Say not then, as you doe;</p>
               <p>
                  <q>We are no more bound to make a loud noyse with our voyces, then the trees are to clap their hands, (as <hi>Isaiah</hi> prophecieth) or then the new Converts were to come with externall singing of Psalmes <hi>Isai.</hi> 51.11.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For in so saying, you will not avoyde the authoritie of the Commandement, nor the necessitie of that dutie of singing. For when God redeemed his people out of the Captivitie of <hi>Babel,</hi> not onely their hearts (the hearts of them who were returning to <hi>Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>) were filled with rejoycing, but even their tongues also with singing, <hi>Psal.</hi> 126.1, 2. And though the Trees cannot be said in proper speech to clap their hands, (for they have no hands to clap) yet common sense will easily tell you, that there is a Mataphor ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in clapping of hands, or in the trees. If trees be taken proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then clapping of hands is put (by a Metaphor) for the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing fruitfulnesse of the trees of the field, which (by the blessing of God) is wont to follow the prosperitie of the Church, in such aboundance, that their boughes and branches shall clap and dash themselves and their fruite one upon another, whereby (as by hands) they reach forth refreshing and food to the children of the Church. But if Trees be put by a Metaphor for trees of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, (as the Saints are so called, <hi>Isa.</hi> 61, 3.) then they shall <hi>clap their hands, and shout for joy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and sing aloud,</hi> (expressing externall signes of comfort) <hi>to behold and consider the wonderfull goodnesse of the Lord,</hi> to themselves and their brethren. And so in the same verse, <hi>Isai.</hi> 55.12. when the <hi>Mountaines and hills</hi> are said to break forth before the Saints <hi>into singing,</hi> if there be not a Metaphor in <hi>singing</hi> then <hi>Mountaines and hills</hi> are put (by a Metaphor) for Princes and men of high degree, (as <hi>Psal.</hi> 72.3.) which shall give example to others in holy rejoycing, and particularly in singing praises to the Lord. So that these Texts in <hi>Isaiah,</hi> which you thought might excuse you from singing with the voyce, (which <hi>David</hi> exhorted to be done with a loud voyce) they will not exempt you at all from this duty, but rather bind you the stronger to it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105681:9"/>
looke as when <hi>David</hi> saith; <hi>I cryed to the Lord with my voyce, (Psal.</hi> 3, 4. &amp; 77.1.) a man shall detract from his meaning, that shall say, he cryed onely to God with his heart: So when <hi>David</hi> exhorteth the Gentile Churches <hi>to make a joyfull noyse unto God with Psalmes</hi>; you doe detract in like sort from his meaning, when you make his meaning to be, not that wee should sing unto God with our voyces, but that we should onely make melody to him, with grace in our hearts. Such detracting from the Word is alike disallowed, and accursed of God, as is adding to the Word.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. Singing of Psalmes with the voyce, is but a type of singing Psalmes with grace in the heart.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. No Scripture speaketh of it as a type: nor doth any evidence of reason so declare it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You might as well say, that Praying with the voyce was a type of praying with the heart, and so is now abolished.</p>
               <p n="3">3, If singing of Psalmes with a loud noyse, had been a typicall worship, <hi>David</hi> would not have exhorted us to the practise of it on the Lords day of the New Testament, <hi>Psal.</hi> 95.1, 2.7.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Christ and his Apostles would not have used it in the Lords Supper, which is a feast of the New Testament, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.30. nor would <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> have used it <hi>in prison</hi> among the Gentiles, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.25.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The light of Nature, which is never wont to teach us types and shadows, doth as well teach us to praise God in singing with our tongues, in times of our rejoycing, as to cry to God with our voyces in times of our distresses.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He second Question about singing of Psalmes, <hi>concerneth the matter of the Psalmes to be sung</hi>; for there be some who doe not scruple singing with the voyce (as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer sort did) but singing of the Psalmes of <hi>David</hi> now in these dayes of the <hi>New Testament.</hi> As conceiving <hi>Davids</hi> Psalmes
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105681:9"/>
were penned for Temple worship, during the Paedagogy of the old Testament. But now in the dayes of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> when God hath promised to powre out his Spirit upon all flesh, now the whole worship of God should be carried on, not by set formes of <hi>Psalmes,</hi> (no more then by set formes of Prayer) b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t by personall spirituall gifts, whereby some one or other of the members of the Church, having received a <hi>Psalme</hi> by the enditement of the Spirit, he singeth it openly in the publique Assembly of the Church, and the rest of the Brethren say Amen to it in the close.</p>
               <p>But touching the persons of those who should sing it pertaineth to the third Question. This second Question chiefly concerneth the matter to be sung, whether the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> or some Psalme or Hymne, endited by the personall gift of this or that member of the Church. Wherein we hold and beleeve;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That not onely the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> but any other spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Songs recorded in Scripture, may lawfully be sung in Christian Churches, as the song of <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Asaph, Heman</hi> and <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>than, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah, Habacuck</hi> and <hi>Zachary, Hannah</hi> and <hi>Debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah, Mary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wee grant also, that any private Christian, who hath a gift to frame a spirituall Song, may both frame it, and sing it private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for his own private comfort, and remembrance of some speciall benefit, or deliverance: Nor doe we forbid the private use of an Instrument of Musick therewithall; So that attention to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, doe not divert the heart from attention to the matter of the Song.</p>
               <p>Neither doe we deny, but that in the publique thankesgivings of the Church, if the Lord should furnish any of the members of the Church with a Spirituall gift to compose a <hi>Psalme</hi> upon any speciall occasion, hee may lawfully be allowed to sing it before the Church, and the rest hearing it, and approving it, may goe along with him in Spirit, and say Amen to it. <hi>When Christ ascended up on high,</hi> to sit upon his throne of glory, looke as Princes are wont to doe in the day of their Coronation, [<hi>Spargere Missilia &amp; Donaria</hi>] so did he powre out his gifts abundantly on all sorts, gifts of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Healing, Tongues, <hi>Psalmes.</hi> And the Churches were willing, when they saw such speciall gifts of the Spirit powred out to make use of them, as occasion served. Whence it was, that sundry of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105681:10"/>
members of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> as they had received a gift of Psalmes and tongues from the Lord Jesus, so they had allowance from the Church <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o imploy their gifts to the publique edification of the Church. But as such gifts now are not ordinarily bestowed, (which were at first given chiefly for admiration and conviction of Infidels, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.22.) so we would not call upon men now, to preferre their ordinary common gift, as more fit for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique edifying of the Church, before the extraordinary gifts of the holy men of God in Scripture, who by the Spirit were guided to prepare spirituall songs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> suitable to all the conditions and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and temptations of the Church and people of God in all ages. So then the Question is, whether the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Asaph,</hi> and such other Hymnes and spirituall Songs endited by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and recorded in Scripture, be appointed by God, to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily sung in Christian Churches, or whether laying aside Scripture-Songs, we are to sing onely such spirituall Songs, as shall be endited by the personall (but ordinary) gifts of any ordinary Officer or member of the Church? The former wee hold to be the Truth, others the latter.</p>
               <p>The Reasons of our Faith and Practise, are these:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Taken from the Commandement, or exhortation of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Be you filled with the Spirit</hi> (saith he) <hi>speaking to your selves</hi> (that is, one to another) <hi>in Psalmes and Hymnes and spiritual Songs, singing and making melody in your harts to the Lord.</hi> To the like purpose is his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement and exhortation to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lossians</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chap. 3. ver. 16. <hi>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdome, teaching and admonishing one another, in Psalmes and Hymnes and spirituall Songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</hi> In both which places, as the Apostle exhorteth us to sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so he instructeth us what the matter of our Song should be, to wit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Psalmes, Hymnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and spirituall Songs</hi>; Now those three be the very Titles of the Songs of <hi>David,</hi> as they are delivered to us by the Holy Ghost himselfe: some of them are called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is <hi>Psalmes</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> some <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ongs.</hi> Now what reason can be given why the Apostle should direct us in our singing to the very titles of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> Psalmes, if it were not his meaning that we should sing them? Yea, either we must exclude the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> from the name
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105681:10"/>
of <hi>Psalmes, and Hymnes, and spirituall Songs</hi>; or else we must be forced to acknowledge, that we are exhorted to sing them, as well as any other.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore we proceed to any further Reasons of the point, let us first (by the helpe of Christ) cleare the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against this. The Objections are many, and some of them seeme more weighty, and some more light: let us unpartially and evenly (by the Lords guidance) weigh them all in the Ballance of the Sanctuary.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1. If <hi>Paul</hi> had meant <hi>Davids Psalmes,</hi> or Scripture-<hi>songs,</hi> it had been an easie matter to have named <hi>Davids Psalmes,</hi> or Scripture-<hi>songs,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> himselfe named his <hi>songs,</hi> the <hi>Psalmes or Songs of David,</hi> when he delivered them to the chiefe Musitian, and to his company to be sung.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It may as justly be said, if <hi>Paul</hi> had meant to exclude <hi>Davids Psalmes,</hi> or Scripture-<hi>songs,</hi> it had been as easie to have excluded them by name, and to have limited them onely to such <hi>Psalmes</hi> and <hi>Songs,</hi> as the Spirit should suggest unto their hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. The Apostle expresly nameth <hi>Psalmes, and Hymnes, and spirituall Songs,</hi> and they three are the very expresse Titles of the <hi>Psalmes</hi> in the Psalme-Booke. Now why he should direct them to the very Titles of <hi>Davids Psalmes</hi> &amp; yet not meane the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> that beare those Titles, can a good conscience give a good reason for it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. When <hi>David</hi> gave his <hi>Psalmes and Songs</hi> to the Musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians in <hi>Israel,</hi> it was meete he should set his name to them, or by some other marke make it appeare, that the <hi>Psalmes</hi> were inspired and delivered by a Prophet of God. But after the Book of <hi>Psalmes</hi> was generally knowne and received to be of divine inspiration, (as other Oracles of God) the <hi>Psalmes</hi> are as usually alledged in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> without the name of <hi>David,</hi> as with it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24 44. <hi>Asts</hi> 13.33.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. The <hi>Psalmes</hi> here committed to the spirituall Singers
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105681:11"/>
to be sung, are the words of Christ, which are to dwell richly in us, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. But the <hi>Psalmes</hi> dedicated to the sonnes of <hi>Corah,</hi> were the words of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Asaph.</hi> And so the Holy Ghost calleth them. Not but that the words spoken by the mouth of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Asaph,</hi> where the words of Christ, but that the words which are to be the spirituall songs of the Saints, wherein they are to teach one another, and to sing unto God, they are words spoken to the heart, by the voyce of the Spirit of Christ. Besides, the word of Christ, is properly the Gospel, by way of eminency, in way of opposition to the Law, given by <hi>Moses.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The words of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Asaph,</hi> as they were the words of Chtist in the mouth of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Asaph</hi>: so they were the words of Christ also in the mouths of the sonnes of <hi>Corah,</hi> or any other Singers in the Temple. If any of them did not sing them with the Spirit of Christ as well as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Asaph</hi> spake, and penned them by the Spirit of Christ, it was a sinfull defect in them, but not in the word it selfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor in the godly Singers of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (such as <hi>Heman,</hi> and <hi>Jeduthun,</hi> and others) who were spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, and holy men, and sang them with melody in their hearts, as well as in their voyces. And it will be alike sinfull defect in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> in such as sing the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> to sing them without some measure of the Spirit of <hi>David.</hi> For the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly requireth, that wee should sing with grace in our hearts. But if the words of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Asaph,</hi> be the words of Christ, and be sung of the Church, with grace in the heart, wee demand whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this act of the Church be not an act of Faith, and of the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deince of Faith to the word of Christ, in that Text of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. It is an unsafe and unsavoury expression, to speake of the words of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Asaph,</hi> as if they were onely the words of Christ in the mouths of spirituall Singers. For if they were not the words of Christ in the mouths of carnall Singers also, then the holy Scriptures were not the word of Christ, if they be read by a carnall reader. So the unbeliefe of man sh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll make the faith of God of none effect; yea the word of God, not to be the word of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 3. Let it be considered in the feare of God, whether the words of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Asaph,</hi> sung with grace in the heart unto God,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105681:11"/>
be not as truly and properly (in the Apostles sence) the word of Christ, as any Song endited by the private gift of any Saint of God now living? If so, then the Apostle encourageth us to sing the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Asaph</hi> with their Spirit: If not, then there be Christians now, that are carried by a more infallible Spirit, then the Prophets were in old time. And yet <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of the Saints now, as led by the Spirt of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14. But <hi>Peter</hi> speaketh of the Prophets then, as carried (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) by the Holy Ghost, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. Which putteth this difference, that such as are led by the Spirit may erre; but such as are carried by the Spirit, are carried and lifted above themselves by the Holy Ghost, and cannot erre: and so was <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Asaph.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Though the words of Christ be the Gospel, yet the words of <hi>David</hi> are not to be shut out of the Gospel; for the Gospel was preached to <hi>Israel,</hi> when <hi>David</hi> and the other Prophets were preached, yea and some parts of <hi>Moses</hi> also, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.46.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 3. But if the Apostle had intended to commend to the Churches the singing of the <hi>Psalmes and Hymnes and spirituall Songs</hi> of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Asaph,</hi> what need was there for him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort either the <hi>Ephesians to be filled with the Spirit,</hi> or the <hi>Colos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians, to have the word of Christ dwell richly in them,</hi> for such a service? For any small measure of the Spirit, and of the Word, will suffice to sing the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Asaph,</hi> in their words, and in the meeter and tunes accustomed. But to invent new spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Songs, fit to teach and admonish the Church, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a full measure of the Spirit, and a rich treasure of the word to dwell in us. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> biddeth the <hi>Ephesians, to be filled with the Spirit,</hi> in singing the spirituall songs of the New Testament, as drunkards are filled with wine, and in the strength and spirits of their wine, invent and sing their wanton Sonnets.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. <hi>Paul</hi> did exhort them <hi>to be filled with the Spirit,</hi> as drunkards be with wine, not that they might invent, and sing spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Songs, as drunkards doe wanton Sonnets; for neither doe drunkards filled with wine, usually invent Sonnets, but sing such as they learned before, when they were sober; nor doth the Apostle speake of inventing Songs at all, either wanton Songs by drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, or spirituall Songs by the faithfull; but onely to be filled with the Spirit, as drunkards be with wine, that so they might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105681:12"/>
the riotous and excessive mirth of Drunkards, and employ and improve their holy mirth and joy, to the singing <hi>Psalmes and Hymnes and spirituall Songs,</hi> for their own mutuall edification and consolation, and for holy thankesgiving and praise unto the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. Though it doe not require such a full measure <hi>of the Spirit,</hi> nor rich portion of the Word <hi>dwelling in us,</hi> to sing a <hi>Psalme</hi> invented and penned to our hands: yet a full and rich mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Word and Spirit will be needfull to performe all those duties, which the Apostle in those Texts calleth for. For the Apostle calleth to the improvement, as of the whole word of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto the teaching and admonishing of one another, so of the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> not onely unto those two heads, but also besides those, unto a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther third end, to wit, unto the singing of them unto Gods praise. Now to be able to improve the whole word of God to these two spirituall ends, and the <hi>Psalmes</hi> to all those three spirituall ends doth require a full and rich measure both of Spirit and Word to dwell in us.</p>
               <p>

It will require a full and rich measure both of <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit to dwell in us,</hi> to direct and appoint a fit <hi>Psalme,</hi> (out of the Booke of <hi>Psalmes</hi>) suitable to the present occasions of singing to Gods praise, and to the instruction and admonition of the Church, according to the present estate of their affections, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, their consolation, or conversation in hand.</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 4. It will require a fuller and richer measure <hi>of the Word and Spirit to dwell in us,</hi> then a carnall heart would imagine even to utter a Song with such grace in the heart, as might make melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to the Lord; It requires a good measure of the indwelling Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and word of God to pray in the Spirit; but much more to sing in the Spirit, wherein our senses delighted with the melody are apt to steale away our hearts from spirituall fervency. <hi>Deborah</hi> found her heart dull to be awakened, so much as to utter the song, which shee had prepared by the Spirit for her and <hi>Barak</hi> to sing together, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Awake, Awake,</hi> (saith shee) <hi>Awake, Awake Deborah, utter a song,</hi> that fourefold ingemination, <hi>Awake, Awake, Awake, Awake, utter a song,</hi> argueth in the best of Gods servants, a deepe drowsinesse of spirit, when wee should come to utter a spirituall Song spiritually: like as that fourfold ingemination to the Church

The Apostle calleth the whole word of Christ dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in us, <hi>Psalmes and Hymnes and spirituall Songs,</hi> neither doth he limit us to one Prophet more then to another, unlesse you will say, that the words of Christ in the Gospel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied by the rest of the Prophets, were not spirituall songs; But the Apostle calleth them all <hi>Psalmes and Hymnes and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Songs,</hi> as well as <hi>Davids,</hi> if they <hi>dwell in the heart.</hi> For the words of Christ there, (to wit, in the heart) are songs for the Spirit, or else they are no songs to any man. Therefore as yet, to sing the Prophecies of <hi>David</hi> after our common manner, is no worship commanded or taught us in holy Writ.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It is a groundlesse Assertion to say, that <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the whole word of God dwelling in us, <hi>Psalmes and Hymnes and spirituall Songs.</hi> For why then should the Holy Ghost give that style and Title of <hi>Psalmes and Hymnes and spirituall Songs</hi> onely to the Booke of <hi>Psalmes,</hi> and to none else of all of the Bookes of the Prophets or Apostles. Againe, if <hi>Paul</hi> called the words of all the Prophets, <hi>Psalmes and Hymnes and spirituall Songs,</hi> why then did not the Prophets in their own language pen them with musicall accents, as well as the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Asaph?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides, if the words of all the Prophets were spirituall Songs, why then did the Prophets themselves finde the Bookes of their own Prophecies bitter in their bellies? <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.10. There be many words of the Prophets, that are more fit matter for humiliation and mourning before the Lord, then fit to be sung <hi>as spirituall songs</hi>

                  </gap>oycing (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all the Doctrines and promises of Grace be) yet what war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant have wee to sing them, as in some Cathedrall Churches and Colledges, the Bible-Clerks doe sing their Chapters out of the old and New Testament?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. Whether the words of Christ in the Gospel, or in the Prophets, be <hi>spirituall Songs</hi> or no, yet if the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David</hi> be also the words of Christ, if they likewise <hi>dwell in our hearts,</hi> and if they be <hi>spirituall Songs</hi> too, then it will unavoydably follow,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105681:13"/>
That the same word of the Apostle that commandeth us to <hi>sing Psalmes and Hymnes and spirituall Songs,</hi> commandeth us also to sing the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Asaph</hi> unto the Lord, unlesse you will say that the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Asaph,</hi> (though <hi>dwelling in the heart,</hi>) are neither <hi>Psalmes,</hi> nor <hi>Hymnes,</hi> nor <hi>spirituall Songs,</hi> howsoever the Holy Ghost entitle them by such names.
<q>How then can you say, that to sing rhe Prophecies of <hi>David,</hi> doth not yet appeare to be a worship of God commanded or taught in holy writ?</q> As for our common manner of singing of them, wee shall have occasion to speake to that hereafter.</p>

                     <hi>Object.</hi> 5. <hi>Davids Psalmes</hi> considered, not as Scriptures divinely inspired, but as spirituall Songs seeme to be appropriated to the Temple-worship. 1. Because they are appointed to be sung by proper Officers and Musicall Instruments, belonging to the Temple, as appeareth by the Titles of severall <hi>Psalmes.</hi> 2. Because neither Christ, nor the Apostles in their writings used them at all, otherwise then as the other writings of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, for instruction and illustration, teaching us how to use the same. Those Psalmes therefore as Songs, being proper to that service of the Temple, are abolished with the Temple worship.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Both these Reasons are too slender to confine <hi>Davids Psalmes</hi> to Temple-worship. For 1. Though some of <hi>Davids Psalmes</hi> were appointed to be sung by the Officers and Musicall Instruments of the Temple, yet not above one part of three, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the length of the 119. <hi>Psalme.</hi> There be an hundred and fiftie Psalmes in all, and of all these not above 57. are appointed to be sung by the Officers and Instruments of the Temple: and <hi>Psalme</hi> 119. is none of them; so that two parts of three are free from any expresse reference to the Temple.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The matter of some <hi>Psalmes</hi> doth evidently argue, they were not appointed to be sung alwayes in the Temple; or at least did agree more properly to other times then those, wherein the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple stood. The 74<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Psalme</hi> (which was a <hi>Psalme</hi> of <hi>Asaph,</hi> but joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David</hi>) complained that the enemies had sent Gods Sanctuary into the fire, (as the Hebrew words be) and had defiled by casting downe the dwelling place of hir Name to the ground, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. The 44<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Psalme,</hi> though it was committed to the sonnes of <hi>Corah,</hi> yet surely it was chiefly intended (as <hi>Paul</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105681:13"/>
part of it) to the times of the New Testament; For I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it could never be verified of any times of the Jewish Temple, (first, or second) that ever God gave up the people of <hi>Israel</hi> as sheepe for meate, to be killed all the day, to be appointed for the slaughter to be sore broken in the place of Dragons, and covered with the shadow of death, when as yet though all this evill was come upon them, they had not forgotten their God, nor dealt falsly in his Covenant; nor their hearts turned backe, nor their steps de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined from his way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>ver.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>7. to 23. <hi>Paul</hi> indeed acknowledgeth this very word to be accomplished in the Saints of the Primitive Churches in the Apostles times, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.36.) but where shall wee finde the like innocency, with the like calamitie met together in the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> whilest the Temple was standing? And is it credible, the <hi>Psalme</hi> was confined to be sung in the Temple, where they could not sing it, but with a sad reproofe to themselves for their discord in practise, and yet forbidden to be sung in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the New Testament, where (in some ages at least) they might sing it, both with heart, and voyce, and practise, all of them keeping holy concent and harmony together?</p>
               <p n="3">3. It appeareth by the Titles of such Psalmes as are directed to the Officers and Instruments of the Temple-Musick, That there was something typicall or rudimentall in the manner of singing some of the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Asaph</hi> in the Temple-worship. But this doth no more argue, that the whole service of God in sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Davids</hi> Psalmes was typicall or rudimentall, then it will argue prayer to be a typicall and Temple worship, because prayer in the Temple was offered with Incense, and so with the Temple and with the Incense to be abolished. He that will make the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David</hi> (as they are songs) to be types of the spirituall songs of the New Testament, and therefore now the singing of them to be abolished. He might as well say (with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Smith</hi>) that the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the Scriptures of the old Testament, were typicall, (typing out the Law written in our hear<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s) and so abolish all reading of the holy Scriptures now in the dayes of the <hi>New Testament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. As it hath been shewed above, that singing of <hi>Psalmes</hi> with lively voyce, is not a ceremoniall but a morall dutie, and so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth now in the dayes of the <hi>New Testament</hi>; so it may be as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said, that the singing of <hi>Davids</hi> Psalmes, and other Scripture-songs, <pb n="24" facs="tcp:105681:14"/>
is in like sort not a ceremoniall but a morall dutie; and so of like continuance in the New Testament. The <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Asaph,</hi> and the rest, are as full of holy and lively, spirituall, and evangelicall meditations, and affections, Instruments, prayers, and praises, as any that we can expect to be endited by any Officer or member of the Christian Churches now. Yea it is to be feared that the <hi>Psalmes</hi> compiled by the devoutest Christians now, would fall short of those of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Asaph,</hi> in spirit and life. How then can we make the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Asaph</hi> ceremoniall types of the spirituall songs of the faithfull in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> when as types are wont to be more carnall, and worldly, and literall, and lesse spirituall and lively, then the antitypes? But here the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>types are lesse spirituall and lively then the types.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <q>5. As for that other Reason taken from the practise of Christ, and his Apostles, who in their writings never used the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David</hi> for spirituall songs as the writings of <hi>Moses</hi> &amp; other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets for instruction and illustration; this is of as small force as the former.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For 1. Writings are not a place or season for the use of <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall songs. Psalmes</hi> are to be used for songs in Church Assemblies, and private Soliloques and Conferences, not in Writings: And yet so farre as <hi>Psalmes</hi> may be used for <hi>songs</hi> in writing, <hi>Paul</hi> so used them in his Epistles written to the <hi>Ephesians</hi> and <hi>Colossians,</hi> where he <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not credible, that Christ never used the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> and <hi>Asaph</hi> for <hi>spirituall Songs.</hi> For the use of those <hi>Psalmes</hi> for <hi>Songs,</hi> was doubtlesse a part of Gods worship whilest the Temple stood. And if Christ had neglected any part of that worship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was then in force, how then did himselfe say, <hi>That it became him to fulfill all righteousnesse?</hi> Mat. 3.15.</p>
               <p>Besides, many things Jesus did and said (and so did the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles) which are not written in the Gospel nor Acts nor Epistles, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.25. And yet this is said, that he with his Disciples sung
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105681:14"/>
an Hymne, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.30. And Hymnes is the generall title for the whole Booke of <hi>Psalmes</hi>; For though it be translated, <hi>The Booke of Psalmes,</hi> yet every one that knoweth that language, knoweth the word is, <hi>The Booke of Hymnes:</hi> So that looke, as when in ordinary speech we say, They sung a <hi>Psalme,</hi> we meane one of the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Asaph,</hi> (unlesse some other be named) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such are wont to be sung in ordinary use; So when the Evangelists say, Christ and his Disciples sung an Hymne, the people of God would not easily understand any other but one or more of <hi>Davids Hymnes,</hi> because such were wont to be the ordinary songs used in the worship of God. And surely if Christ and his Disciples had sung any other Hymne, then one of these <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Asaph,</hi> which were wont to be sung in their Temples and Synag<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The like may be said of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> who are recorded (<hi>Acts</hi> 16.25.) to have <hi>sung an Hymne</hi> to God, (for so is the word;) where common understanding would take it for one or more of the Hymnes of <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Asaph,</hi> and not any other new invented spirituall song, unlesse some hint in the Text might carry us from the ordinary meaning and use of the word amongst the people of God.</p>

the Lambe</hi> is expresly fetched from severall words of praise to the Lambe, in severall <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David</hi>; One of these two things (if not both) will from hence justly be deduced.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Either this, That any of those <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David</hi> may be sung to the praise of the <hi>Lambe,</hi> out of which those words of praise are fetched (as when the people of God are said to have praised God with such a word in a <hi>Psalme,</hi> it is meant they sung the whole <hi>Psalme</hi>; as, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.13. &amp; 20.21. <hi>Ezra.</hi> 3.11.) all of them point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Psalme</hi> 136.</p>
               <p>Or else secondly, That it may be lawfull upon speciall and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary occasions, to compile a <hi>spirituall Song</hi> out of <hi>Davids</hi> words of praise dispersed in severall <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> and other Psalmists in Scripture, and to sing them, composed together as a <hi>Psalme</hi> of praise unto the Lord. And both these willingly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit: For these are still the divine Meditations, and spirituall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of the holy men of God in Scripture, which God hath prepared for the setting forth of his own glory.</p>

                     <hi>Object.</hi> 7. As the Apostle writing to <hi>Timothy</hi> about Prayer in generall, and prescribing no forme of prayer, it is therefore justly argued, that we are to use no set formes of Prayer at all: So the same Apostle exhorting the Churches to sing, and not prescribing any formes of <hi>Psalmes,</hi> hence it followeth, that he alloweth not the singing of <hi>Davids Psalmes.</hi> And whatsoever Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, strike against stinted formes of Prayer, strike against all formes of <hi>Psalmes</hi> also, as stinting and quenching the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It is not true, that the Apostle exhorting to Sing, doth not prescribe any formes of <hi>Psalmes.</hi> For in the same Texts where he doth exhort the Churches and people of God to <hi>sing,</hi> he doth direct them also to <hi>sing Psalmes and Hymnes and spirituall Songs:</hi> which are the expresse titles of the very formes of <hi>Psalmes</hi> endited by <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Asaph</hi> as hath been shewed above. Neither can it be truly said, that he alloweth not the <hi>singing</hi> of <hi>Davids Psalmes.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it might be truly said, that the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> are neither <hi>Psalmes,</hi> nor <hi>Hymnes,</hi> nor <hi>spirituall Songs.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. The Scripture putteth a manifest difference between these two, set formes of <hi>Prayer,</hi> and set formes of <hi>Psalmes</hi>; also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween set formes devised and prescribed by men, and set formes
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105681:17"/>
appointed by God. Set formes of Prayer the Lord did never ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily prescribe unto his people, neither in the <hi>old Testament,</hi> nor in the <hi>New</hi>: but set formes of <hi>Psalmes</hi> no man doubteth, were ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily prescribed in the <hi>old Testament,</hi> and wee suppose in the <hi>New</hi> also, in the Texts alledged.</p>
               <p>Againe, set formes devised and appointed by men, I will not deny to be justly rejected by the true meaning of the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement: but God that forbad us to make to our selves any Images or imaginations and inventions for worship, did never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid himselfe to devise and appoint for us what forme of worship himselfe pleased, either in the <hi>old Testament,</hi> or in the <hi>New.</hi> And therefore what ever Arguments strike against set formes of Prayer invented and prescribed by men, there is none of them strike a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst set formes of <hi>Psalmes</hi> appointed by God. Neither can it with any colour be pretended, that the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David</hi> being devised and appointed by the Holy Ghost himselfe, should either stint or quench the Spirit, unlesse it might be thought, that Gods own Ordinance to convey, and quicken, and enlarge the Spirit, should become an impediment and restraint to the Spirit.</p>

The edification of the Church and body of Christ under the <hi>New Testament,</hi> ought to be carried on by the person<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and proper gifts of Gods Spirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.7, 8.11, 16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10, 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.4.6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. But in singing of <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> there is no more personall gift manifested, then there is in reading a stinted forme of Prayer.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> These Scriptures prove that God hath given the gifts of the Spirit for the edification of his Church: and that they who have received the gifts of the Spirit, should employ them to the edification of the Church. And some of those Scriptures prove also, that they who haue received any gifts, though outward gifts of wealth and honour, should improve and employ them to the good of the Church. But none of them prove, that all the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church should be carried on by the personall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per gifts of the present members of the Church. For then the Church should not be edified now in these dayes by the gifts of the pen-men of Scripture, whether Apostles, Prophets, or Evangelists, which is expresly repugnant to some of the Scriptures alledged by you. For in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8. to 13. and in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. it is expresly said,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105681:17"/>
that <hi>God gave Apostles, Prophets, and Evangelists, for the edifying of the Church, till the whole body of Christ be perfected at the day of his comming.</hi> And least you should dreame of new Apostles to be raised up in every age, the Holy Ghost telleth us, the Church of the <hi>Jewes</hi> at their last conversion shall be built upon the foundation of the Lambes twelve Apostles, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.14. The twelve Apostles of the Lambe shall have a fundamentall influence in the rearing and building of the Church of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> not by their resurrection to life againe in those dayes, but by the power of the Spirit breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their gifts and writings. And as <hi>Abel</hi> being dead <hi>yet speaketh, Heb.</hi> 11.4. and that to edification: So the Apostles though dead speake also; and <hi>David</hi> being dead speaketh, and singeth likewise to the edification of the body of Christ, till we come to sing Halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujahs in heavenly glory.</p>
               <p>Say not these writings of the Apostles and Evangelists, of <hi>David</hi> and the Prophets, doe not speake to the edification of the Church, but as they are expounded and applyed by the spirituall gifts of the Ministers and people of God in each age. For the very read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them is an Ordinance of God, and no Ordinance of God is empty and beggarly, and destitute of the Spirit: which is the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of mens traditions, and may not be imputed to any of Gods Ordinances.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Neither ought you to say, That in singing the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> there is no more personall gift manifested, then there is in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a stinted forme of Prayer.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For 1. in reading a stinted forme of prayer, there is no gift of the Spirit at all manifested, but rather (as I conceive) a manifest breach of the second Commandement of God, which is a grieving of the Spirit. But in singing of the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> there is a gift of the Spirit manifested, even the gift of obedience to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Apostle. And that is the personall gift of him that singeth.</p>
               <p>And secondly, all the treasures of the gifts of the Spirit breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David</hi> are likewise manifested in the reverent and holy singing of them. You might more truly have said, there is no more personall gift of the Spirit manifested in singing the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David</hi> then in reading the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David</hi>; because ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of both those duties are alike acts of obedience to Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.

Many of Gods people now have gifts to compose spirituall Songs, as well as carnall Poets to make carnall Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, or as drunkards that make Songs of Gods people. Now every one that hath a gift is to administer it by Christs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10. And if any for want of experience of such a gift in themselves, should question it, they may consider the promise of powring out the Spirit in a more plentifull measure, now in the dayes of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> then in the old.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Though many of Gods people have gifts to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose spirituall Songs, as well as carnall Poets carnall Sonnets, and Drunkards prophane Sonnets; yet that will not argue, that the spirituall Songs, which many of Gods people have gifts to compose, are fit to be sung in the publique holy Assemblies of the Saints, no more then the carnall and prophane Sonnets of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Poets are fit to be sung in civill Assemblies. Let drunken car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Poets sing their carnall Sonnets in their Tavernes and Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses, and such of Gods people as have received a gift to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a spirituall Song fit for their private solace, sing it in their private houses. But every spirituall Song, fit for private solace, is not fit to be sung in the solemne Assemblies of the Church for publique edification: no more then it is fit for every private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian who hath a gift to compose a spirituall prayer to utter and powre forth the same in the publique Congregation of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. It is more then probable, that many of the people of God in the old Testament had gifts to compose spirituall Songs, besides <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Asaph</hi>: and yet unlesse their gift were carried along by an infallible Spirit, they were not received among the Songs of the Temple.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 3. Suppose that spirituall Songs composed by an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary gift, might be received among the publique Songs of the Congregation, yet will it thence follow, that the Church shall be bound to sing onely such Songs, and deprive themselves of the <hi>Psalmes, and Hymnes, and spirituall Songs</hi> of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Asaph,</hi> which were composed with a farre larger measure and power of the Holy Ghost?</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 4. It is readily granted, that as every man hath received a gift, so let him administer and dispense it, according to the Text alledged, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10. But yet in Christs way, every private gift is not fit for publique Administration; nor every publique gift fit to be administred to the shouldring out of a greater gift then it selfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 5. If such as want the experience of such a gift of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Poetry in themselves, should be encouraged to expect it from the promise of powring out the Spirit on all flesh in the dayes of the Gospel, (<hi>Acts</hi> 2.17.) they might as well looke for the gifts of tongues, and healing, and miracles. For it is the same Spirit (though not the same measure) which is there promised to be powred out upon all flesh; Let every man administer the gifts of the Spirit, according to the measure which he hath received within his own line.</p>

The Directions given in that Epistle to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> we willingly grant are Precedentiall to all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as well as the Directions given in other Epistles to other Churches. And the Directions there given be, that in dispensing spirituall gifts, Prophecy be preferred before Tongues, nor any Tongues dispensed without interpretation; That order be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without confusion; That divers may speake without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; That no man may speake without subjection; That wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men be not permitted to speake unto usurpation; That all things be done to edification. And all these Directions are Precedentiall to all such Churches as have received the like gifts. But there is no direction given to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> or any other, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man should have a gift of tongues, or a gift of compiling a <hi>Psalme</hi>; or if he have a gift of compiling a <hi>Psalme</hi> for his private use by an ordinary Spirit, that then he should present it to be sung before the whole Church, and the Church to say Amen to his <hi>Psalme.</hi> For the gift of <hi>Psalmes,</hi> which the Apostle there speaketh of, was not an ordinary gift to compile some spirituall Ditty in verse, but extraordinary, as joyned with the gift of strange Tongues. For it appeareth by the Context, that the gift of Tongues was used by the Members of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> foure wayes: 1. In <hi>speaking mysteries,</hi> ver. 2. 2. In <hi>prayer,</hi> ver. 14. 3. In <hi>singing,</hi> ver. 15. 4. In <hi>thankesgiving,</hi> ver. 17.

Singing <hi>Psalmes</hi> and Prophecy differing no otherwise then Poetry and Prose; and if it was extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> wee have no warrant for publique ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. As the gift of Tongues was extraordinary, so was eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ordinance dispensed in it, whether Prayer, or <hi>Psalme.</hi> or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, all of them extraordinary, both for sublimity of matter, (in the Spirit he speaketh Mysteries, <hi>ver.</hi> 2.) and for power and demonstration of the Spirit, and for suddennesse and dexteritie of utterance without previous study, or meditation, as <hi>Acts</hi> 2.4.11. What though there be an ordinary gift of Prayer and Prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as well as of singing?

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. It is an uncouth comparison, to make no more diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between singing <hi>Psalmes</hi> and Prophecy, then between Poetry and Prose. In Prophecy we open the Scriptures and Counsels of God: in <hi>Psalmes</hi> we open the Counsels and thankesgivings of our own hearts; In <hi>Psalmes</hi> we sing to glorifie God; in Prophecy we speake to edifie men; you might with farre more reason and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruitie have said, That Prayer and singing <hi>Psalmes</hi> differ no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then Poetry and Prose. And yet there is more difference even between them, then so, as the Apostle <hi>James</hi> noteth, <hi>James</hi> 5.13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 3. When you say, that <q>if the singing in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was extraordinary, then wee have no warrant for our publick ordinary singing in the <hi>New Testament</hi> from any exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Neither doth the Argument follow, nor if it did, is it of any force.</q> For though this example of singing in the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> was extraordinary: yet that singing of Christ and his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples at the last Supper was ordinary, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.30. And though there were no example of puhlique ordinary Singing in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> yet it is enough that there is a precept of publique ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Singing given to the Churches, both of the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> and of the <hi>Colossians,</hi> Eph. 5.19. Colos. 3.16. And what the Spirit speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to those Churches, it speaketh to all.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. Propounding a second and third Argument, for the singing of <hi>Davids</hi> Psalmes.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving thus (by the helpe of Christ) cleared the first Argument, for the Singing of <hi>Davids</hi> Psalmes, and such like Scripture-<hi>Psalmes</hi>; Let us now proceed to a second Argument, <hi>taken from the end and use of the Psalmes of David.</hi> The <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Asaph,</hi> and the like, were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for a threefold end, as we see expressed by the Apostle, <hi>Col.</hi> 3 16. to wit, <list>
                     <item>1. For Instruction, or Teaching.</item>
                     <item>2. For Admonition.</item>
                     <item>3. For singing Praise and Thankesgiving to the Lord.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Now if the Psalmes of <hi>David,</hi> and the like, were written (as doubtlesse they were) in the Old Testament for this three-fold end, and each of them of morall (that is, of generall and perpetuall use) and none of them abrogated in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> looke then as it would be a sacrilegious sinne, to take away from the <hi>Psalmes</hi> either of the two former uses (the use of Instruction, or Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;) so it will bee alike Sacriledge to deprive them of the three-fold use, by forbidding them to be sung for praise and thankesgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to the Lord. Whereto a third Argument may be added, <hi>taken from the duty of singing of Psalmes every Sabbath,</hi> and the defect of provision of other Psalmes, if the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> and other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-<hi>Psalmes</hi> be refused. It appeareth from Psalme 95.1, 2, 7, &amp;c. <hi>That when we present our selves before the Lord, to heare the voyce of his word</hi> (as we do every Lords day) <hi>wee should come before his presence with singing of Psalmes.</hi> If so, then some must have a gift, either to prepare set formes of <hi>Psalmes</hi> aforehand for every Sabbath day; or at least a gift, upon the present occasion, suddenly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and utter a <hi>Psalme</hi> fit for the present Sabbath from weeke to weeke: Neither of both which are easie to be beleeved. For if it were so, then doubtlesse Christ would have appointed some or other Officer to attend to this duty of compiling <hi>Psalmes,</hi> as hee hath appointed Elders to attend to the Ministery of the Word, and Prayer, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.4. Or else he would inspire some or other
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:105681:20"/>
Member of the Church with such a Gift and Spirit of <hi>Psalmistry,</hi> as might suite the occasions of the Church from Sabbath to Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. But neither of both these doe wee finde, either in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> or in experience; we finde neither Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance appointing it, nor Providence granting it. And yet evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it is, that the gracious providence of God, is not wanting in supplying well ordered Churches, with all such gifts of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Prayer, and Rule, and the like, as God hath required for the edification of the Church to the end of the world. Neither is it credible, that Christ would take us off from singing the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Asaph,</hi> which were of divine and infallible inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and leave us to an uncertain and common gift of private bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>If it be said, the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> wanted not such gifts of <hi>Psalmes,</hi> nor such members as did compile, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is true, neither did they want gifts of tongues, and of Revelation in the same Text. But these were extraordinary gifts, fit to glorifie Christ in his first ascension into Glory, and fit to commend and confirme the Gospel to Pagans, but no where pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to be continued to Churches in after ages, nor no where commanded to be imitated: much lesse our common gifts, and the <hi>Psalmes</hi> endited by the same to be substituted in their roomes, and <hi>Davids Psalmes</hi> to be silenced, that our <hi>Psalmes</hi> might be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. Concerning the Singers: and first, whether one alone to sing, or the whole Church.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He third Question about Singing of <hi>Psalmes, concerneth the Singers.</hi> For though vocall <hi>Singing</hi> be approved, and also the Singing of <hi>Davids Psalmes,</hi> yet still it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth to some a Question, who must sing them. And here a threefold scruple ariseth. 1. Whether one be to sing for all the rest, the rest joyning onely in spirit, and saying, Amen; or the whole Congregation? 2. Whether women, as well as men;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:105681:21"/>
or men alone? 3. Whether carnall men and Pagans may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to sing with us, or Christians alone, and Church-Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers?</p>
               <p>Touching the first of these Scruples; It is out of doubt. 1. That a Christian man for his own private solace and edification, may sing a <hi>Psalme</hi> alone by himselfe; as <hi>Asaph</hi> had his Songs by night, <hi>Psal.</hi> 77.6.2. It is granted, that he who had a spirituall and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Gift of enditing a <hi>Psalme,</hi> might sing it himselfe, and the rest of the Church joyne with him in Spirit, saying Amen: though in the old Testament, he that endited the <hi>Psalme,</hi> gave it to the Master of Song, to be sung publiquely, by others as well as himselfe. But the Question is of Singing the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David</hi> and other Scripture <hi>Psalmes,</hi> whether they are to be sung by the whole Congregation, or by one alone for all the rest, (the rest joyning onely in the Spirit, and in the close) saying, Amen; And to make good this latter way,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1. It is alledged, In the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> one had a <hi>Psalme,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26. And he that had a <hi>Psalme</hi> sung in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and was directed to sing with understanding also, (that is, in a tongue understood by the whole Church) that they might joyne with him in Spirit, and say Amen, <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This onely concerned the extraordinary <hi>Psalmes,</hi> endi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by such as had also a gift of Tongues as well as of <hi>Psalmes.</hi> For therefore it is, that such are directed, as they sing in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that is, by a spirituall gift, so to sing with understanding al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, to wit, with the understanding of the Church. But this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth not the Singing of the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> which now are not given by any peculiar gift to any one man.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. It is also alledged, That Singing of <hi>Psalmes</hi> is an act of Prophecy. And the Prophets were to speake one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and if any thing were revealed to another that sate by, the first was to hold his peace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.30, 31.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Prophecy is taken two wayes in Scriptures, to omit o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acceptions of the word, not pertinent to the point in hand. 1. Sometimes more strictly and properly, for Preaching, that is, for expounding and applying Scripture to edification. 2. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more largely, for the publishing of spirituall things to the glory of God, and edification of our selves or others. And in this
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:105681:21"/>
sence Master <hi>Perkins</hi> (in his <hi>Propheticâ</hi>) maketh two parts of it,
<list>
                     <item>1. Preaching of the Word.</item>
                     <item>2. Prayer; for which he quoteth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.7. <hi>Abraham is a Prophet, and he shall pray for thee</hi>; he quoteth also, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.1. where the Sonnes of <hi>Asaph, Heman,</hi> and <hi>Jeduthun,</hi> who were Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, are said <hi>to Prophecy with Harpes.</hi> Which argueth that singing of <hi>Psalmes</hi> as well as Prayer, may in some sence, (to wit, in this large sence) be called an act of Prophecy. But in this sence <hi>Paul</hi> doth not speake of Prophecy; for hee doth expresly distinguish it from Prayer, and much more from singing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.4, 5. And in this 14 Chapter to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> hee doth plainly distinguish prophecy from singing <hi>Psalmes</hi>; for when he exhorteth them to covet after spirituall gifts, chiefly, that they might Prophecy, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.1.) it is not his meaning, they should chiefly covet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the gift of enditing or singing of Psalmes, but rather after the gift of Preaching, to wit, of expounding and applying Scripture to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification. When therefore <hi>Paul</hi> directeth the Prophets to speake one by one, <hi>ver.</hi> 30, 31. He speaketh not of that kind of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, whereby many may sing one and the same <hi>Psalme</hi> together, but of the other kind of Prophecy, which is Preaching. Howbeit, true it is also, that if many shall sing severall <hi>Psalmes</hi> at one and the same time together in one and the same Congregation, it would breed the like confusion in the Church, as if the Prophets should speake two or three, or more of them at once.</item>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>If it be said, Why, is it not a confusion for so many voyces to joyne together in singing a <hi>Psalme,</hi> though it be one and the same <hi>Psalme?</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> No more now in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> then it was in the Old, when the Trumpeters and Singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising the Lord, and <hi>when they lift vp their voyce, with the Trumpeters, &amp; Cymbals, and Instruments of Musick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and praised the Lord, saying, for he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever,</hi> 2 Chron. 5.13. For then God shewed his approbation and acceptance of that concourse and consent of so many voyces toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by filling the house of the Lord with a Cloud, which was a gracious signe of his visible presence with them, and acceptance of them, and of their worship. And surely, If the concourse and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of so many voyces had been a confusion, doubtlesse it would
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:105681:22"/>
have been as much displeasing to God in the old Testament, as in the <hi>New.</hi> For God is not a God of confusion in the Churches of the Saints, whether of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> or of the old, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.33. And if our desire be, the will of God may be done on earth as it is done by the Angells in Heaven, we reade of a <hi>multitude of an heavenly hoast of Angells, praising God, and saying, Glory be to God on High,</hi> &amp;c. without any confusion.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 3. Scarce any example can be given of any entire Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, that sang together, mentioned in Scripture.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Though no example could be given, yet it is a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient warrant for the Duty, if any Precept have been given of it in Scripture, and the Precept is plaine in <hi>Colos.</hi> 3.16. where the whole Church of <hi>Colosse</hi> is exhorted to have <hi>the word of Christ dwell richly in them,</hi> not onely to Teach and Admonish one another, (as well in the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> as other Scriptures) but also to sing the <hi>Psalmes</hi> with holy melody to the Lord. If God had reserved this Dutie to some select Choristers, he would have given some direction in the <hi>New Testament</hi> for their Qualification and Election: But since he speaketh nothing of any such select Musitians, he commendeth this Dutie to the whole Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. It is not safely said, that scarce any example in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can be given of any entire Congregation that sang toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For 1. In <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.1. <hi>Moses</hi> and the chilrdren of <hi>Israel</hi> are said to sing a Song of Thankesgiving to the Lord. And the same, they, that sang this Song, the same are said soone to forget Gods works, and not to waite for his Counsell, but to fall a lusting, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106.12, 13, 14. which was the body of the people.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Christ and his Disciples when they administred and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Lords Supper, (which was a Church Act) they were an entire Congregation. <hi>And they after Supper sung a Psalme or Hymne,</hi> Mat. 26.30. To say, that one sang it, and the other joyned in Spirit, saying Amen, hath no foot-hold in the Text. It might as well be said, they all tooke the bread, they all blessed it, and brake it, and gave it, in that one did it, and all the rest joyned in Spirit, and consented, and like enough to the blessing of it, said Amen.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is no straine of wit, but a solid and judicious exposition of the fourth Chapter of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> to make it a description of a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:105681:22"/>
particular visible Church of Christ, according to the platforme and patterne of the <hi>New Testament:</hi> where, as the <hi>foure living Creatures,</hi> are the foure sorts of Officers, so the <hi>twenty-foure Elders</hi> set forth the brethren in the Church, who are as Elders (in respect of their ripe age, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3.) and twenty-foure, in number, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering to the twenty-foure Orders of Priests and Levites, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.9. &amp;c. And these are all said to joyne together <hi>in singing a new Song unto the Lambe,</hi> Rev. 5.8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 4. If the whole Church should sing together, then all the members were Teachers. For the Apostle biddeth us to Teach and Admonish one another in <hi>Psalmes,</hi> Colos. 3.16. But the same Apostle denyeth all to be Teachers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.29.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Though the Apostle bid us to Teach and Admonish one another in <hi>Psalmes</hi>; yet he doth not say, that we should teach one another by singing <hi>Psalmes</hi> together; But hee there holdeth forth a twofold use and improvement of the whole word of God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling richly in us, and a threefold use and improvement of the <hi>Psalmes.</hi> The whole word of God dwelling richly in us, is to be improved to the Teaching and admonishing of one another: but the <hi>Psalmes</hi> are to be improved, not onely to both these ends (as all the rest of the Word beside) but to a threefold end also, even to the Singing of Praises to the Lord. Now in this third end, all the Congregation may joyne, in improving the <hi>Psalmes</hi> thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, though not in the Publique teaching or Admonishing of the Church by them, yet in setting forth the Praises, the Counsels, the workes of God declared in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. Though not every one that Singeth a <hi>Psalme,</hi> may be said forthwith to Teach or Admonish them that sing with him, yet hee that appointeth the Psalme to be sung, may be said to teach and Admonish the whole Congregation that are to sing it, or heare it. <hi>Julian</hi> the Apostate, tooke himselfe to be admonished, yea and reproved when the Christians sang in his hearing the 115. and 97. <hi>Psalmes</hi>; which declare the vanity of Id<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 3. Though the Apostle deny all to be Teachers, his meaning is onely to deny, that they are all Teachers by publique Office, to attend upon Expounding and applying Scripture to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:105681:23"/>
publique edification: But it was no part of his meaning, either to forbid private Teaching, or Adomition of one another, (for then <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> had gone too farre in instructing <hi>Apollos, Acts</hi> 18.26.) or to forbid the quickening and edifying of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of one another, by singing together <hi>Psalmes</hi> of Instruction, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, Consolation to themselves, and Prayers and Praises to the Lord.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. Whether Women may sing as well as Men.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He second scruple about Singers is, <hi>Whether women may sing as well as men.</hi> For in this point there be some that deale with us, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> dealt with the <hi>Israelites,</hi> who though he was at first utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing that any of them should goe to sacrifice to the Lord in the Wildernesse, yet being at length convinced that they must goe, then hee was content the men should goe, but not the Women, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.11. So here, some that were altogether against singing of <hi>Psalmes</hi> at all with lively voyce, yet being convinced, that it is a morall worship of God warranted in Scripture, then if there must be a Singing, one alone must sing, not all, (or if all) the Men onely, and not the Women.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>And their Reason is. 1. Because it is not permitted to a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to speake in the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.34. how then shall they Sing? 2. Much lesse it is permitted to them to Prophecy in the Church, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.11, 12. And singing of <hi>Psalmes</hi> is a kind of Prophecying.</q>
               </p>
               <p>One answer may at once remove both these scruples and withall cleare the Truth, It is apparent by the scope and context of both those Scriptures, That a woman is not permitted to speake in the Church, in two cases. 1. By way of Teaching, whether in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding, or applying Scripture. For this the Apostle accounteth an act of Authority, which is unlawfull for a Woman to usurpe over the man, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13. And besides, the woman is more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Error then the man, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. And therefore might soone prove a Seducer, if she became a Teacher.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:105681:23"/>2. It is not permitted to a woman to speake in the Church, by way of propounding Questions, though under pretence of desire to learne for her own satisfaction; but rather it is required shee should aske her husband at home, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.35.</p>
               <p>For under pretence of Questioning, for learning sake, she might so propound her Question, as to Teach her Teachers; or if not so, yet to open a doore to some of her own weake and erroneous apprehensions, or at least soone exceed the bounds of womanly modesty.</p>
               <p>Neverthelesse in two other cases, it is cleare a woman is allowed to speake in the Church. 1. In way of subjection, when shee is to give account of her offence. Thus <hi>Peter</hi> Questioned <hi>Saphyra</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church touching the price of land sold by her and her husband, which her husband had concealed by his lye: And shee accordingly spake in the Church to give answer to his Question, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.8. 2 In way of singing forth the Praises of the Lord, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the rest of the Congregation. For it is evident the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle layeth no greater restraint upon the women for silence in the Church, then the Law had put upon them before. For so himselfe speaketh in the place alledged, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.34. <hi>It is not permitted to the women to speake, but to be under subjection, as also saith the Law.</hi> The Apostle then requireth the same subjection in the woman, which the Law had put upon them: no more. Now it is certain, the Law, yea the Lawgiver <hi>Moses</hi> did permit <hi>Miriam</hi> and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that went out after her to sing forth the praises of the Lord, as well as the men, and to answer the men in their Song of thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving; <hi>Sing yee to the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he throwne into the Sea,</hi> Exod. 15.20, 21. Which may be a ground sufficient to justifie the lawfull practise of women in singing together with men the Praises of the Lord. And accordingly the ancient practise of women in the Primitive Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to sing the publique praises of the Lord; wee reade recorded in the Ecclesiasticall History, <hi>Socrates</hi> 2.

               <head>CHAP. IX. Whether carnall men may sing, as well as godly Christians?</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He third scruple about the Singers remaineth, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther carnall men and Pagans may be permitted to sing with us, or Christians alone, and Church-members?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What wee beleeve in this poynt, may be summed up in these three particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Church and the members thereof are called to sing to the Praises of God, and to their mutuall edification: For they were Churches of Christ, and members of Churches, whom the Apostle exhorteth to speake to themselves, and make melody to the Lord with Psalmes and Hymnes and spirituall songs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Colos.</hi> 3.16.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Praising of God with <hi>Psalmes</hi> is comely for all the upright, whether received into the Fellowship of any particular visible Church, or no. For so much the words of <hi>David</hi> hold forth, <hi>Praise is comely for the upright,</hi> Psal. 33.1.3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though spirituall gifts are necessary to make melody to the Lord in singing; yet spirituall gifts are neither the onely, nor chiefe ground of singing; but the chiefe ground thereof is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall duty lying upon all men by the Commandement of God; <hi>If any be merry to sing Psalmes</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Jam. 5.13. As in Prayer, though spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall gifts be requisite to make it acceptable; yet the duty of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er lyeth upon all men, by that Commandement which forbiddeth Atheisme; it is <hi>the foole that saith in his heart, There is no God</hi>; of whom it is said, <hi>they call not upon the Lord,</hi> Psal. 14.1.4. Which also may serve for a just Argument and proofe of the poynt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If by the Commandement of God, and indeed by the light of Nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if all men be bound to pray unto God in their distresses. (as even <hi>Jonah's</hi> Marriners will confesse in a storme, <hi>Jonah</hi> 1.6.) then all men are likewise bound to sing to the praise of God in their deliverances, and comforts; For the word runneth alike levell, <hi>Is any afflicted, let him pray? Is any merry? let him sing Psalmes, James,</hi> 5.13.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:105681:24"/>A second proofe may be taken from the generall Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all men upon earth to sing to the Lord, <hi>Psal.</hi> 96.1. <hi>Sing unto the Lord all the earth,</hi> Psal. 100.1, 2. <hi>Make a joyfull noyse unto the Lord all yee Lands, come before his presence with singing.</hi> Psal. 68.32. <hi>Sing unto the Lord all the Kingdomes of the earth, O sing Praises unto the Lord.</hi> And indeed the grounds and ends of Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though some of them doe more peculiarly concerne the Church and people of God (and therefore they of all others are most bound to abound in this Dutie;) yet sundry of the grounds and end of Singing are common to all the sonnes of men, and therefore none of them to be exempted from this service. As, the soveraignty of God, <hi>The Lord is a great God, and a great King above all Gods,</hi> Psal. 95.3. And therefore <hi>make a joyfull noyse to him with Psalmes,</hi> ver. 2. <hi>He is to be feared above all Gods,</hi> Psal. 96.4. And therefore <hi>sing unto him all the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The greatnesse of Gods workes of Creation and Providence, they are other grounds of Singing, and they concern all the sonnes of men in common, <hi>Psal,</hi> 145.6. to 10. <hi>The Lord giveth food to all flesh,</hi> ver. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16. Therefore let all flesh blesse his holy Name, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>Let every thing that hath breath Praise the Lord for his mightie Acts, and for his execellent Greatnesse,</hi> Psal. 150.2. to 6. The end of singing is to praise the Lord for his goodnesse, and to stirre up our selves and others to serve the Lord with chearfulnesse &amp; glad hearts. And therefore <hi>Travellers, Prisoners, Sickmen, Seamen,</hi> being saved from severall distresses by the good hand of God, they are all of them commanded <hi>to praise the Lord for his goodnesse,</hi> and to <hi>declare his wonders before the sonnes of men,</hi> Psal. 107.6. to 32.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Against the singing of all sorts of men in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, carnall as well as Christian, is taken from the examples of Song set forth in Scripture, which both in the <hi>old Testament,</hi> and in the <hi>New,</hi> were onely performed by the Church and Church-members. As the Song of <hi>Moses</hi> at the red Sea was sung by <hi>Moses,</hi> and the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> Exod. 15.1. His other Song, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. he was commanded to teach it to the children of <hi>Israel, Deut.</hi> 31.19. The Song of <hi>Deborah</hi> was sung by her and <hi>Barak, Judg.</hi> 5.1. Under the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> and after the returne from Captivitie, the Officers of the Church onely sang for the more orderly carrying on of that Ordinance, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.31, 32. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.4. <hi>Neh,</hi> 11.22, 23.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:105681:25"/>
                  <q>In the <hi>New Testament,</hi> Christ and his Apostles sang in a place apart from others, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.30.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>In the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> none but the brethren had libertie of Prophecy, in Teaching or Singing <hi>Psalmes.</hi> In the <hi>Revelation</hi> the <hi>foure Beasts,</hi> and the <hi>twenty-foure Elders,</hi> and the 144000. who sung the praises of God and of the Lambe, were apparent repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations of the Church her Officers and Members, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 14.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.1, 2, 3, 4.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. All these examples prove no more, but what we wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly grant, and what in the former part of this discourse, we have been occasioned to maintaine and prove, to wit, that it is lawfull, not onely for one man alone, but for a whole Church, Officers and Members, to sing the praises of the Lord in heart and voyce together with one accord, and so much all these places doe evince.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We live not by examples onely, but by precepts also. And evident precepts have been alledged already, for the generall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of Singing by all the sonnes of men upon the face of the earth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some of these examples doe allow even wicked men and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postates to sing, though it be to upbraide and convince their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse. As that Song of <hi>Moses,</hi> Deut. 32. was appointed to be sung by the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> not onely in <hi>Canaan,</hi> but in their State of Apostasie, and calamitie, <hi>When evill should befall them in the latter dayes,</hi> Deut. 31.19.21, 22.29.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. It is one of the peculiar priviledges of the Church, that the publique dispensation of the Word is committed onely to them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9.4. But singing for the matter of it, is nothing else, but the word, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. And the act of singing in publique, is the publique dispensation of it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The publique dispensation of the Word, to wit, by Preaching, that is, by exposition and application of the word, and that in way of office, is committed onely to the Church, and to some select members of the Church, chiefly for the Churches sake, though the benefit thereof may redound also to men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. But the publique dis<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ensation of the word is not so confined to the Church, but that occasionally men without may publiquely as well as privately, dispense the counsell and will of God both to the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to men out of the Church. And it may be a sinne
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:105681:25"/>
both in Gods people and in others, not to hearken to it. <hi>Pharaoh Necho</hi> (though neither <hi>Israelite</hi> nor <hi>Proselyte</hi>) yet by his Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors did publiquely declare the counsell of God to <hi>Josiah</hi>: and it was a dangerous sinne in <hi>Josiah,</hi> that he did not hearken to the words of <hi>Necho,</hi> which the Text saith, <hi>were from the mouth of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.21, 22. <hi>Balaam</hi> publiquely dispensed the counsell and word of God throughout the 23. and 24th Chapters of <hi>Numbers,</hi> to <hi>Balack</hi> and the Princes of <hi>Moab</hi>: and it was a desolating sinne in <hi>Balack</hi> and the Princes of <hi>Moab,</hi> that they did not hearken to him: and it would have been a sinne in the Church of <hi>Israel</hi> also, if they hearing of the same, had not received his Prophecies (which God put into his mouth) as the word of God. The King of the <hi>Philistims</hi> reproved both <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> from the word of the <hi>Lord</hi> Gen. 20.9, 10.16. and it had been a sinne in them both, to have neglected his reproofe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. It is one thing publiquely to dispense any Ordinance or worship of God, which is peculiar unto the Church, (as the Seales, and Censures, and the like:) another thing to joyne with the Church in such parts of the publique worship of God, which are not peculiar to the Church, but common to all the sonnes of men. Of which sort the publique prayers and praises of God be, and to the <hi>Psalmes</hi> also; which though they be dispensed and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up in the very words of God, yet due praises are not therefore the more undue, because they are offered up in due words</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 3. It is confusion for the Church and the world to sing together, in a mixt Assembly.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. All that are out of the Church, are not forthwith the world, many are called out of the world (and so indeed all ought to be, except the children of the faithfull) before they be received into the Church. And such though they do sing with the Church, yet it is not a singing of the Church and world together; because they are not of the world, but Christ hath called them out of the world, and the world hateth them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. It is no confusion, but lawfull communion, for Church and world to joyne together in a mixt Assembly, to performe such duties, as God requireth of them in common: as to heare the word of God, and the like. In <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Pisidia,</hi> the whole Citie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most (the greatest part whereof were Pagans) came together to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:105681:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
heare the word of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.44. Was this a confusion? And what if the Apostles had prayed in that mixt Assembly, and all the faithfull had said Amen to their prayers, and what if Pagans also understanding what they prayed, had said Amen with them, had it been a confusion? Yea what if in such an Assembly, they should not depart without the publick praises of God in a <hi>Psalme,</hi> and that whole mixt Assembly should joyne together in the sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, would it be a confusion? If it be no confusion for all sorts of men to joyne together in a mixt Assembly to heare the word of God, because it is a dutie required of them all; then neither is it a confusion, but a lawfull communion to joyne together in singing the praises of God in a <hi>Psalme,</hi> because it is a dutie required of them all. <hi>David</hi> foretelleth, <hi>that all the Kings of the earth</hi> (and why not thei<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> people as well?) <hi>shall praise the Lord, when they heare the words of his mouth. Yea they shall sing in the wayes of the Lord, that great is the glory of the Lord,</hi> Psal. 138.4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5.</p>

                     <hi>Object.</hi> 4. The end of singing is to instruct, admonish, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the Church: but the world must not instruct the Church, the Church having received sufficient gifts by Christs ascension to edifie it selfe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.7. to 12. This were to borrow Jewells of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> to make a golden calfe, and to put the Arke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Cart, to be drawne by oxen, that should be carried by Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The end of singing is not onely to instruct, admonish, and comfort the Church, but such also as are godly, though out of the Church. <hi>Praise is comely for the upright,</hi> whether in the Church, or out of it. Nay further, the end of singing is not onely to instruct, and admonish, and comfort the upright<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but also to instruct, and convince, and reprove wicked, as hath been shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. The end of singing, is not onely to instruct, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and edifie men but also to praise and glorifie God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 96.1, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Though the Church might be sufficient to edifie it selfe: yet is it not sufficient to glorifie God alone: which is a duty lying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the sonnes of men, yea in their kinde, upon all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 3. Though the Church have received from Christs as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension sufficient helpes within it selfe, to edifie it selfe: yet if his
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:105681:26"/>
Providence also cast in other helpes from without to edifie it, it is from the vertue of the same ascension of Christ sitting at Gods right hand; and such helpes are not to be rejected. <hi>Josiah</hi> did not well to reject the admonition of <hi>Pharaoh Necho: Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> did well to receive the admonition of <hi>Abimelech.</hi> And yet neither <hi>Pharaoh</hi> nor <hi>Abimelech</hi> were of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 4. The admonition and instruction given in the singing of a <hi>Psalme,</hi> is rather given by him that penned the <hi>Psalme,</hi> and by him that appointeth the <hi>Psalme</hi> to be sung, then by every Singer, unlesse the admonition and instruction be to himself by the words: and unlesse there be a stirring up of affection to himselfe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, by the blessing of God upon the harmony.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 5. Though it was an abuse of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Jewells, to borrow them to make a golden calfe; yet it was no abuse of them to offer them to God for the building and furnishing of the worke of the Tabernacle. God forbid any Christian soule should please it selfe in comparing the Praises of the holy and glorious God to the golden calfe; for though the Singing of the praises of God by carnall men, may be compared to the employment of <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Jewells to that end for which they are used: yet that end being the praising of God, and in such a way as God hath enjoyned to all men, it is not an employment of <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Jewels to the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a golden calfe, but to the Praises of the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, especially of all them that beleeve.</p>
               <p>Nor is there any resemblance between putting the Arke upon a Cart to be carried by Oxen, which should have been carried by Levites, and the permitting of men out of the Church to joyne in singing the Praises of the Lord. For neither doe the members of the Church (to whom the Lord hath chiefly committed the sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of his praises) lay aside this dutie, and leave it to Non-Members, (as the Levites laid aside the carrying of the Arke, and left in the Cart and Oxen:) neither are Non-Members as a Cart and Oxen, upon whom this dutie was never laid: But are all of them enjoyned, as to heare his Word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to call upon his Name, so to sing forth the praises due unto his Name from all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. There is much more just cause of feare, lest this new opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Rejecting of singing of <hi>Davids Psalmes,</hi> and disallowing any <hi>Psalmes</hi> to be sung, but such as are invented by ordinary common
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:105681:27"/>
gifts, and the same to be sung onely by them that invent them, least this new Opinion, I say, be worse then the new Cart of the <hi>Philistims</hi>; for that was to carry the Arke of God to his place; but this new Opinion tendeth to carry this Ordinance of singing <hi>Psalmes</hi> out of the Countrey. And there is the like cause of feare least this over-prizing our personall spirituall common gifts, and the <hi>Psalmes</hi> endited by them, above the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> be not indeed the erecting of a golden calfe, in stead of the Cherubims of the Tabernacle.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It hath been shewed above, that Prophecy is taken two wayes in Scripture. 1. More properly for preaching the Word, that is expounding and applying Scripture to edification. 2. More generally for speaking or publishing the holy things of God, to the glory of God. In the former of these wayes, it is not for Pagans, or prophane persons, ordinarily and allowably to Prophecy in Christs spirituall Temple, which is his Church. But in the latter way, it is not unlawfull as to say Amen, to the publique prayers of the Church, and thereby to expresse their joyning in prayer, (which is one act of Prophecy;) so to joyne with them in singing <hi>Psalmes</hi>; which it hath been shewed above, is a dutie common to them with the Church, as well to joyne with them in hearing the Word. Wherein whether they edifie the Church or no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, it tendeth to the glory of God, that Gods praises should be set forth by all the sonnes of men. And it is a further glory to God, that such Pagans and prophane persons should sing the word of God to their own conviction and confusion of face: And from both, some edification and comfort redoundeth to the Church, to see the wicked convinced, and Gods Name to be glorified. For it is an honour to God, and a comfort to his Church, that our God is not as their God, our enemies being judges and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> That the godly Jewes did reject the Samaritans from building with them, it was not out of morall consideration, as if it were unlawfull for Heathens to contribute their assistance to the worship or Ordinances of God; but out of a ceremoniall respect, because no Heathens or unclean persons might be allowed to come into the Temple of the Lord, <hi>Act.</hi> 21.28. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.19. But by the death of Christ the Partition wall of Ceremonies is broken downe: and wee may allow Heathens and prophane persons to come into our holy Assemblies, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24. which they would not admit. Certain it is, the godly Jewes themselves did receive li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall contributions and oblations from the Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the building and maintenance of the Temple, <hi>Ezra</hi> 7.21. to 24. and Chap. 8.24. to 30. which was a morall acknowledgement of the honor due to the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> as wel by Gentiles as Jewes. If therefore the Jewes would accept acknowledgment of morall homage and service from Heathens and prophane persons to the God of <hi>Israel</hi>; why may not Christians accept from Pagans and prophane persons, their acknowledgement of morall homage and service to our God, in singing forth his praises amongst us?</p>

But if we speake of the worthinesse of fitnesse, though it bee true, their uncleane lips are not fit to take the holy word of God into their mouthes; yet the holy word of God is fit to come into their minds and mouths also, to convince and reprove them of their Apostasie from God, and rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.19. And howsoever they be unfit and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to take Gods Name and Praise into their mouths; yet surely the Lord is worthy of all Praise and Glory, Blessing and Thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving from them, and all the Creatures which he hath made.</p>

But the melody of our Assembly compared with theirs, hath no outward beauty in it.

               </p>
               <p>The two former of these Scruples, because they stand upon one and the same ground, may fitly be handled together.</p>
               <p>The judgement of the Churches of Christ in these Points, is doubtlesse sutable to their Practise, <hi>That it is lawful to sing Psalms in English verses</hi> (which runne in number, measure, and meeter) <hi>and in such grave and melodious tunes, as doe well befit both the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse and gravity of the matter, and the capacity of the Singers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A double ground or reason may be given hereof: The former is this; If it be lawfull to translate and turne the Hebrew Bible into English Prose in order to reading, then it is lawfull also to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and turne <hi>Davids</hi> Hebrew <hi>Psalmes,</hi> and verse into our English Psalmes and Verse, in order to Singing. <q>But the former of these, is a confessed Truth, and generally received amongst Protestants; except onely Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> who had a s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hem, except they reade them? And the noble <hi>Beraeans</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded for <hi>searching the Scriptures,</hi> in the examining of <hi>Pauls</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:105681:29"/>
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11, 12. which how could they have done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reading? And wherefore did all the Apostles and Evangelists write the <hi>New Testament</hi> in Greeke? a language of all more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally knowne then the Latine, and therefore much more then any other in the world, as <hi>Tully</hi> himselfe testifieth <hi>Pro Archiâ Poetâ:</hi> was it not for this end, that the <hi>New Testament</hi> might be read, and generally understood of all Nations? And where it was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, there it might most easily be translated out of a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage well knowne unto the severall language of every Nation? And as for the old Testament, it was translated to their hands out of the Hebrew into Greeke almost three hundred yeares before the Apostles times. Yea wherefore did God commit the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of his will and word to writing, for the edification and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all his people, but that it might be read and understood of them all? If then it be the holy will of God, that the Hebrew Scriptures should be translated into English Prose in order unto reading, then it is in like sort his holy will, that the Hebrew <hi>Psalmes</hi> (which are Poems and Verses) should be translated into English Poems and Verses in order to Singing.</p>
               <p>The Consequence is evident and undeniable. For presupposing that God would have the Scriptures read of English men as well as of other Nations, then as a necessary meanes to that end, he would have the Scriptures translated into the English Tongue, that English People might be able to reade them. In like sort, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposing that God would have the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> and other Scripture-<hi>Psalmes</hi> to be sung of English men, (as hath been evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced above in the second Point) then as a necessary meanes to that end, he would have Scripture-<hi>Psalmes</hi> (which are Poems and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses) to be translated into English-<hi>Psalmes</hi> (which are in like sort Poems and Verses) that English People might be able to sing them. Now as all Verses in all Poems doe consist of a certaine number, and measure of Syllables; so doe our English Verses (as they doe in some other Nations) runne in meeter also, which make the Verses more easie for memory, and fit for melody.</p>
               <p>A second ground of this Point is this: If it be not lawfull to translate Hebrew <hi>Psalmes</hi> (which are Verses) into English Verses, which runne in number, measure, and meeter of syllables:) then it is not lawfull to expresse the elegancy of the Originall language
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:105681:30"/>
in a translation; for it is an artificiall elegancy which the holy Pen-men of Scripture used that they penned the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> and such like Poeticall books of Scriptures not in prose, (which men use in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon speech) but in verses, which observe a certain number and measure of syllables, and some of them run in meeter also, as those know that know the Hebrew, and as <hi>Buxtorf.</hi> sheweth in his <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saur. pag.</hi> 629. Now surely then it were a sacrilegious nicenesse, to thinke it unlawfull lively to expresse all the artificiall elegancies of the Hebrew Text, so farre as we are able to imitate the same in a translation. Yea doubtlesse it were a part of due Faithfulnesse in a Translator, as to declare the whole Counsell of God, word for word; so to expresse lively every elegancy of the Holy Ghost<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (as much as the vulgar language can reach) that so the People of God may be kindly affected, as well with the manner, as with the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p>And for the English Tunes that wee use in singing of <hi>Psalmes,</hi> take this for a ground; Since God hath commanded us to sing <hi>Psalmes and Hymnes and spirituall Songs,</hi> and amongst others, those of <hi>David</hi>: and yet withall hath hid from us the Hebrew Tunes, and the musicall Accents wherewith the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David</hi> were wont to be sung. It must needs be that the Lord alloweth us to sing them in any such grave, and solemne, and plaine Tunes, as doe fitly suite the gravitie of the matter, the solemnitie of Gods worship, and the capacitie of a plaine People. As, to instance in a like case, when the Lord instituted the Paschall Supper, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a whole Lambe to be eaten, the head, feet, and purtenances, and made no mention what drinke they should use in it, whether wine, or water, or beere, or other liquor; It was therefore left to their libertie, to use any such liquor as they were wont to drinke fit for such meate as was to be eaten, and for such stomacks as were to feed upon it: So here when the Lord appointed us to sing <hi>Davids Psalmes,</hi> and doth not appoint us in what Tunes, He therefore plainly leaveth us to our libertie, to make use of such Tunes as are suitable to such an Ordinance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to them that partake in it.</p>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1. It will not follow, that because the word is to be dispensed in a knowne tongue, and so translated into it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Hebrew Songs into English Song. For the former, we have the warrant of the Word to dispense it for edification, exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:105681:30"/>
and comfort; but no word for the other, nor no gifts of that kinde given for the Churches profit, to dispense the word this way. Such Songs therefore, and such Tunes (which are called grave Church-Tunes) are not of God. Nor doe I beleeve that the Levites invented any New Tunes, I have no faith to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that ever God betrusted mans corrupt nature, to frame any thing in Gods worship to his praise. But suppose God had so farre honoured the worldly Singers then; yet it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the Lord Jesus alloweth us the like libertie now. He will not now allow any flesh to boast in his presence, who is not able to bring to passe so much as a good thought.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> To weaken the argument for translating Hebrew Songs into English Songs and Tunes, taken from the like warrant of translating Hebrew Scriptures into English Scriptures; This ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection denieth, that we have either the like word, or the like gift, or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the like libertie. Whereto our answer is, wee have all alike equally.</p>
               <p>For 1. that wee have the like word for singing Hebrew Songs, hath been proved above, out of <hi>Colos.</hi> 3.16. &amp; <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.19. And the same word that commandeth us to sing them, commandeth us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the translation of Hebrew Songs into English Songs, as a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary meanes to the acceptable singing of them. For if we should sing Hebrew Songs in the Hebrew tongue, the People (the body of the Church) should sing without understanding, which were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to the Apostles Direction, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.15.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That we have also the like gift of translating Hebrew Songs into English Songs, as well as Hebrew Prose into English Prose, is evident by the event. For wee have not onely as many but more Translations of the Hebrew <hi>Psalmes</hi> into English <hi>Psalmes,</hi> then of the Hebrew Bible into the English Bible.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>If it be said, such a gift of translating Hebrew Songs into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Songs, is but a Poeticall gift, not a spirituall gift.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It might as well be said, the translating of the Hebrew Scriptures into English, is not a spirituall gift, but a Grammaticall, or Rhetoricall gift. Whatsoever the art or skill be, Grammaticall, Rhetoricall, Poeticall, they are all of them gifts of God (though common) and given chiefly for the service and edification of the Church of God.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:105681:31"/>3. That we have also the like liberty of inventing Tunes, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth from what hath been said already; For if God have given us liberty and warrant to sing <hi>Psalmes and Hymnes and spirituall Songs,</hi> then we must sing them in some Tunes. Now the Tunes of the Temple are lost and hidden from us, so that wee cannot sing them at all; and therefore we must sing such other Tunes, as are suitable to the matter, though invented by men.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But you doe not beleeve that the Levites ever invented any New Tune.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Either the Levites invented New Tunes, or the Psalmists delivered musicall Accents, and Notes together with the <hi>Psalmes</hi>: which seeing we understand not, either wee must not sing a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> all, or we must make use of such Tunes, as are invented by others.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But you cannot believe, that ever God betrusted mans corrupt nature, to frame any thing in Gods worship to his Praise.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Then you cannot beleeve, that ever God betrusted the Hebrew and Greeke Scriptures, to be read in the Christian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in English words; for all English words are framed by English men, in corrupt nature, to wit, without the immediate assistance of the Holy Ghost in the framing of them. And if wee may not make use of Tunes invented by men for the singing of the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> then neither may we make use of words invented by men for the Reading of the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> and other Scriptures. The one is as much a worship of God as the other: And English words are as much an invention of man as English Tunes. But least you should begin hereupon to take up a scruple against the Reading also of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in English words, as well as against the singing of <hi>Psalmes</hi> in English Tunes, and both upon this pretence of the inventions of men in the worship of God, be not ignorant, that such godly men as have been desirous of Reformation, and most zealous against humane inventions in the worship of God, they alwaies intended such humane inventions in the worship of God, as had no warrant but the wit and will of man, not such as had warrant either from consequence of Scripture, or light of Nature, or civill custome. For a woman to cover her head in time of publique Prayer, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying, and for a man to uncover his head, the Apostle war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranteth both from the light of Nature, and the custome of the Churches, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.4. to 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:105681:31"/>The Kisse of love in holy Assemblies was warranted, not by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine institution, (for then it were a sinne in us to neglect it now;) but by occasion of civill custome in those Nations; where, it being usuall in their Civill Assemblies to greet one another with a kisse of love, The Apostles doe not disallow the use of it in holy As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, but onely require the sinceritie and holinesse of the love expressed in such kisses, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.20. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.26. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.14. These Apostles did not beleeve in this Point, as you doe, that God never betrusted corrupt Nature, to frame any thing in Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to his Praise.</p>
               <p>It is true, mans corrupt Nature cannot bring forth a good thought, to wit, a gracious thought, and that of it selfe, but yet by the helpe of Christ, it may bring forth both knowledge by Tongues, and Tunes by Musick; and that with as good allowance in the <hi>New Testament</hi> as in the Old. God did as much disallow any flesh to boast in his presence in the <hi>old Testament,</hi> as in the <hi>New, Jer.</hi> 9.23, 24. But what cause hath any flesh to boast, either of his spirituall, or common gifts? Seeing both are gifts, and received of God: and if received, why should men boast, as if they had not received them? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7.</p>

To sing with mans melody and meeter, doth not hold forth any spirituall gift of Christ, but onely the art and nature of man: whereas Prayer and Preaching doe hold forth spirituall gifts. And the tuning of Scripture by mans art, it is no gift of Grace, neither doth it redound to the praise of Grace.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Though Prayer and Preaching doe hold forth spirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall gifts, yet all the Duties that tend to edification, doe not hold forth spirituall gifts, but some of them common gifts onely. The reading of the Scriptures tendeth to edification, as being it selfe an Ordinance of God, though exposition afterwards be added also, which is another Ordinance, <hi>Deut,</hi> 31.11, 12, 13. And yet read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scriptures is no spirituall gift. <hi>Aquila,</hi> and <hi>Symmachus,</hi> and <hi>Theodotian,</hi> translated the Hebrew Scriptures into Greeke, and yet none of them were endued with spirituall gifts, or at best but common. To say Amen at the end of a publique Prayer, tendeth to edification; and yet Amen may be said without holding forth any spirituall gift.</p>

                  <q>But that which is ground of your scruple seemeth to be this, that that which is no gift of Grace, how can it redound to the Praise of Grace?</q>
               </p>
               <p>But the Answer is ready, that such things as helpe either the understanding, or the affection, and are appointed of God for his worship; they do tend to edification, and so to the praise of grace, though they may be performed by a gift of God in Nature or art, without any spirituall gift of Grace: Translation of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures into the Mother-Tongue, and the reading of them in a knowne tongue, doe both of them helpe the understanding: and being appointed of God, they tend to the edification of the people in the Grace of Christ. The translating of the <hi>Psalmes</hi> into verse, in number, measure, and meeter, and suiting the Ditty with apt Tunes, doe helpe to stirre up the affection: And the singing of <hi>Psalmes</hi> being appointed of God, they tend to make a gracious melody to the Praise of God and edification of his People.

They frame their words and sentences more to the Meeter, then the Prose.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The meeter and verse of the late Translators, cometh as neare to the words and sence of the Originall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as doth the Prose; especially considering they doe withall expresse the holy Art of the Originall Hebrew Poetry, which the Prose doth not attend unto. Neither doe the Translators breake the Attributes of God, when for the verse sake, they put Jah for Jehovah; For both <hi>Jah</hi> and <hi>Jehovah</hi> doe hold forth one and the same Attribute of God, even his eternall being. The Evangelists and Apostles give us a patterne of greater changes of the Attributes of God, then that; any yet without breaking of the Attributes of God, and much
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:105681:32"/>
more without mangling of the word of God. It is an usuall thing with them to translate <hi>Jehovah</hi> the Lord, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.44. with <hi>Psal.</hi> 110.1. And yet <hi>Jehovah</hi> holdeth forth his eternall essence, the Lord his Soveraigne Dominion. It were sacrilegious Blasphemy to call this changing either the breaking of Gods Attributes, or the mangling of his word. Besides, its very rare when the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slators doe make any such change of <hi>Jah</hi> for <hi>Jehovah</hi>: and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all stumbling, either of your selfe, or others at it, I suppose they will helpe it in the next Edition of the <hi>Psalmes.</hi>

Since God commandeth all men in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse to call upon him, and all men in their mirth, to sing his Praise, what is mortall sinfull man, (Dust and Ashes) that he should forbid, what God hath commanded? God knoweth how to allow, yea and to reward what is his own: when yet he taketh no pleasure in the sinfull manner of performance of any Dutie. God tooke notice of <hi>Ahabs</hi> humiliation, and rewarded it with respite of temporall judgements, though he tooke no pleasure in his sinfull hypocrisie, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.27<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 28, 29.

               <head>CHAP. XI. Of Reading the Psalmes in order to Singing.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He last scruple remaining in the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of singing, <hi>Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the order of singing after the Reading of the Psalmes.</hi> For it is doubted by some, and concluded by others that reading of the <hi>Psalmes</hi> is not to be allowed in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to singing. We for our parts easily grant, that where all have books and can reade, or else can say the <hi>Psalme</hi> by heart, it were needlesse there to reade each line of the <hi>Psalme</hi> before hand in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to singing. But if it be granted, which is already proved, that the <hi>Psalmes</hi> to be ordinarily sung in Publique, are Scripture-<hi>Psalmes,</hi> and those to be sung by the body of the Congregation. Then to this end it will be a necessary helpe, that the words of the <hi>Psalme</hi> be openly read before hand, line after line, or two lines together, that so they who want either books or skill to reade, may know what is to be sung, and joyne with the rest in the dutie of singing; It is no unwarrantable invention of man, brought into the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, to make use of such meanes, which the light of Nature teacheth us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be either necessary or convenient helpes, either to the hearing or understanding of what it said in the worship of God. Scaffolds erected in Meeting houses are inventions of men; no expresse precept, nor example in Scripture calleth for them; and yet the light of Nature easily suggesteth it, that they helpe to hearing, and so to edification, in as much as they draw multitudes of people to sit within the Ministers voyce; That which helpeth the very outward sence of hearing, helpeth also knowledge and understanding, and so edification. And therefore no man taketh exceptions at Scaffolds as inventions of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though they be used to helpe forward Gods worship, and spirituall edification; because they are not brought in, nor used for spirituall meanes immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but remotely, so farre as they are fit to helpe the outward sence of hearing and so understanding. Of like use is reading in order to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:105681:33"/>
Singing. It giveth the People to heare, and so to understand, what is to be sung, that so they may joyne with the rest in singing of the <hi>Psalme</hi>: and by Singing be stirred up to use holy Harmony, both with the Lord and his People.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Object,</hi> 1. The Scripture mentioneth no ordinary reading in any Church, but that which is joyned with interpertation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The Scripture doth expresly mention <hi>Baruch</hi> to have read the word in a Church Assembly, without adjoyning any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation to it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 36.6, 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. As Preaching, of the word is an Ordinance, so read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word in order to Preaching, is an Ordinance also. In like sort, as singing of <hi>Psalmes</hi> is an Ordinance, so reading the <hi>Psalmes</hi> in order to singing, is allowable also.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 3. It is mentioned in Scripture, that the children of <hi>Israel</hi> did all joyne in singing the <hi>Song of Moses</hi> at the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> Exod. 15.1. Now it is not credible, that they who were bred and brought up in bondage, were brought up to reade. It were much if one of a thousand of them could reade. If most of them could not reade, how could they joyne in singing that <hi>Psalme,</hi> unlesse some or other read, or pronounced the <hi>Psalme</hi> to them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 4. Though it be true, that the Church of <hi>Israel</hi> had such an Ordinance amongst them, that after the reading of the Law, or the Prophets, some or other of the Priests or Levites, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, were wont to expound the same to the people, (<hi>Acts</hi> 13.15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.21. <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.7, 8.) yet the very reading of the word it selfe was also an Ordinance, though no Exposition followed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.11, 12, 13. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.14. to 26.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. The Scripture prescribeth not what Officer shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme this act, to reade the <hi>Psalme</hi> in order to singing.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Scripture prescribeth this, as it doth many other matters of ordering Gods house, to wit, under generall Rules. It is no where expresly prescribed in Scripture, who shall be the Mouth of the rest in the publique Admonition, or Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of an Offendor; yet by generall Rules, it may easily be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, That publique dispensations of the Church, doe ordinarily pertaine to the publique Officers of the Church. Any of the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching or ruling Elders may warrantably goe before the people, in putting the words of the <hi>Psalme</hi> into their mouths.</p>

                     <hi>Object.</hi> 3. This reading of the <hi>Psalme</hi> doth hinder the melody, the understanding, the affection in singing.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If a mans prejudice against reading doe not hinder him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, Reading hindreth none of these; not melody, for the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not in the art of singing, but in the pause; nor the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for it helpeth such as cannot reade, or want Books to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what is to be sung, which otherwise they could hardly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; nor the affection, for when the melody is not interrupted, and the understanding furthered, the affection is rather helped then hindred; or if it be hindred, lay the fault where it is, rather in a coy, or cold heart, then in a distinct and intelligent Reading.</p>

That practise which was anciently used in the Churches immediately after the Apostles times, is most probable to be nearest the constitution of the Apostles; and that practise which followed a great while after it, is most probable to be furthest off; as the water is purest and clearest, nearest the fountain, and runneth more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and muddy afterwards. Now the practise of singing <hi>Psalmes,</hi> which were made by the faithfull, was first in use: For those <hi>Psalmes</hi> which the Primitive Christians used before day in the time of Persecution, wherein they sang Praises to Christ their God (as <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth to <hi>Trajan</hi>) they are said to be made of the faithfull.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>These were in use, even in <hi>Johns</hi> time, after he was called from Banishment (after <hi>Domitians</hi> death) to order the Churches; which practise also continued about three hundred yeares; wherein there was more purity in Doctrine and Discipline, (as useth to be under Persecution) then afterwards.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. This Syllogisme falleth short of Truth in both the Propo<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:105681:34"/>
nearest to their constitution, (as the water is purest and clearest next the fountaine;) and that which followeth a great while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, is furthest off. As water neare the fountaine may fall out to be troubled, and so become lesse cleare and pure, then in his run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning course further off. The night following the day, though it be nearest to the day, yet it is more darke, then the day following after, though it be further off from the day before. The Elders and People that lived in the dayes of <hi>Joshuah,</hi> they served the Lord: but when that Generation were gathered to their Fathers, <hi>there arose another Generation after them, which knew not the Lord, and they did evill in the sight of the Lord, and served Baalim,</hi> Judg. 3.7. to 11. <hi>Paul</hi> forewarneth the Elders of <hi>Ephesus</hi>; He knew that after his departure <hi>grievous Wolves should come in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, not sparing the flocke,</hi> Acts 20.29, 30.

               <p n="2">2.

For it is evident that in the next Century after the Apostles times, the Church did (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> testifieth, <hi>Apologet, Chap.</hi> 39.) <hi>Deo canere,</hi> either <hi>de Scripturis Sanctis,</hi> or <hi>de proprio ingenio,</hi> that is, either out of the holy Scriptures, or out of their own gift. Yea and <hi>Pliny</hi> himselfe, (which is all the Testimony you alledge of the Churches practise for three hundred yeares) he doth not expresse what <hi>Psalmes</hi> they sang, whether out of the holy Scriptures, or out of their own gift, or that any one alone did sing, but that they did <hi>Carmen Christo quasi Deo dicere suo invicem, Plin.

The practise brought in by <hi>Flavianus</hi> and <hi>Diodorus,</hi> was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther some new fashion of singing <hi>Davids Psalmes,</hi> then the singing of them. For as <hi>Theodoret</hi> reporteth it, they were the first that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Quire of Singers into two sides, and appointed one side of them to answer the other in the singing of them: and used the same at the Monuments of the dead, and that sometimes all the night long. But these inventions savoured rather of superstition, then of pure Primitive Devotion: though they wrought a good effect upon <hi>Theodosius,</hi> when <hi>Flavianus</hi> sent those Songs to be sung at his Table, to moderate his wrath against the Citizens of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi>;

see <hi>Theodoret, Hist. Eccles. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 24. <hi>Zozomen, Hist. Eccles. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 23.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is spoken without warrant of Antiquity, that <hi>Ambrose</hi> and <hi>Augustine</hi> tooke up the practise of singing <hi>Davids Psalmes</hi> from <hi>Flavianus</hi> and <hi>Diodorus.</hi> For neither did they bring it in, (as was shewen out of <hi>Tertullian</hi>;) nor is the slacknesse of some Churches in receiving an Ordinance, a just exception against the Ordinance, but rather a just reprehension of their negligence. And so much doth <hi>Augustine</hi> confesse in his 119 <hi>Epistle, chap.</hi> 18.
<q>Where speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this practise of singing of <hi>Psalmes,</hi> though it be, saith he, so usefull to the stirring up of the heart in godlinesse, and to kindle the affection of divine reading: yet the custome of Churches is divers about it, and the most members of the African Churches, <hi>Pigriora sunt,</hi> have been more sloathfull in receiving it. In so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the <hi>Donatists</hi> doe reprehend us, that wee sing soberly the divine Songs of the Prophets, whereas they inflame their drunkennesse (as it were) by a Trumpet of exhortation to the singing of <hi>Psalmes,</hi> composed by their own humane wit.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By which reproofe of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> it may appeare that the custome of singing <hi>Davids Psalmes</hi> was in use in the African Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and in <hi>Millain</hi> also of former times; and that the Custome brought into the Church of Millain to keepe the people awake in their night Watches against the Arrian violence, was the singing of <hi>Psalmes</hi> after the Easterne manner, with more curiosity of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, and one side of the Singers answering another. And of this is <hi>Augustine</hi> to bee understood in the ninth booke of his <hi>Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, chap.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is not true, That <hi>Augustine</hi> became a Patron of singing <hi>Davids Psalmes,</hi> rather forced to it by the importunity of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, then of his owne accord.
<q>For hee saith expresly in the same Chapter of the same Epistle; That the practise of singing <hi>Psalmes</hi> and <hi>Hymnes</hi> is to be done without doubting, seeing it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended out of the Scriptures, in which wee find both the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and Examples, and Precepts of Christ, and of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles for it. And the same <hi>Augustine</hi> in his first Tome and third Rule, (as it is titled) <hi>Nolite</hi> (saith he) <hi>cantare, nisi quod legitis esse cantandum. Quod autem non ita Scriptum est ut cantetur, non cantetur</hi>; that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doe not sing but what you reade is to be sung, <pb n="69" facs="tcp:105681:36"/>
but that which is not written that it should be sung, let it not be sung. Nor is it true, that <hi>Augustine</hi> repented, that the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of singing <hi>Davids Psalmes</hi> was brought into the Church, or that he wished rather it were taken away.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For though when hee saw his heart more taken up with the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody of the Tune, then with the sweetnesse of the matter, he could have wished the sweetnesse of the melody removed from his owne eares, and from the Church: yet still he would have them sung af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Athanasius:</hi> And then correcting himselfe;
<q>But when J remember, saith he, my Teares which J powred out at the singing of thy Church, in the first restoring of my Faith, and how J am still moved, not with the Song, but with the matter sung, when it is sung with a cleare voyce, and convenient tune or modulation, J doe againe acknowledge the great utility of this Institution.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And though he doe waver between the perill of delight to the sence, and experiment of wholsomnesse to the soule: yet his scruple was not of the lawfulnesse of singing <hi>Davids Psalmes,</hi> but partly of the pleasantnesse of the Tunes (which might be more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall, then the gravity of the Ordinance required) partly of the expediency thereof to himselfe, till his heart were more spirituall. His writing against <hi>Hillarius jubentibus fratribus,</hi> doth not argue, he wrote against his will, but by a good call, in defence of singing <hi>Davids Psalmes</hi> against a man that tooke up any occasion to carp at Gods Ministers, <hi>August.

Neither were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and Canonicall Singers brought into the Church in his time. The Councell of <hi>Laodicea</hi> which allowed them, and interdicted <hi>Psalmes</hi> composed by divers Christians, was neare about sixty yeares after him.</p>

But otherwise for their prohibiting of singing of <hi>Psalmes</hi> composed by private men, and the reading of any books in the Church, but the writings of the Prophets and Apostles, as they doe in <hi>Canon</hi> 59. that so they might establish the reading of Scripture-bookes, and the singing of Scripture-<hi>Psalmes.</hi> It is so farre from superstition, that it tendeth rather to preferre divine Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, above humane Inventions. When they interdicted the <hi>Psalmes</hi> composed by private Christians, whom they called Idiots, or as we call them in our language, simple fooles. You are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that an Idoll in their language signifieth no more but a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man; and in the same sence the Apostle himselfe useth it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.16. though the Translators turne it unlearned.</p>
               <p>Neither doe Formes of Gods Praise stop the breathing of the lively Gifts of Gods Spirit, when the Formes are no other, but such as were indited by the immediate Inspiration of the Holy Ghost; For when the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> and of other holy men of God, were commended to the Church of <hi>Israel,</hi> and by them were ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily sung in the Temple and elsewhere, would you say it did hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the free passage of the breathing of the lively gifts of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, either in the Ministery of the Priests, or in the writings and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of the Prophets?

Lord, whether it doe more savour of an Antichristian spirit, for the whole Church to sing the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David</hi> with one accord, or to sing <hi>Te Deum,</hi> or some other Anthem devised by a private spirit, one man alone? Sure it is (as we said before) Antichristian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches doe utterly reject the singing of <hi>Davids Psalmes</hi> in the Meeter of each Nation in their Mother Tongue, yea and do reproach such <hi>Psalmes</hi> as <hi>Genevah</hi> jiggs; so farre are they off from closing with singing of them as an Invention of their own.</p>

Let no man thinke, that the singing of <hi>Davids Psalmes</hi> is an Ordinance of God, because many Christians have found their affections stirred (as <hi>Augustine</hi> also did) in the singing of them. This doth not justifie this practise, no more then it doth Preaching by a false calling, because some have found conversion by it: no more then it doth the receiving the seale of the Supper in a false Church, and that with the Idolatrous gesture of knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, because some have found quickning and strengthening Grace therein. For Gods goodnesse many times goeth beyond his Truth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> We cannot say, That Gods goodnesse goeth beyond his Truth, though sometime he shew a man mercy out of his way. For we have the truth of Gods word to testifie, that so sometime he doth as <hi>Saul</hi> found converting grace in going to <hi>Damascus</hi> to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Saints. But this we say, that when God doth thus, he either convinceth a man of the error of his way, before he shew him fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in it, (as he did <hi>Saul</hi>;) or else the way it selfe, or Dutie is of God, though there be some falling in the circumstance of it. Many of <hi>Israel</hi> that came to the Passeover in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> time in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse, yet they found mercy with the Lord. But it was because the Ordinance and Duty was of God, the failing was onely in the manner of Preparation to it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.18, 19, 20. But if <hi>Micah</hi> set up an invention of his own in his house, though he may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise himselfe a blessing in some orderly circumstance of it, (as he did <hi>Judg.</hi> 17.13.) yet let him be sure he shall finde a curse in stead of a blessing, according as God hath exprest it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.26. It is granted and bewailed, that there hath been found some sinfull fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in sundry circumstances of some Ministers callings: And yet because the substance of the calling was of God; many have found saving blessings in attending on their Ministery. And the Lords

Supper administred by them being of God, though the gesture in which it was received was corrupt, the Lord was pleased to accept and blesse what was his owne, and to passe by sinnes of ignorance in his people. But can it ever be proved that when any practise of Gods worship hath been but an humane and Antichristian inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it hath been neverthelesse blessed with the communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of spirituall affections, and that not seldome and rarely, but frequently and usually; not to one or two Saints, but generally; not to the weakest, but to the strongest Christians? We are verily perswaded no such instance can be given since the world began. God is not wont to honour and blesse the wayes of superstition, with the reward of sincere devotion. But surely God hath deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to blesse the singing of his holy <hi>Psalmes,</hi> with gracious and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall affections, not onely in <hi>Augustines</hi> time, &amp; in <hi>Justine Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> before him, but from age to age to his Saints, usually, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and abundantly: so that doubtlesse the servants of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud their soules of much spirituall good, and comfort, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud themselves of the Fellowship of this Ordinance.</p>
