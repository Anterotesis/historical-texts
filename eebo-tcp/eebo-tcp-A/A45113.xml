         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

smartest; <hi>Affliction commeth

thou couldst not but kisse it;
Why man, it is thy good
God, the Father of all mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
that layes these stripes
upon thee; Hee that made
thee, he that bought thee at
so deare a rate as his owne
blood, it is he that chastiseth
thee; and canst thou think he
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58618:20"/>
would whip thee but for thy
good? Thou art a Father of
children, and art acquainted
with thine owne bowels;
Didst thou ever take the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

smiting that flesh which is
derived from thine owne

thee to make thy child smart,

thou sawest good reason to

And if we that are evill,

now they are stinted, and goe
under commission; neither

any other limits then thy

hadst thou rather be good,

thou mayst well be so. Who
is so little in his owne favour
as to imagine hee can be the
worse for faring well? But
he that made thee lookes far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into thee then thine owne

that if thy body be not sick,
thy soul will: if he therefore
finde it sit to take downe thy
worse part a little, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
of a mortall danger
to the better, what cause hast
thou to complain, yea, rather
not to be thankfull? When
thou hast felt thy body in a
distemper of fulnesse, thou
hast gone to sea on purpose to
make thy self sick; yet thou

               <p>Thou complainest of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
I have known those
that have bestowed teares
upon their too much health,
sadly bemoaning the feare and
danger of Gods disfavour for
that they ayled nothing; and
our <hi>Bromiard</hi> tels us of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
man in his time,<note place="margin">Bro. Sum. V. Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitas</note> that
bewailed his continued wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
as no small affliction;
whom soon after God fitted
with pain enough: The poore
man joyed in the change, and
held his sicknesse a mercy;
neither indeed was it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
intended by him that
sent it. Why are we too much
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58618:23"/>
dejected with that, which
others complain to want?
why should we finde that so
tedious to us, which others
have wished? There have
been Medicinal Agues, which
the wise Physitian hath cast
his Patient into, for the cure
of a worse distemper. A se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
and lawless health, how
ever Nature takes it, is the
most dangerous indisposition
of the soul: if that may be
healed by some few bodily
pangs, the advantage is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable.
Look upon some
vigorous Gallant, that in the
height of his spirit, and the
heat of his blood, eagerly
pursues his carnal delights, as
thinking of no heaven, but
the free delectation of his
sense; and compare thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58618:24"/>

<hi>My God, my God, why hast thou

the dear and eternal Son of
his love, our ever blessed Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deemer?

this the way to their heaven,

or of a <hi>Regulus,</hi> that after so

himself to the worst of the

Why shouldst thou
think it strange (saith wise
<hi>Seneca</hi>) that some men should
be well pleased to be scorcht,
to be wounded, to be rackt,
to be kill'd? Frugality is a pain

studie is a torture to the

are not in their own nature
difficult; but we are feeble,

and shall we Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
droop, and pule under

of thy Saviour, that it cals not
thy sense to witnesse. As for
that assurance thou speakest
of, they are happy that can
truly feel, &amp; maintain it; and
it must be our holy ambition
(what we may) to aspire unto
it; but that is such an height
of perfection, as every travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
in this wretched pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
cannot, whiles he is in
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58618:46"/>
this perplexed, and heavy
way, hope to attain unto: It
is an unsafe and perillous
path, which those men have
walked in, who have been
wont to define all faith by as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance;
Should I lead thee
that way, it might cost thee a
fall; so sure a certainty of our
constant and reflected appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of eternall life, is both
hard to get, and not easie to
hold unmovably; consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the many and strong
temptations that we are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
unto in this vale of mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and death: Should faith be
reduced to this triall, it would
be yet more rare then our
Saviour hath foretold it: For,
as many a one boasts of such
an assurance, who is yet fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of a true faith, (hugging
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58618:47"/>
a vain presumption in stead of
it) so many a one, also, hath
true faith in the Lord Iesus,
who yet complaines to want
this assurance. Canst thou
in a sense of thine owne mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
close with thy Saviour?
canst thou throw thy self into
the arms of his mercy? canst
thou trust him with thy soul,
and repose thy self upon him
for forgivenesse and salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
canst thou lay thy self
before him as a miserable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of his grace and mercy?
and when it is held forth to
thee, canst thou lay some
(though weak) hold upon it?
Labour what thou mayst for
further degrees of strength
daily; set not up thy rest in
this pitch of grace; but, chear
up thy self, my son, even thus
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58618:47"/>
much faith shall save thy soul:
Thou believest; and he hath
said it,<note place="margin">Joh. 3. 36.</note> that is Truth it self; <hi>He
that believeth on the Son, hath
everlasting life.</hi>

my apprehensions of him are
so feeble, as that they can
afford no sound comfort to
my soul. Courage, my son;
were it that thou lookedst to
be justified, and saved by the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58618:48"/>
power of the very act of thy
faith, thou hadst reason to be
disheartened with the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

but now that the vertue

thy God and Saviour, (which
cannot be abated by thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities)
thou hast cause to
take heart to thy self, and
chearfully to expect his sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
Understand thy case
aright: Here is a double
hand that helps us up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
heaven: our hand of
Faith lays hold upon our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;
our Saviours hand of
mercy and plenteous redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
lays hold on us: our
hold of him is feeble, and easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58618:48"/>
loosed; his hold of us is
strong, and irresistible. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
thy self therefore, in this,
with the blessed Apostle;
When thou art weak, then
thou art strong; when weak in
thy self, strong in thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.
Shouldst thou boast
of thy strength, and say, Tush,
I shall never be moved; I
should suspect the truth and
safety of thy condition: now
thou bewailest thy weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
I cannot but encourage
and congratulate the happie
estate of thy soul. If work
were stood upon, a strength
of hand were necessary; but
now, that onely taking and
receiving of a precious gift
is required, why may not a
weak hand do that as well as
a strong? as well, though
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58618:49"/>
not as forcibly. Be not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
dejected with the want
of thine own power, but
comfort thy self in the rich

dead in sins and trespasses;
neither ever had I any true

have onely beguiled the eyes
of the world with a meer

whereof I have made a

thou wilt be acknown of;
Thou hast true life of grace
in thee, and for the time per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivest
it not: It is no heed
to take of the doom thou
passest upon thy self in the

thy heart was free, thou wert

upon better advice return to
thy former thoughts. It is

                     </gap>ychus,</hi>
that fell down from
the third loft, and was taken
up for dead; yet for all that,
his life was in him. We have
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58618:53"/>
known those who have lien
long in trances, withovt any
perception of life; yea, some
(as that subtil <hi>Joannes Duns
Scotus</hi>) have been put into
their graves for fully dead,
when as yet their soul hath
been in them, though unable
to exert those faculties which
might evince her hidden pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.
Such thou mayest be,
at the worst: yea, wert thou
but in charity with thy self,
thou wouldst be found in a
much better condition. There
is the same reason of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
life, and the spiritual:
Life, where it is, is discerned
by breathing, sense, motion:
Where there is the breath of
life, there must be a life that
sends it forth: If then the
soul breathes forth holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58618:54"/>
doubtless there is a life
whence they proceed. Now
deny, if thou canst, that thou
hast these spiritual brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things
of holy desires within
thee? Dost thou not many
a time sigh for thine own
insensateness? Is not thine
heart troubled with the
thoughts of thy want of
grace? Dost thou not truly
desire that God would renew
a right spirit within thee?
Take comfort to thy self; this
is the work of the inward
principle of Gods Spirit
within thee: as well may a
man breathe without life, as
thou couldst be thus affected
without grace: Sense is a
quick discrier of life: pinch
or wound a dead man, he feels
nothing; but the living per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58618:54"/>
the easiest touch.
When thou hast heard the
fearful judgements of God
denounced against sinners,
and laid home to the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
hast thou not found thy
heart pierced with them?
hast thou not shrunk inward,
and secretly thought, How
shall I decline this dreadful
damnation? When thou hast
heard the sweet mercies of
God laid forth to penitent
sinners, hath not thy heart
silently said, Oh that I had
my share in them! When
thou hast heard the Name of
Christ blasphemed, hast thou
not felt a secret horrour in
thy bosom? All these argue
a true spiritual life within
thee. Motion is the most
perfect discoverer of life:
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:58618:55"/>
He that can stir his limbs, is
surely not dead: The feet of
the soul are the Affections:
Hast thou not found in thy
self an hate and detestation
of that sin whereinto thou
hast been miscarried? Hast
thou not found in thy self a
true grief of heart for thy
wretched indisposition to all
good things? Hast thou not
found a secret love to, and
complacency in those whom
thou hast thought truly god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
and conscionable? With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a true life of grace, these
things could never have been:
Are not thine eyes and hands
many times lifted up in an
imploration of mercy? Canst
thou deny that thou hast a
true, though but weak appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
to the means, and further
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58618:55"/>
degrees of grace? What can
this be but that hunger and
thirst after righteousnesse, to
which our Saviour hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
blessednesse? Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort
not thy selfe too
much, son, with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
disappearance of grace,
during the hour of thy temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
it is no otherwise with

powerfull denunciation of
judgement, which hath so
wrought upon them that it
hath brought them within
sight of hell; who after long
and deep humiliation, have
been raised up through Gods
mercy, to a comfortable sense
of the divine favour, and
have proceeded to a very high
degree of regeneration, and
lived, and died Saints: But
this is not every mans case;
Those who having from their
infancy been brought up in
the nurture and feare of the
Lord;<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 4.</note> and from their youth
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58618:58"/>
have been trained up under a
godly and conscionable Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery;
where they have
been continually plyed with
the essectuall means of grace;
<hi>Precept upon precept,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isai. 28. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>line upon
line, here a little, and there a
little;</hi> and have by an insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
conveyance received the
gracious inoperations of the
Spirit of God, (though not
without many inward strifes
with temptations, and sad fits
of humiliation for their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
failings) framing them
to all holy obedience, these
cannot expect to finde so sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
alterations in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
As well may the child
know when he was naturally
born, as these may know the
instant of their spirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation;
and as well may
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:58618:59"/>
they see the grasse to grow, as
they can perceive their insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
increase of grace; It is
enough that the child attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the use of reason, now
knowes that he was born:
and that when wee see the
grasse higher then we left it,
we know that it is growne.
Let it then suffice thee, my
son, to know, that the thing
is done, though thou canst
not define the time, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of doing it: Be not curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in matter of particular
perceptions, whiles thou
mayst be assured of the reality
&amp; truth of the grace wrought
in thee: Thou seest the skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Chirurgion, when hee
will make a fontinell in the
body of his patient, he can do
it either by a sudden incision,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:58618:59"/>
or by a leasurely corrasive;
both sort to one end, and
equally tend towards health:
trust God with thy self, and
let him alone with his own
work: what is it to thee
which way he thinks best
to bring about thy salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>

so the securing of this

is this a mercy peculiar
to his domestick followers

shall believe through their

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58618:62"/>
spoken to in them, so sure as
we have names, we may know
them registred in those eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Records above. Not that
we should take an <hi>Acesius</hi> his
Ladder, and climb up into
heaven, and turn over the

and read our selves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to glory: but that as
we by experience see that we
can by reflections see and
read those Letters, which
directly we cannot: So we
may do here, in this highest
of spiritual objects. The
same Apostle that gives us
our charge, gives us withal
our direction:<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 10, 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Wherefore</hi> (saith

                  </gap>, as divers
copies read it; <hi>by good works:)
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58618:62"/>
For if ye do these things, ye shall
never fall: For so an entrance
shall be ministred to you abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
into the everlasting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</hi> Lo, first our
Calling, then our Election:
not that we should begin
with heaven, and thence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
to the earth; (it is
enough for the Angels on
that celestial Ladder of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi>
to both descend, and
ascend:) but that we should
from earth ascend to heaven;
from our Calling to our Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
as knowing that God
shews what he hath done for
us above, by that which he
hath wrought in us here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe.
Our Calling therefore
first; not outward, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
but inward, and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:58618:63"/>
The Spirit of God
hath a voice, and our soul
hath an ear: that voice of
the Spirit speaks inwardly,
and effectually to the ear of
the soul, calling us out of
the state of corrupt Nature,
into the state of Grace; out
of darkness into his marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
light. By thy calling
therefore maist thou judge of
thine election: God never
works in vain, neither doth
he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the common;) But <hi>whom he
did predestinate,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>them also he
called; and whom he called, them
he justified; and whom he justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
them also he glorified.</hi>
This doubtless, thou saist, is
sure in it self; but how is it
assured to me? <hi>Resp.</hi> That
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58618:63"/>
which the Apostle addes, (as
it is read in some copies) <hi>By
good works,</hi> (if therein we also
comprehend the acts of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
and repenting) is a
notable evidence of our ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
But not to urge that
clause, which (though read
in the vulgar) is found want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in our editions; the clear
words of the Text evince
no less; For, if ye do these
things, ye shall never fall:
here is our negative certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
And for onr positive;
So, an entrance shall be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
unto you abundantly
into the everlasting Kingdom
of our Lord and Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ: Lo, if we shall
never fall, if we shall undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
enter into the Kingdom
of Christ; what possible
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58618:64"/>
scruple can be made of the
blessed accomplishment of
our election? What then are
these things, which must be
done by us? Cast your eyes
upon that precious chain of
graces which you shall finde
stringed up in the fore going
words;<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 5, 6.</note> If you <hi>adde to your

knowledge; and to knowledge,
temperance; and to temperance,
patience; and to patience godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and to godliness, brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
kindness, and to brotherly
kindness, charitie.</hi> If you
would know what God hath
written concerning you in
heaven, look into your own

hath there wrought in you:
Truth of grace (saith the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Apostle) will make good
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:58618:64"/>
the certainty of your electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Not to instance in the

is the last; which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends

is not so much what we have,

many have we known that
have grown rich out of a

               <p>Thy son is dead: What
marvel is it, that a mortal
Father hath begot a mortal
Son? Marvel rather, that thy
self hath lived to have or to
lose a son: We lie open to so
many deaths, that our very
subsistence is almost miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
Thou hast lost a piece
of thy self: for what are our
children, but as colonies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from our own flesh?
yea rather, our selves made up
in other models. This loss
cannot but go neer thee:
But tell me, What was the
disposition of the son thou
mournest for? If he were
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:58618:111"/>
graceless and debauched, as
thy shame, so thy sorrow
should die with him: set the
hopes thou mightst have had
of his reclaiming, against the
fears of his continuing, and
increasing wickedness, and
thou couldst have made no
other present account but of
dishonour, and discomfort:
If it be sad that he is taken
away in his wildness; it had
been more heavie, that he
would have added to the
heap of his sin, and therein to
his torments. If he were gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
he had a better Father
then thy self, whose interest
was more in him then thine:
and if that heavenly Father
have thought good to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
him to a crown of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
glory, why shouldst
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:58618:112"/>
thou be afflicted with his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement?
Why shouldst
thou not rather rejoyce that
thy loyns have helped to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
heaven with a Saint?
Were it put to thy choice
that thy son might be called
off from his blessed rest, and
returned to his former earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
relations; couldst thou be
so injurious in thy self-love,
as to wish the misery of so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous
a change to
that soul, which, as it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of thy production, so it
were pity it should be at thy

have thine own soul so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,

Those evils that we have

not be too much troubled
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:58618:113"/>
with the loss of this trivial,
and perishing stuff: Had
these been true goods, they
could not have been lost: for
that good that is least capable
of loss, as it is unsatisfying
in the time of an imperfect
and unsure fruition, so in the
losing it turns evil. Didst
thou not know that <hi>riches
have wings?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 23 5.</note> and what use
is there of wings, if not to flie?
If another mans violence shall
clip those wings, even this
very clipping is their flight.
Set thy heart upon that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and precious wealth
which can never be taken
from thee, which shall never
leave thee, nor thou it, thou
shalt easily slight these poor
losses. As these were not
goods, so they were not

of <hi>Didymus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
who being blinde from his

that being a blinde man
he could steal more cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

of our <hi>Fisher,</hi> that hee was
more dextrous in picking the

and fetching forth the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures

then those that had the shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest
eyes about him; in so
much as it was noted those
were singular Proficients
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:58618:141"/>
which imployed themselves
in reading to him; If they
read Books to him, he read
Lectures the while to them;
and still taught more then he
learned. As for the other
outward senses, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
more exquisite in the
blinde; We read of some who
have been of so accurate a
touch, that by their very
feeling they could distinguish
betwixt black and white;
And for the eare, as<note n="*" place="margin">The Lord <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rul. Fr. Bacon</hi> in his Naturall Historie.</note> our
Philosophers observe, that
sounds are sweeter to the
blind, then to the sighted;

the vertue of both those sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

How couldst thou have had
thy thoughts raised so high,
as to give glory to that great
God, whose infinite power
hath wrought all these mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
things? No doubt,
God hath his own waies of
mercy, even for those that are
born dark; not requiring
what he hath not given; gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
supplying by his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in the vessels of his electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
what is wanting in the
outer-man; so as even those
that could never see the face
of the world, shall see the
face of the God that made it;
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:58618:143"/>
But in an ordinary course of
proceeding, those which have
been blinde from their birth,
must needs want those helps
of knowing and glorifying
God in his mighty works,
which lie open to the seeing:
These once filled thine eies,
and stay with thee still after
thine eies have forsaken thee;
What shouldst thou doe but
walk on in the strength of
those fixed thoughts, and be
alwaies adoring the Majesty
of that God whom that sight
hath represented unto thee so
glorious, and in an humble
submission to his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
strive against all the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforts
of thy sufferings.

               <p>Thou hast lost thy hearing:
It is not easie to determine
whether loss is the greater, of
the Eye, or of the Ear: both
are grievous. Now all the
world is to thee as dumb,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:58618:144"/>

How small a matter hath

are the senses of instruction:
there is no other way for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
to be conveyed to
the soul, whether in secular

Had it pleased God to shut up

there is not so much comfort

they are come to their proof;

have raised our hopes of

them, and doubled our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

(according to the French

cannot lose; so contrarily,
he that hath must lose; our
meeting is not more certain
then our parting; either wee
must leave them, and so their
grief for us must double
ours; or they must leave us,
and so our grief for them
must be no lesse then our
love was of them. If then
thou wilt be truly wise, set
thy heart upon that onely
absolute good, which is not
capable of losing: Divided
affections must needs abate of
their force; now since there

               <head>§ 1. The misery of the want of rest; with the best re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</head>
               <p>THOU art afflicted with
want of sleep: A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
incident to distempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
bodies, and thoughtfull
mindes: Oh how wearisome
a thing it is to spend the
long night in tossing up and
down in a restlesse bed in the
chase of sleep, which the
more eagerly it is followed,
flies so much the farther from
us! Couldst thou obtain of
thy selfe to forbear the desire
of it, perhaps it would come
alone; now that thou suest
for it (like to some froward
peece) it is coy and overly,
and punishes thee with thy
longing: Loe, he that could
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:58618:154"/>
command an hundred and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and twenty Provinces,
yet could not command rest;<note place="margin">Esth 6. 1</note>
                  <hi>On that night his sleep departed
from him;</hi> neither could bee
either forced, or intreated to
his bed. And the great <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian</hi>
Monarch, though hee
laid some hand on sleep, yet
he could not hold it,<note place="margin">Dan 2. 1.</note> for <hi>his
sleep brake from him:</hi> And
for great and wise <hi>Solomon,</hi> it
would not so much as come
within his view,<note place="margin">Eccl. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16</note> 
                  <hi>Neither night
nor day seeth he sleep with his
eyes:</hi> Surely, as there is no
earthly thing more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to nature then bodily
rest,<note place="margin">Jer. 31. 26.</note> so there is nothing
whose losse is more grievous
and disheartning; If the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
be not sometimes in meet
vicissitudes, tied up, how can
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:58618:155"/>
they choose but run them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
out of breath, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and spend themselves to
nothing? If the body be not
refreshed with a moderate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchange
of repose, how can
it but languish in all the parts
of it? and as commonly the
soul followes the temper of
the body, how can that but
finde a sensible discomposure
and debilitation in all her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
and operations? Do
we not see the savagest crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
tamed with want of
rest? Doe we not find this
rack alone to have been tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
enough to fetch from
poor soules a confessionall
discovery of those acts they
never did? Doe we not finde
raveries, and frenzies the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
attendants of sleeples<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:58618:155"/>
Herein therefore thy
tongue hath just cause to
complain of thine eyes. For
remedy, in stead of closing
thy lids to wait for sleep; lift
up thy stiff eyes to him that
<hi>giveth his beloved rest:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ps. 127. 2</note> what
ever be the means, he it is
that holdeth thine <hi>eyes wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psa. 77. 4</note>
He that made thine
eyes, keeps off sleep from
thy body, for the good of thy
soul: let not thine eyes wake
without thy heart. The
Spouse of Christ can say,
<hi>I sleep,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 5. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>but my heart waketh;</hi>
how much more would she
say, Mine eyes wake, and my
heart waketh also? When
thou canst not see sleep with
thine eyes, labour to see him
that is invisible: one glimpse
of that sight is more worth,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:58618:156"/>
then all the sleep that thine
eyes can be capable of: give
thy self up into his hands, to
be disposed of at his will:
What is this sweet acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>escence,
but the rest of the
soul? Which if thou canst
finde in thy self, thou shalt
quietly digest the want of thy
bodily sleep.</p>

a favourable construction, as
conceiving an impossibility
of an absolute sleeplesness
yet if we shall compare it
with other instances of the

that Monsieur <hi>L' Angles,</hi> a

lived no fewer yeers altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

so to fasten our eyes upon the

as not to take in the
advantages that belong to it;
which carefully laid together,
may perhaps sway the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
to an equall poise: Let
it be true that old age is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
with many bodily
griefes; but what if it yeeld
other immunities which

whereof it is not the least,
that it gives us firm resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

For the old man knowes how
little of his clew is left in the
winding, and therefore, when

not much upon so inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
a remainder. Old age
and orbity, as <hi>Cesellius</hi> profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,

hee answered those menaces

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:58618:167"/>
(except we be too much wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

observation of such variety
of actions and events as meet
with us in the whole course

with us such sure rules of
judgement, as may be unfail<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
directions for our selves,

In regard whereof, well
might the old man say, Yee

Certainly, what value soever

this fruit of age is such, as

that the earth hath nothing

In regard whereof, the
Grecians had wont to say,
that young men are for Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
old men for Advice: And
among the Romans we know
that Senators take their name
from age. That therefore
which is the weakness of old
mens eyes, that (their visual
spirits not uniting till some
distance) they better discern
things further off, is the
praise and strength of their
mental eyes; they see either
judgements or advantages
afar off, and accordingly
frame their determinations.
It is observed that old Lutes

him, then of those grave Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators

meer Age is of it self thus
rich in wisdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
but Age well cultured,
well improved: There are
old men that do but live, or
rather have a being upon
earth, (so have stocks and
stones as well as they) who
can give no proof of their
many yeers, but their gray
hairs, and infirmities. There
are those, who, like to <hi>Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,</hi>
are old men, whiles they
are boys; and children, when
they are old men: These, the

a painfull dissolution, but now
since all goe one way, and (as
the wise Philosopher saies)
those which are unequall in

is true that those whom the
last day shall finde alive, shall
not die, but they shall bee
changed; but this change of
theirs shall be no other then
an analogicall death, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
there shall be a speedy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
of all our corrupt

pain must be so much the
more intense, by how much
it is more short then in
the ordinary course of death:
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:58618:176"/>
Briefly, that change is a
Death, and our Death is a
change,<note place="margin">Job 14. 14.</note> as <hi>Job</hi> stiles it; the
difference is not in the pain,
but in the speed of the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action:<note place="margin">Ecclus. 41. 3.</note>
Fear not then the
sentence of death; remember
them that have been before
thee, and that come after, for
this is the sentence of the

why are we troubled with
death, when we believe
that Jesus died? And what
a triumph is this over death,
that the same Jesus who
died, rose again? And what
a comfort it is, that the same
Jesus who arose, shall both
come again, and bring all
his with him in glory? And
lastly, what a strong Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
is this to all good hearts,
that all those which die well,
do sleep in Jesus? Thou

makes us unwilling to die:
Did we think (according to
the cursed opinion of some
fanatick persons) that the
soul sleeps as well as the
body, from the moment of
the dissolution, till the day
of Resurrection: Or did we
doubt lest we should wander
to unknown places where we

cannot be certain of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment;
or did we fear
a scorching trial (upon the
emigration) in flames little
inferiour, for the time) to
those of hell, there were
some cause for us to tremble
at the approach of death:
But now that we can boldly
say, with the Wise man, <hi>`The

               <p>Thou quakest at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of the last Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Surely, the very Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
of that great Assize
must needs be formidable:
And if the very delivery of
the Law on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi>
were with so dreadful a
pomp of Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
of Fire, Smoke, Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes,
that the Israelites

magnificence shall God
come to require an account
of that Law at the hands of
the whole sinful generation
of mankinde? Represent
unto thy thoughts, that which
was shewed of old to the
Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> in Vision:

thousand thousands ministring
unto him, and ten thousand

him; the judgement set,
and the Books opened.</hi> Or as
<hi>John,</hi> the <hi>Daniel</hi> of the New

from whose face the earth and
the heavens fled away, and the

that which these bodily eyes
shall once see; and tell me
how thou feelest thy self af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected

It is thy Saviour that

safe art thou then under such

he will doom thee to death,
who died to give thee life?
Canst thou fear he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
thee for those sins
which he hath given his

thou fear the rigour of that
Justice which he hath so
fully satisfied? Canst thou
misdoubt the miscarriage of
that soul which he hath so

Fashionable suppliants may

he that can truly pray,
can never be truly miserable:
Of our selves we lie open to
all evils; our rescue is from
above; aud what entercourse
have we with heaven but by
our prayers? Our prayers are
they that can deliver us from
dangers, avert judgements,
prevent mischiefs, procure
blessings; that can obtain par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for our sins, furnish us
with strength against tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
mitigate the extremity
of our sufferings, sustain our
infirmities, raise up our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectednesse,
increase our
graces, abate our corruptions,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:58618:214"/>
sanctifie all good things to
us, sweeten the bitternesse of
our afflictions, open the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
of heaven, shut up the
bars of death, vanquish
the powers of hell:
Pray, and be both
safe, and
happy.</p>
