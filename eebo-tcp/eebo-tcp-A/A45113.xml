         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that layes these stripes
upon thee; Hee that made
thee, he that bought thee at
so deare a rate as his owne
blood, it is he that chastiseth
thee; and canst thou think he
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58618:20"/>
would whip thee but for thy
good? Thou art a Father of

with thine owne bowels;
Didst thou ever take the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

smiting that flesh which is
derived from thine owne

now they are stinted, and goe
under commission; neither

hadst thou rather be good,

he that made thee lookes far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into thee then thine owne

that if thy body be not sick,
thy soul will: if he therefore
finde it sit to take downe thy
worse part a little, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
of a mortall danger
to the better, what cause hast
thou to complain, yea, rather
not to be thankfull? When
thou hast felt thy body in a

hast gone to sea on purpose to
make thy self sick; yet thou

I have known those
that have bestowed teares
upon their too much health,
sadly bemoaning the feare and
danger of Gods disfavour for
that they ayled nothing; and
our <hi>Bromiard</hi> tels us of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
man in his time,<note place="margin">Bro. Sum. V. Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitas</note> that
bewailed his continued wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
as no small affliction;
whom soon after God fitted
with pain enough: The poore
man joyed in the change, and
held his sicknesse a mercy;
neither indeed was it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
intended by him that
sent it. Why are we too much
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58618:23"/>
dejected with that, which
others complain to want?
why should we finde that so
tedious to us, which others
have wished? There have
been Medicinal Agues, which
the wise Physitian hath cast
his Patient into, for the cure
of a worse distemper. A se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
and lawless health, how
ever Nature takes it, is the
most dangerous indisposition
of the soul: if that may be
healed by some few bodily
pangs, the advantage is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable.
Look upon some
vigorous Gallant, that in the
height of his spirit, and the
heat of his blood, eagerly
pursues his carnal delights, as
thinking of no heaven, but
the free delectation of his
sense; and compare thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58618:24"/>

<hi>My God, my God, why hast thou

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58618:26"/>
the dear and eternal Son of
his love, our ever blessed Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deemer?
Had not God found
this the way to their heaven,
they had not trod so deep in

to wet our feet where they
waded? Yea, if from these
holy ones, thou shalt turn
thine eyes to some meer Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,

<hi>Epicurus,</hi> the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher;
who on his dying

What should I

who in a glorious revenge
voluntarily burns off his own

envie and pity of his enemies:
or of a <hi>Regulus,</hi> that after so
high a provocation, offers
himself to the worst of the
merciless fury of his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors?
Why shouldst thou
think it strange (saith wise
<hi>Seneca</hi>) that some men should
be well pleased to be scorcht,
to be wounded, to be rackt,
to be kill'd? Frugality is a pain
to the riotous; labour is a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment

studie is a torture to the

are not in their own nature
difficult; but we are feeble,

and shall we Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
droop, and pule under

Heathen souls! they never

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58618:46"/>
sinfull enough to need mercy,
and sorrowfull enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
and receive mercy: Canst
thou but love thy selfe so
well, as that when thou seest
a pardon reached forth to
thee to save thy soule from
death, thou shouldst doe any
other then stretch forth thy
hand to take it? Lo, this hand
stretched forth is thy faith,
which so takes spirituall hold
of thy Saviour, that it cals not
thy sense to witnesse. As for
that assurance thou speakest
of, they are happy that can
truly feel, &amp; maintain it; and
it must be our holy ambition
(what we may) to aspire unto
it; but that is such an height
of perfection, as every travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
in this wretched pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
cannot, whiles he is in
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58618:46"/>
this perplexed, and heavy
way, hope to attain unto: It
is an unsafe and perillous
path, which those men have
walked in, who have been
wont to define all faith by as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance;
Should I lead thee
that way, it might cost thee a
fall; so sure a certainty of our
constant and reflected appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of eternall life, is both
hard to get, and not easie to
hold unmovably; consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the many and strong
temptations that we are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
unto in this vale of mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and death: Should faith be
reduced to this triall, it would
be yet more rare then our
Saviour hath foretold it: For,
as many a one boasts of such
an assurance, who is yet fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of a true faith, (hugging
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58618:47"/>
a vain presumption in stead of
it) so many a one, also, hath
true faith in the Lord Iesus,
who yet complaines to want
this assurance. Canst thou
in a sense of thine owne mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
close with thy Saviour?
canst thou throw thy self into
the arms of his mercy? canst
thou trust him with thy soul,
and repose thy self upon him
for forgivenesse and salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
canst thou lay thy self
before him as a miserable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of his grace and mercy?
and when it is held forth to
thee, canst thou lay some
(though weak) hold upon it?
Labour what thou mayst for
further degrees of strength
daily; set not up thy rest in
this pitch of grace; but, chear
up thy self, my son, even thus
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58618:47"/>
much faith shall save thy soul:
Thou believest; and he hath

my apprehensions of him are
so feeble, as that they can
afford no sound comfort to

were it that thou lookedst to
be justified, and saved by the

power of the very act of thy

disheartened with the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

cannot be abated by thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities)
thou hast cause to
take heart to thy self, and
chearfully to expect his sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
Understand thy case
aright: Here is a double
hand that helps us up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
heaven: our hand of
Faith lays hold upon our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;
our Saviours hand of

lays hold on us: our
hold of him is feeble, and easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58618:48"/>
loosed; his hold of us is
strong, and irresistible. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
thy self therefore, in this,
with the blessed Apostle;
When thou art weak, then
thou art strong; when weak in
thy self, strong in thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.
Shouldst thou boast
of thy strength, and say, Tush,
I shall never be moved; I
should suspect the truth and
safety of thy condition: now
thou bewailest thy weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
I cannot but encourage
and congratulate the happie
estate of thy soul. If work
were stood upon, a strength
of hand were necessary; but
now, that onely taking and
receiving of a precious gift
is required, why may not a
weak hand do that as well as
a strong? as well, though

not as forcibly. Be not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

dead in sins and trespasses;

have onely beguiled the eyes

Thou hast true life of grace

it not: It is no heed
to take of the doom thou
passest upon thy self in the

                     </gap>ychus,</hi>
that fell down from
the third loft, and was taken
up for dead; yet for all that,
his life was in him. We have
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58618:53"/>
known those who have lien
long in trances, withovt any
perception of life; yea, some
(as that subtil <hi>Joannes Duns
Scotus</hi>) have been put into
their graves for fully dead,
when as yet their soul hath
been in them, though unable
to exert those faculties which
might evince her hidden pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.
Such thou mayest be,
at the worst: yea, wert thou
but in charity with thy self,
thou wouldst be found in a
much better condition. There
is the same reason of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
life, and the spiritual:
Life, where it is, is discerned
by breathing, sense, motion:
Where there is the breath of
life, there must be a life that
sends it forth: If then the
soul breathes forth holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58618:54"/>
doubtless there is a life
whence they proceed. Now
deny, if thou canst, that thou
hast these spiritual brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things
of holy desires within
thee? Dost thou not many
a time sigh for thine own
insensateness? Is not thine
heart troubled with the
thoughts of thy want of
grace? Dost thou not truly
desire that God would renew
a right spirit within thee?
Take comfort to thy self; this
is the work of the inward
principle of Gods Spirit
within thee: as well may a
man breathe without life, as
thou couldst be thus affected
without grace: Sense is a
quick discrier of life: pinch
or wound a dead man, he feels
nothing; but the living per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58618:54"/>
the easiest touch.
When thou hast heard the
fearful judgements of God
denounced against sinners,
and laid home to the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
hast thou not found thy
heart pierced with them?
hast thou not shrunk inward,
and secretly thought, How
shall I decline this dreadful
damnation? When thou hast
heard the sweet mercies of
God laid forth to penitent
sinners, hath not thy heart
silently said, Oh that I had
my share in them! When
thou hast heard the Name of
Christ blasphemed, hast thou
not felt a secret horrour in
thy bosom? All these argue
a true spiritual life within
thee. Motion is the most
perfect discoverer of life:
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:58618:55"/>
He that can stir his limbs, is
surely not dead: The feet of
the soul are the Affections:
Hast thou not found in thy
self an hate and detestation
of that sin whereinto thou
hast been miscarried? Hast
thou not found in thy self a
true grief of heart for thy
wretched indisposition to all
good things? Hast thou not
found a secret love to, and
complacency in those whom
thou hast thought truly god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
and conscionable? With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a true life of grace, these
things could never have been:
Are not thine eyes and hands
many times lifted up in an
imploration of mercy? Canst
thou deny that thou hast a
true, though but weak appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
to the means, and further
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58618:55"/>
degrees of grace? What can
this be but that hunger and

which our Saviour hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced

not thy selfe too
much, son, with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
disappearance of grace,
during the hour of thy temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
it is no otherwise with

and the rest of the Apostles;
One man he drawes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

another he drives thither
by a strong hand; we have

mispent their yonger times

courses, living as
without God, yea, against
him, have been suddenly
heart-stricken with some
powerfull denunciation of
judgement, which hath so
wrought upon them that it
hath brought them within
sight of hell; who after long
and deep humiliation, have
been raised up through Gods
mercy, to a comfortable sense
of the divine favour, and
have proceeded to a very high
degree of regeneration, and
lived, and died Saints: But
this is not every mans case;
Those who having from their
infancy been brought up in
the nurture and feare of the
Lord;<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 4.</note> and from their youth
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58618:58"/>
have been trained up under a
godly and conscionable Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery;
where they have
been continually plyed with
the essectuall means of grace;
<hi>Precept upon precept,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isai. 28. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>line upon
line, here a little, and there a
little;</hi> and have by an insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
conveyance received the
gracious inoperations of the
Spirit of God, (though not
without many inward strifes
with temptations, and sad fits
of humiliation for their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
failings) framing them
to all holy obedience, these
cannot expect to finde so sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
alterations in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
As well may the child
know when he was naturally
born, as these may know the
instant of their spirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation;
and as well may
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:58618:59"/>
they see the grasse to grow, as
they can perceive their insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
increase of grace; It is
enough that the child attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the use of reason, now
knowes that he was born:
and that when wee see the
grasse higher then we left it,
we know that it is growne.
Let it then suffice thee, my
son, to know, that the thing
is done, though thou canst
not define the time, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of doing it: Be not curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in matter of particular
perceptions, whiles thou
mayst be assured of the reality
&amp; truth of the grace wrought
in thee: Thou seest the skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Chirurgion, when hee
will make a fontinell in the
body of his patient, he can do
it either by a sudden incision,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:58618:59"/>
or by a leasurely corrasive;
both sort to one end, and
equally tend towards health:
trust God with thy self, and
let him alone with his own
work: what is it to thee
which way he thinks best
to bring about thy salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>

so the securing of this

that concern the well-being

is this a mercy peculiar

shall believe through their

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58618:62"/>
spoken to in them, so sure as
we have names, we may know
them registred in those eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Records above. Not that
we should take an <hi>Acesius</hi> his

heaven, and turn over the

and read our selves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to glory: but that as
we by experience see that we
can by reflections see and
read those Letters, which
directly we cannot: So we
may do here, in this highest
of spiritual objects. The
same Apostle that gives us
our charge, gives us withal
our direction:<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 10, 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Wherefore</hi> (saith

                  </gap>, as divers
copies read it; <hi>by good works:)
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58618:62"/>
For if ye do these things, ye shall
never fall: For so an entrance
shall be ministred to you abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
into the everlasting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</hi> Lo, first our
Calling, then our Election:
not that we should begin
with heaven, and thence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
to the earth; (it is
enough for the Angels on
that celestial Ladder of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi>
to both descend, and
ascend:) but that we should
from earth ascend to heaven;
from our Calling to our Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
as knowing that God
shews what he hath done for
us above, by that which he
hath wrought in us here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe.
Our Calling therefore
first; not outward, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
but inward, and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:58618:63"/>
The Spirit of God
hath a voice, and our soul
hath an ear: that voice of
the Spirit speaks inwardly,
and effectually to the ear of
the soul, calling us out of
the state of corrupt Nature,
into the state of Grace; out
of darkness into his marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
light. By thy calling
therefore maist thou judge of
thine election: God never
works in vain, neither doth
he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the common;) But <hi>whom he
did predestinate,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>them also he
called; and whom he called, them
he justified; and whom he justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
them also he glorified.</hi>
This doubtless, thou saist, is
sure in it self; but how is it
assured to me? <hi>Resp.</hi> That
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58618:63"/>
which the Apostle addes, (as
it is read in some copies) <hi>By
good works,</hi> (if therein we also
comprehend the acts of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
and repenting) is a
notable evidence of our ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
But not to urge that
clause, which (though read
in the vulgar) is found want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in our editions; the clear
words of the Text evince
no less; For, if ye do these
things, ye shall never fall:
here is our negative certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
And for onr positive;
So, an entrance shall be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
unto you abundantly
into the everlasting Kingdom
of our Lord and Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ: Lo, if we shall
never fall, if we shall undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
enter into the Kingdom
of Christ; what possible
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58618:64"/>
scruple can be made of the
blessed accomplishment of
our election? What then are
these things, which must be
done by us? Cast your eyes
upon that precious chain of
graces which you shall finde
stringed up in the fore going
words;<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 5, 6.</note> If you <hi>adde to your
faith, vertue; and to vertue,
knowledge; and to knowledge,
temperance; and to temperance,
patience; and to patience godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and to godliness, brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
kindness, and to brotherly
kindness, charitie.</hi> If you
would know what God hath
written concerning you in
heaven, look into your own
bosom, see what graces he
hath there wrought in you:
Truth of grace (saith the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Apostle) will make good
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:58618:64"/>
the certainty of your electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Not to instance in the
rest of that heavenly combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
do but single out
the first and the last, Faith
and Charity: For Faith, how

is the last; which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends

                  <hi>We love him,

fought so much the more

doth but whet the edge of
true fortitude: Many a one

the offending soul, upon the

he is delivered over
to Satan, that Satan should

are raised to a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
height of godly zeal then
ever. <hi>Corinth</hi> had never been
so rich in grace, if it had not
been defiled with so foul a
crime. Say now, whether this
be not, in effect, thy case?
Shouldst thou ever have so

hadst not been drawn in to
commit it? Shouldst thou
have found in thy self so fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
love to thy God, if it had
not been out of the sense of

his great mercy in remitting
it? Wouldst thou have been
so wary of thy steps as now
thou art, if thou hadst never
slipped? Give glory to God,
my son, whiles thou givest
shame to thy self; and bless
him for the benefit that he
hath been pleased to make of
thine offending him.</p>

I love this complaint
of thine, my son; and tell
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:58618:79"/>
thee, that without this thou
couldst not be in the way of
being happie. Thinkst thou
that those whom thou estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest
more eminent in grace,
make not the same moan that
thou dost? Certainly, they
never had any grace, if they
did not complain to have too
little: Every man best feels
his own wants, and is ready
to pass secret censures upon
himself for that, wherein he
is applauded by others: Even

heart can say,<note place="margin">Psal. 69. 29.</note>

been so wealthy in grace,
if they had been conceited
of greater store: Even in this

with Saint <hi>Paul, When I am

We may believe the

Doubtless so he was: but
his wise resolutions have soon
brought him out: <hi>Let us fall
now into the hand of the
Lord, (for his mercies are
great;) and let me not fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hand of man.</hi> He that
was to send these evils, knew
their value, and the difference
of their malignity: yet he
opposes three days pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
to seven yeers famine,
and three months vanquish<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment:
so much oddes he

there is this alleviation of our

               <p>Thy son is dead: What
marvel is it, that a mortal
Father hath begot a mortal
Son? Marvel rather, that thy
self hath lived to have or to
lose a son: We lie open to so
many deaths, that our very
subsistence is almost miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
Thou hast lost a piece
of thy self: for what are our
children, but as colonies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from our own flesh?
yea rather, our selves made up
in other models. This loss
cannot but go neer thee:
But tell me, What was the
disposition of the son thou
mournest for? If he were
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:58618:111"/>
graceless and debauched, as
thy shame, so thy sorrow
should die with him: set the
hopes thou mightst have had
of his reclaiming, against the
fears of his continuing, and
increasing wickedness, and
thou couldst have made no
other present account but of
dishonour, and discomfort:
If it be sad that he is taken
away in his wildness; it had
been more heavie, that he
would have added to the
heap of his sin, and therein to
his torments. If he were gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
he had a better Father
then thy self, whose interest
was more in him then thine:
and if that heavenly Father
have thought good to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
him to a crown of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
glory, why shouldst
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:58618:112"/>
thou be afflicted with his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement?
Why shouldst
thou not rather rejoyce that
thy loyns have helped to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
heaven with a Saint?
Were it put to thy choice
that thy son might be called
off from his blessed rest, and
returned to his former earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
relations; couldst thou be
so injurious in thy self-love,
as to wish the misery of so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous
a change to
that soul, which, as it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of thy production, so it
were pity it should be at thy
disposing? Rather, labour to
have thine own soul so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
that it may be ready

Those evils that we have

not be too much troubled
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:58618:113"/>
with the loss of this trivial,
and perishing stuff: Had
these been true goods, they
could not have been lost: for
that good that is least capable
of loss, as it is unsatisfying
in the time of an imperfect
and unsure fruition, so in the
losing it turns evil. Didst
thou not know that <hi>riches
have wings?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 23 5.</note> and what use
is there of wings, if not to flie?
If another mans violence shall
clip those wings, even this
very clipping is their flight.
Set thy heart upon that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and precious wealth
which can never be taken
from thee, which shall never
leave thee, nor thou it, thou
shalt easily slight these poor
losses. As these were not
goods, so they were not

               <p>THOU art restrained of
thy Liberty. I cannot
blame thee to be sensible of
the affliction. Liberty is

lost their life to purchase
their liberty? But take heed
lest thou bee either mistaken,
or guilty of thine owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint;
for certainly, thou
canst not bee bereaved of thy
liberty, except thou wilt:
Liberty is a priviledge of the
will; will is a soveraigne
power that is not subject to
either restraint, or constraint:
Hast thou therefore a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
within, a full scope to
thine owne thoughts? It is
not the cooping up of these
outward parts, that can make
thee a Prisoner: Thou art
not worthy of the name of

that is onely it which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
power can reach unto.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:58618:121"/>
Besides, art thou a Christian?
then thou hast learned to
submit thy will to Gods;
Gods will is declared in his
actions; for sure what hee
doth, that hee wills to doe.
If his will bee then to have
thee restrained, why should
it not bee thine? and if it be
thy will to keepe in, what
dost thou complaine of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint?</p>

               <p>Thine eyes are lost; It is a
blessing that once thou hadst
them; hadst thou been born
blinde, what a stranger hadst
thou (in all likelihood) been
to God and the world? hadst
thou not once seen the face of
this heaven, and this earth,
and this Sea, what expressions
could have made thee suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
apprehensive of the
wonderfull works of thy Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator?
What discourse could
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:58618:142"/>
have made thee to understand
what light is? what the Sun
the fountain of it, what the
heavens, the glorious region
of it, and what the Moon and
Starres illuminated by it?
How couldst thou have had
thy thoughts raised so high,
as to give glory to that great
God, whose infinite power
hath wrought all these mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
things? No doubt,
God hath his own waies of
mercy, even for those that are
born dark; not requiring
what he hath not given; gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
supplying by his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in the vessels of his electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
what is wanting in the
outer-man; so as even those
that could never see the face
of the world, shall see the
face of the God that made it;
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:58618:143"/>
But in an ordinary course of
proceeding, those which have
been blinde from their birth,
must needs want those helps
of knowing and glorifying
God in his mighty works,
which lie open to the seeing:
These once filled thine eies,
and stay with thee still after
thine eies have forsaken thee;
What shouldst thou doe but
walk on in the strength of
those fixed thoughts, and be
alwaies adoring the Majesty
of that God whom that sight
hath represented unto thee so
glorious, and in an humble
submission to his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
strive against all the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforts

with them, especially, when
they are come to their proof;
when their parts, and disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
have raised our hopes of
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:58618:153"/>
them, and doubled our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
towards them; And as
(according to the French
Proverb) hee that hath not
cannot lose; so contrarily,
he that hath must lose; our
meeting is not more certain
then our parting; either wee
must leave them, and so their
grief for us must double
ours; or they must leave us,
and so our grief for them
must be no lesse then our
love was of them. If then
thou wilt be truly wise, set
thy heart upon that onely
absolute good, which is not
capable of losing: Divided
affections must needs abate of
their force; now since there
are no objects of dearnesse
which might distract thy love,
bee sure to place it wholly
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:58618:153"/>
upon that infinite goodnesse
which shall entertain it with
mercy, and reward it with
blessednesse. If <hi>Elkanah</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <p>THOU art afflicted with
want of sleep: A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
incident to distempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
bodies, and thoughtfull
mindes: Oh how wearisome
a thing it is to spend the
long night in tossing up and
down in a restlesse bed in the
chase of sleep, which the
more eagerly it is followed,
flies so much the farther from
us! Couldst thou obtain of
thy selfe to forbear the desire
of it, perhaps it would come
alone; now that thou suest
for it (like to some froward
peece) it is coy and overly,
and punishes thee with thy
longing: Loe, he that could
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:58618:154"/>
command an hundred and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and twenty Provinces,
yet could not command rest;<note place="margin">Esth 6. 1</note>
                  <hi>On that night his sleep departed
from him;</hi> neither could bee
either forced, or intreated to
his bed. And the great <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian</hi>
Monarch, though hee
laid some hand on sleep, yet
he could not hold it,<note place="margin">Dan 2. 1.</note> for <hi>his
sleep brake from him:</hi> And
for great and wise <hi>Solomon,</hi> it
would not so much as come
within his view,<note place="margin">Eccl. 8<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 16</note> 
                  <hi>Neither night
nor day seeth he sleep with his
eyes:</hi> Surely, as there is no
earthly thing more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to nature then bodily
rest,<note place="margin">Jer. 31. 26.</note> so there is nothing
whose losse is more grievous
and disheartning; If the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
be not sometimes in meet
vicissitudes, tied up, how can
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:58618:155"/>
they choose but run them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
out of breath, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and spend themselves to
nothing? If the body be not
refreshed with a moderate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchange
of repose, how can
it but languish in all the parts
of it? and as commonly the
soul followes the temper of
the body, how can that but
finde a sensible discomposure
and debilitation in all her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
and operations? Do
we not see the savagest crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
tamed with want of
rest? Doe we not find this
rack alone to have been tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
enough to fetch from
poor soules a confessionall
discovery of those acts they
never did? Doe we not finde
raveries, and frenzies the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
attendants of sleeples<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:58618:155"/>
Herein therefore thy
tongue hath just cause to
complain of thine eyes. For
remedy, in stead of closing
thy lids to wait for sleep; lift
up thy stiff eyes to him that
<hi>giveth his beloved rest:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ps. 127. 2</note> what
ever be the means, he it is
that holdeth thine <hi>eyes wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psa. 77. 4</note>
He that made thine
eyes, keeps off sleep from
thy body, for the good of thy
soul: let not thine eyes wake
without thy heart. The
Spouse of Christ can say,
<hi>I sleep,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 5. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>but my heart waketh;</hi>
how much more would she
say, Mine eyes wake, and my
heart waketh also? When
thou canst not see sleep with
thine eyes, labour to see him
that is invisible: one glimpse
of that sight is more worth,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:58618:156"/>
then all the sleep that thine
eyes can be capable of: give
thy self up into his hands, to
be disposed of at his will:
What is this sweet acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>escence,
but the rest of the
soul? Which if thou canst
finde in thy self, thou shalt
quietly digest the want of thy
bodily sleep.</p>

               <p>It is not a little injurious
so to fasten our eyes upon the
discommodities of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
as not to take in the
advantages that belong to it;
which carefully laid together,
may perhaps sway the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
to an equall poise: Let
it be true that old age is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
with many bodily
griefes; but what if it yeeld
other immunities which
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:58618:164"/>
may keep the scales even?
whereof it is not the least,
that it gives us firm resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and bold security against
dangers and death it selfe;
For the old man knowes how
little of his clew is left in the
winding, and therefore, when
just occasion is offered, sticks
not much upon so inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
a remainder. Old age
and orbity, as <hi>Cesellius</hi> profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
were those two things
that emboldened him. And
when <hi>Castritius</hi> refused to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
the hostages of <hi>Placentia</hi>
to <hi>Carbo</hi> the Consul, and was
threatned with many swords,
hee answered those menaces
with his many yeares. And
that wee may not disdain
home-bred instances, and
may see that brave spirits may
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:58618:164"/>
lodge in cottages; In my time
a plain Villager in the <hi>Rude
Peake,</hi> when theeves taking
advantage of the absence of
his family, breaking into his
solitary dwelling, and finding
him sitting alone by his fire
side, fell violently upon him;
and one of them setting his
dagger to his heart, swore
that he would presently kill
him, if he did not instantly
deliver to them that money
which they knew he had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
received; the old man
looks boldly in the face of
that stout Villain, and with an
undaunted courage returnes
him this answer in his Peakish
Dialect, Nay, even put fro
thee, sonne, I have lived
long enough, but I tell thee,
unlesse thou mend thy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:58618:165"/>
thou wilt never live to
see halfe my daies; put fro
thee if thou wilt. What
young man would have been
so easily induced to part with
his life, and have been so rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to give entertainment to
an unexpected death? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the hope and love of life
commonly softens the spirits
of vigorous youth, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades
it from those enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises
which are attended
with manifest perill; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
extream age teacheth us
to contemn dangers.</p>

               <p>Yet a greater priviledge of
age is a freedome from those
impetuous passions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
youth is commonly
over-swayed; for together
with our naturall heat is also
abated the heat of our inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:58618:165"/>
lusts, so as now our wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
appetite may easily be
subdued to reason: The tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
old man in the Story,
when one shewed him a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
face, could answer, I
have long since left to be eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick:
And that other could
say of pleasure, I have gladly
with drawn my self from the
service of that imperious mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse.
What an unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
vassalage our youthfull
lusts subject us unto, we need
no other instance then in the
strongest, and wisest man;
How was the strongest man
<hi>Sampson</hi> effeminated by his

               <p>Adde hereunto the benefit
of experimentall knowledge,
wherewith age is wont to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
us, every dram whereof
is worth many pounds of the
best youthly contentments;
in comparison whereof, the
speculative knowledge is
weak and imperfect; this, may
come good cheap, perhaps
costs us nothing; that, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
we pay deare for, and
therefore is justly esteemed
the more precious: If experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
be the mistresse of fools,
I am sure it is the mother of
wisedome; neither can it be
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:58618:167"/>
(except we be too much wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to our selves) but the long
observation of such variety
of actions and events as meet
with us in the whole course
of our life, must needs leave
with us such sure rules of
judgement, as may be unfail<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
directions for our selves,
and others: In vain shall this
be expected from our youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
yeares, which the wise
Philosopher excludes from
being meet Auditors, much
lesse Judges of true morality:
In regard whereof, well
might the old man say, Yee
young men think us old men
fooles, but we old men know
you young men to be fooles:
Certainly, what value soever
ignorance may put upon it,
this fruit of age is such, as
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:58618:167"/>
that the earth hath nothing
equally precious. It was a
profane word, and fit for the
mouth of an Heathen Poet,
That Prudence is above De<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stiny:
But surely, a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
may modestly and justly
say, That, next to Divine
Providence, Humane Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
may challenge the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
place in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of these earthly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs;
and that Age may claim
the greatest interest in that
Prudence: Young <hi>Elihu</hi> could

                  <hi>Multitude of yeers should

                  <hi>Oh how comely a thing

Oh how comely is the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

and counsel to men of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour!</hi>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:58618:168"/>
In regard whereof, the
Grecians had wont to say,
that young men are for Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
old men for Advice: And
among the Romans we know
that Senators take their name
from age. That therefore
which is the weakness of old
mens eyes, that (their visual
spirits not uniting till some
distance) they better discern
things further off, is the
praise and strength of their
mental eyes; they see either
judgements or advantages
afar off, and accordingly
frame their determinations.
It is observed that old Lutes
sound better then new: and
it was <hi>Rehoboam</hi>'s folly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing,<note place="margin">1 Kings 12. 6, 7, 8<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 9, 10, &amp;c.</note>
that he would rather
follow the counsel of his
green heads that stood before
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:58618:168"/>
him, then of those grave Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators
that had stood before
his wiser father. Not that
meer Age is of it self thus
rich in wisdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
but Age well cultured,
well improved: There are
old men that do but live, or
rather have a being upon
earth, (so have stocks and
stones as well as they) who
can give no proof of their
many yeers, but their gray
hairs, and infirmities. There
are those, who, like to <hi>Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,</hi>
are old men, whiles they
are boys; and children, when
they are old men: These, the
elder they grow, are so much
more stupid. Time is an ill
measure of age, which should
rather be meted by proficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
by ripeness of judgement,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:58618:169"/>
by the monuments of our
commendable and useful la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
If we have thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
our selves, our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn
will shew what our
Spring was; and the colour of
our hair will yeeld us more
cause to fear our pride then

               <p>Thou art troubled with the

hast thou to be afflicted with
that which is the common
condition of mankinde? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,

                  <hi>Behold,

thou be so fond as to think
there should be a by-path left
for thee, wherein thou mayst
tread alone? Were it so that

mightst perhaps finde some
pretence of reason to repine at

a painfull dissolution, but now
since all goe one way, and (as
the wise Philosopher saies)
those which are unequall in
their birth,<note place="margin">Sen. Ep. 91.</note> are in their deaths
equal, there can be no ground
for a discontented murmure:
Grudge if thou wilt,<note place="margin">Psal. 89. 49.</note> that thou
art a man,<note place="margin">Psal. 90. 3, 5, 7.</note> grudge not that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

is true that those whom the

not die, but they shall bee
changed; but this change of
theirs shall be no other then

it is more short then in

Briefly, that change is a
Death, and our Death is a

why are we troubled with
death, when we believe
that Jesus died? And what
a triumph is this over death,
that the same Jesus who
died, rose again? And what
a comfort it is, that the same
Jesus who arose, shall both
come again, and bring all
his with him in glory? And
lastly, what a strong Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

that all those which die well,
do sleep in Jesus? Thou

have we with heaven but by

they that can deliver us from
dangers, avert judgements,
prevent mischiefs, procure
blessings; that can obtain par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don

with strength against tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
mitigate the extremity

increase our
graces, abate our corruptions,

sanctifie all good things to
us, sweeten the bitternesse of
our afflictions, open the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
of heaven, shut up the

the powers of hell:
Pray, and be both
