            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>A Very smal Head is a proper Indication of a vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Brain, and yet a great Head doth not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily declare a strong Brain; If there be no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Much Meat and Drink fills their Bodies full of Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion, Wind, and Stitches, Quotidian Agues and Dropsies, Falling sickness and Gouts, Rhewms and Catharres.</p>
                        <p>Much Exercise is very healthful for them unless they love their laziness better than their health, for by that means gross Humors are made thin and expelled by sweat, the Memory is quickned and the Skin clarified.</p>

               <p>I Saw another, the whol habit of whose Body gave In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications of Flegm, and yet every day he vomited red Choller, I thought good to view the Excrements of his Belly, and I could see but little Choller appear in them, wherefore I conjectured that the passage which carried the Chollerick humor to the Bowels was either very strait or stopped, and we know this appears by the Skin in many, as in such as have the yellow Jaundice, and it is also found in the dissection of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Creatures, and therefore he that desires to be expert in the knowledg of such things, let him be much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant at Dissections, so shall he gain much knowledg and reap much profit by it, we wrote of these severally before, we only make mention of some examples of it here, that so men might be the more inflamed with a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The like you may say of meat and drink and all the rest, being given in due measure and quality, when the Body needs them, they are healthful, but necessity, measure, and quality erring, they assalt Nature to thrust her out of her House of Clay (or slime which you will.)</p>
               <p>If you please you may ad Time as a Companion to all these, for none but a Blockhead will doubt, but if both quantity and quality of such things as Nature needs, be administred at an unfitting time, the occasion of time may be the occasion of illness to the Body, for seeing the Body of man is very subject to change, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore somtimes it needs one, somtimes another help.</p>
               <p>Therefore seeing in these very intentions, some cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are Healthful, we will make some repetition of what belongs to our purpose, when the Air is temperate to a


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56672:46"/>
Body of the best Constitution, a moderate quantity both of meat and drink, sleeping and watch, motion and rest, &amp;c. is convenient, but when the Air is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper'd, you must vary the rest accordingly, that so the Body may neither shake for cold, nor sweat for heat; as for motion, when your body begins to be weary, leave off exercise; the quantity of food is known by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectness of digestion, and the excrements avoided ought to be according to the quantity of the food taken in, for a good Nature appetites no more than it concocts, and the contrary shews a failing in Nature; also Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture when it is strong is able to set bounds to sleep, and when the Body needs no more, the man wakes, there is no failing in the Excrements, of Urine, Dung &amp;c. and if you consider this but well, you may easily see such a man is not easily moved by affections of the mind, <hi>viz.</hi> Anger, sadness, fury, fear, envy &amp;c. for these alter the Body from its natural state.</p>

                  <p>Fourthly, Scituation of the place alters the Air. For,

                        <item>3. Restrictive meats eaten first, are subject to hinder such from digestion as are eaten afterwards, and thereby cause them to putrefie in the Stomach.</item>
                        <item>4. If you consider the two former Aphorisms, you may easily find the reason of the first.</item>

               <p>THe Opinion of <hi>Epicurus</hi> was, that it was Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthful for man to come to the School of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>; but indeed and in truth, the Exercise is beneficial, if a due interval of time be observed: And this you may know, if the man find himself the better and not the worse after the Act. As for the time to such business, Let not the Body be too full nor too empty, too hot nor too cold, too dry nor too moist; and if you must err in in one of these, err as little as you can: And because u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually errors are in such case, let the Body be rather hot than cold, full than empty, moist than dry: Before you come to the School of <hi>Venus,</hi> go to the School of <hi>Mars,</hi> namely, Exercise your Body before you take councel of the under sheet, and so exercise it that you do not tire, it: If your Constitution be good, you need not fear the Exercise of your Constitution can be otherwaies: If there be deficiency in your Body, it is no wonder if you reade it in your Child. We have given you notice how you may know the deficiencies of your own Body; and we have spoken of them severally in other Works of ours: If the Temperature of the Body differ from Health, the effects of the same Temperature must differ as much from the desired end; and in that take a few Rules to help your selves.</p>
               <p>Hot Bodies desire hot Nourishments, cold Bodies cold Nourishments, dry Bodies dry Nourishments, and


<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56672:53"/>
moist Bodies moist Nourishments, and the reason is because every like is maitained by his like: Therefore Whereas Motion, want of Nourishment, Watching, a Loosness, and Discontent, dry the Body and procure Diseases thence coming, the contrary to these moisten the Body, for likes rejoyce in their likes, and keep the Bodies in their Temperature; and this we speak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Bodies Healthful. The inequality of these is the breach of Health in the Body of man, the way to correct which we have spoken of before, only somthing we shall now ad, If the Body be offended by much Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, we ought to correct it by Exercise, but this is to be done by degrees, for Nature abhors all sudden change; Understand the like by a Body weakned by too much Exercise, as also by other things not natural, which we spake of in the last Chapter.</p>
               <p>Also it may so come to pass, that the Stomach may be colder than it ought to be, and yet the Brain at the same time, hotter than its due temper, in such a case, you must remedy them both with Medicines proper for them: Do the like by other parts of the Bodie when they are hotter, colder, drier, or moister than they ought to be.</p>

               <p>AS concerning Healthful Causes of the Instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal parts of the Body, some consist in want of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in Formation, others in want of error in Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, Number, and Scituation.</p>
               <p>In Formation many errors happen, both in the fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the part, and if there be any Cavity in it, when it differs from the Golden Mean in the Passage, Mouth, Roughness or Smooth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ess; these if they differ but little from what naturally they ought to be, may deserve the appellation of [Healthful] but if much they may safely be called Unhealthful, but if the difference be so great that the part cannot perform its operation, it may truly be said to be sick.</p>
               <p>Also difference must be made in the Quantity of the Defect, as also in the Number, whether one or mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>, or how many of the parts be deficient; as also what the Scituation of the deficient part is.</p>
               <p>The Differences then of these are four;

                     <item>1. Such whose Instrumental parts are in a due Decorum.</item>
                     <item>2. Such as differ but little from it, and therefore may also be called Healthful.</item>

                  <hi>viz.</hi> such as are crooked or the like, while the Child is yet yong and tender, they may be reduced to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural habit, by binding or such like means, but when once the Child is grown up and the parts hardened, 'tis impossible to reduce them, and indeed all errors in the Body are easier to be amended whilst the Body grows than afterwards, for then (according to the Opinion of most Phyfitians) there is no place left for Remedy.</p>
               <p>As for such Members as exceed their due proportion in bigness may be reduced by resting, and convenient binding of them; also Members may be encreased by motion, and moderate rubbing, for that calls the Blood to the place.</p>
               <p>All defective parts which have their Original through Blood, are not impossible to be corrected or restored; but such parts of the Body as are Spermatical, or have their Original by Seed, are either altogether impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be restored or very neer the point, although a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous matter grow in their places, which performs the same office they did.</p>
               <p>In all these Nature is the Work-woman, and the Physitian but her Servant.</p>
               <p>Also somtimes two or three Vices may accompany one and the same Part, as in him that we told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that had a smal and round Stomach, and neer the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> for in him both Magnitude, Formation, and Scituation were depraved, and the greatest Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialness in the world could never bring this to a natural habit, for if his Stomach were never so little full, diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of breathing followed, therefore his only Remedy was to take little meat and drink at a time, and to take it often. And he which we told you of, that had an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction in his Liver by reason of the narrowness of the Vessels, and extenuating diet was found out for his Remedy.</p>

               <p>THe Art of Curing hath one common Intention, which is taking away that which is contrary to the Cure, and all such Causes as bring Health do no more; Also the disposition of every part to be cured is to be considered, hot distempers are to be cuted by cold causes, cold by hot causes; for if whatsoever be immoderate thwart Nature, and whatsoever is mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

help Nature, then of necessity, whatsoever is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate one way, must be brought to Mediocrity by its contrary immoderate, and this may be done two waies, either according to power or according to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination; according to power when a thing is really so, according to imagination, when we conceit a thing to be so as it is not: Of these things we have spoken in our Vertues of Simple Medicines.</p>
               <p>As for the Cure of such Diseases as are already inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to the Body, we must regard the cause of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease; put case for example, a Feaver ariseth of putrified Humors, The Indication of Cure is, <hi>Evac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>Also the part of the Body is to be considered, that so the coldness of the Medicine may make the afflicted part no colder than it ought to be; if the Disease lie in a remote part of the Body, the Medicine ought so to be formed that it lose not its Vertue before it come to that

               <p>Also the matter or substance of the offending Humor must be heeded, for if it be thick it cannot penetrate to the extream parts of the Body, and in such cases you must use Medicines that are of a cutting quality.</p>

               <p>THe breaking of a Bone is a Solution of continuity in it; A Bone broken in two cannot be made one again, but is only united by a Callous, a Callous is made of the very same Nourishment that Nourisheth the Bone, and some hold that the Bones of a Child whilst they are yong and tender will unite without a Callous.</p>
               <p>Usually when a Bone is broken, the Muscles which lie neer it suffer also, therefore the intention of Cure is double, one which regards the Bone its self, the other which regards the parts of the Body neer the Bone which is broken, the latter you find the way of Cure in the foregoing Chapter.</p>
               <p>Because as we told you all Bones are united by Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, you ought to supply Nature with a convenient su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity to make this, and withal to observe a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Decorum both in respect of the Qantity and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of it, and according as you find the fracture to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with moisture or driness, so to prescribe a diet either drier or moister as you see fit.</p>

               <p>SEing Nerves and Tendons are of such exquisite sence, the pricking of either of them is very subject to produce Convulsions, and the reason is, because no expiration can come outwardly from those parts; to prevent it, then you have no other Remedy than to open the Wound and dry it up with Medicines of such thin substance as can penetrate even to the very bottom of the Nerve.</p>

                  <p>The usual practice of the Chyrurgians of our time in such cases is to cut the Nerve, and so suffer the Patient to lose the use of that Member; but I suppose if you heedfully read my <hi>English Physitian,</hi> you may find a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer way to the Wood.</p>

               <head>Chap. 95. Of Roughness and Smoothness.</head>
               <p>VVHat parts of the Body soever have lost their natural habit by roughness, natural smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is to be restored to them, and this (be it to the Bones, Arteries or Tongue) is to be done by mild and moistning Remedies, which have no biting quality at al in them.</p>
               <p>Again, Other parts of the Body have or may have a smoothness in them which is not Natural, roughness is to be recovered to such, by Medicines which clense and somthing bind, but if there be Obstructions and narrowness of the passages withal, use first such Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines as cut tough Humors.</p>
               <p>If there be a mixture of any of these Diseases, let there be the like in the Medicines, it is sufficient to give one Example, for that's the Rule we follow in all our Works: Suppose a multitude of Blood flow to some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Member, that not only the greater but also the lesser Veins of that Member are extended, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the cleerness of the Skin are cleerly seen; 'tis


<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56672:59"/>
to be supposed, that other Vessels that cannot be seen are stretched also; now the danger is lest that which is sweat out through the Vessels be spilled in the void pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the midst of the Body: Now the Cure of this must be done by Evacuation, or to write plainer English by Emptying, because the Disease proceeds of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate filling of the part, but yet this Humor thus passed into the Cavities of the Body will never be brought out that way while the world stands, therefore all Evacuation cannot be made at the part of the Body offended if the whol Body be overfilled, for if we use Scarrifications or Incisions, we shall draw the more thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by reason of the pain; if we should attempt to scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it by heat, the heat would draw more to it than it scatters away; If we go about to drive it back, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being full admits no such motion; in such a case then you must first evacuate the whol Body, then meddle with the particular part afflicted afterwards, first repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Humor and then dispersing of it.</p>
               <p>And this know, The less the Humor is, the sooner 'tis evocuated, cooling and binding Remedies repell <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>If you conjecture any offending Humor yet retained in the part, first search whether it be thick or thin, that so you may expel it either with or without cutting Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.</p>
               <p>Alwaies have a care of hot Medicines if the patient part be towards the upper part of the Body, because they send Vapors upwards; therefore in such cases let the heat of the Medicine be but mean, and if it be a little moist withal, it can cause no pain, but if you would disperse any humor from the lower parts of the Body let the Medicine be strong lest it lose its strength before it come at the afflicted part, neither need you fear the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior


<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56672:59"/>
parts will be afflicted by such Medicines, seeing the cause of the affliction lies not in them, neither are the Medicines to be apropriated to them.</p>
               <p>Then consider, That the parts afflicted by such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>luxions, some are rare, loose and soft by Nature, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers thick and hard by Nature, the former are easily emptied, you must use sharper Remedies to the latter.</p>
               <p>The Indications then must be taken, both from the substance of the afflicted part, and also, from the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and Scituation of it: for example, if it happen so, that the Liver be afflicted by Humors in the small Vessels thereof, which Humors are thin viscuous, thick or superaboundant; Is it not the readiest way, first to separate these by extenuating meats and drinks, and change them into another substance? Then in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, to empty those by passages which are large, and not by those that are narrow, whereas you cannot bring them thither without extenuating, for there are large passages [<hi>Meatus</hi>] in the Liver as well as narrow, which pass to the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> as the narrow doth to the <hi>Vena Porta</hi>: It is no such difficult matter then when Humors are thick and tough in the Liver to evacuate them, by drawing them to the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> by such Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines as have a drawing quality, that so they may be cast out by Urine.</p>
               <p>But besides these, here is another Indication to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Liver it self; Suppose it be so weakned by moistning Medicines, or Cataplasms, that it is unabled not only to perform its own Office, but weakens the Veins also; in such a case you must mix some binding things with your Medicines, but seeing the Liver lies so low, 'tis some Question whether the binding Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines be not weakned before they come at it, unless they be mixed with some things else of more subtil parts, as
