            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PSALM CV. 5.</bibl>
               <q>Remember his Marvellous Works that he hath done
his Wonders, and the Judgments of his Mouth.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE chief design of the Anniversaries, as well
as of the Rituals instituted by <hi>Moses,</hi> was
to oblige the Jewish Nation frequently to
reflect upon the wonderful Characters of
Gods love and care of them, and the
Signal Miracles wrought for their Preservation and Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.
Upon the returns of those Days, and upon the
performance of many Rites, which had no clear signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
in themselves, it was natural for the younger,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101265:5"/>
and the more ignorant among them, to ask what the
meaning of those things was? And then the Fathers and
Masters of Families made them long and particular
Recitals of their Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> on the days
of their <hi>Paschal Festivity,</hi> of their Station at <hi>Mount Sinai;</hi>
and the Promulgation of the Law, at their <hi>Pentecost;</hi> and
of their march through the Wilderness, on the Feast
of <hi>Tabernacles;</hi> and with the Commemoration of those
Signal Transactions, they were to mix Reflections on
their Religion and Laws, their Obligations to adhere
to the one, and to conform themselves to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>This was the provision that God made for keeping
that People always in mind of his Goodness to them,
and of their Duty to him, besides the Weekly returns of
their <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> and the Monthly returns of their <hi>New-Moons.</hi>
Those Festivities were of <hi>Seven</hi> or <hi>Eight</hi> days a
piece: And all the People of the Land assembled then
at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and spent that time in Discoursing over
those Memorable Transactions.</p>
            <p>The Rituals of their Worship at the Temple on these
days, were likewise suited to the ends of those Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and several of <hi>Davids</hi> Psalms were probably inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
as Hymns to be Sung at those times for heightning
the Solemnities of the Feast, and for infusing those mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
deeper, both into the Memories and the Affections
of the People. In the daily Worship of the <hi>Iews,</hi> they
made use only of a small number of the <hi>Psalms,</hi> the
greatest part of them being composed upon some of the
eminent turns of <hi>Davids</hi> own Life: But others relate to
remoter and more general Matters. This and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101265:5"/>
               <hi>Psalms,</hi> seem to have been penned for the <hi>Passeover:</hi>
This carries on the Thread of Gods Providences towards
their Fathers, till they came out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> The next be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
at the Wonders wrought in the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> to which
he adds a lively Recital of their Ingratitude, Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and frequent Murmurings: The one <hi>Psalm</hi> tending
as much to humble that Nation, with a Representation
of the Sins of their Fore fathers, as the other exalted
them with Reflections on Gods care and love to their
Ancestors, that had appeared in such Surprising-Instances.
Both these <hi>Psalms</hi> are introduced and ended with such e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levating
Expressions, that could not but very much affect
the <hi>Israelites,</hi> as oft as they repeated them, or heard
them Sung in the Temple.</p>
            <p>In the words of my Text, we have, in short, the chief
Duty of those and all other Festivities: They tend to
raise our Minds towards God, to acknowledge and adore
his Providence, <hi>Remember his Marvellous Works that he
hath done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Wonders:</hi> Some have thought that one of
these words belongs to the <hi>Miracles</hi> that were wrought
for that People, and that the other belongs to those <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Providences</hi> that had watched over them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
them; but there may perhaps be too much nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in this, for as both the <hi>Words</hi> seem to relate to <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
the History here related to being one continued
Scene of <hi>Miracles,</hi> so it is an ordinary piece of Beauty in
Poetry, especially when it is designed for Musick, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the same thing by different words; and therefore
I shall not strain these too nicely: But while they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
the <hi>Miracles</hi> that God had wrought, in order
to the bringing them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> they were not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
the <hi>Iudgments of his Mouth</hi> or <hi>Face,</hi> that is, the Laws
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101265:6"/>
which were delivered on <hi>Mount Sinai;</hi> first to <hi>Moses Face</hi>
to <hi>Face,</hi> and to the whole Nation in that Majestick ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
which rested on the top of the Mountain,
and in that dreadful Promulgation, which did not only
terrifie the <hi>Israelites,</hi> but <hi>Moses</hi> himself, who though
more accustomed to Divine Manifestations did <hi>Fear
and Tremble exceedingly. Iudgments</hi> being one of those
words that are used promiscuously with <hi>Laws, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,</hi>
and <hi>Commandments,</hi> as appears through the whole
129 <hi>Psalm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These words thus opened, do plainly lead us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the right end, and true use of Anniversaries,
which is to have the Impressions of Gods govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the World infixed deeply upon us; by consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the more eminent steps of his Providence, that
from thence we may be brought under a deeper
Sence of our Obligations and Duty to him. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
frequently in our minds, the Blessings that have
descended either upon that Church and Nation to
which we belong, and in whose prosperity every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
has a share; or more particularly upon our
selves, is a Duty of Religion which is sounded upon
the common Principles of Gratitude and Justice. If
the favours that we receive from one another, ought
to be frequently thought on by us, to beget in us
due acknowledgments, and to oblige us to suitable
returns, then by a higher Parity of Reason, we
ought to raise our minds to a very frequent revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of those great and unvaluable Blessings, that
have in so distinguisht a manner, been now for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years the happy Lot of this <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Nation.</hi>
An<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as every Man will find in the Series of his own small
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101265:6"/>
concerns, much matter of Reflection and Praise,
when he considers that watchful Providence that
has hovered over him, that has by an indiscerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
conduct, carried him by many Dangers, which
he seemed to be courting, and into which he had
precipitated himself, if that good Hand had not
diverted the danger from him, or him from it:
Often dangers being past before we were so much
as aware of them. The good things that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
come to us often very unexpectedly, by unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
means, and by a Conjuncture that we had
neither laid, nor so much as ever looked for: In
short, every Man, who does attentively and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
observe the Methods of Providence towards
him, will be soon able to furnish himself with
much matter of Meditation here: But I am now
upon a more general Subject, of considering the
Reflections that we ought to make on those Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
that come down upon greater Bodies in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;
which Anniversaries are designed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate.</p>
            <p>Here is an exercise of Religion which is beyond no
mans compass of thought or capacity. A little memory
to lay things together, and a small measure of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to observe the visible causes and consequences of
them, will serve turn here; some may descend to more
particulars than others, and may reason more exactly;
but every man is capable of thought enough upon this
head, to beget in him a sense of the power and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
the justice and goodness of God, in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the World. A man needs no great stock of
knowledge, nor much fineness of thought to go far
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101265:7"/>
here; and as this sort of exercise is within every mans
reach, so it has not in it that irksomness that hangs often
upon other duties, such as publick or private wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
the sorrowings of repentance, or earnestness in
prayer: this goes more with the grain, there is no pain
but a very considerable pleasure in it. All History, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
what is secret and instructing, is pleasant, but
most of all are such Remarks from History as repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the Church and Kingdom to which we belong as
the special Subjects of a favourable Providence. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
and self-love may carry us too far on this head,
and make us construe things too advantageously of our
own side, and stretch them too much; imagining per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
that to be the indication of a more particular
care, which was only the effect of a general Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
but even this bias upon us, to carry our Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
further then things will bear, makes it out,
that such Meditations are exercises that give much more
pleasure than pain. Sometimes I confess a black prospect
and a gloomy face of things, may be on the other hand
as unreasonably aggravated by men of melancholly
tempers: yet even in that case, the remembring past
deliverances gives livelier and more promising hopes, so
that this may be well reckoned the easiest and pleasantest
exercise of Religion, nor is there any one more useful:
nothing shews the folly of Man, and the wisdom of
God more eminently, then when we set them together:
nothing shews the corruptions of the Human Nature,
and mercies of the Divine more conspicuously, nothing
mitigates the sharpness of our afflictions, nor tempers
our mind in prosperity so much as our depending
upon Providence and ascribing the good things that
happen to its influence, and not claiming too great a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101265:7"/>
share in them to our selves; nothing tempers the mind
so equally in every turn and sta<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of life, as the Belief
of God's go<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erning the World, and the turning our
thoughts frequently to serious reflections upon it.</p>
            <p>I will not enter here upon that deep, but mysterious,
and often abused Argument of Providence. I suppose
you do all believe it; for indeed if you believe it not,
you believe nothing in Religion, to any purpose: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this, our Prayers and Praises would come within a
very small compass: our faith and hope would be much
narrower; and our love to God would be much blunted,
if we brought our selves once to think, that all things
go in a chain, that there are no special directions in the
conduct of this World; but that <hi>Chance</hi> or <hi>Fate</hi> dispence
every thing; either with inexorable sullenness or in a
tumultuary levity; We must in consequence to such
perswasions let our selves loose from all the restraints
and all the seriousness of Religion: but instead of
these, how ungrateful soever they may be to undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplined
minds, we should have nothing to ballance, to
fix or to govern us, but should be toss'd from wave
to wave. We should either have the black Cloud of
hard fate hang over us, or be in the constant fears of
the next bad chance, which might in a minute throw
down all that former good ones had built up. A
man that does not believe a Providence has no
support from a better prospect in his ill circumstances,
nor are his good ones secured to him by any hope
of their continuance: whereas he who believes that
all things are directed by infinite wisdom and goodness,
receives the good things that fall to him with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
tenderness; because they seem to be the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101265:8"/>
indications of the love of his heavenly Father to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him; and he expects that they shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to him, as long as it is fit that he should hold
them, that is, as long as they are real blessing to him;
and he desires to keep them no longer, and on no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
terms: he does not sink under calamities; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders
them as medicinal things sent to reform him or
to try his vertues, and to make some publick Essay
of the force and firmness of his faith and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>To all this, that demonstrates how much a happier
thing it is for Mankind to be under the belief of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
then otherwise, I will only add one conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
that wise men have observed in many different
Ages and Climates of the World; and which they
have thought no small confirmation of this great
Article of Religion; that at some times a strange Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
seems to run through whole Nations an<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities,
which can hardly be either resisted or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.
A great Impetus and Fermentation works
powerfully for a while, and then goes off, without
any visible cause that appears, either for its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
or for its ending. The same occasions that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
such a temper at one time, will not have the
same effect at another; an irresistible courage does
sometimes rise in great Bodies, as unaccountably as it
falls. The servour with which the Reformation began
was not more extraordinary, than the flatness under
which it has fallen in this Age, and the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
heat and giddiness that spread it self over these
Nations in the beginning of the wars, was not more
amazing than the calm conclusion in which they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101265:8"/>
ended at last, which is the blessing that we do now
commemorate, and on which I do now enter.</p>
            <p>But as the <hi>Iews</hi> did at the <hi>Paschal Solemnity</hi>
carry back the recapitulation of their deliverance
out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to God's first calling <hi>Abraham</hi> out
of the Land of the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> so that we may
make fuller and clearer reflections on the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
of God to this <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Nation,</hi> in the
protection and prosperity of the <hi>Royal Family,</hi> and
that in the same view, we may observe those
extraordinary steps of Providence, that have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
both towards the <hi>Crown</hi> and the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and at once, both consider <hi>his Wonders,</hi> and
<hi>the Iudgments of his Mouth,</hi> suffer me to begin my
Recital of some more Signal Providences, as high
as the first beginnings of the Reformation.</p>
            <p>Before that time, our Princes were but half
Kings, a Forreign Power ruled over the Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of their People: The <hi>Immunities</hi> of <hi>Places</hi> and
<hi>Persons</hi> were great checks to their Authority. The
best part of the Soil, and much of the Wealth and
Treasure of the Kingdom, were at the disposal of a
Body that claimed to be Independent on the <hi>Crown;</hi>
and were subject to a severe Master, at whose
Mercy our <hi>Kings</hi> Reigned, and governed their <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;</hi>
and were frequently put into great Convulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
when they seemed to break in upon an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
that pretended to be <hi>Sacred,</hi> and on that
score justified its being so tender of all its Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
A High-spirited King arose, who together
with his People, were resolved to bear no longer
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101265:9"/>
with that Diminution of the Security and Dignity
of this <hi>Imperial Crown:</hi> The Importance of that
<hi>Word,</hi> as it is used in our <hi>Laws,</hi> having no Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to our Constitution at home, as some have vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imagined, it signifying only, that this was a
compleat Government within it self, having no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
on any Forreign Authority whatsoever.
That King though often threatned with Invasion and
Rebellion, and though he had drawn upon himself
the Fury and Revenges of a vast multitude of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable
<hi>Wasps,</hi> whom he had stirred out of their
<hi>Nests,</hi> yet escaped all dangers, and carried on his
designs as far as his Principles could go: He remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Rubbish, and so made way for that which
he could not have promo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed himself, being still
deeply tinctured with his first Impressions and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements.
It was much for one Man, to do so
much as he did: He restored the Crown to a g<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eat
part of its Lustre, as well as its Authority, and
recovered that which was weakly parted with, in a
course of many dark and Superstitious Ages. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him our Princes were to make their Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
elsewhere, and to take their measures from
thence, how their own People were to be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
but now the Government is entire, all is done
at home, no Vassalage is to be paid to a Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
which was as cruel in its Administration, as it
was unjust in its pretentions; and had in a more
particular manner oppressed this Kingdom, Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing
too Imperiously over the easiness of our
Princes, and the Superstition of their Subjects.</p>
            <p>As the first part of that great Work was so far
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101265:9"/>
advanced by a King, whom nature had fitted for a
performance that required a Man of no ordinary
<hi>Genius:</hi> So a young Prince succeeded, who had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing in him that was Great and Promising,
far beyond his years. In his Reign our Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was perfected, but while some went into
that good design upon True and Noble Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
there was a mixed multitude that came in
for a share of the <hi>Spoil,</hi> and were a <hi>Reproach</hi> to
that which they seemed to promote: One bad
Man in particular, who at his Death professed
that he had all the while adhered to his old per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions,
even when he seemed to act most dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
from them. The good Men of that time, did
look for a terrible <hi>Catastraphe:</hi> They did not think
that God would suffer his House to be built up
by such <hi>defiled Hands,</hi> or bless such a corrupted
Scene, with the continuance of so good a King,
the <hi>Iosias</hi> of this Church. All was quickly laid in
the Dust, and turned not only into Rubbish but
to Ashes, and a severe storm was set over this
Church; but when it was like to have spread it
self over the rest of <hi>Europe,</hi> and that the two
Crowns being under the Ministry of two <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,</hi>
both designing to extirpate the Reformation,
were coming into a Peace, that so they might be
at leasure for such bloody work at home; it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
God to deliver this Church, to raise up again
that light which seemed almost quite extinguisht,
and to bless us with that ever renowned <hi>Queen,</hi>
who did not only restore and repair what had been
ruined at Home; but became the Support and
Strength of all Abroad. They found not only
Sanctuary among us, but carried from us both
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101265:10"/>
Force and Treasure, to preserve and secure themselves.
Things lookt often so cloudy, whilst the greatest pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and the vastest Treasure of <hi>Europe,</hi> was engaged
with an unrelenting fury on the other side, that
for about twenty years together, the wise Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
of that Reign were every year looking for a
fatal Revolution: At last God by blasting all their
designs, both open and secret, and chiefly the last
and greatest Attempt of the boasted <hi>Invincible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mada,</hi>
did secure that <hi>Queen,</hi> and Establish this
<hi>Church;</hi> and by her Protection and Influence, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Forreign Churches were also Formed and
Established, and the Correspondence we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
with those beyond Sea, made us the safer,
and the more united at home. The Crown was
fortified with Alliances and Dependencies abroad,
the Nation was spread by many Colonies into
remote parts. Trade flourished, and Wealth from
all parts flowed in upon us: The blessings both
of Heaven and Earth meeting together in that
<hi>Celebrated Reign.</hi> What was wanting to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
the Happiness of this Nation was brought about
in the <hi>next,</hi> in which the whole <hi>Island</hi> was brought
under the same <hi>Head:</hi> And the Northern parts which
had been formerly Scenes of War and Desolation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated
and ill peopled, became the quiet Seats of
Tillage and Industry; so that <hi>Nature,</hi> that seemed to
have laid this Island, and designed it for one <hi>Monarchy,</hi>
was now answered by this happy Union. And the
many Disorders in <hi>Ireland,</hi> forced the Reduction of that
Kingdom to Civility and Industry, to the same Laws
and Language, and for the greater part to be of the
same Stock and Race with our selves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:101265:10"/>
These are some of the more signal felicities, which have
happened to us, and to the <hi>Crown</hi> that protects and
governs us, since that happy <hi>light</hi> first visited us: <hi>And
the Land had rest fourscore years:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Judges 3. 30.</note> The longest period
that we find marked in the old Testament, of the
quiet of the people of <hi>Israel.</hi> Nor can we easily assign
the like period in any History, of such an entire and
long continued peace: for in all that time, tho we
had Wars abroad, they never broke in upon us, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb
us at home. The short and soon supprest Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of some <hi>Earls</hi> in the <hi>North,</hi> scarce being to be
reckoned as an interruption of our quiet. But while
God protected us from our Enemies, yet when we had
<hi>corrupted our ways before him,</hi> he delivered us up to our
selves, to be plagued by our own Follies, and they
proved severe punishments. I will not open that black
and dismal Scene: I will not suffer any thing that looks
like <hi>anger</hi> or <hi>satyre,</hi> to darken the chearfulness of this
day, or to sowr those thoughts that should be now soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to joy; but a joy in God, decent and modest, and
suitable to the occasion.</p>
            <p>I will not repeat History or Gazettes: I will only lay
before you some reflections that are not the less impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
because how obvious soever they may be, yet
they are not so generally commented on, as they
well deserve to be. Our Confusion lasted long, and the
Scenes shifted so oft, that at last men found no known
Constitution, no Precedent either at home or abroad,
that could fit us: so that Assemblies of a new nature
were formed, in which men gave scope to their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
to invent a Scheme of Government that could
secure us: Bu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> all in vain, the Ancient Landmarks
stood still in all mens eyes, and thoughts, and the
Nation grew so weary of its tossings, and so wise af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101265:11"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:101265:12"/>
so many practices, that had been made upon it, as
to return to its first Basis, and to its immemoral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution:
The Confusions of that time will still be
preserved in our History, as the best and most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrative
Arguments, to recommend our Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to us: since we see that nothing could bring the
Nation to Quiet and Order, till it settled again on its
old Foundation, and returned to that frame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which it had subsisted, and flourished for many
Ages; and without which it could not be supported
a few years, even tho a resolute and victorious Army,
that was deeply engaged both by Principle and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
endeavoured to fix it upon another bottom.
The Tide turned, and how strangely soever mens Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Humours wrought against it, yet nothing
could withstand the united desires of the whole
Nation, that called aloud for <hi>bringing back the
King.</hi> This no doubt has been, and will still be a
powerful Curb to restrain the violence of some mens
tempers; and to make all to consider, how hard it is
even by Force and with Success, to work a Nation off
from its antient and known Government, to new
Models and airey Speculations.</p>
            <p>The great and free range that Enthusiam then had,
the multiplicity as well as the extravagance of the Sects
that sprung up among us, in those day of Confusion
and Violence, the wild Notions as well as the ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
practices of the several parties, their mutual
animosities, and the gross hypocrisie that run too vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
through the greatest numbers of them, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
not a little to bring the Nation back to love
<hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> in sacred matters: and many, who
perhaps formerly disliked our publick Establishment,
having exceptions that seemed plausible to some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101265:12"/>
in it, came afterwards to see how mischievous
it was to bring men once off from rule and <hi>order,</hi> and
to give such scope to humour and fancy: and so,
they grew more in love with settled methods, and
have adhered more firmly to them: and thus we
may conclude that the Essay, which was made then to
new model both <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> how fatal soever it
proved to those who were run down in the struggle,
yet has since that time, had this good effect, to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
both, upon a firmer foundation in the hearts of
the people.</p>
            <p>Two things were also very eminently remarkable in
the whole course of our disorders, the one was, that
the very Party which of all others was the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to new cast the Nation into the old model, and to
set up that Government, on how bad a title soever, which
was that only, that our Law could acknowledge, since
they of all others needed a pardon most to cover them
from <hi>Sacred and Royal Blood,</hi> besides many other lesser
crimes, which lay upon them, they had also divided
among themselves the spoils of the <hi>Crown,</hi> and of the
<hi>Church,</hi> to which they could have no title founded in
Law, without an authority, with which our Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
did agree: for so sacred is our frame, that the
very shadow of it, has a great operation in <hi>Law,</hi>
and had they agreed to have set up their <hi>Idol King,</hi>
this would have gone so far<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both to have indemnified
their persons, and to have secured their Estates, that
even the happy Restoration that followed, could not
easily have set that matter right: both the <hi>Crown</hi> and
the <hi>Church</hi> had been put to wrestle with great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
all which was happily prevented, by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>managable
stiffness of those, who of all others were
the most concerned to have promoted it: and thus
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101265:13"/>
without any considerable difficulty, every thing did
easily fall into its old Channel again: and when it
was too late, those who proved the Instruments of
their own Ruin, saw their Errer: but could not then
rectifie it: they expiated their crimes with their own
Blood, and so <hi>the Land was purged:</hi> and what had been
unjustly acquired, was most justly restored back to
the true owners again.</p>
            <p>But the most eminent character of God's merciful
Providence towards these Nations, in the blessing of
this <hi>day,</hi> was the manner of it. It made our miseries
both the less sensible to us, and the less out of our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to overcome, that <hi>Strangers</hi> got no footing among
us, all the while: and that the depressed side, was
not cast on demanding assistance from those who
might in conclusion have proved cruel friends, and
the worst of <hi>Enemies.</hi> All <hi>Europe</hi> was so deeply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in a long and cruel War, that it was not in
the power of our neighbours to take advantage ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the feebleness that our distractions threw
us into, or from the necessities of the weak and <hi>unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate</hi>
side, and so to come in for a share of the <hi>spoil,</hi>
which is commonly all, that <hi>Auxiliary</hi> forces design on
such occasions. While the Nation was left to its self,
and all was in its own hands, as well as its Substance
and Stock was kept entire, it was in their own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to return again to their old Foundations. The
time in which this happned, was also Critical, for it was
when our destemper was at its height: when an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiastical
and Cruel Spirit was in the <hi>Ascendant,</hi> which
probably if it had not then been effectually mastred,
had burst forth into very dismal extravagancies. <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm</hi>
armed with <hi>power,</hi> being like a Sword in a
mad mans hand: but as our distractions at home were
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:101265:13"/>
in their heighest Fermentation, the state of affairs
abroad changed so considerably, by the <hi>Peace</hi> that
was made between the two <hi>Crowns,</hi> that then it was
highly probable, Foreigners might have thrust them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into our affairs: and that both out of Political
and Religious considerations. It appears to have been
the settled opinion of a great <hi>Cardinal,</hi> and a Chief
<hi>Minister</hi> at that time, that when the War was quite
ended, both Crowns should have concurred to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establiment
of the Royal family; tho from those rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
of his, it also appears that he neither meant well
to the <hi>King</hi> nor to the <hi>Nation</hi> in it. However it is
most likely, that upon the lessening of the Forces on
both sides, that followed upon the Peace, the late
<hi>King</hi> might have received such a powerful assistance
of men of fortune, that he might have <hi>invaded,</hi> or
rather come into his Kingdom with a foreign force.
If he had succeeded in it, as he would have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
great obligations to those who had assisted him,
so he would have been much in their power, and
might have come under the odious name of a <hi>Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi>
which might have rendred his Government both
severe and hateful; and must have ended, either in
the total subversion of <hi>Publick Liberty,</hi> or in new and
dreadful Convulsions, which must have endangered
the whole, and exposed us to be a prey to some vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Invader.</p>
            <p>It was therefore no inconsiderable part of the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
of this day, that it was brought about in such
a manner, that the King owed it entirely under <hi>God,</hi>
to the duty and affections of his own <hi>Subjects,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any others pretending to have the least share in it;
so that the whole frame of our Constitution rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to its former state, and nothing was put, or left
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101265:14"/>
out of <hi>joint.</hi> The late King had no reason to depart
from our Constitution with relation to his People; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they had so chearfully returned to it with relation
to the <hi>Crown:</hi> and of all others he had the least ob<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on him, to his next neighbours, tho they were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
his most immediate Kimed; and that the chief oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of our miseries, came from Councils that were
inspired from thence.</p>
            <p>As this blessing was procured to us immediately, by
a management at home, so the calm and the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
with which it was brought about, had such a
stamp of the goodness and mercy of Providence in it,
as is perhaps without example in History. Those who
know the transactions of that time, cannot reflect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
amazement, on the unaccountable change of the
dispositions of the Nation towards the <hi>Royal Family,</hi>
that happened from the year 1640, to the year 1660.
And all this was brought about by a turn over the
whole Nation. Arguments or Speculations seldom
have such effects. If the greater part had brought
in the less, the event had been still great and amazing,
but it was all over wonderful when the <hi>whole</hi> chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so entirely, that the <hi>few</hi> who were engaged by
their Interests and Fears, as well as by their Notions,
to oppose it, were brought under such a consternati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
broken into such divisions, which the Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Heat of some, and the the Mistrust and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
of others had sowed among them, <hi>that none of
those men of might found their hands,</hi> but seemed to be
cast into <hi>a dead sleep.</hi> So great an Army, so long train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
so well Disciplined, and so oft Victorious, might
have raised such an opposition as could not have been
easily resisted, if at all. It had appeared in the year
1648, what feeble things popular and tumultuary Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
were, when in almost all the quarters of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:101265:14"/>
the people rise and desired to be rid of the Army,
to have that <hi>Blessed King,</hi> set at Liberty, and on his
Throne, and to have the Nation again settled: but so
little Concert and Union, so little Method and Order,
appeared in all those motions, that they only served
to promote that which they were affraid of: the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
was flushed with Victory and Success, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
every thing before it: Which brought on the
black and fatal 30<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Ianuary.</hi> But now when the
time was come, in which God was to restrain their
force, as he does the Seas, <hi>hither shalt thou come and
no further: here shall thy proud waves he stopt:</hi> when
<hi>God arose to judgment, the earth feared and was still.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It appeared by the violence in which a small num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of them studied to overturn this happy change
after it was wrought, what greater numbers of them,
if united might have done to have hindred it. So
that the giddiness with which they were struck, and
their want of Council and Spirit, upon so great an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
was a greater indication of an over-ruling
Providence, than if they with the rest of the Nation,
had really changed their minds, and gone into the
Stream. They both meant to oppose it, and might
have done it to a great degree; had not God taken
from them at once, both <hi>Head, Heart,</hi> and <hi>Hand:</hi>
and thus when we observe all the Methods of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God, in bringing this about, we must adore
the Wisdom, but most particularly the Goodness of
them, both towards the <hi>Royal Family</hi> and towards the
whole <hi>Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From what confusions were we then freed, and
what a Scene of Blood and Misery had this Nation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
been, if the turn had not been so entire as it
was: And how little soever, many may either appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101265:15"/>
or value the blessing of a legal Government,
tempered between the extreams of lawless <hi>Tyranny</hi> on
the one hand, and of wild and Enthusiastical Frensies,
on the other, yet they must conclude that in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
we were restored at that time to a Government
that is much the happiest of any now in the World,
and is so particularly fitted for us, that nothing else
could make us either safe or happy.</p>
            <p>But all the blessings of that time did not terminate
in that day, or in the Restoration of the <hi>Royal Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
at that time: what was done then, made way to
what we enjoy at present: Without <hi>that</hi> we could
not have expected the happiness we do now live under,
and look for. I will not reflect on the Gloom that has
come between: the unhappy things which have come
since: but whatever we have been, or whatever we
were like to have been, we do <hi>now</hi> see a better prospect,
not only the <hi>Crowns</hi> flourshing at home, but the Laws
and Liberties of the people happily revived; not only
our Religion secured, and our Church protected, but
that from us other Churches are in hope to receive <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection</hi>
and Strength, and the rest of <hi>Europe</hi> a just bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance,
and a quiet security: that now <hi>England</hi> is not
only recovering the interest and share that naturally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to her, but is at present the great Instrument of
giving all <hi>Europe</hi> a happy escape from a vast danger,
that had threatned it all over.</p>
            <p>In this Audience, I shall not enlarge further on this
Subject. I need say the less, because we do all feel and
hope so much from it. The Subject indeed speaks so
much, that I may be well allowed to say the less. This
is the compleating of that happy change, which is now
to be reflected on, with so much the more joy, because
we have reason to hope that we are near, very near,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101265:15"/>
all that a Nation can wish for, to make it both Great
and Happy, Prosperous and Safe.</p>
            <p>But as we have thus let our thoughts run out upon
the <hi>wonderful works,</hi> that God on this day did for us,
so we ought not to forget the <hi>Iudgments of his mouth,</hi> his
<hi>Laws</hi> and his <hi>Gospel:</hi> that are the much greatest of
all his blessing, that render all other things to be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
indeed to us; they being chiefly intended to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
this to us, and to engage us to improve it to
the best purposes. For as the Psalm ends, all Gods
mercies to the Jewish Nation, were given them, on
this design <hi>that they might observe his Statutes, and keep his
Laws;</hi> so what answers to this among us, but is indeed
a great many sizes beyond it, is the purity of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion, which we have now enjoyed above
an Age and a half, with advantages beyond any Church
under Heaven, and in a course of temporal blessings
beyond any that we ever knew since we were a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
<hi>England</hi> is more encreased at home and abroad,
in the Soil cultivated at home, and in the Colonies sent
abroad, in the numbers of the people, in Force and
Shipping, in Wealth at home, and Trade all the World
over, and in the resinings of solid Learning, or use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Arts, in this period, since the Reformation, than
for ought appears to us, it ever was before, since we
were a Nation: and it now possesses all this under a
Civil Government, that is the wonder as well as the
envy of the World: for while other Nations have
either foolishly thrown up and abandoned their <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
or have been forcibly deprived of them, and see
no remedy; we have ours not only preserved, but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
by fresh explanations and provisions: All this
put together ought to make us consider the great value
of that unspeakable blessing which God is so signally
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101265:16"/>
recommending to us, by those happy Providences
which accompany it.</p>
            <p>If we could examin it in it self, without those bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
consequences, we should see cause enough to value
it highly, or if we could compare our own condition
with either the <hi>Heathen Nations</hi> that are utter strangers
to it, or those <hi>degenerated Christians</hi> that have corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, so as to be but little better than <hi>Heathenism</hi> it
self, then we might be able to form a truer judgment
of that happiness, which we enjoy in it. I confess, as
the far greater part use it, there is no great account to
be had of it: if it is only a set of Notions, how true
soever they may be, and a circle of some forms, in
which we go always round, without making any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress,
then tho our Religion may be less burdensome
and imposing than some others, yet after all, it can
be no great matter it self: but if this Gospel, and these
Laws of God are means intended by him for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
ends, fitted for them, and capable of procuring
them to us, if they by their own efficiency are capable
of making us not only happy in another world, but
even happy in this life, happy in our selves, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
in another, if they tend to make a Nation great
in general, and every individual of it, both great in
himself, and great in his usefulness to mankind, then
we may justly Glory in our Religion and in those
<hi>judgments of his mouth,</hi> with which God hath blessed
us: and whatever advantages the <hi>Iews</hi> had reason to
reckon themselves under, by their Laws, beyond the
Nations round about them, these will appear to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
much more eminently to us, when we compare
our selves with the corrupted state of Christianity, that
prevails in so many Kingdoms not far from us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:101265:16"/>
The <hi>Iews</hi> were by the Laws of <hi>Moses,</hi> delivered
from all that Idolatry and Magick, those superstitious and
barbarous rites that had over-run Heathenism: from
the cruelty of offering up humane Sacrifices, nay, and
their own Children too, to those <hi>false Gods,</hi> whom
they served: They worshipped the host of Heaven, Sun,
Moon, and Stars, high Hills, great Stones, ancient
Oaks, the founders of Nations, and inventers of Arts:
they had Images and Statues to resemble the Divinity,
and believed, that a company of extravagant rites,
had in them, by the Charms they used with them,
strange and sublime vertues. Those Deities they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased
with a variety of oblations, which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
were acceptable to them: these were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
with much Pomp, and at a vast charge: an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness
in them they thought pleased the Deity, as
much as a failure therein provoked it: and they had a
variety of Gods for several Countries and Professions;
a special Deity belonged to every occasion: How hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
then might the <hi>Iews</hi> reckon themselves, who saw
through all those vain imaginations, and knew that
there was but <hi>one only God,</hi> the supream Lord of all
things; a <hi>pure mind,</hi> and therefore capable of no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
representation, and so sublime a <hi>Being,</hi> that what
Sacrifices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Rites soever he appointed, yet admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of no humane Sacrifices, and had limited his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments
within such bounds, that all Superstition
was cut off. Now if these Characters of the Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
and Jewish Religion are applied to the present State
of Christendom, it will appear that we have the same
reason to value our Religion, that the <hi>Iews</hi> had to
value theirs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:101265:17"/>
There is a Communion of Christians, whose Churches
are full of Corporeal representations, of that which they
adore: those Statues have all such Ornaments about
them, and such adorations paid them as the Heathens
were accustomed to: Many created beings have all
the acts of worship, such as Prayers, Praises, Incence burnt,
bodily adoration, Churches built, Sacraments used for
their honour; and even that Sacrament which is no less
than the immediate object of the highest degrees of
worship among them. Thus if ever there was, or if
there can be Idolatry in the world, they are guilty of
it. All those pretended vertues, that by their bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
they give out, that they put on holy water,
<hi>Agnus Dei's,</hi> with all the train of those consecrated
things, with which they entertain the credulity and
the misled Devotion of their People, is either Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
or Charm. In the cost of these, and of the
other invented parts of worship, particularly their
Processions, another rite of heathenism, there is no
measure put to the Pomp and Magnificence with
which they study to adorn them. It is true they have
no humane Sacrifices in the strictest sense: but no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
ever taught the shedding so much human blood,
nor made that so main a piece of Religion, of such
merit, so certainly and so highly rewarded, as they
have done: of which both the last and the present
Age have received too sensible and too demonstrative a
conviction. What reason then have we to value our
Religion, which has so entirely freed us from such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
and corruptions: since Idolatry does vitiate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in its Source and Fountain: it debasing the Idea
of God, and bringing us to fancy him to be something
like our selves. We own him to be a pure mind; that
can be represented by no bodily figure: We
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101265:17"/>
worship him in a sp<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ritual manner: in acts and forms
suitable to his nature. We worship him only, and
pay no adorations to Angels or Saints: nor have we
invented any parts of worship, besides those of his
own appointment: We teach and practice Charity to
Enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even to those who hate us, and who we
kn<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w would persecute us, if it were in their power.</p>
            <p>Another Consideration, on which the <hi>Iews</hi> had just
reason to value their Religion, was because it was fixed
and stated, in the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Moses:</hi> no additions could
b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> made to it, unless God had sent a Prophet on a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Commission, with particular Credentials: their
Priests had not, as the Heathens, <hi>Books</hi> in their hands,
that were kept as <hi>secrets,</hi> which the people might not
see, and which they might vouch for any additions,
with which they loaded them, as oft as it served their
ends. A written Law which every man might read
as well as the Priests, was a vast security against fraud
and Impositions. Upon the same account, we have
just reason to set a high value upon our Religion, since
it can be neither more nor less than what is contained
in the Scriptures; we have no Article in <hi>reserve,</hi> for
which, as oft as we please <hi>Tradition</hi> may be vouched:
We have no <hi>infallible tribunal,</hi> to coin new Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
or impose new Doctrines upon the pain of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themas
and Extirpation: How great that Tyranny is
and how unbounded is easily enough imagined; when a
man must believe a <hi>blank,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> has the filling
up that <hi>blank:</hi> and when the more implicit and blind
men are in their Faith, they are thereby esteemed the
truer Sons of the Church, which will have none enquire
into what she dictates. nor dispute her commands:
Whereas in ours, the <hi>Officers</hi> of the Church are only
considered as men appointed to minister in <hi>holy things,</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:101265:18"/>
to serve and instruct the people, in the things of God,
without being the Masters of their Faith and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
we pretend to no other authority: and leave to
the people entire, all the liberties of humane nature.</p>
            <p>A 3<hi>d.</hi> Consideration that did very particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Religion to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> was its
purity: the justice and probity, the freedom from
luxury, simplicity of Life, the restraint of appetite and
passion, and the modesty of deportment, that it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned:
these were great and noble Characters of a
Religion that came from God, and that tended to
make men in a good degree to resemble him: for
tho that was an imperfect Religion, yet the <hi>Law of
the Lord was pure, and his commandments were clean.</hi>
But all this in a much higher degree concurs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
to us, the Religion that by the blessing of
God is received among us. We own the Gospel in the
same simplicity in which Christ and his Apostles deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
it: we teach that men must <hi>deny ungodliness and
worldly lusts,</hi> and <hi>live soberly, righteously and godly,</hi> and
that <hi>without holiness no man shall see the Lord:</hi> we offer
no other conditions, or means of salvation, but <hi>Faith,
Repentance,</hi> and <hi>new Obedience:</hi> we oblige all persons
to the highest degrees of purity, and warn them to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
every <hi>sin, the wages of which is death.</hi> In a word,
the main part of our Doctrine is, to convince the world
of the indispensible necessity of an universal holiness,
which must first possess a mans thoughts, and rectifie
his intentions, and then run through his whole life,
and govern all his Actions. We flatter no men with
hopes of the after-game of a <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and a redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
out of it by <hi>Masses:</hi> we make no sin to be slight or
<hi>venial,</hi> nor do we teach that any duty is only a <hi>council
of perfection;</hi> much less do we flatter Pride and Vanity
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101265:18"/>
by the Doctrines of <hi>Supererrogation:</hi> we do not pretend
to supersede the obligation of <hi>loving God,</hi> or of being
truly contrite <hi>for sin;</hi> nor do we teach any methods of
supplying imperfect acts of Contrition, by the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
as if acts of sorrow, which of their own nature
could not be accepted of God, could be supplied by
the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and so become the means of justifying
those who are still in the habits of sin: we pretend to
no other power of <hi>Absolution</hi> but the <hi>absolving</hi> from the
censures of the Church, and the declaring men <hi>absolved</hi>
according to the truth of their Repentance.</p>
            <p>Thus it appears, that we have much juster grounds
for setting a high value on the purity of the Christian
Religion, among us, than the <hi>Iews</hi> had for esteeming
their Law far beyond the Idolatry of the <hi>Heathens.</hi> If
these are the most valuable things, as indeed what can
be valuable, if they are not, then how particular a reason
have we, to rejoyce in them, now when we have so
fair and likely a prospect of their being setled and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
to us, of their being no more undermined among
us, by the practices of disguised Enemies, by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
us into animosities, and by subdividing us into
parties, and so weakening us by our own follies, that
we may become an easier prey to our Enemies: and
while all these things grow to be safer and firmer at
home, by the Protection that the <hi>Crown</hi> gives to those
who profess the same faith abroad. While we at home,
are feeling the tender hand of such a <hi>nursing Father</hi> and
such a <hi>nursing Mother,</hi> and while those abroad, are not
hoping to feel, but actually feeling, the happy effects of
their <hi>Favour</hi> and <hi>Protection;</hi> then it is that we may with
peculiar accents of <hi>joy,</hi> commemorate the blessing of this
day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:101265:19"/>
When our almost withered <hi>Roses</hi> begin to look fresh,
and to open again, while the <hi>Lillies</hi> grow pale and
fade: When <hi>England</hi> begins not only to recover the
figure it once made, but puts on a new lustre, and has
an interest in <hi>Europe</hi> beyond what former times can
boast; while our <hi>Church</hi> checks the pride of <hi>her,</hi> that
has so long made the earth drunk with her <hi>Sorceries,</hi>
and while she animates those other bodies that were
either in their last Agonies, or very near them; then
we have just reason, according to the words with which
this Psalm begins, to say, <hi>O give thanks unto the Lord,
call upon his name, make known his deeds among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
sing unto him, sing Psalms unto him, talk ye of all
his wondrous works: Glory ye in his holy name, and let
the heart of them rejoyce that seek the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us conclude all with our most earnest praises to
God for those who do now fill the <hi>Throne,</hi> with so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
a grace. May they live and prosper: <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

more and more reason to <hi>remember the marvellous works
that God has wrought for us, by their means: his wonders</hi>
in them, <hi>and the judgments of his mouth,</hi> secured to us
by them. May we live so worthy of them, that we
may long, long enjoy them, with all the accessions of
Plenty and Peace. <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
