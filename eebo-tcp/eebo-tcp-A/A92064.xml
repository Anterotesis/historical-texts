            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </hi> Doe verily That the Vote we have already paſs'd, For the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding the Armies the firſt and tenth of <hi>March,</hi> will finde us no farther on our way, then where we now are, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the ill Accidents that may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:112899:3"/>
and ſo much precious time ſpent, as till then.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> The Main Buſineſſe is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſhall have a preſent Treatie or no? and this concerns us in all that we Have, and Are Since we Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed a Treaty at <hi>Nottingham, I</hi> doe not find that we have gotten much ground, although our Army then was freſh, full, and full paid; the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple erect, bountifull, and forward to the warre. Now, the Diſpoſition of the Kingdome, for the greateſt part, ſtands bent towards a Peace: ſo that whereſoever the Refuſall, or Delay of the way to it ſhall be fixt, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage will fall on that ſide. How cleare ſoever the Jntentions of the Houſe are, yet abroad it will be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken but as a ſhew without Reality,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:112899:3"/>
and ſo it will be returned upon us.</p>
            <p>For the Propoſitions, J have not known, nor heard, that all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions in any Treaty of Jmpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, were ever ſwallowed whole. Jf ſome be harſh and rough, they may be wrought and ſuppled by wiſe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, made fit for an acceptable agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Jf other be unpaſſable, they may be totally rejected. Thoſe that are our unqueſtionable Rights, may be ſo claim'd, and held.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Speaker,</hi> We have already ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the bitter bloudy fruits of warre, we are growne exceedingly behind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand with our ſelves ſince we began it: if we perſiſt, there will ſuch a conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Miſchiefs break in upon us, as <hi>I</hi> am afraid will ruin the King, the Kingdome, the Nation; unleſſe God
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:112899:4"/>
be mercifull to us, and doe ſtep in with a great Miracle, for a little one will not ſerve our turne.</p>
            <p>I have long and thougtfully expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that the cup of trembling which hath gone round about us to other Nations, would at length come in amongst us Jt is now come at laſt, and we may drink the Dreggs of it, the worſt; which God divert.</p>
            <p>There is yet ſome comfort left, that our Miſeries are not likely to laſt long. For, we cannot fight here as they doe in <hi>Germany,</hi> in that great, large, vaſt continent: where although there be warre in ſome parts of it, yet there are many other remote quiet places, for trade and tillage to ſupport it. We muſt ſight as in a Cock-pit, we are ſurrounded with the ſea. We have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:112899:4"/>
no ſtronger Holds, then our owne Sculls, and our own Ribs, to keep out enemies; ſo that the whole Kingdome will ſuddenly be but one flame.</p>
            <p>Jt hath been ſaid in this Houſe, that we are bound in conſcience to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the ſhedding of innocent bloud: but <hi>Sir,</hi> who ſhall be anſwerable for all the innocent bloud which ſhall be ſpilt hereafter, if we doe not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour a Peace, by a ſpeedy Treaty? Certainly, God is as much to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in a Treatie, as in a warre: it is He that gives wiſdome to treat, as well as courage to fight, and ſucceſse to both, as it pleaſeth Him. Bloud is a crying ſinne, it pollutes a land: why ſhould wee defile this land any longer?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:112899:5"/>
Wherefore <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Speaker,</hi> Let us ſtint Bloud as ſoon as we can. Let us agree with our Adverſaries in the way, by a preſent, ſhort, wary Treaty. God direct us.</p>
