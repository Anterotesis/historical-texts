            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>DUncan,</hi> King of the <hi>Scots,</hi> had two Principal Men, whom he Imployed in all Matters of Importance, <hi>Macbeth</hi> and <hi>Banquo,</hi> Theſe two Traveling together through a Forreſt, were met by three Fairie Witches (Weirds the <hi>Scots</hi> call them) whereof the firſt making Obeyſance unto <hi>Macbeth,</hi> ſaluted him, <hi>Thane</hi> (a Title unto which that of <hi>Earl</hi> afterwards ſucceeded) of <hi>Glammis,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Thane</hi> of <hi>Cowder,</hi> and the third King of <hi>Scotland:</hi> This is unequal dealing, ſaith <hi>Banquo,</hi> to give my Friend all the Honours, and none unto me: To which one of the Weirds made Anſwer, That he indeed ſhould not be a King, but out of his Loyns ſhould come a Race of Kings; that ſhould for ever Rule the <hi>Scots.</hi> And having thus ſaid, they all ſuddenly Vaniſhed, Vpon' their Arrival at the Court, <hi>Macbeth</hi> was immediately Created <hi>Thane</hi> of <hi>Glammis;</hi> and not long after ſome new Service of his, requiring new Recompence, he was Honoured with Title of <hi>Thane</hi> of <hi>Cowder.</hi> Seeing then how happily the Prediction of the three Weirds fell out, in the former he Reſolved not to be wanting to himſelf in fulfilling the third; and therefore firſt he Killed the King, and after by reaſon of his Command among the Souldiers and Common People, he Succeeded in his Throne. Being ſcarce warm in his Seat, he called to mind the Prediction given to his Companion <hi>Banquo:</hi> Whom hereupon ſuſpected as his Supplanter, he cauſed to be Killed, together with his Poſterity: <hi>Flean</hi> one of his Sons, Eſcaped only, with no ſmall difficulty into <hi>Wales,</hi> Freed as he thought from all fear of <hi>Banquo</hi> and his Iſſue; he Built <hi>Dunſinan</hi> Caſtle, and made it his Ordinary Seat: And afterwards on ſome new Fears, Conſulted with certain of his Wizards about his future Eſtate: Was told by one of them, that he ſhould never be Overcome, till <hi>Birnam</hi> Wood (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Miles diſtant) came to <hi>Dunſinan</hi> Caſtle; and by another, that he ſhould never be Slain by any Man which was Born of a Woman. Secure then as he thought, from all future Dangers; he omitted no kind of Libidinous Cruelty for the ſpace of 18 Years; for ſo long he Tyrannized over <hi>Scotland.</hi> But having then made up the Meaſure of his Iniquities, <hi>Macduff</hi> the Governor of <hi>Fife,</hi> aſſociating to himſelf ſome few Patriots (and being aſſiſted with Ten Thouſand <hi>Engliſh</hi>) equally hated by the Tyrant, and abhorring the Tyranny, met in <hi>Birnam</hi> Wood, taking every one of them a Bough in his hand (the better to keep them from diſcovery) Marching early in the Morning towards <hi>Dunſinan</hi> Caſtle, which they took by <hi>Scalado. Macbeth</hi> eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, was purſued by <hi>Macduff,</hi> who having overtaken him, urged him to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat; to whom the Tyrant, half in ſcorn, returned this Anſwer: That he did in Vain attempt to Kill him, it being his Deſtiny never to be Slain by any that was Born of Woman. Now then ſaid <hi>Macduff,</hi> is thy fatal end drawing faſt upon thee, for I was never Born of Woman, but violently Cut out of my Mothers Belly: Which words ſo daunted the cruel Tyrant, though otherways a Valiant man and of great Performances, that he was very eaſily ſlain; and <hi>Malcolm Conmer,</hi> the true Heir, Seated in his Throne.</p>
