            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

called Periostium to bee diseased, when soft and gentle without great paine it is in the flesh: when heavie and blunt, it points foorth some of the intrels to bee grieved.</p>
               <p>The situation of the paine makes known the seat of the disease also, so if it bee in the right hypochondre or vnder the short ribs on the right side, it declares the lever to be hurt, if vnder the left side, the melt: for wheresoever is the paine there is the sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: wherefore wee must not omit to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyre of the sick person on which side hee lyes with greatest ease: for if it be without he lyes best on the whole side, but if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, best on the sore.</p>
               <p>That which issueth foorth of the body indicats also the part affected, so if by cough there is thrown foorth any part of a girstle, there is no doubt the light pypes are torne: if in the water there is found any peece of flesh, it betokens the neers to bee hurt: if in the draught, there is found any peece of skin, it signifies the puddings to be vlce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. The stomack is known to bee hurt when the meat or chile doth issue foorth at the wound, and if the fecall mater come foorth it shews the puddings to be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, so the water issuing wills the bladder

               <p>Moreover the forme of issuing foorth is remarked, for the better vnderstanding of the part that is troubled: so the blood that proceedes of the arteries, because of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of the spirits doth issue with force in a leaping manner: but if flowing and deadly from the veine: also if any peece of the part troubled doe come forth alone, it signifieth the place or seat to be neere by, but if it bee mixed with the excrements, it declares to bee higher and further remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>The accidents points also at the place, so the pearle declares the eye to bee molested, the swelling of the right lisk, the lever, and that of the left, the melt.</p>
               <p>The symptomes manifests the place, for ravery designes the braine to bee distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, the cheeks verie red, the lights to be inflammed, the losse of appetit, the indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the stomack, the excrements like to the washing of raw flesh, the debility of the lever.</p>

               <p>Thus having found out the part that is

Sympathie is an indisposition which befalls any part by the fault of another. And that either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the defluxion of an humour falling from one part to another, or by reason of the defect of the naturall facultie requyred for the action of the part: sometimes it fals out that a part of a long trouble by a sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathie, in end turnes to bee troubled by an Idiopathie. Idiopathie is either privatiue or consecutiue, so it is expedient to remark whether the disease bee privatiue, that is, bee first, or consecutive, that is, doth flow from another.</p>

               <p>During the caniculare dayes, laxative medicines are not good, for all strong pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations are hardly supported that time, for three reasons. The first because all purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves being naturally hot, inflammes the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy already warme by the heat of the aire. The second is because they dissipat the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces already weakned by the vehemency of the heat. The third because the action of a purging medicine, &amp; that of the invironing aire are contrare, for asmuch as that doth draw from without, inward, and this from within, outward.</p>
