         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Spirituall Things: but like the Widow in the Gospell, Poore in the Riches of
Christ, and too much a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow by the absence of her Heavenly Spouse, my Soule
hath offered from her Penury to your Treasury.</p>
            <p>Yet, as a Steward, have I endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be Faithfull, bringing
forth the Best of my Spirit, for Service, and Food to your Spirits: as the
Priests of old gave the Fat of the Sacrifices to the Flame on the Altar.</p>
            <p>As the Royall Preacher sought out Choice <pb facs="tcp:96807:3"/> Words: so
have I sought for the most Pleasant, most Profitable, most Powerfull
Discoveries of God, in my Scanty Store, in the midst of that Thick Ignorance,
which covers my Poore Heart.</p>
            <p>Now I have laid them at your Feet, where they lye, as Scattered,
and Dry Bones; except the Spirit of our Lord Iesus breath upon them, bring them
together, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse a Warmth, Power, and Beauty into them, to make them Living
Company for you.</p>
            <p>Not able to bring Stately, and Costly Beasts to the Sanctuary; I
have made it my Desire, and Designe to present for an Offering before God, and
You, a Payre of Turtle Doves; Simplicity, and Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; or, an Innocent
Integrity with an Humble Meekenesse.</p>
            <p>I hope both are, if not without blemish, because they have
alighted on my Heart: yet of the right-breed of that Dove, which <pb facs="tcp:96807:3"/>
descended from Heaven, and alighted on the Head of our Lord Iesus.</p>
            <p>And now, what is my Expectation? For my owne Soule, for my
Brethren in the Flesh, all the Children of <hi>Seth,</hi> for the rest of my
Fellow Creatures, which groane continually in my Eares? Is not my desire and
Sighing before thee, O my God? Even This; The Descent of the Dove upon them;
the Manifestation of the Spirit in them, the True Iubile, the Divine Liberty of
the whole Creation.</p>
            <p>All within me testifies of this Spirit to me; All without me
proclaimes this Spirit before Me; as the Spring of my Ioyes; the End of my
Faith; the Glorification of my Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and not of mine onely, but of all
those, who are rooted in this Principle of Life, what ever the Soile of

            <p>This Spirit brought forth from it selfe the Creation, and still

                  </note> This you may reade in the 4. verse, <hi>From Him,
  Which Is, Which Was, and Which is to Come.</hi> The whole Frame of Things is
  built with a Three-fold Partition, like the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which makes a Three-fold
  Kingdome: 1. That of <hi>Nature.</hi> 2. That of the <hi>Mediatour.</hi> 3.
  That of the <hi>Father.</hi> These Three Kingdomes have their Full
  Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions, and Severall Periods in that One Majestick Person of our
  Saviour.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Kingdome of Nature</hi> lyes in the Glory of
  Christs Person, as <hi>Past.</hi> The first Creation was a kind of
  Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; for in that, the Image of God was made Flesh. Jesus Christ was
  the Seed of the world. God calls him, <hi>The Seed of the Woman, Gen.</hi>
  3.15. He is the Seed in the Woman, which Sends Her forth, and Growes up out of
  Her. The Woman and the World are to Jesus Christ, as the Corne to the Blade,
  Eare and Huske. You reade, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.15. <hi>The Feet of Christ</hi> were
  <hi>like unto Fine Brasse, as if they were Burning in a Fornace.</hi> The
  Formes of Nature are the Feet of the Lord Jesus. <pb n="4" facs="tcp:96807:7"/> These are
  in the Divine Brightnesse of his Immortall Person, as in a Flame;
  <hi>Consumed</hi> in the <hi>Heat</hi> of a Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Glory: yet stil
  <hi>Conspicuous</hi> and Transparent through the <hi>Light</hi> of it.
  Therefore in this Kingdome, our Lord raignes with this Title, <hi>He That
  Was.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Kingdome of the Mediatour.</hi> This is the
  Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Marriage of the Two other Kingdoms, of <hi>Nature,</hi> and the
  <hi>Father; Time</hi> and <hi>Eternity.</hi> This is, as a Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
  Picture, which consists of Light and Shadow, making of Both, One Beauty. God is
  the <hi>Light,</hi> the Creature the <hi>Shadow,</hi> which here are
  interwoven, and shine mutually; The Creature <hi>By</hi> God, God <hi>In</hi>
  the Creature: so Both make but One Appearance, One Kingdome.</p>
               <p>This is the Middle-state of things: Thorow this, God first
  Descends into Nature: Thorow this, All Things Ascend and return again out of
  Nature unto God. Therefore this is cal'd <hi>Regnum Mediatorium</hi>: This is
  properly the Kingdome of Christ, as he is the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator</hi>: In this our
  Lord Jesus is according to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per State and Person, known by This name,
  <hi>He That Is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Kingdome of the Father.</hi> Here the God-head
  reignes in the <hi>Fulnesse</hi> of an <hi>Unmixt,</hi> the <hi>Freedome</hi>
  of an <hi>Unlimited</hi> Glory. The Kingdome of Christ is ever in Motion, till
  at last it roul it selfe into this <hi>sea,</hi> where it Perfectly
  <hi>loseth,</hi> and yet more Perfectly then ever, <hi>keeps</hi> its own
  <hi>Distinct State.</hi> This is the First De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription.</p>

                  </note> This is the first part of the fifth

Christ.</hi>
                     </item>

                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:96807:8"/>1. <hi>The Appearance of all things in
  Christ: Iesus Christ the faithfull witnesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Lord Jesus in glory is become the <hi>Image,</hi> and the
  <hi>Light</hi>: The <hi>Image,</hi> in which Each Thing is seen: The
  <hi>Light,</hi> by which that Image appears. So He is both the
  <hi>Testimony</hi> and the <hi>Witnesse. He</hi> is the <hi>Faithfull
  witnesse:</hi> For He is the Truth of all things. Every thing is seen in Him,
  according to its most Right, most Proper, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidest Appearance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Presence of Christ in all. The first-born from
  the dead.</hi> v. 5. c. 1. Our Lord Jesus was in Nature, so He became capable
  of dying, He sinks himselfe out of Nature into The Darknesse, which is a Shadow
  flying round about this Creation, so He dyes. Thorow this Darknesse he shoots
  forth himselfe into the Light of God, which encompasseth all: So He is risen
  from the dead.</p>
               <p>By His Presence in Nature, all things put forth themselves
  there: For <hi>all subsist in him. Colos.</hi> 1.17. By His Death all things
  die, His Death being the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal one, including and bringing forth all
  Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar deaths. For the world is crucified by the Crosse of Christ. By His
  Resurrection all things are raised into the Life of God; as the Soul raiseth
  all the parts of the Body, making to it selfe so many severall Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
  in them. Thus is Christ the <hi>First-born from the Dead. This</hi> is He,
  Present in All Things, Passing thorow All States.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Power over all: The Prince of the Kings of the

  are streames in which Jesus Christ flowes forth from God, pouring forth
  himselfe at last into <pb n="7" facs="tcp:96807:8"/> God againe. So have we gone thorow the
  Prayer in the Salutation, as it containes a Three-fold Description of our
  Saviours High and Heavenly Person.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Praise.</hi> This second part of the Salutation
  which raiseth it selfe, by a quick sweetnesse of change, unto Praise, is
  comprehended in the latter part of the fifth verse and the sixth. The Praises
  sing forth the Person of Christ in a Two-fold Description: First <hi>Love</hi>:
  Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly <hi>Lustre.</hi>
               </p>

  5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Effect.</hi> This is Three-fold. 1. Our

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Lustre. To him be Glory and Dominion for ever and
  ever. Glory</hi> is the Reflexion of Beauty from every Appearance.
  <hi>Dominion</hi> is the Power or Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that comprehends and sends forth
  each Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. This is the Lustre of our Saviours Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. 'Tis set
  with the <hi>Roots</hi> and Rags of all Being. It hath in it selfe the

               </p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> from these <hi>Praises</hi> passeth as by a

  You will see this Text though it speak of Wounds, Mourning, Teares, to have a

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Show. He Comes with Clouds. He comes.</hi> This

               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Spectators.</hi> The whole world is the
  Theater, or Stage, on which this <hi>Show</hi> is presented. All orders of
  Spirits are the <hi>Spectators: Every eye shall see him: They also that have
  Pierced him.</hi> This clause hath a peculiar relation to the Jewes; 'Tis also
  a Hint of that Depth in which Divine Love hath laid it's Designe, to spring the
  Highest Sweetnesse upon the most Horrid Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. 'Tis a melting Touch, like
  that, <hi>Go, tell his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and Peter; that he is risen: Mark,</hi>

  Love,</hi> and <hi>Ioy:</hi> Teares of <hi>Remorse,</hi> for having hated Love,
  stain'd Glory, murthered Life it selfe, upon a Mistake; And all this, Their Own

  Universal Beauty, an Vnlimited Sweetnesse, united in one <hi>Iesus,</hi> like
  Light and Heat in one Beame, and breaking forth from His Face to make a True

 now was, The Highest God making Himselfe the Lowest of Things; Flesh, Dust, The

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Person.</hi> The <hi>Person</hi> of our Blessed
 Saviour in his Second Comming is altogether <hi>Spirituall</hi> and Divine.
 Such as the Person of our Jesus was at His Ascension, such is it in His Second
 Approach to Men. What is that Person in which our Saviour sits at the Top of
 His Ascent? You shall read, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.10. <hi>He that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended is the
 same, that Ascended farre above All Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.</hi> This Ascent doth not so much
 import a <hi>Change</hi> of <hi>Place,</hi> as of <hi>Person</hi> and
 Proportion. When the Lord Jesus was gone up above these Heavens, which we see,
 then He was above all Change of Place. The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, which we do not see; the
 Invisible Part of this Creation is fetter'd with the Chaine of Time, but not
 imprison'd too by a Confinement or Circumscription of Place. Our Lord ascended,
 not so much by a <hi>Locall Motion,</hi> as a <hi>Spirituall Mutation,</hi> and
 Exaltation of His Person. As Earth heightned unto a Flame, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not its
 Place onely, but Forme and Figure: So the Person of our Saviour was raised to a
 Greatnesse, a Glory vastly differing from, and surmounting Any I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, All
 Images of Things visible or invisible in this Creation. So 'tis fitly exprest,
 <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7.29. <hi>He was made Higher than the Heavens.</hi> He was
 Heigthned to a Splendour, Enlarged to a Capacity and Compasse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the
 Brightest, beyond the Widest Heavens.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see <hi>Negatively,</hi> what the State of our
 Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's <pb n="12" facs="tcp:96807:11"/> Person was, when He was once Ascended. It was
 no more Like to any thing in Earth below, or Heaven above: It was Remote from
 All Created Formes of Things, Transcending All: <hi>Farre above All
 Heavens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Saviour Himself wil teach us, what the <hi>Positive</hi>
 State of His Person now was, by his Prayer for it: <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.5. <hi>And
 now, O Father, glorifie me with Thy Selfe, with that Glory, which I had with
 Thee before the World was.</hi> Our Lord prayes, (and His Prayer is both a
 Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie, and the Performance begun) that His Divine Nature may be both the
 Center and Circle to His Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, inwardly enlivening, outwardly clothing and
 fashioning it; that his Man-hood may be after his Death, at His Ascension, in
 that same Image, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, in which the God-head was to it selfe, before
 any thing else was.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> points out to us that, as Perfect, which
 our Saviour prayes for: <hi>Colos.</hi> 2.9. <hi>In whom the Fulnesse of the
 God-head dwels Bodily.</hi> The whole Man-hood of Christ, Body, as well as
 Soule, was so farre enlarged, so farre Spiritualized, as to take in, and hold
 forth the God-head Fully. It was heightned to <hi>Both,</hi> the
 <hi>Fulnesse</hi> and <hi>Forme</hi> of God.</p>
                  <p>But, we must take heed, that we doe not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understand this,
 and while we strive to have a Distinct View of our Saviour in Glory, confound
 Him, and our Selves. To this purpose we must use the help of a Two-fold

                  </p>
                  <p>Such was the Person of our Saviour at His Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; Such is
 He, when againe He Descends upon us, at His Second Comming. So Himselfe
 witnesseth, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.38. <hi>When He Commeth in the Glory of His
 Father.</hi> The Angel so fore-told the God-like manner of our Saviour, Comming
 the Second Time, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.11. <hi>This same Iesus, which ye see taken up
 from you into Heaven, shall so come, as ye have seene Him goe into Heaven.</hi>
 Behold, how your Master ascends, and as he ascends, he puts off his Earthly
 Appearance, growes Invisible, and vanishes into the Glory of God: So, in the
 same Divine manner, in the same Glory, Invisible to Mortall Eyes, He shall come
 againe to you. Such, as He is now, at His Entrance into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; such shall He
 be at his Re-entrance into the World.</p>
                  <p>Christ at his First Comming was a God in the forme of an
 Earthly Man, of a Worme, the Lowest of Men: at his Second Comming He is a Man,
 a Worme, the lowest of Men in the Forme of God. And now the Last is First.</p>
                  <p>This is the Spirituality of our Saviour's Comming in the First
 Respect, in <hi>His Person.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:96807:12"/>2. <hi>Appearance.</hi> Our Lord
 comes the Second Time into the World, not so much by <hi>Change of Place,</hi>
 as of <hi>Appearance. Ephes.</hi> 1.10. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of he Father
 and of Christ, <hi>That in the Dispensation of the Fulnesse of Time, he might
 gather together in One, All Things in Christ, both which are in Heaven, and
 which are on Earth, even in Him.</hi> The Dispensation of the Fulnesse of Time,
 is the Discovery of <hi>Eternity,</hi> which gathers up into One undivided
 State, All Times, Past, Present, To Come; and is therefore called the
 <hi>Fulnesse of Time,</hi> which is the Shadow to this Body. This Dispensation
 began at Christ's Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and was then perfected in <hi>His Person.</hi>
 Now was our Lord fully Glorified. Now He saw All Things in the Beatificall
 Vision, in the God-head, after a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as unchangeable, as God. Nothing
 passed away, nothing was to Come. From the Heighth of Heaven above, to the
 Depth of the Earth, and the Creature below, He possesseth All Things, in One
 Glory, even in Himselfe. To Him then there is now no more Roome for Ascent, or
 Descent, for Change of Time or Place. What then is His Second Comming? 'Tis His
 Shining forth upon the rest of the Creatures; that, as He comprehends Himselfe
 and All Things in God: So They may comprehend All Things, and Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in
 Him. Our Saviour speaks this plainly, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.27. <hi>For as the
 Lightning commeth out of the East, and shineth unto the West, even so shall
 also the Comming of the Son of Man be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> cals it an <hi>Appearance, Colos.</hi>
 3.4. <hi>Your Life is hid with Christ in God: When Christ, who is our Life,
 shall appeare, then shall we appeare with Him in <pb n="15" facs="tcp:96807:12"/>
 Glory.</hi> The Person of Christ is taken into the Glory of God. This is
 invisible, not to it selfe, nor any thing like it selfe, but to Eyes of Flesh.
 Thus Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is Hid, as God is, by the Greatnesse of the Glory. In His
 Second Comming, He is as the Brightnesse of the God-head breaking forth upon
 the World; discovering it self, as a New Root of Immortality below the Natural
 Root of each Creature; and clothing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on each Appearance with a New Appearance
 of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Thus the Comming of Christ is an Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Himselfe from the
 same Center, yet not to Himself, but others.</p>
                  <p>So Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls this Comming, <hi>A Revelation
 from Heaven,</hi> 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.7. <hi>And to you, who are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, rest
 with us, when the Lord Iesus shall be revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from Heaven.</hi> In this sense
 Saint <hi>Peter</hi> speakes, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.20, 21. <hi>And He shall send
 Iesus Christ, &amp;c. whom the Heavens must receive, till the restitution of
 All Things.</hi> When our Lord Ascended, He was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed above all Heavens into
 God; from thence im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately He goes on shining forth, and dispensing the
 Glory of God through the Heavens, the Invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of this Creation, Angells
 and Spirits of Men. Within this Limit He containes his Beames till the Last
 Day. Then He shall Enlarge His Circuite to take in the Visible and Bodily Part
 of Things, when They also shall be Restored, and Returne into that Glory, and
 Divinity, out of which They fell.</p>
                  <p>There is One Thing more to be observed, before we passe from
 this Head. <hi>The Second Comming of Christ is Graduall.</hi> As the Sun, when
 it is gone from us to <pb n="16" facs="tcp:96807:13"/> the utmost Point of Heaven
 South-ward, immediately Returnes: So our Saviour began His Comming again into
 the World at His Ascension, so soone, as He had reaeh't the furthest Point of
 Distance from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in the Heigths of the Creatour. We reade
 <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6. <hi>And again, when He bringeth His First-begotten Son into
 the World, He saith; Let all the Angells of God Worship Him.</hi> Thus it is
 read in the English Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But, as a late Learned Critick hath observed,
 it runs Thus in the Greek: <hi>When He</hi> (that is, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) <hi>bringeth
 His First-begotten Sonne againe into the World,</hi> &amp;c. This place thus
 read, manifestly joynes together the Ascention of our Lord, and His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
 the Second time into the World. For when was it that Proclamation was made
 among the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to Worship Jesus Christ? Was it not then, when He Ascended,
 and sate downe at the Right Hand of God? So it is cleerly seene
 <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 9<hi>t</hi> 10. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God also hath Highly exalted
 Him, and given Him a Name above every Name; That at the Name of</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
 <hi>every Knee should bow.</hi> So soone as our King is entred into the Divine
 Glory, and hath there received the Ointment of the God-head, immediately He
 comes forth, and begins to shew Himselfe in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse of Glory thorow the
 Creatures, to receive their Fealty and Homage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Revel.</hi> 6.2. The Coronation of Christ, and his Comming
 forth in a Spirituall Beauty are conjoyn'd by Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> who there
 begins his Prophetick Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and makes this the opening of the First Seale on
 the Booke, <hi>I saw, and behold a White Horse, and He that sate on Him had a
 Bow, and a Crowne was given <pb n="17" facs="tcp:96807:13"/> Him, and He went forth
 Conquering and to Conquer.</hi> The Booke is the Image of God, the Seven Seales
 the Naturall Formes of Things. The Opening of the Seales by the Lamb, His
 Comming forth in the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>I will finish this Head with that place of Scripture, 1
 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45. <hi>The First Man Adam was made a Living Soule: the Last
 Man was made a Quickning Spirit.</hi> Our Blessed Lord in his Second Appearance
 comes into the World, as a Soule comes downe into the Body. The Soule comes
 downe upon the Body, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing it with a new Shape, Life, and Lustre. So Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
 Christ descends upon the World, to Comprehend, to Act it, to Appeare in it, to
 Gather it up into One Spirit of Beauty and Immortality, in Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
                  <p>So shall the Heavenly Man sprout forth thorough the Earth, as
 an Vniversall Paradise; sending forth all Earthly Formes, as Revived Plants, by
 a New Growth, out of Himselfe. Then shall All Without the Circle of this
 Spirituall Person, this Quickning Spirit be Death and Hell; a Hell for Dogs and
 Devils; each foule, false, and fiery Spirit.</p>

 Carthage, passed thorow the Court into the presence of the Queene, there stood
 in the midst of them unperceived, while they speak of Him, as absent, Lament
 him as lost; till the Fire purified it selfe into a Clearnesse. So the Great
 Prince of Peace and Spirits, as He comes forth, casts a Cloud about Him; so He
 comes on upon us; so He encompasseth us, is still in Motion. Yet still we speak
 of Him, as far above and beyond the Starry Sky, and of His Comming, as at a
 Great Distance. But, Behold! He is already in the midst of us; He breaks forth
 on our Right hand, and on our Left, like a Flame, round about us; and we

 in the Night.</hi> 'Tis the interposal of the Earth's shadow between the Sunne
 and our Eyes, that makes Night. The Devill benights Man-kind, by interposing
 this shadowie world betweene their Saviour and their Soules. In this Night he
 rocks them into a Sleep, by a perpetuall Motion of vanities. In this Sleep he
 deludes them with Dreames of Reason, Counterfeit Images of Truth. Now in this
 Night, Sleep, and Dreame the Day of Christ's appearance, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares not, but as
 a Fancy or Dotage. All things seem to continue as they were from the Beginning.
 Where, say they, is the Promise of His Comming? They dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne no Dawning of

                  <p>All the Powers and Spirits of Darknesse hate the Light; and
 Christ, because He comes as the Light, to <hi>increase</hi> and
 <hi>inflame</hi> their Darknesse. They therefore Strive to raise Mists upon
 this Rising Glory, that they may stain it, if they cannot stop its Course. So
 the Progresse of Christ is to the greatest part of Men, like the Motion of the
 Sunne in a Winter day, when 'tis hard to perceive the Day-break, or distinguish
 between Day and Night. This is the First sort of <hi>Clouds, Dark

                  </p>
                  <p>The Comming of our Saviour in the Spirit, is for the Full

 Clouds, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. The Creation in its first Principles is Figured out
 to us, as a Dark and Deep Sea. Each particular Creature is as a Cloud raised
 out of this Sea of Darknesse, over-cast with Light and Images. When the Temple
 was finish't, which was an Earthly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace shadowing out Heaven, fil'd with all
 Excellencyes, as Pictures of Heavenly Glories; then <hi>Solomon</hi> saith to
 God, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 8.12. <hi>Thou dwellest in Thick Darknesse</hi>:
 Signifying, that the Brightest Beauties of Nature are True Clouds.</p>
                  <p>In the midst of this Darknesse our Saviour passeth on; upon
 the backs of these Clouds he comes riding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long. Behind the visible Formes of
 things He hides Himselfe, and steales in upon us ere we be aware. All Their
 Motions are His Approaches. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. The Disciples ask their Master,
 What should be the signes of His Comming? He relates by way of Prophesie the
 whole story of the World, Publike in Nations, Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular in Families, Private
 in single Persons, From His death, to that of the whole World: And so He
 answers their Question, teaching them, that as all Creatures are the
 <hi>Print</hi> of his Feet, so their whole Conduct is the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of
 His Feet, Their <hi>Commotions</hi> His <hi>Commings on</hi> upon them.</p>
                  <p>As the Whale moveth himselfe under the Waters, the Billows
 rise and rowl, the Deep boyles like a Pot. Before our Saviour's time
 <hi>Lucifer</hi> was the <hi>Leviathan,</hi> that made the Sea to seeth about
 him, like a Pot of Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now our Lord Jesus sports Himselfe in these
 Waters. He makes his way under them, and as he <pb n="22" facs="tcp:96807:16"/> moves, The
 Deepes of Mens Spirits, Counsailes, Common-wealths, boyle, the whole Frame of
 Things reel and rowl themselves into violent Concussions, like Waves of the

 1.7. <hi>And of Angels He saith, He hath made His Angels Spirits, His Ministers
 a Flame of Fire.</hi> These are the Waters in which the Chambers of God are;
 the Clouds which are His Chariot; the Winged Windes, on which He rides; the
 Flames, in which He Comes.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> joynes these Two, <hi>Angels</hi> and
 <hi>Flames,</hi> at the Comming of Christ, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.7, 8. <hi>The
 Lord shall be revealed from Heaven, with His Mighty Angels, And with Flaming
 Fire.</hi> The Flame of Fire is Heat working it selfe into Light. This is the
 Immediate Image and Instrument of Angels in this visible World, thorow 
 <pb n="23" facs="tcp:96807:16"/> this they appeare and work. All the Appearances of God
 under the Law were by Angels. All the Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of Angels were by Flames, or
 Light. The Angel went up from <hi>Manoah</hi> in a Flame: <hi>Iud.</hi> 30.20.
 He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to <hi>Moses</hi> in a Flame: <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.2. The Angels came
 downe upon the sacrifices in a Flame. The Lord Jesus shall come in a Flame of
 Angels.</p>
                  <p>The Glory of God in Christ, as he comes the second time,
 breaks forth upon the Angels. In these He Flames out upon the Bodily Part of
 Things, as Fire dissolving them in their own shapes, and resolving and raising
 them into Angelicall Formes. These are the Heavenly Flames of Glory, in which
 Saints are Blessed; the Fire of Hell, in which Evill men are tormented;
 Angelicall Forms.</p>
                  <p>In this sense Jesus Christ tels us, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.22. that
 <hi>Lazarus</hi> being dead, was carryed by Angels into <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi>
 Bosome. That Glory of God, which is cal'd <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham's</hi> Bosome, (a Type
 of the Fathers Bosome,) was revealed in the Angels, in them it over-shadowed
 <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> withdrawing Him out of this Present State, and gathering Him
 up unto these Spirits, which are the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Earthly Man.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly we read, <hi>Mark</hi> 13.27. <hi>He shall send
 forth His Angels, and gather His Elect from the Four Windes.</hi> This shall be
 the Resurrectin of the Body, when this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Image and life, which was as

 by their opening themselves upon it, be again taken in to God, in these
 Spiritual Chambers.</p>
                  <p>In the same sence Angels are called the Chariots of God:

                  <p>I will make an end of this Discourse with that Place,

                  <p>As a Sun-beame beating with a strong Light upon the Naturall

 And now how cleer, how sweet, how satisfactory must this sight be? 'Tis a
 <hi>Fit Union</hi> of an <hi>Object Suitable</hi> to <hi>a Proportion'd

 Things more than Thee. Now they are Everlastingly gone, and have left me alone:

                     <hi>The First
 Consideration is</hi> this: 'Tis now ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <pb n="29" facs="tcp:96807:19"/> years since our
 <hi>Fasts</hi> and our <hi>Fights</hi> have been mutually interwoven. Yet, what
 Profit have we of the One? what Peace from the Other? what end of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
 Still we <hi>fast,</hi> still we <hi>fight,</hi> if not in Camps, yet more
 dangerously in Counsailes. Our ship is fil'd with waves, more still pressing
 in, ready to sink it: So that we may cry, <hi>O God! carest thou not, that we
 perish in the mid'st of all our Prayres, Praises, Fasts, and Holy
 Feasts?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now you are met againe to fast and pray: Now put on your
 Tenderest Bowels of pity and affection. So look upon this poore Kingdome, which
 hath wrapt up in it your Countreymen, your Kinred, all your Dearest and
 sweetest Relations: Nay, that which to you sure should be, more than all These;
 the Glory of your God. See it trembling and hovering between A <hi>Heaven of
 Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> all good Angels and Men striving to raise it up thither, and
 <hi>A Hell of Ruine,</hi> the weight of all Devils, and bad Men hanging upon
 it, to sinke it downe thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Let this sight melt you, Let it move you to call up all your
 strength this once; to cry mightily to God. Who Knows, what <hi>this One
 Day</hi> may do to Crosse the feares, to Crown the hopes and toyle of many
 yeares, if it please the Eternall Spirit, to blow right and strong upon your
 Spirits, <hi>this One Day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Six dayes the Army of Israel compassed <hi>Iericho</hi>; yet
 still It stood. On the seventh Day they compassed it seven Times; at the
 seventh Time, the Priests blew with the Trumpets, and the people gave a Mighty
 shout, and the walls of <hi>Iericho</hi> fell downe flat to the Ground. This is
 the <hi>First Consideration.</hi>
                  </p>

                     </note>
                     <hi>The second Consideration</hi> is this. No teares
 prevaile with God, but such as are wept over Jesus Christ. <hi>All the Tribes
 of the Earth shall mourn over Him.</hi> If Jesus Christ be not the Flame in our
 Breast, that melts our Hearts; if He be not the Object, that draws forth our
 Teares, though we weep Blood, our Blood will be, but as Water spilt upon the
 Ground.</p>
                  <p>If we grieve, and not <hi>in</hi> Christ, our Griefe is
 Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, or at best but Formality. If we grieve, and not <hi>for</hi>
 Christ, our Griefe is Idolatry. What makes the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses of men mutually
 understood and moving? 'Tis the union of Men in One Vniversall Spirit of
 Reason. What makes Colours, Sounds understood and moving, in the Eye or Eare?
 'Tis the union of Sense and Sensible Things, in One Common Spirit or Principle
 of Sense.</p>
                  <p>If you will touch the Heart of God with your Prayers and
 Sorrowes, it must be by a union between Him and you, in One Vniversall, Common
 Person, the Lord Jesus, God-Man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iacob</hi> obtained not the Blessing by Prayers and Tears
 alone. But as He prayed and wept, He held fast in His Armes the Angel of the
 Covenant. Then shall the Day break upon us, and we become as Princes with God,
 when we pray, and with our Jesus in our Armes; when we weepe upon the Bosome of
 our Jesus.</p>
                  <p>If then you have any Sense of the utmost good or ill of this
 Kingdome, first your <hi>Parent,</hi> now your <hi>Foster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child</hi>: If you
 have any Sense of your own Safeties, your Soules, your immortalitie, any thing;
 Send up a strong and secret groane, which God may heare, and say with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you:
 O! that the Lord Jesus, that All-quickning Spirit would descend into our
 Spirits, and become a <pb n="31" facs="tcp:96807:20"/> Spring of Divine sorrowes there!
 Then should our Teares be as His Blood. O! that the Lord Jesus the Highest
 Image of Love and Beauty, the most profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and persecuted, would set Himselfe
 before our eyes! Then should we know, Why, and How to weep: then should we weep
 indeed.</p>
                  <p>If our Dear Saviour would make his Arms our Crosse, that we
 might from thence offer our Broken Hearts in Sacrifice to the Father; then
 would our God smell a sweet Savour of Rest in us, and at length give us Rest in
 Himselfe. This is <hi>the second Consideration</hi> in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative.</p>

 <hi>Paul</hi> tels us now, <hi>This is the Greatest Mystery of Godlinesse: God
 manifested in the Flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of Angels:</hi> Behold!
 Jesus Christ, as God puts forth Himselfe in the Forme of Flesh, of the
 Creature, and over-spreads that Form or Flesh with the Glory and Spirit of the
 God-head. Thus He shines forth already upon the One Half of Things, the
 Invisible Part: He already is risen upon the Angels, as Starres, at once
 gathering them up into His Divine Light, and riding forth upon their Beames. So
 each Starre now carryes forth a Sun along with it: Each An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, the Son of man
 and God.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tels us, <hi>Colos.</hi> 2.10. <hi>that
 Christ is the Head of All Principality and Power.</hi> Our Lord Jesus cloth'd
 with the Glory of His Father, hath united Himselfe to the Acting Principles,
 and Ruling Powers of this Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. Now He Flames forth thorow these invisible
 <pb n="33" facs="tcp:96807:21"/> Fires into all Courts, Campes, or Counsailes, into eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
 Frame of things. Now He flyes abroad upon the Backs of these Cherubims, and the
 Wings of these Winds into the Breast of each Man, into the Bosome of each
 Creature.</p>
                  <p>We reade, <hi>Colos.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Having spoyled
 Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Powers, He made a Shew of them Openly, Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing over
 Them.</hi> See the Lord Jesus binding Evill Spirits, the Powers of This world
 in straiter Chaines of Darknesse, leading them Captives at the Taile of His
 Chariot, making them His Slaves, to Serve Him for Executioners, as the Mutes
 doe the Great Turke; to raine downe Snares, Tempests, Fire and Brimstone on His
 Enemies.</p>
                  <p>Have you seene the Lord thus mounted on His Horses of Fire?
 Like the Sun, like a Champion comming forth to run His Race from one end of
 Things to the Other? Are you come to this Mount Sion, where the Mediatour
 appears with God in the midst of His innumerable Angels?</p>
                  <p>If you be Strangers to such Sights, then Mourn. For you are
 yet at Mount Sinai in the midst of Clouds and Stormes. You are still in a
 Wildernesse full of Fiery Serpents, where every Step you take may be to a
 Death. As you Mourn, Pray: <hi>Sweet Iesus Shine; Sweet Iesus Come thou, as the
 Day-spring from on High upon us; Change the Appearance, Open to us this New
 Frame of Angels Glories, covering the World like Clouds, and thy Glories raised
 on These.</hi>

                     <hi>Have you Seen the Lord Iesus Comming in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of
 Men on Earth?</hi> This is the 2. Step of our <pb n="34" facs="tcp:96807:22"/> Saviour's
 Descent from the Bosome of the Father. We are taught, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.20, 21.
 that, <hi>The Kingdome of God commeth not with Observation. For the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
 of God is within You.</hi> The Glory of the Father, in which Christ Comes, is
 the Kingdome of God. This is not obvious to Sence or Reason grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
 Sence. For it comes not their way, from without. It bubbles up from an inward
 Spring, like Life. From within it Enlarges it Selfe, as Circles from the
 Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Out-most being Last.</p>
                  <p>This is the Method, by which our Saviour comes Spiritually
 into the world. <hi>First</hi> the Godhead opens it Selfe upon the Humane
 Nature of Christ, making that the First-fruits of the whole Creation.
 <hi>Colos.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Lord Jesus with this
 over-spreading Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry comes downe upon the Angels, making them, the
 First-fruits of Spirits. The <hi>Third</hi> Step, which He takes, is through
 the Angels into the Souls of Mortall Men. In these He plants Himselfe, as a
 Throne Circled in with the various Beauties of Angels, like the
 di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse-Coloured Raine-bow, <hi>Revel.</hi> 4.3. Thus these become the
 First-fruits of Men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. The <hi>Fourth</hi> Remove is upon the
 Bodies of the Saints, that they may be the First-fruits of Bodies. The
 <hi>Last</hi> is the Passing of the Lord Jesus from the Bodies of the Saints
 into the whole Frame of Visible Things; as a Flame still taking hold of
 Neighbouring Fuell, Still Catching and Infolding it selfe thorow All Things. By
 these Degrees the Lord Descends in Glorious State, and as He Descends,

                  <p>Unhappy He! That Sees not the Comming of Christ into His own

 among men; the Distance lessening betweene Heaven and Earth; the Glory of the
 Godhead growing to a Fuller Tide, and winning upon the World, as the Sea eating
 in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Land. He cannot discerne the Times and their Changes, How, or Why
 they are; the Fatality of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Kingdomes, their Periods. For these

 Suppose a Man by Miracle, Borne and Grown up in One Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night. Day now begins

 Hand; on another, Pleasant Fields, Faire Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, a Peacefull Country. As
 the Light increaseth, the Face of these Things still Changeth, Presenting Fresh
 Horrours, and fuller Beauties. Would not this Man Amazedly Wonder, whence these
 Formes of Things should grow round about Him, with such So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainnesse and
 Change? till He look't upward, and Saw the Light of Heaven, as It goes on in

                  <p>Who is not Amazed to See the Changes that are made in the

 saw The Glory of God: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. This Glory was the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Frame of
 our Saviours Divine Comming upon His Chariot composed of Living Creatures and
 Wheels: Angels Spiritualized, Bodies Angelized. In this vision He saw the State
 of Jerusalem, and accordingly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn'd the Jewes.</p>
                  <p>As the shadow went back upon the Dyal of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> so
 <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> life was set back from Death. The Person of our Lord Jesus
 is the Diall of Time, as the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head is in the Course of it's Glory advances
 or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws upon this Diall: So it points out the Rise or Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of Persons
 and Things.</p>
                  <p>We read, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. That God gave to Christ the
 Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of Things by a Light of Glory, in His own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; to this end,
 that He might shew to His Servants, what will quickly Be. Our Lord Jesus is
 that Word of God, which is to be, the Man of our Counsailes. On Him we are to
 look, in Him to see, what <hi>should be</hi>; by seeing God in His own Formes:
 what <hi>shall be,</hi> by seeing God in All Formes of the Creature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:96807:25"/>This is Reason, say the Heathen. A
 Connexion of Things Past, with those which are Present, a Deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Things
 to come out of Both, for Discovery and Direction. This is a Dark Shadow of
 Christ. He is the Reason of a Christian, who unites and represents by a Perfect
 Light, all Three States of Things, calling Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe by this Three-fold Name;
 He that is, He that was, He that is to Come.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>A Resignation to Christ for Conduct.</hi> This is
 the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Thing, which Christ calls for in His second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. <hi>I am
 Alpha and Omega saith the Lord, He that is, He that was, He that is to Come,
 the Almighty,</hi> the All-comprehending: <hi>Revel</hi>: 1.8. The Spirituall
 Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ, is the great Tide of Things; this way the fulnesse of the
 God-head pours forth it selfe from Sea to Sea, from the Beginning to the End of
 Things, Both in Himselfe. Happy is He, who puts Himselfe into the Current of
 this stream; swiftly, smoothly, safely shall He be carryed along upon it to His
 End.</p>
                  <p>There is Mention of a Wheel, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.26. <hi>The

                     </gap>. Our Lord Jesus comes on as the Great Wheel of Things,
 reposing in it selfe, and rowling on with it selfe, those, who are taken up
 unto it: But bringing it selfe over those which fall out of it, and breaking

                  <p>There are two Things which expresse an unsuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse in our

 Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Prudence.</hi> The Israelites in the wildernesse made a Golden Calfe
 for their Guide, after the Example of the Aegyptians, who worship'd an Ox for
 their Chiefe God. For this <hi>Moses,</hi> say they, we know not what is become
 of Him. What was the successe? They were forc'd to embitter their Drink with
 the Powder of this Calfe.</p>
                  <p>Have any of you been thus tempted, to make the Calf of
 Humane-Policy your Counsellour, because this is the God of Nations? or to
 think; <hi>We know not what This Iesus, or His Comming in The Spirit meane?
 Shall we trust our selves, and the Kingdome to a name, an ayrie Fancy?</hi> If
 you have been thus tempted, I hope your own Piety and Prudence will prompt you
 to grind this Calf to Powder by a Penitent Contrition, and make it bitter to
 your Spirits, by a Kindly Remorse.</p>
                  <p>I humbly commend to you one story at large record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: 1
 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. <hi>Samuel</hi> promised <hi>Saul</hi> to come at a Day, He
 delay'd. <hi>Saul</hi> feared the <hi>Philistines</hi> comming upon Him with a
 Mighty Body; the Dividing of the People from Him: He growes weary of
 <hi>Samuel's</hi> stay, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth Himselfe to sacrifice. If you have so
 fal'n, so forc'd your selves, for such reasons, to sacrifice, to establish a
 worship without the Divine Appearances, because they have been delay'd: O
 repent and feare, lest <hi>Samuel's</hi> message to <hi>Saul,</hi> be to you
 also: <hi>Now is the Kingdome divided from you,</hi> this way, by which you
 thought to confirme it to you.</p>
                  <p>Let us at last be Converted, and become as Little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, 
 <pb n="42" facs="tcp:96807:26"/> learning what that Meanes, <hi>To Obey is better than
 Sacrifice, and to Hearken, than the fat of Rams.</hi> To Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the
 Breathings and whispers of the Lord Jesus; to Obey the Breakings in of the
 God-head upon us, is more than All Burnt-offerings, or our Best
 Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Unsuitablenesse. The Designing an Earthly Power

 saith the Holy Man: <hi>Psal.</hi> 73.50. The Earthly Image is the Strumpet,
 Humane Prudence the Eyes of this Harlot, which are as snares; Humane Power the
 Hands, which are Nets and Bands. He that is allured and caught by these, is

                  <p>In the Progresse of this Mighty King, as He goes on
 Conquering; An Earth-quake shakes All Things, the Sun becomes Black, the Moon
 as Blood; Stars fall like untimely figs; Heaven passeth away as a Scroll

 at the presence of the Lord. The most Spirituall Appearances of God thorow
 Flesh are darkned and dis-appeare: The brightest of Fleshly Formes, The fairest
 letter of the Highest Mysteries, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come seeds of Warre, and sink in blood: Men

                  <p>Every Fleshly thing, is a vaile between us and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. All

 Onions. We are very unwilling to travell thorow a wildernesse, though it be
 unto a Land flowing with Milk and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
                  <p>We are like <hi>Lot,</hi> we know not how to leave this

 we are come forth from the City of this World, casting a longing look back upon
 it in the midst of its Flames. But if we be like her in her fault, let us be so
 too in the Consequence of it. She was chang'd into a Pillar of salt. So may we
 as in answer to the Type, if we bring forth a Spirit of Remorse and Fire, like
 salt, to consume the Fleshly, Corrupting Part; that the Divine Part may be
 preserv'd untainted to Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The second Enmity is an Aversenesse from the
 Spirit.</hi> Jesus Christ promised His Disciples the Effusion of the Spirit, at
 the Disappearance of His Flesh. He spake to them of Divine Powers, Lights,
 Gloryes, Joyes, of the Highest Company and Contents which should come, when His
 Spirit came. Yet the Disciples were sad, and as dead men still, when their
 Saviour spake of His Death. The Spirit appear'd to them a Miserable Comforter
 and Comfort, when they were no more to have a grosse sight of their Jesus in
 Flesh. He was as None to them, when He was to be Onely in the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Peter</hi> felt Himselfe born up alone by the
 work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing waves, he feares, faints, and begins to sink, though he have the Call
 of Christ to carry him on, and Christ Himselfe in his Eye to infuse Spirits
 into him. This is an Example for us: When we cal'd by God, begin to feel the
 Foundations of the Earth, and the Seeming-firme Land of Sense withdrawing from
 us, when we are now Lanching forth into the Sea of the God-head; we no sooner
 feel our selves left upon the waters of the Spirit, to be sustain'd by them,
 but Immediately we sink our selves by our feares and unbeliefe.</p>

                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:96807:28"/>Let us then now weep, that we have refused
 the All-quickning Spirit, which is our Jesus, as if there were no Life in this
 Spirit, or no Light in this Life, as if God were a wildernesse, and the
 Building of God had no Foundation or Fairenesse in it. Let us now returne
 weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and say, <hi>We have feared to commit our loves, hopes, and joyes to
 Thee, O meek, O Mighty Iesus! But all our Springs are in Thee, those that feed
 our outward senses, our inward Faculties, with Streames of Life, Truth,
 Strength and Pleasures. Thou art our onely Husband, the Image of all Loves, and
 Lovelinesse to us, the Best Image of our selves. Come thou downe upon us,

                  <p>Formes are sweet Helpes, but too severe Lords over our Faith.
 They may be Ornaments to our Face and <pb n="48" facs="tcp:96807:29"/> Neck, serving the
 Beauty of Christ's Appearances to us, and His union with us. But then they must
 be of Gold or Precious stone, taken out of the Mine or Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury of the Spirit.
 So worne, they may become the Heires at age, the Spirit-born Princes. But if
 they be of Iron or Brasse, laid upon our Feet and Hands; that is, Grosse in
 Fleshly Darknesse, binding up the Activity and Motion of our Spirits towards
 God; then are they sad Marks of the Bond-womans Children.</p>
                  <p>The Body is esteem'd a Prison or Grave to the Soul; because it
 tyes the Soul up into One Particular Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, suffering it not to enlarge
 it selfe to any other, but as they are reflected in This Glasse. When the
 Eternall Spirit is fast'ned, and proportion'd to any One Form of Things, is it
 not now imprison'd or buried? It was a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable and High Contemplation, that

 Consecrate, or converse with any Ordinance or Peculiar way of worship; let us
 then remember, that our Object is the Person of Jesus Christ, that Wisdome of
 God, whose way is more untrac'd than the Eagle, whose extent is wider than the
 Earth. The Heavens of Heavens cannot take in All of Him, to Containe or Confine
 Him; much lesse any One Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in this world, or Fleshly Fashion.</p>
                  <p>'Tis in vain to attempt to shut up Christ in any Thing. Though
 you kill Him, that you may keep Him safe; though you lay Him in a Grave hewne
 out of a Rock in a Garden, a Frame contriv'd with greatest strength and Beauty;
 though you set the Seal of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity upon it, and a guard about it; yet Christ

                  <p>Jesus Christ tels <hi>Peter, What I do, thou knowest not, but
 thou shalt know hereafter. Ioh.</hi> 13.6. Our Saviour puts forth Himself to
 Men in Many Appearances, of which they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable, to lie as seeds in their
 Spirits, and perhaps after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years grow into distinct Fruits in their
 understanding, and ripe Fruits in their Affections. Then they know that a
 Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet hath been among them: That the Highest Appearances of God have been
 plain before their Eyes, when they have least imagin'd it.</p>
                  <p>The Wise-man that spake in Parables and Proverbs tels
 <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.2. <hi>'Tis the Glory of God, to conceale a Thing</hi>
 (<hi>the Word</hi> in Hebrew) <hi>and of Kings to search out the matter, (the
 Word.)</hi> God makes it His Designe in this World, to bring forth the Eternall
 word, the Brightest Image of Himself, so as that we <hi>Seeing</hi> Him shall
 not <hi>See</hi> Him. But then it pertaines to the Kingdome of Christ, as the
 proper Glory of that, to comprehend this Dark World, and make it understood by
 <hi>it's</hi> Light. Take heed then how you judge the Comming of Christ by the
 Day-light of this world, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'tis His Glory to come in the Night.</p>
                  <p>The Devil too labours to Darken the Comming of Christ. 
 <pb n="50" facs="tcp:96807:30"/> Sweetest and Clearest Spirits in which the Bride-groome
 comes forth most Beautifully, are by Him clog'd and clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the Disguise

 Christ Himself. The most Heavenly Truths, which are, as the lookings forth of
 this King of Glory, are by him presented to the World in the most deformed
 Appearances of Hellish Blasphemies.</p>
                  <p>As the Devill hath his Arrowes which flie in the Dark; so hath
 Christ: His Comming in the Spirit, is an Arrow, that flies in the Dark at
 Noon-day; Woe be to him, that stands in its way, it will pierce his Liver. Our
 Saviour speaks it of Himself: If the Good man knew, at what hour the Thief
 would come, he would watch, and not suffer his house to be broke open. If you
 know the Time and way in which Christ will certainly come, you might
 <hi>define</hi> that, and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine</hi> Him. But now fear to be mistaken,
 because of that place of Scripture: <hi>The stone, which the Builders refused,
 is become the Head of the Corner: Psal.</hi> 118.22. The stone which the
 Builders refused, is become the Head of the Corner. <hi>O ye Builders! Take
 heed, what stone ye refuse. O ye Men! Take heed of stumbling at that Stone
 which the Builders refuse, lest your Buildings and Selves be broken upon it,
 but That grow up into a Building of Glory, which can never be broken or
 shaken.</hi> Thus much for the First Caution.</p>

 <hi>His Brightnesse was as the Light: Hornes were in His Hand, and there was

 with a Drawn Sword in his way. I intend no particular Application, but onely a
 generall Allusion. <hi>Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> is fleshly Man, that hath the visions of
 God in the Fleshly Image. The Asse, the Externall Power of Nature and the
 Creature, on which he rides. When you go forth against any, that call
 themselves Israel, and think your selves most clearly sent from the mouth or
 face of God: yet if then your Asse retreat, fall back, Rush upon the walls of
 Difficulties; take heed of putting him on too fiercely: Let it fairly warn you
 to fear: Perhaps the Power of Nature and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, sees the Lord Jesus
 Comming forth, with the Sword of His Spirit Brandish'd in his Hand. If it
 should go on, it might carry you into an Absolute Ruine. Take heed then of

 the Blast of an Angels Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, or Glance of an Angels Eye, can Jesus Christ
 give our Dead Hopes a Glorious Resurrection out of their Dust.</p>
                  <p>Let us then in the midst of our Sorrows sing, <hi>The Lord
 Raignes: Let the Earth be glad. The Lord Comes. Clouds are upon us, but Angels
 ride upon those Clouds, and the Lord Iesus upon those Angels.</hi> Open your
 Eyes, see the King, as He comes in Glorious State. If <hi>Elisha</hi> saw
 <hi>Eliah,</hi> as he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, he was to have the spirit of his Master
 doubled upon him. If we see our Saviour as He descends in a Divine Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; we
 shall be cloth'd with His Spirit, and His Mantle: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Beauties, Outward
 Prosperities, falling fresh from the Person of Christ on us, as He comes down
 upon us.</p>
                  <p>Let us then spread our own Garments, our Earthly Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
 Policies, or Prosperities, in His way, under His feet. And as He passeth along,
 let us cry aloud in our songs: <hi>Hosanna, Hosanna, Save now: Blessed is He
 that comes in the Name of the Lord: Hosanna; Now Save us.</hi>
