            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Here offer you not a Tranſcript, nor Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, but my own free, and perhaps, not quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded Thoughts on ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Subjects; though I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to impoſe on any Mans <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, my
<pb facs="tcp:93255:3"/>
own irregular Fancies, as inclining more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to Scepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſim in diſputable matters, than to that Bold, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſterial air of Dogmatical Philoſophers. My chief Deſign then in writing and publiſhing this preſent Treatiſe, was to furniſh the <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> with matters fit for ingenious Converſations: Which perhaps I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd in ſome meaſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the great, and not unpleaſant Variety of things it contains. I ſpeak every
<pb facs="tcp:93255:3"/>
where my mind with a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical freedom, neither blaming other mens Fancies, nor preſuming too much upon my own Conceits. And if I ſeem to be ſomewhat Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxical on ſeveral occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, 'tis more in appearance perhaps, than in realty: for theſe ſeeming Paradoxes, if not overlook't, may appear to an unprejudic'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Reader undenyable Truths, or at leaſt (which is my utmoſt aim) not to be altogether improbable. Of ſuch things
<pb facs="tcp:93255:4"/>
'tis free to every one to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> as it ſerves his turn, or preſent Fancy. Wherein I could never conceive any thing of a pedantick Humour, but a very Lawful, and Laudable Exerciſe of Wit and Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: which I deſignedly add, becauſe ſome, I know, are of Opinion, that all kind of Learning and Ingenuity ſhould be baniſhed from a free and familiar Converſe: But I conceive ſuch Men to be either of the dulleſt
<pb facs="tcp:93255:4"/>
ſort, or <hi>Epicureo de grege Porcos,</hi> meer <hi>Epicureans,</hi> as taking delight in nothing, but what may pleaſe their Senſes, or revive the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of their paſt Pleaſures. Thus ſome home-bred Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen make a long Story to every one they meet, of what they daily either eat or drink. Others talk per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually of their Amours, Miſtreſſes, and new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues, and not a few a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe your Patience with ſevere Reflections on their Neighbours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:93255:5"/>But ſince you are not guilty of ſuch Irregularities, I had, no doubt, ſome other reaſon, than your Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to prefix your Name before theſe Papers. I ſhall then perhaps, offend your Modeſty, but not the Truth, if I ſay it was chiefly the great ſhare you have in the Subject they treat of. 'Tis true, the Antient and preſent State of your Noble Family, and other advantages of that kind might have enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me to make you this
<pb facs="tcp:93255:5"/>
Preſent, had I been of an Humor to value Men only by their out ſide, I mean, by what is without them, and not rather by their real Parts, and if I may ſo ſay, intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Nobility. I ow indeed an outward Reſpect to a Perſon of Quality, yet I ſhall pay him no inward Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, if nothing elſe recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him, but the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Family; whence you may eaſily judge, that, how conſiderable ſoever you may be in the Eyes of the
<pb facs="tcp:93255:6"/>
World on other accounts, I do value you moſt for what is really your own, I mean your Ingenuity, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, Wiſdom; yea, and Virtue too, ſo ſeldom to be met with in this corrupted Age we live in. As theſe Endowments of the Mind are far more taking with me than any other advantages of Fortune whatſoever, ſo they were my chief Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to let you know by this inconſiderable Preſent, that I am in Realty, and
<pb facs="tcp:93255:6"/>
without Flattery, which I hate,</p>

            </argument>
            <p>TIs ſeemingly improbable, yet very true, that the things we are moſt acquainted with, we leaſt know. Thus Light, than which, nothing in the whole Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is more conſpicuous, is as impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable to the dim Eyes of our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, as 'tis viſible and obvious to thoſe of our Bodies. Thus Time
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93255:8"/>
ſo generally known and diſcours'd of, is as obſcure unto me, if not more, than Eternity it ſelf. What more viſible than Colours? Since we ſee nothing elſe; yet if I conſult for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions ſake, Phyloſophers, I ſhall make no more of their moſt ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory Anſwers, than that they are, (at leaſt to my weak underſtanding) meer occult qualities, <hi>un je ne ſcay quoy,</hi> or I know not what. So far theſe Great Men, though deſervedly reputed not ordinary <hi>Wits,</hi> fall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs ſhort, of the true Orgine, and Mechaniſm of the moſt known and viſible Objects. The Wind I feel, and am extreamly ſenſible of, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when boiſterous, and blows hard; what it is, whence it comes, why it is ſo changeable; and yet in ſome parts of the World ſo conſtant, why it moves ſidewiſe and <hi>Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally</hi> (as they ſpeak) and not <hi>Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicularly,</hi> or from the Circumference to the Centre on a ſtrait Line, I never yet could reach, and thought
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93255:8"/>
always the Laudable Endeavours of ſuch as have undertaken to give us an account of thoſe hidden, though moſt viſible <hi>Phinomena</hi>'s, altogether unſucceſsful.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What I have ſaid of Light, Time, Colours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and whatever we are moſt converſant with in the Works of the Creation, I ſhall with a no leſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Reaſon, apply to our preſent Subject: For what the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines call, <hi>Ingenium</hi> the French, <hi>L'eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prit,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh, Wit,</hi> is a thing ſo generally known, that there are few but pretend to be acquainted with it, and not to want it, or not to have received as great a meaſure of it, as the very wittieſt ſort can pretend to; for nothing more true than this common Word, <hi>Qui velit ingenio cedere rarus erit.</hi> Yet even thoſe, on whom Nature has beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it moſt Liberally, are put to a ſtand, and know not what to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, if you preſs them to determine what in realty it is. But pretending
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93255:9"/>
ſometimes to know more than really they do, and being reſolved to ſay any thing rather than nothing, they will endeavour to put you off with great and empty Words, Splendid Deſcriptions, Tedious Tautologies, affected Metaphors, and whatever may ſeem a ſufficient Veil to their Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. What is it then we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call <hi>Wit</hi>? I confeſs, I never either read or heard any thing on this Subject, that looks like a ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory Reſolution of this Queſtion: And perhaps what I ſhall ſet down here, will prove far ſhort of the thing I aim at. For I am of Opinion, we do ſo little underſtand the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things, that we cannot confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently boaſt yet of any true Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Definition. Yea, I hold that this very Definition of Man, <hi>Homo eſt Animal rationale,</hi> ſo familiar in the Schools, is near as imperfect as this, <hi>Homo eſt Anima rationalis, Man is a rational Soul.</hi> My Reaſon for this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, is becauſe the latter Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93255:9"/>
preſents to my Underſtanding nothing but what is in ſome Sence true, though not all the Truth: For a man indeed is a rational Soul, tho' ſomething elſe. The former, beſides its obſcurity, gives me juſt grounds to ſuſpect its containing more than the Truth; I mean, that this ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Soul, which in the Second Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, I conceieve, in a manner free from matter, is really material, as depending on an Organical Body, as to its firſt being, conſervation, and functions. For if you take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder this Notion, and conſider it in every reſpect, you ſhall find that this reaſoning faculty, ſuppoſed to be in man, is never exerted without the concurrence of the matter, or of ſome material Phantaſm. The contrary whereof is a prerogative granted only to thoſe perfect Spirits, the antient Phyloſophers called <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> and by the <hi>Grecians Angels,</hi> who by the priviledge of their moſt refined Nature, are happily freed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93255:10"/>

I cannot then pretend to give you a true and genuine Notion of <hi>Wit,</hi> but an imperfect, and rude inchoate deſcription thereof, yet ſo general and comprehenſive, that it contains all ſuch Creatures, as without any violence done to the Word, we may truely call <hi>Witty.</hi> Yet ſhall I not ſay with a great Man of this Age, that <hi>Wit</hi> is, <hi>un je ne ſcay quoy, I know not what</hi>: For this would be to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, and an eaſie anſwer to all difficulties, and no ſolution to any. Neither ſhall I call it a certain Livelineſs, or Vivacity of the Mind inbred, or radicated in its Nature, which the <hi>Latines</hi> ſeem to inſinuate by the word <hi>Ingenium</hi>; nor the ſubtleſt operation of the Soul above the reach of meer matter, which perhaps is mean't by the <hi>French,</hi> who concieve <hi>Wit</hi> to be a Spiritual thing, or a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

L'<hi>eſprit.</hi> Nor with others, that 'tis a certain acuteneſs of Undeſtanding, ſome men poſſeſs in a higher degree, the Life of diſcourſe, as Salt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which nothing is reliſhed, a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Fire, a Spiritual Light, and what not. Such and the like Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons contain more of Pomp than of Truth, and are fitter to make us talkative on this Subject, than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten our Underſtandings. But what then is <hi>Wit? To hold you no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in ſuſpence,</hi> Wit <hi>is either a ſenceful diſcourſe, word, or Sentence, or a skilful Action.</hi> This Notion, though ſhort, being as you ſee, disjunctive, is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account the more compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive: Where ever then you ſhall meet with Sence in diſcourſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Dexterity and Skill in Actions, there, and no where elſe you ſhall meet with <hi>Wit.</hi> As this is ſo clear, that it needs no more proof than the Sun needs Light, ſo I leave it untouch't, and to your own Meditation, as a ſelf-evident Principle, I ſhall only
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93255:11"/>
ſay, that Sence is ſo neceſſary for meriting the Honourable Name of a <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> and a true <hi>Wit</hi>; that Men without this advantage are deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not only reputed not <hi>Witty,</hi> but meer Fools, and ſenſeleſs: Yet do I not mean that every kind of Sence in our diſcourſe, allowes our Diſcourſe to be ſtiled <hi>Witty</hi> elſe the number of <hi>Wits</hi> would be fargrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than we are commonly aware of: Yet certain it is, there are but few true <hi>Wits,</hi> in compariſon of thoſe that have Sence enough, not to be meer Fools. We ſpeak then here not of Senſe only, but of Sencefulneſs, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a dead, and down right flat Sence, for nothing more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, but rather of a Lively one, as being animated by a certain <hi>Tour</hi> not uſual to the duller ſort. This ſort of Sence is not unlike to a bright and poliſh'd Diamond, the other may be repreſented to us by a <hi>Brute,</hi> and unpoliſh'd one: They are both of the ſame Subſtance, not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93255:11"/>
of the ſame Value, both of the ſame <hi>matter,</hi> not of the ſame <hi>form,</hi> I mean of the ſame Light, Splendour and Brightneſs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As to the other part of this Deſcription, wherein I mention a dexterous or skilful Action as a piece of <hi>Wit,</hi> I confeſs ingeniouſly, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd by this Addition to declare, that I am not ſo great an Admirer of mankind, as to think that no other material Subſtance, but that which is congenial to my ſelf, may be, and deſervedly too, called <hi>Witty.</hi> Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers may pretend what they pleaſe, unleſs they prove themſelves <hi>Semideos,</hi> to be more than Men, they ſhall never convince me that they are otherwiſe differenced than in Speech and Figure, from thoſe living Creatures, we call commonly <hi>Beaſts</hi>; and which I have always conceived to be in reality, <hi>Animalia rationalia, rational Catures,</hi> but of a lower Rank, and leſs perfect than Men.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93255:12"/>
Neither ſhall any Man laugh me out of this Phyloſophy with their innate <hi>inſtinct,</hi> which in the judgement of common underſtanding, is their firſt inward Mover, and the ſole princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal of all their Actions. For unleſs you underſtand by this <hi>Inſtinct,</hi> God himſelf, which would be no leſs ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing, than <hi>Deus e Machina,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides no ſatisfactory anſwer, you will I hope confeſs 'tis nothing elſe but an obſcure and inſignificant Word, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented only to heighten that too vain conceit we have of our own nature, by depreſſing that of other inferiour Creatures. For Men conſidering the wonderful, and moſt skilful, and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable Actions of Apes, Elephants, Swallows, Bees, Dogs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were loath to allow them to be endowed with ſome kind of Reaſon, as if they ſhould thereby range themſelves among the Beaſts. Yet being forced to give ſome account of theſe undoubted peices of <hi>Wit</hi> we daily obſerve in that lower ſort of living Creatures, they call'd
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93255:12"/>
ſubtily their moſt ingenious Actions, the Products not of Reaſon, but of <hi>Inſtinct</hi>; whereby, if they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood nothing elſe, but an inferiour ſort of Reaſon, and in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars far below that of the more perfect and rational Creatures, they were only guilty of a wilful and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected obſcurity: But if they intended by this harſh Word an entire excluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all true reaſoning, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend more, than ever they did or could well prove, as I could eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, if it had not been done by others. They were in vain afraid alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that if they granted once the uſe of Reaſon to other Inferiour Creatures, they ſhould not be ſufficiently diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed themſelves, and far enough removed from their Condition, as if beſides Shape and Speech, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent degrees of Reaſon could not make a ſeparation wide enough between Men and <hi>Beaſts</hi>: For though 'tis moſt true, that, <hi>Simia quicquid agat, ſimia erit,</hi> a Beaſt at
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93255:13"/>
the beſt will always be but a <hi>Beaſt</hi>: Yet I never underſtood why we ſhould deny ſome ſhare both of Reaſon and <hi>Wit</hi> to ſeveral of thoſe inferiour Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that do things we can neither imitate, nor account for, without granting them, in ſome meaſure, this reaſoning faculty, we would feign Monopolize to our ſelves. I would not then ſtile him an Extravagant, who ſhould conceive as much Reaſon and <hi>Wit</hi> in an Ape, a Dog, Fox and Elephant, as in ſome Men, though not meer Fools. However no man can deny, what chiefly I here aim at, that <hi>Wit</hi> is not the Prerogative of Mankind alone. A Spiders Web in my conceit, is no leſs, if not more ingeniouſly contrived, than the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver's. I conceive in a Honey Comb, with Pleaſure and Admiration, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry acurate, and regular piece of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification; the wonderful Texture and groundleſs Foundation of a Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows Neſt, do repreſent to me more art, than ever I could be yet ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible

            </argument>
            <p n="1">1. WE are taught in the Schools, that all diverſity of Wit in Men, does originally ſpring from
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93255:14"/>
that of their Organs. I ſuck't in this Doctrine in my greener years, and beleived it a while, as many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of greater moment, which I have bid a farewel to ſince, in a riper Age: For being naturally curious, and not very credulous, I began to ſhake off by degrees, a certain implicate Faith, I had been for ſeveral years too much enſlaved to; having more than once in my ordinary ſolitude, and retired thoughts, <hi>Neque enim cum me aut porticus accepit, aut lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus deſum mihi,</hi> called my ſelf to an account upon what grounds I had ſo long ſtood up for ſuch a vulgar Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, I found them all to be movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, unſtable, and groundleſs; and firſt I thought I was neither confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to reaſon, nor common Sence, to think that a Soul free from mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Mortality, as I conceived mine to be, ſhould entirely depend upon a Body, both material and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, eſpecially as to its Chief, and moſt perfect Operarions, as undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93255:14"/>
thoſe of the <hi>Wit</hi> are. I had another more powerful Inducement not to ſhake hands with this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and bid it adieu, which was that I remembred to have been familiarly acquainted with ſeveral, both at home and abroad, who had no viſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the Organs of their Bodies, and yet were moſt deficient, as to the endowments of the Mind. And on the contrary, I have known not a few, who, if you regard only their out-ſide, may look upon Nature as a cruel Step-mother, as having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from her no ſenſible marks of a Motherly Benevolence; yet if ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them by another Byaſs, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their Abilities, you ſhall, I am perſwaded, inſtantly confeſs, that they are more obliged to Nature, or God rather, than moſt of thoſe who have received in a larger meaſure, thoſe exteriour Ornaments and Gifts of Beauty. For why may we not reckon the ſharpneſs of their <hi>Wit,</hi> and other advantages of their Souls to be more
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93255:15"/>
a ſufficient Compenſation for ſome outward Imperfections of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Thus it happens ſometimes, that Blind Men are clearer ſighted than many of thoſe who make uſe of both their Eyes. I had the luck to to be acquainted with one of this Number in <hi>Germany,</hi> whom I judged the moſt extemporary <hi>Wit</hi> I ever met with. I remember I was once curious to know what he thought of Black, Red, White, and other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, his anſwer was, he fram'd to himſelf the ſame <hi>idea</hi> of ſuch things that we frame to our ſelves of occult qualities.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thus all things impartially weighed on each ſide, I could not aſcribe thoſe differences and manifold degrees of <hi>Wit</hi> we obſerve among the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Men, to any other Cauſe with a greater appearance of Truth, than to the different perfections of their Souls: For meditating ſometimes upon the grounds of this common Word, <hi>quantum homo homini praeſtat,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:93255:15"/>
how much one man ſurpaſſeth another in Vivacity, ſharpneſs, penitrancy, and other intellectual Endowments. I was inclined to believe ſome things among thoſe <hi>Imperfect Spirits,</hi> for ſuch are the Souls of Men, as being each of them but a part of the whole Man, anſwerable to what Divinity will needs have us to admit, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe perfect Spirits, we call Angels. I was inclined I ſay, to think that there are different <hi>Species</hi> or <hi>Hierarchies</hi> of Souls, as well as of other created Spirits. For I conceive an Angel, and I believe the School Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines will not give me the lye, to be farther diſtant from the perfection of a Cherubim, or Seraphim, than a Lyon, or any other inferiour Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is from that of a Man. Now the reaſon of this great variety in that ſuperiour Spiritual Nature, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſheth the ſame, or not an unlike one in the Souls of Men. The Divines then ſay, that if God had created but one ſort of things, or one
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93255:16"/>
               <hi>ſingle Species,</hi> he had not given us ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Illuſtrious Marks of his Power, and Wiſdom; and conſequently had bin leſs glorifyed by us. Undoubtedly then a <hi>Specifical</hi> variety of Spirits, as they ſpeak in the Schools, muſt needs be a greater manifeſtation of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, than, to borrow this other Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtick Expreſſion, a meer numerical one. We may diſcourſe after the ſame manner of our Souls. For as the great diverſity of Bodies furniſheth us with a nobler <hi>Idea</hi> of Gods Power, than if he had created but one kind, or all of one Texture; ſo if I ſuppoſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent <hi>Species,</hi> and <hi>Hierarchies</hi> of Souls as of Angels, I frame, no doubt, a higher conceit of his perfections. Yet notwithſtanding all this, you ſhall not be allowed hence to infer, that there are different Species of Men: For this Denomination we take from what is moſt obvious to our Senſes, that is from the Bodies. In which we can obſerve no ſuch difference, as we may eaſily take notice of between a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93255:16"/>
Horſe and a Lion, a Lion, an Ape, and a Bird, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this Doctrine will raiſe in our minds a great Reſpect and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration for Men of greater Abilities than we know our ſelves to be of; for we ſhall conceive their Souls are in a higher order, as indeed they are, and conſequently pay to them a due and proportionable Homage, as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels do Honour and Eſteem Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angels, and Archangels likewiſe <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Thrones, &amp;c.</hi> But I muſt needs here, for your further ſatisfaction, anſwer ſome curious inquiries about this matter.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How comes it to paſs that a moſt perfect Soul is ſometimes lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a moſt defectuous Body? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, this happens againſt the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature: for Nature delights in proportion, and reaſon teacheth us, there ſhould be ſome proportion between the Beauty of the Soul, and that of the Body it lodgeth in, as the Statelieſt <hi>Pallaces</hi> are ordinarily the dwelling places of the greateſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93255:17"/>
Princes. 2. Are not the nobleſt Souls more ordinarily lodged in beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Bodies? I anſwer they are; for the reaſon above mentioned, and 'tis by accident, if perhaps the contrary happeneth. But theſe are the ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a meer <hi>Naturaliſt,</hi> or of one that favours too much Nature. I anſwer then in Second Inſtance, we muſt ſearch after the true cauſe of ſuch ſurprizing contingencies in the firſt cauſe of all things, I mean in God himſelf, who may do, and does ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, what, to our weak Judgements, Nature neither ſeems to deſire nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. 3. Doth it never happen that a Soul of the firſt or ſecond Order, that is a moſt perfect one, is ſo diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, during its ſtay in a corruptible Body, as never to diſcover its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral abilities? I anſwer 'tis not likely that ſuch a caſe ſhou'd ever happen, or if it does, this is as I was ſaying before, againſt the intention of Nature, tho' not of the Author of Nature, and a meer chance occaſion'd by ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93255:17"/>
defect of our Organs, which the Soul, how perfect ſoever, is not able to ſupply, becauſe it wants a fit and convenient matter to work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But hence ſome that take notice but of few things, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are eaſily miſtaken, may conclude the contrary of what I intend to aſſert, that the various degrees of <hi>Wit</hi> depend on the diverſity of our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans; which cannot be Lawfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from what I have ſaid, for as if we place the moſt imperfect Soul, that is one of the Loweſt Order, in the moſt compleat Body can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, it ſhall never for all this, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend its own dull nature, and by conſequence ſhall operate but very imperfectly, ſo if we conceive the Nobleſt Soul that ever God created in a Body moſt imperfect, that is, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of neceſſary Organs, or having but the Rudiments of true Organs, it ſhall never do what otherwiſe it had been able to perform, becauſe it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcover to us its abilities in this
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93255:18"/>
Life, but by theſe material inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor <hi>operate</hi> to any perfection they be wanting, or notably defective Which argued only Imperfection i<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:93255:18"/>3. Yet I acknowledge willingly there may be other Inferiour Cauſes, that contribute not a litle to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of <hi>Wit</hi>: For how perfect ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we conceive the Soul to be, ſhe requires ſtill the help both of Vital and Animal Spirits. And if theſe be but too few, or not lively enough, you ſhall find her ſlow, dull and heavy. 'Tis not then an unwholſome Advice to all ſuch as are ſenſible they have received from above, <hi>Animam bonam,</hi> a not very imperfect Soul; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve with all poſſible care the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Inſtruments of her moſt Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Operations; I mean not to conſume by exceſſive Venery, exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Drink, or any other kind of Surfeit thoſe Spirits, without which their Souls, though never ſo perfect, will act but very imperfectly, and far below that degree of perfection God hath allowed them. Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, a ſober Dyet, or temperate Life is the beſt Preſerver both of <hi>Wit</hi> and Health; for nothing more true
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93255:19"/>
than this common Word <hi>Vinum mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate ſumptum acuit ingenium,</hi> Wine doth not only ſtrengthen the Stomack but likewiſe quickens the Spirits, if moderately made uſe of; as on the contrary it weakens the Stomack, and darkens the Underſtanding, if taken exceſſively, or beyond a proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable meaſure.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There is as yet another greater Promoter of <hi>Wit,</hi> we muſt not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, which is to converſe often, and keep Company with thoſe that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Ingenious and <hi>Witty</hi>: For though your Soul, perhaps, be of the higheſt <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> yet it moves not it ſelf eaſily, unleſs it be firſt moved; it muſt then be rouz'd up, and awakened by the Company of thoſe who can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly improve thoſe real Talents God has vouchſafed to beſtow upon it: For as we may boldly judge of a Mans Temper, or good Humour, of his good or bad Morals, if once we are informed what Company he moſt frequents; ſo likewiſe we may
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93255:19"/>
gueſs at his intellectuals by the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and Abilities of ſuch as he is moſt converſant with. For expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience has taught us more than once, that ingenious Men become at length dull and heavy, by frequenting too much the duller ſort; whereof I think this account may be given with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome ſhew of probability. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Men have need of ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable encouragement to diſplay thoſe Talents they have received from above. Now neither eſteeming nor valuing much the Eſteem of mean Capacities, they fall in a manner, in a certain Lethargy, and are not able to rouze up their Spirits for want of ſufficient inducements. And this often happening, begets in them a habit, they cannot eaſily be afterwards rid of.</p>
            <p n="5">5. On the contrary, nothing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves us more than a frequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with the wittieſt ſort, as daily Experience ſheweth; and the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the Ancient Phyloſophers,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93255:20"/>
who travelled all the World over, to ſee and hear the Learnedſt Men of their times; which example is followed in this very age we live in by moſt Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> eſpecially, and the <hi>Germans,</hi> and by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of late, who, for the moſt part, become not only ſmoother, and more polite by their travelling into Forreign Countries, but ſharper too, and <hi>Wittier</hi>; as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one may eaſily obſerve, who will be at the pains to compare a meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly home-bread Gentleman, with one that has either lived abroad, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd much with Strangers, eſpecially the ingenious ſort at home: I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the former as a meer Clown, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of that Delicacy of <hi>Wit,</hi> and diſcerning Faculty, you ſhall find upon occaſion in the latter. But all this is to be underſtood <hi>cum grano ſalis,</hi> in this ſuppoſition that you have not a Soul of the loweſt Rank, but one that may hold in the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> or imperfect <hi>Spirits,</hi> a place at leaſt of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93255:20"/>
an Archangel, I mean, that is not in the very loweſt Order of Souls: for let a Man travel never ſo far, and converſe never ſo much, he ſhall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt in vain the attainment of that <hi>Wit,</hi> which by reaſon of the innate Imperfection of his Underſtanding, he is not capable of. If then a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther minds to ſend his Son abroad, in Order to improve his Underſtanding, let him conſult firſt with himſelf, and others, if he be capable of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable improvement; for the firſt and chief Source in us of <hi>Wit</hi> is the Soul it ſelf, which, all our indeavours ſhall not be able to quicken, if it be heavy and dull by Nature. For as ſome rough Stones may be ſmoothed into a bright Diamond, becauſe they contain already what ever is moſt valuable in a Diamond; ſo ſome others, for a contrary Reaſon, can never be changed into ſo Noble Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Even ſo, if our Souls be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally capable of a further improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they may be ſo far improved,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93255:21"/>
as to attain to no ordinary Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; but we loſe our Time, if we pretend to equalize them at length to thoſe of a higher Order, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to them in Nature. For I take the ſupernatural Order, and the Natural to be proportionably an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to one another. As then there is a certain finite number of Bleſſings, wherewith we may, if we pleaſe, work our Salvation, which being once granted, and infus'd, we can obtain no more; ſo likewiſe there is a certain pitch and meaſure of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Ability, beyond which, with all our poſſible endeavours, we can never reach. If then your Soul be of the Loweſt <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> you can no more pretend to the Excellency of a Higher one, than an <hi>Angel</hi> to be an <hi>Archangel,</hi> or an <hi>Archangel</hi> to be a <hi>Power, &amp;c.</hi>

I Never wondred much at the great variety of Phyſiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomies and Humane Bodies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am fully perſwaded that a perfect reſemblance in every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, is either impoſſible, or can be at the moſt, but a work of meer chance, by a fortuitous Coha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of the compounding corpuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles into the ſame Texture. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving no ſuch Compoſition or Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93255:22"/>
in our Spiritual Souls, I ever look't upon them as more deſerving pieces of Wonder. I was always then extreamly ſurprized, and I am yet, that among ſo many Millions of Rational Souls, God hath created ſince the firſt Birth of the World; there are ſo few, if any at all, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling exactly one another: For tho' they fall not under the reach of our Eyes, yet we cannot but know infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly their real diſcrepancies, by the diverſity we obſerve in their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive productions, which, as I was lately ſaying, ſpring originally from the Soul, though ſometimes it may ſuffer an occaſional ſtop, or chance, by the Temper of the Body. But to be more plain, what I ſay deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ever my higheſt admiration, was this, that let mens Bodies reſemble never ſo much one another, their Souls ſhall never be near of the ſame temper; by which I mean not only the ſame humour, but likewiſe the ſame degree of Perfection or <hi>Wit.</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:93255:22"/>
Whereof for Methods ſake we may conſider two ſorts: The Firſt I call <hi>Habitual,</hi> the Second <hi>Accidental.</hi> An habitual Wit is proper only to all ſuch and only to ſuch as are habitually inclin'd, and diſpoſed to think and ſpeak ſenſefully, and to the Purpoſe on all occaſions. And this is the true Character of thoſe that are deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called <hi>Witty.</hi> Such obſerve natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally St. <hi>Bernard</hi>'s Judicious Precept, <hi>Verbum bis Veniat ad Limam quam ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel ad Linguam,</hi> they think twice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſpeak once, leaſt their words ſhould forerun their thoughts. They are wiſe, diſcreet, humble, peaceable, and the fitteſt of all Men for the Managment of great Affairs. The accidental <hi>Wit</hi> is the Product in a manner of a meer chance, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, ſuch as that of moſt, at leaſt of many Women, the moſt talkative, but neither the moſt judicious, nor the moſt thinking part of Mankind. They ſay ſometimes, things that look like <hi>Wit,</hi> but <hi>impetu naturae non judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cii,</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:93255:23"/>
meerly by a ſuddain vehemency of their Nature, or rather a certain volubility of their Tongues, not by Judgement, or a ſerious reflection, what proportion their diſcourſe may have with the Subject in queſtion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, they ſeldom take notice of the Dictates of their diſcerning Faculty, but follow the ſudden motions of a mutable and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Imagination or Fancy. <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>his is only to be underſtood of that ſort of Women, who are to be accounted Witleſs rather, than Witty: For this accidental Wit we are now ſpeaking of, holds ſo much of Chance, that meer Fools may now and then ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble upon it. And I am really of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as, <hi>Nemo omnibus horis ſapit,</hi> No Man hath always his Wits about him, ſo likewiſe, <hi>Nemo omnibus horis deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,</hi> no mans Brains are ſo darkn'd, but that he may have on certain occaſions ſome <hi>Lucid</hi> Intervals. We muſt not then judge a Man Witty, as ſome ſhort ſighted People do, becauſe of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93255:23"/>
his uttering a Witty word, or two, by chance rather than by judgement. 'Tis not one or two Converſations, nor broken pieces of Diſcourſe, that we are to take our meaſures by for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions of this nature; but after, at leaſt ſome days familiar converſe with thoſe, whoſe Reach and Capacity we are curious to know, we may become capable of making ſuch diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a ſecond diſtinction of <hi>Wits</hi> worthy our Conſideration. Some we may call <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Wits,</hi> other <hi>Singular</hi> ones; which Word I take not in the moſt obvious Senſe, as it imports ſome peculiar pre-eminency, but as it may be determined to imply a limitation of Capacity to ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Subject. For 'tis moſt certain that, <hi>Non omnia poſſumus omnes,</hi> as there are many things we cannot overcome with the ſtrength of our Bodies, ſo there are far more beyond the greateſt Abilities, and longeſt reach of our Souls. Thus a Man may
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93255:24"/>
prove an able Mathematician, who ſhall be but an ordinary Divine, and on the contrary you ſhall meet with moſt ſubtle School Divines, that are ſimple and dull in all other reſpects. Thus likewiſe you may meet with ſome Phyſitians that can diſcourſe pertinently enough of all Tempers and Diſtempers, yea, and preſcribe in general twenty different Remedies for the ſame Diſeaſe, yet want a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain practical Judgement, ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for a due application, that they kill unhappily more than they cure. I have been familiarly acquainted with ſome excellent Gameſters at the Cheſs, which is thought to require a great deal of Wit, whom certainly I knew to be of little or no Underſtanding in all other things. Whereof we can give no rational account, unleſs we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, what I hold to be moſt true, that there are ſome Characters of Wit inconſiſtent one with another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they depend upon different principles; ſome ſpringing from the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93255:24"/>
Intellect, and ſome from the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, faculties ſo oppoſite one to another, that we can hardly ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel in them both, becauſe the latter relies much upon meer proportion, combination, ſhape, and ſitutation, and the former from all ſuch <hi>Materialities.</hi> Hence if a man is a moſt skilful Gameſter at the Cheſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but cannot penetrate the ſubtile School Difficulties, 'tis an eviden<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> mark that his Imaginative facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath the advantage above the Intellective. And again, if an able Divine find himſelf unfit for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks, Cheſs, or any other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical exerciſe depending much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſhape of things proportion, figure, and ſituation, he may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly thence conclude, that Nature hath beſtowed upon him a penetran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of underſtanding, but no conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable quickneſs of Imagination. As to thoſe Wits I have called <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal,</hi> I know not, if in the rigour of the Word it may be allowable,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93255:25"/>
that there are any ſuch in the World. But taking the thing in a leſs rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſenſe, we may ſay, That ſuch as have a general Wit fit for all Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, Arts, Employs, or at leaſt can diſcourſe ingeniouſly, and to the purpoſe, with a certain air of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of any Subject whatſoever, are to be accounted <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Wits.</hi> For this Character implies at leaſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a not ordinary quickneſs of Imagination, ſome general Notions and Ideas of moſt honourable things.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But here is a third diſtinction, or rather a third ſort of <hi>Wits</hi>: For ſome are <hi>ſlow,</hi> and others <hi>extemporary.</hi> The latter are Men of a ſuddain and extemporary ſharpneſs, and much eſteemed by the leſſer diſcerning ſort, becauſe having always an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer at hand to any Queſtion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you may propoſe to them, they are never ſurprized. Such ſort of Men diſcover all their abilities in the firſt converſe you have with 'em,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93255:25"/>
becauſe they are not capable to ſpeak to the purpoſe after premeditation; a witty Word muſt needs iſſue out of their Mouths on a ſuddain, as a Lightning out of a dark Cloud. The <hi>Slower</hi> Wits, as not being quick in their replies, are often laugh't at by the leſs underſtanding ſort. They conceive eaſily enough, but miſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting prudently their own Abilities, venture not to utter their Thoughts, till they underſtand the matter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, and to the bottom. You may compare them unfitly to the Water, that admits eaſily of any ſort of Figure, or Character you pleaſe to frame upon it with your Finger, but ſhall in a moment loſe it again. They reſemble Gold rather, or any other Metal hard to be wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but withall being tenacious, and a faithful Preſerver of whatever you Carve upon it. So they hardly ever let go the Images of things once conceived. They were undoubtedly meant by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> when
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93255:26"/>
he ſaid that the Melancholy are inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and Witty, <hi>Ingenioſi Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lici,</hi> which is not to be underſtood of a certain black and terreſtrial Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, for this is dulneſs it ſelf, but of that ſort which is animated by brisk, lively and vigorous Spirits, and purified by a clear Flame.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I doubt it may not be allowed here to make a fourth diſtinction of <hi>Profound,</hi> and <hi>Superficial</hi> Wits: For ſome have received from above a kind of comprehenſive Knowledge of moſt things. They ſee in a manner as Angels do the remoteſt concluſions in their firſt principles, without any <hi>formal</hi> conſequence. Such Men are not only fit for Humane Society, but to ſit at the Helm, and manage the weightieſt Affairs of Great Kingdoms and Empires. They are not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times much admired by the undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſort, eſpecially in a free and familiar Converſe, becauſe they ſpeak little, being naturally more thinking and contriving, than talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93255:26"/>
but what they ſay carries along with it ſuch a Character of good Sence, that you ſhall inſtantly diſcern them to be none of the common ſort. Yet as there is nothing in the World <hi>Omni ex parte beatum,</hi> without a mixture of ſome imperfection; theſe Great Men are ſo taken up ſometimes with their own Thoughts, and Deſigns, that in a familiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe they ſeem not to talk to the purpoſe; which gives occaſion to the Vulgar, to think that they are really ſimple. Now theſe Wits we call <hi>Superficial,</hi> are not indeed wholly dull, but in the next degree to the dulleſt ſort. You ſhall not be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of their Weakneſs at their firſt Complement, their firſt utterance being commonly ſenſeful enough, Which I have likewiſe obſerved in ſome Fools. But you ſhall eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the heightneſs of their Brains in a continued diſcourſe; let them but go on, for ſpeak they muſt, and will ſhew in a trice their foppiſh and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93255:27"/>
ſimple Temper, becauſe they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend commonly to know every thing, though they have but few clear Notions of any thing. They value themſelves highly upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a not ordinary Volubility of their Tongues, as being talkative be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond meaſure, like moſt Women, which the leſs knowing part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, take to be a piece of <hi>Wit.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. I Mean not by a <hi>Pretender</hi> to Wit a meer Fool, but rather one that hath ſome ſhare in this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Endowment of the Mind. Far leſs do I underſtand any of thoſe Learned Societies, that make a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar profeſſion of promoting <hi>real</hi> Knowledge: For we muſt needs confeſs ſeveral of their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers not to be meer Pretenders to Learning, but eminent Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſo's,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93255:28"/>
and great <hi>Wits.</hi> I mean then by this ſomewhat ambiguous Word, all ſuch as fooliſhly pretend to more Wit than God and Nature have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally allowed them. I conceive them to be near a kin to thoſe ſuperficial Wits, we were lately diſcourſing of, and not very unlike the <hi>Nominal</hi> Philoſophers; becauſe their deepeſt Knowledge reacheth no farther than to the Etimologies, Derivation, and Nature of Names; upon which account they prefer themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men of more ſuppoſed Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. They are not clear enough ſighted to diſcern what is true Sence, or down right Nonſenſe in a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: They are only capable to judge of a polite Expreſſion, of a Word <hi>A-la-mode,</hi> and other ſuch like Childiſh niceties. They have, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, ſome confuſed Notions of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, which emboldens them to debate things that are beyond the reaeh of their Capacity. They are the profeſſed Cenſurers of Mankind,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93255:28"/>
and can ſpeak good of none, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves only excepted: I conceive them to be ever without Reſt and Repoſe, yea, and the moſt miſerable of all Men, becauſe moſt obnoxious, not to be envyed, but to envy others. They are highly offended if you happen to commend any other in their Preſence but themſelves, or any other Mans Works but their own; if perhaps they have appeared in Publick, wrap't up in a Pamphlet or two. For they make it their whole buſineſs to cut deep in the Reputation of thoſe who ſhould, methinks, be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the aſpiring, and reach of their Envy. <hi>This Man, ſay they, in a familiar Converſe, hath printed ſuch a Book, as you know but containing little Truth in it, they could eaſily refute the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Doctrine it offers, if they judged the matter worthy their while; he hath miſtaken himſelf in ſeveral material points, and ſpeaks here with little coherency, and there flat untruth,</hi> though perhaps they have not ſo
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93255:29"/>
much as ſeen the Title Page of the Book they talk thus at random of; you ſhall name no Philoſophy, no Poem, no ingenious Piece, that ſuch men have not peruſed more than once, but you'll do them a piece of ſervice not to queſtion them too much upon any particulars, leaſt you diſcover their Vanity and Weakneſs. They are more guilty than the reſt of Mankind of that general hatred, that thoſe of one Profeſſion conceive ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily one againſt another: For the common Word is but too true, <hi>Figulus figulum odit.</hi> They leave no Stone unmov'd to ruine the Repute of ſuch as concur, or ſhare with them in any profitable Employ. I know no People in the World that have leſs Reſpect for, and leſs Knowledge of Antiquity. I have heard ſome of thoſe Irregular Heads call <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> whom probably they had never read, a meer Fool, only becauſe they had declared themſelves <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſians.</hi> I have always obſerved
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93255:29"/>
this ſort of Men to affect extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly novelties, but above all new terms and new coin'd Words. <hi>Italian</hi> Proverbs, Epigrams, <hi>Deviſes,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated and ſhort Sentences, and ſometimes the ſharpeſt both <hi>Hebrew, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Words. 'Tis pleaſant to hear ſome Phyſitians, eſpecially the greener ones, talking perpetually of <hi>Acids</hi> and <hi>Alcaliis.</hi> I diſpute not here the Truth of the thing in itſelf, whether it may be allowed that an <hi>acid,</hi> as ſome do think, is the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſe of all Diſtempers. But the affections only in ſpeaking of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I juſtly blame, and look upon it as a mark of little Judgement, and <hi>Wit.</hi> Who would not laugh to hear a Phyſitian reſolve all his Patients doubts with an <hi>Acid</hi> and an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But nothing ſhall divert you more, than the familiar uſe of ſome conceited Chymiſts, eſpecially if diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblingly admiring them. They
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93255:30"/>
will diſplay in a quarter of an hour ſeveral great and rare <hi>Arcana's,</hi> or Secrets, yet without diſcovering any of them, but only that being taken with the Bait, you may, buy at a high rate, what once known you ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value or value but very little. There is no Diſtemper, but ſuch Phyſitians will undertake to cure. They ſpeak great things, and promiſe Wonders, as pretending to do more with a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of drops of ſome Eſſence, Oyle, Tincture or Spirit, than the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> with a Troop of <hi>Simples,</hi> and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite variety of loathſome Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. They pretend to the great <hi>Art</hi> of making Gold, and of converting imperfect Metals into perfect. If you underſtand not their Myſteries, you muſt ſubmit your Judgement, becauſe you are not perhaps a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Art, who only is able to comprehend the Frame, and Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Philoſophers Stone, of the <hi>Alkaheſt, extraverſion,</hi> of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, &amp;c.</hi> I have a great reſpect for
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93255:30"/>
               <hi>Helmont,</hi> that celebrated Chymiſt, but more upon the Authority of an Eminent Virtuoſo of this Nation who eſteems him, then by a free de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of my own Judgement. For I muſt beg his pardon, if I ſay, I conceive, him to ſpeak ſometimes like a mad Man, or as if he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, not what he meant: Becauſe as all Men deſire naturally to know, <hi>Omnis homo naturaliter ſcire deſiderat</hi>: ſo all Men have a deſire no leſs natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and vehement to be known, <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis homo naturaliter ſciri deſiderat</hi>; If then we have any important Secret to communicate to the World, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery whereof may redound to our Honour, and the good of Mankind, I am fully perſwaded that no man is ſo indifferent for the increaſe of his own Repute, as to publiſh it immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and obſcurely, or in ſuch terms, as few or none can comprehend. Thus when <hi>Helmont,</hi> and other ſelf-conceited Chymiſts ſpeak ſo boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingly and boiſterouſly of the great
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93255:31"/>
Wonders they can do, without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering their Methods, ſo that they may be underſtood, I am apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they have but very confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Idea's,</hi> and obſcure Notions of thoſe great <hi>Arcana's</hi> they talk ſo much of.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You ſhall meet with ſome other Virtuoſo's that pretend not to thoſe high Strains of <hi>Wit,</hi> but to a certain politeneſs in their diſcourſe, and Writings; if they meddle ſometimes with the Pen. Their chief care is not how to ſpeak ſencefully, but how to ſpeak politely, wherein they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the weakneſs of their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the ſhallowneſs of their <hi>Wit</hi>: For men of great Parts are wont to expreſs themſelves ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantly, but without any apparent affection of too much <hi>Polity.</hi> This is the common defect of ſome young Gentlemen that live upon their Rents in, and about <hi>London.</hi> They think themſelves ſufficiently improved by frequenting the Play-Houſe, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:93255:31"/>

I confeſs, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, they may get ſome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by ſuch Lectures, provided they take not ſo much notice of the Words, and manner of expreſſion, as of the deſign and management of the intrigue, wherein the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt <hi>Wit</hi> of the piece conſiſts.</p>
            <p>Others again make it a part of their buſineſs to ſtudy the faſhionable Art of Complementing: as being ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded, they can give no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proof of their Sufficiency, than by ſtudyed Complements, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a piece of <hi>French Wit</hi>: For 'tis almoſt become Proverbial among the Vulgar <hi>French, c'eſi un hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me d'eſprit il fait bien un Complement.</hi> Such a one is a <hi>Witty</hi> Gentleman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he complementeth well. If the <hi>French</hi> had no other thing to be proud of but this Complemental mode, the greateſt Favour I could
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93255:32"/>
do them, would be to reckon them among the Superficial <hi>Wits,</hi> I have ſpoken of elſewhere; and I fear all things impartially weighed, they can be hardly allowed any higher Rank. I know they pretend to a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy of <hi>Wit,</hi> which they monopolize to themſelves, as if other Nations could not reach it, and which they ſay is no otherwiſe accountable for, then that it is, as one of their <hi>beaux eſprits</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>un je ne ſcay quoy,</hi> I know not what. But having lived near Twenty Years among the Learnedſt ſort of them, I think I may venture to give a clear and diſtinct notion of What they call delicacy of <hi>Wit,</hi> that thereby it may appear to be no prerogative of the <hi>French,</hi> but common enough to all civilized Nations.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I have obſerved then that what they call <hi>vn eſprit delicat,</hi> is chiefly known by a ſmooth, eaſie and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural expreſſion, an acurate and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious compariſon, or a ſenſeful
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93255:32"/>
Word that may be eaſily miſtaken by a common underſtanding, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a ſenſe it was not intended for. That this is a near deſcription of a <hi>Delicate Wit</hi>: I could eaſily if it were neceſſary, prove by thoſe very Authors, they allow moſt of this Character too. I can imagine no other reaſon why the <hi>French</hi> miſtake themſelves ſo far, as to think that other Nations have little or nothing of this forementioned <hi>Delicacy,</hi> then becauſe they write Romances, and Love Intrigues, which admit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire this ſmooth way of writing, more than any of their Neighbours, who generally choſing more ſolid Subjects, have not ſo often occaſion to give Proofs of their being capable to write <hi>delicately.</hi> For it would be eaſie to ſhow this Character in the Authors of all Nations, who have chanc'd to handle Subjects that requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall add in the laſt Inſtance, that thoſe whom we call here <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:93255:33"/>
to <hi>Wit,</hi> are commonly bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Spokes-men, than Writers or Pen-men. They ſurprize thoſe that have never before convers't with them, with an extempory Eloquence, and an eaſie Utterance of their Thoughts upon any obvious Subject, by an extraordinary Volubility of their Tongues, beſides a vehement incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to be hearkned to in a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Converſation, as if they were Oracles; hence it is that they think their repute leſſened, if any other in the Company talk more, with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Authority, or longer than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But it often happens that thoſe ſame Men, who ſeem to the the Vulgar ſort, ſo eloquent in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary debate, are at a loſs in cold Bloud, and when on occaſion, they muſt recollect themſelves to write their own Thoughts. Whereof take this ſhort and rational account: Such men being endow'd with a quick Imagination, which being ſtirred up in a Debate, furniſheth them with
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93255:33"/>
Words enough, and with certain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary Arguments, fitter to dazle the Vulgar ſort, than to perſwade a Solid Wit. On the other ſide, their Intellective Faculty being but weak, and now left to it ſelf, without the help of an unwakened Fancy, gives no more Light.</p>

I cannot but pity and laugh at the ſimplicity of the <hi>Italians, French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who think themſelves wittier than the Northern Nations, only becauſe they live in hotter Climats, for at this rate they muſt acknowledge the <hi>Moors, Negroes</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond themſelves in <hi>Wit,</hi> which they will not, I doubt, readily grant. It was in my Judgement no piece of <hi>Wit</hi> in the famous <hi>Du Peron</hi> to ſay of the Jeſuite <hi>Iretſter, that he was ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for a German.</hi> The occaſion of this vulgar Error among Forreigners may be thus rationally accounted for. In the hotter Climats, becauſe the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93255:35"/>
Bodies are weaker, the InhabItants eſpecially, if civiliz'd, are more given to the exerciſing of the Mind, than of the Body. But the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Nations take generally more delight in the exerciſe of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, than in that of the Mind, as being more allured thereunto by their Natural Courage, good Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and not ordinary Strength. I ſee not then what other Influence the coldneſs of the Air can have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, than to incline us more to the Improvement of the Natural En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments of our Bodies, than to the promoting thoſe of our Souls. But in the main here lies the miſtake of thoſe ſelf-conceited Forreigners, that ſeeing perhaps a greater number of <hi>Virtuoſo's</hi> among them, than among us, they conclude very illegally to our diſparagement, and to their own advantage, that they have more Wit than we, whereas they can be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to raiſe from hence, no other ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Inference, but perhaps this,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93255:35"/>
that they have more <hi>Wits,</hi> or rather more Writers; for among twenty <hi>French, Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Italian,</hi> that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie the Preſs, you ſhall hardly meet with two, or three that deſerve to be ſtiled <hi>Witty.</hi> The Inhabitants then of the Northern parts of the World, delighting generally more in Wars, or in Warlike Exploits, than in Writing. No wonder if they trouble not the Preſs with ſuch a number of uſeleſs Books as the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Climats do: which argues a meer want of Inclination to buſie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that way, but not in any innate diſpoſition to write well. For we cannot but know by daily Experience that no People in the World write more wittily than the the Natives of cold Climats, if once they betake themſelves to the <hi>Muſes,</hi> which minds me of a Saying of the famous <hi>Barklay,</hi> a moſt ingenuous Writer, who ſpeaks with a generous freedom, the known Ill and Good of all Nations, not ſparing the <hi>Scots,</hi> his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

As to the other Members of this Royal Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I think I do them no wrong, if I ſay that the famous <hi>Boyle</hi> is the Chief Pillar thereof: For his Name carries with it ſuch a weight of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in Forraign Countries, that I have heard ſome Eminent Men ſay, that whatever he poſitively affirms in his Books is ſure and evident. Out of all this diſcourſe, we may raiſe to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this ſelf-evident Inference, that <hi>Coelum atticum</hi> is no more an infallible Cauſe or Sign of <hi>Wit</hi> than <hi>Caelum Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum,</hi>

            <p n="3">3. Yea I think it no Paradox to ſay that the cold Climats are the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Soils for the producing of great <hi>Wits.</hi> I conceive but two things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the exiſtency of what ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally we underſtand by a great <hi>Wit,</hi> firſt, a Soul of the firſt, or at leaſt none of the loweſt <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> I mean one of a not ordinary perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, whereof I have diſcours'd at large in the Second Section.

As to the former point, I hope you will grant that 'tis in the Power of the Almighty to create moſt perfect Souls in cold Climats as well as in hot. Hence then you can pretend no advantage. And for the latter 'tis evident, that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93255:39"/>
that the Bodies in cold Climats are better tempered, of a firmer Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and fuller of brisk and lively Spirits, than thoſe of hotter Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where men are commonly lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, faint and exhauſted by a ſenſible diſſipation of thoſe few Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits they live and move by. They are then little acquainted with the World, who affirm the pureſt Air to be the only Element for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tileſt <hi>Wits</hi>; ſince we know by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and 'tis generally confeſſed by all Forraigners, that the <hi>Scotch</hi> and the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who breath in no very thin Air, are far ſubtiler diſputants in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, Logick, and ſuch like Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtick, and Airy matters, than either the <hi>Italians</hi> or the <hi>French.</hi> I would then have Men to ceaſe from gazing upon the Stars, and not look upon the Celeſtial Influences, as the only cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of thoſe various Characters of <hi>Wit,</hi> we obſerve in the World; for there may be ſome more hidden Sources of acuteneſs, and leſs refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

on: Such I take to be the inviſible <hi>Effluviums</hi> of the Earth: For as the Famous <hi>Boyle</hi> acutely proves, 'tis moſt probable that they are the unheaded Cauſes of many Epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Diſtempers, ſo I think it no leſs conformable to reaſon, to ſay that they occaſion likewiſe the good tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the mind, by contributing not a little towards the Health of the Body; for ſince 'tis moſt certain by daily experience, that the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of this Northern part of the World, to whatever they apply themſelves entirely, become at length moſt eminent therein, and do far exceed the reſt of Mankind, eſpceial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Learning, Courage, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Warlike Exploits, we muſt needs confeſs there may be Corpuſcles iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out from the coldeſt Soil, that mixing themſelves thorow the Pores of the Body with the bloud, give it ſuch a Texture, as is requiſite to make it a fit Inſtrument for the moſt <hi>Spiritual</hi> Functions of the Souls.

am ſo far from beleiving the vulgar Error, or rather the vain conceit of ſome ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> that thoſe who are born in, or near the cold <hi>Zones,</hi> have few or none of thoſe natural Gifts that make a true <hi>Virtuoſo</hi>; I am ſo far, I ſay, from beleiving ſuch a groſs and vulgar Error, that I hold ſuch to be the fitteſt men in the World for penetrating Airy, and Subtile things, and for doing great ones, if they will be but at the pains, when occaſion ſerves to improve their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Talents.

the Soul or in the Spirits, that could not thruſt forward their Work. But I know no greater diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, or more ominous of this part we are ſpeaking of, than its nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs, or ſtraitneſs, whether we take the narrowneſs thereof from the Root of the Noſe upwards, or from the Right Temple to the Left; for this is but a too viſible mark of a very imperfect Soul, and of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary want of Spirits: And thoſe few that ſuch puny Heads do lodge, are withal Dormant in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and cannot for want of Room either dilate themſelves, or give any Light. This you ſhall believe the more probable, if you take par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular notice of thoſe that are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally Fools, and ſilly. For you ſhall ſcarce meet with one of them that wants this mark of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity. What I have ſaid of the Forehead, may be likewiſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the whole Head: The Bulk whereof, generally ſpeaking, if pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93255:44"/>
to the Body is no ill mark, and I take the contrary to be a vulgar Error, confuted by daily Experience, and the aforeſaid rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. And if one contrary may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover another, I remember to have ſeen at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> in the Houſe near the Temple, wherein the natural Fools are kept, to the number of three or four, whoſe Heads did not ſurpaſs in Bulk an ordinary mans Fiſt. Now if Nature hath ſo propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably enlarged a Mans Head, as if it had intended to make two of of one, by giving him a Forehead qualified in the aforeſaid manner, and likewiſe a high and bulky hinder part, you ſhall hardly fail, if you ſay, that ſuch a one is not of an ordinary <hi>Wit</hi> and Capacity. But that you miſtake nothing here, I take the hinder part of the Head to be high or bulky, when it it is not cut in a manner even down, but over-reacheth the hollow of the Neck. For the <hi>Perpendicular</hi> deſcent of the Head, ſo that the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93255:44"/>
hinder part and the Neck be upon the ſame <hi>Perpendicular</hi> Line, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led 'pleaſantly' by the <hi>French, Le coup de hach,</hi> the Axe-ſtrock, and is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally thought a ſcarce ever failing ſign of a mean <hi>Wit:</hi> Becauſe I fancy the hinder part of the Head is the Magazine of the Soul, where the <hi>Species</hi> and Images of things are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. This may be the reaſon why being deſirous to recover the memory of a forgotten thing, we turn naturally our hand back thither, as if we intended to awaken our <hi>Memorative</hi> Spirits. For I doubt not but the Memory is a great help, and Promoter too of Sharpneſs, Judgement and Knowledge, becauſe it repreſents faithfully to us all ſuch Circumſtances as are neceſſary for the right framing of our Reflections. It then Nature hath deprived us of this back Room, we may neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs have, perhaps, ſome no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Talents, but none in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high degree.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:93255:45"/>3. As for the Hair, four things may be conſidered concerning them. 1. Their lying flat on the Head. 2<hi>ly.</hi> Their curling. 3<hi>ly.</hi> Their quantity. 4<hi>ly.</hi> their Colour. The Firſt ſignifies Dulneſs, if they be not ſomewhat curled at the ends, becauſe this ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a want of Heat. The Second ſome greater ſharpneſs, becauſe it ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſome more heat. The Third, if very conſiderable, and accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thickneſs, is a ſign of too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Excrementitious Parts, and of a too material Subſtance of the Brains. Of the <hi>Fourth</hi> for Methods ſake, I ſhall diſtinguiſh but three ſorts, the black and the fair Colour, as two extreams, the Cheſnut Colour, as a middle between them both. The Fair is a ſurer mark of Wit, Judgement, and good Sence, than the Black, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis originally occaſioned by the movement of brisker, clearer, and more lively Spirits. Whereas the Black, I mean the deepeſt ſort, may ſometimes import a Melancholy, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93255:45"/>
and dull Temper, as being of an exceeding Compact and cloſe Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet 'tis often produced by the motion of more active Spirits, but which are tempered with Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtial ones. And when this happens 'tis no ill <hi>Omen</hi>: But the Cheaſenut Colour is to be preferr'd before the other two, as proceeding not from the Action of meer Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial, or of meer airy <hi>Corpuſcles</hi> but from a juſt mixture of both.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I had almoſt forgot the Ears, whereof the Bulk only is conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in relation to Phyſiognomy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if they be reſpectively too great, or not proportionable to the Head, they are reckoned common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be a ſign of dulneſs. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Vulgar is, becauſe ſuch People reſemble <hi>long Ear'd Aſſes.</hi> But 'tis more rational to ſay, that this is occaſioned by the weakneſs of an Imperfect Soul, who made one part proportionably larger than the other. Becauſe though it aimed indeed,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93255:46"/>
as all things do by the impulſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, at the moſt perfect, yet it could not reach it, as being none of the Higheſt, or of the firſt <hi>Hierarchy</hi> of Souls. But to turn about now from the Ears to the Eyes; they are not only windows through which the Soul looketh out to us, but through which likewiſe we look into it, and by their Light diſcover eaſily its real perfections, and abilities. I know but three things in them worthy a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiognomiſt's Obſervation, their Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, their Situation, their Colour. The black eye repreſents to us a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Soul, but none of the ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, becauſe of the too compact Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Inſtruments it makes uſe of, I mean of the Spirits. The blew grayiſh is more common, and if ſome other Conditions be not wanting, may be a good proof of acuteneſs and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, becauſe of a proportionable mixture of maſſie and airy Corpuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, ſubſervient to the Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Mind. The largeneſs is an
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93255:46"/>
equivocal Sign, either of Dulneſs, or <hi>Wit,</hi> becauſe the great eyes are not commonly ſparkling like the Stars in the Firmament, but of a ſixt Light, like that of moſt Planets. The little Eyes then, or of no exceſſive ſize, but quick, and conſtantly ſparkling, are reputed to be infallible marks of Sharpneſs and <hi>Wit,</hi> becauſe of the brightneſs, agility, and livelineſs of the Spirits they move and ſhine by. The Situation of the Eye makes but little to our purpoſe. Yet may not we be allowed to ſay that the deep eye ſheweth as much weakneſs in the Soul, as vigour in the Sight, or Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſelf; and on the other ſide, that the <hi>prominent</hi> Eye, which the <hi>French</hi> call <hi>a fleur de peau,</hi> may diſcover its good Temper and Strength. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain my ſelf thus. Becauſe of the weakneſs of our <hi>viſive</hi> Faculty, we apply a Telleſcop or Proſpect cloſe to our Eye, whereas if it were ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and more vigorous, we could ſee the Objects through the Proſpect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93255:47"/>
and at ſome diſtance from our Eye. Conſider then the deep or hollow. Eye, as a Proſpect joyning more cloſely in a manner to the Soul, and the <hi>Prominent</hi> ſomewhat more diſtant; and you ſhall inſtantly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand why I take the <hi>Prominency</hi> of the Eye for a mark of greater vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour in the Soul, as likewiſe wherefore I affirm the contrary of a deep Eye; which ſupplyeth, in ſome manner, this imperfection of the Soul; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe gathering cloſely together the viſual Beams, it repreſents to us the Objects at a greater diſtance, but not ſo well thoſe, or not at all, that ly at our ſides, unleſs we turn about to them. I know this compariſon is lame in ſome reſpects, but <hi>Omnis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratio claudicat,</hi> you know elſe it would change its Nature.</p>
            <p n="5">5. As for the other part of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Phyſiognomy, which the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> call <hi>Vultus, Viſage</hi> or Face, and whereby here I underſtand not only the conformation of the Face, but
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93255:47"/>
of the whole Body; I ſhall only ſay if we take it by the firſt Byaſs, we ſhall find nothing obſervable in it but the Colour and the Shape. The Face ſomewhat inclining to a natural and habitual pale, doo<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The fair Complection likewiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the clearneſs of their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, ſhews a well diſpoſed Soul, but not always very much acuteneſs. As to the ſhape, more length than breadth is to be moſt commended; for ſuch commonly have the hinder part of the Head very large, which, as we ſaid lately, is a good mark.</p>
            <p>Now if we take the word <hi>vultus</hi> preciſely for mans out-ſide, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, we may conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der two things, his Stature, and the accidents thereof. As to the firſt, the talleſt men generally ſpeaking, are not always the <hi>Wittieſt</hi>: becauſe in
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93255:48"/>
ſuch, as in High Houſes, the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Room is commonly the worſt furniſhed, their Spirits being too much diſperſed to produce any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Effect. The middle ſize, for the functions of the Mind, as well as for thoſe of the Body, is the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious. I ſhall ſay nothing of the adjuncts of the Body, ſave that 'tis obſervable that the crooked, lame and blind, are ordinarily poſſeſſed of not ordinary endowments of the mind, whereof I can give no other rational account, than by ſaying that this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens through a peculiar diſpoſition of an univerſal providence ſupplying thus abundantly the defects of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, by imparting to the Nobler part, the Soul, a peculiar perfection, and Beauty. Out of all this we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude not without a a ſhow of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, that, <hi>Frons, oculi, vultus, verum perſaepe loquuntur, Oratio vero ſaepiſſime:</hi> The Front, the Eyes, the Face ſpeak often Truth, and diſcover what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally we are, but our Tongue yet
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93255:48"/>
more frequently layeth us open to the underſtanding ſort, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance more certainly too, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if we take it for the very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the things we ſay, for then by the coherency, or incoherency of our diſcourſe, we betray our ſelves either to be Fools or wiſe, dull or <hi>Witty.</hi> But as a Phyſiognomiſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely, I mean here the out-ſide only, if I may ſo ſpeak, and the accidents of our Speech, as the <hi>Sound, Precipitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Stammering, Duration, &amp;c.</hi> As to the Sound: To ſpeak High and boiſterouſly without any rational oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, is a ſurer mark of a ſharp voice than of a ſharp <hi>Wit. Precipitation</hi> proceeds ſometimes, I confeſs from a too quick apprehenſion, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives more things than the Tongue can well utter in a ſhort time; but more often 'tis occaſion'd by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed <hi>Idea's</hi> of the Soul. By the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our diſcourſe, I mean that exceſſive one, whereby we become inſufferable to thoſe we converſe,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93255:49"/>
as being talkative beyond meaſure, whick I take to be no ſign either of <hi>Wit</hi> or judgement, unleſs we admit that the talkative ſort are the witti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and moſt judicious, which no man of Sence will ever grant, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficiently confuted by obvious reaſon, and daily experience: For as, <hi>Loquaciores avium quae minores,</hi> the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt Birds, for Inſtance, the Sparrows, Nightingales, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> make more noiſe than the greater ones do; as the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, the Swan, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So thoſe <hi>petits eſprits,</hi> ſhallow <hi>Wits,</hi> and ſuperficial Underſtandings are commonly more talkative than the Judicious, and moſt thinking ſort of Mankind.</p>

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93255:50"/>
not likewiſe a vulgar Error: For I am ſo far from believing that true Knowledge does puff up a Man, and ſwell him with Pride, that I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nothing fitter to make us truly humble without either Hypocriſie or Diſſimulation. 'Tis eaſie to conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture upon what grounds I run thus contrary to the Stream, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Opinion of moſt men, becauſe methinks 'tis evident that the chief Source of true Humility, &amp; Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on too, is a perfect knowledge of our own Weakneſs and Imperfections, of our Incapacity, and little Inſight in moſt things, which I take to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to thoſe only, who are the moſt knowing ſort of Mankind. I look upon ſuch as true Scepticks in this Senſe, That whatever is not laid open to their Eyes, either by the Light of an undeniable demonſtration, or by ſome ſort of ſelf-evidence, they juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doubt of. Becauſe they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand perfectly the difficulties on both ſides, which holding their Judgement
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93255:50"/>
in <hi>aequilibrio,</hi> equally in the middle, and in ſuſpence, hinder them from joyning cloſely with either of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams. Hence it appears that as the greateſt Wits have moſt Doubts, ſo the Dulliſh are commonly thoſe that doubt almoſt of nothing. I ſpeak not here in matters of Faith, for as Chriſtians, we are meer Believers, not Phyloſophers, but of Nature and Natural things, of the World, and what it contains, or whatever is within us, or without us: whereof we have ſo little Knowledge, that the ſelf-evident principles excepted, we know nothing evidently, or at leaſt by demonſtration. We know in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed certainly that we are, as having ſome ſenſible Foundation both in Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Exiſtency, That there is in us a certain internal principle, whereby we move, ſubſiſt, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, which we call the Soul. But how it performs all theſe things, what it is, whether Spiritual or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral we know not: I believe my
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:93255:51"/>
Soul to be both Immortal and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. And I have read ſeveral Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes pretending to a clear demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of its Spiritual Nature, which I cou'd never yet ſee, nor any Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial judge, I am afraid, ſhall ever be ſenſible of, becauſe we can have no certitude from the light of Reaſon that ſhe hath either being, or opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not depending upon matter, or ſome Material <hi>Phantaſma</hi>; and what in the other Life ſhall be her way of acting, we ſhall not know ſo long as we remain in this. I am not altogether unacquainted with the chief Prerogatives of our Souls, which are to conceeive, and frame general Notions, to preſcind, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther divide by her ſharp Edge the matter, into various parts ſeverally intellegible, to raiſe Influences from the general to the particular, and from the particular, though more Illegally to the general, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber things paſt, enviſage the preſent, and frame not unlikely conjectures of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93255:51"/>
what is to come. But all this amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to no more than to ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of probability, offers nothing like a demonſtration of the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of our Souls. For I conceive no reaſon why God, who made all things of nothing, may not likewiſe make what he pleaſeth of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Where is there then any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, if we ſay that God, who created the Matter of nothing, may change the ſame into a being capable to do, and in a more perfect man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to whatever our Soul performs. For I conceive it to be but a meer prejudice, and not reaſon that leads us to ſay, that whatever thinks, or <hi>reaſons,</hi> is of a Spiritual Nature. 'Tis obſervable then, whenſoever we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to reveal by demonſtration ſuch hidden Myſteries, we always ſuppoſe what in firſt Inſtance we ſhould prove, I mean that God is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo powerful to elevate the <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to what he pleaſeth, nor ſo skilful as to change it into a form capable

Old or New Philoſophy for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of the moſt common things. I am for Inſtance as little ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, when I am told, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I ſee under ſo many different figures, ſhapes and ſizes, is only oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by a various Texture and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alition of Corpuſcles, I am, I ſay, as little ſatisfied with this, as with <hi>Ariſtotle's</hi> matter and form united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, I know not how: For to ſay a thing belongs to this or that <hi>Species</hi> or kind, becauſe it hath a certain texture that we can give no further account of, is a Notion almoſt as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure unto my dim Underſtanding, as if you had inſtanced for Anſwer, <hi>A matter informed by a certain ſpecifical form.</hi> On each ſide you ſee by the very word <hi>certain</hi> we inſinuate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough our doubtfulneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of the thing.

may expect in vain a rational account of the ſame from the ableſt Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher. To attribute with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt number of Philoſophers this wonderful Phaenomenon to the Stars, or more particularly to the Moon, is but an ingenuous confeſſion of their ignorance, and deſpair of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter anſwer. For it being certain that when the Moon is in the upper <hi>Quadrant</hi> of our <hi>Meridian,</hi> the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are not only ſwelled here, but likewiſe in the oppoſite part of the Earth towards our <hi>Antipodes</hi>; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive how the Moon pierceth through ſuch a thick and maſſie Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as the Earth, ſo as to heighten the Waters beneath. I'm ſure ſhe acts not at ſuch a diſtance, either by heat or by light, for her heat is not ſtrong, and her light is but very weak, and neither of them can penetrate above ten foot within the ſuperficies of the Earth. Her occult and ſecret Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, I neither underſtand, nor look upon as an anſwer capable to ſatisfie

a curious enquirer. The movement of the Earth, by which ſome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to give an account of this regular movement, we obſerve in the Seas, beſides the uncertainty of this principle contributes but little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing towards the ſolution of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuperable difficulty; and <hi>Maurus,</hi> his Angel moving thus orderly this great and vaſt Body, is but a gueſs, and at moſt but an ill grounded Opinion.</p>

The very Sciences themſelves are not ſuch to us, if narrowly look't into. I have reaſon to examine the Truth of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clides</hi> demonſtrations, ſince I ſee the Impoſſibility of a common <hi>Segment,</hi> as they ſpeak, demonſtrated to my Weak Judgement by <hi>Proclus,</hi> and again contradicted with no leſs evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence by other able Mathematicians. To ſay nothing of the duplication of the <hi>Cub,</hi> the Squaring of the Circle, and other <hi>Gordian</hi> lenots of this Nature; I doubted always of the very Foundation of Geometry, I mean of the true Notion of a point. For when I hear this ſtranger de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, <hi>Punctum eſt cujus pars nullae eſt,</hi> I begin to wonder what that can be, that though not a Spirit, has no
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93255:56"/>
Imaginable parts: and then conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding there's no ſuch thing in being. I take the true Object of Geometry as a Line that is made of Points, and a Superficies compounded of Lines, to have no other Foundation in Eſſence or Exiſtency, but my own Conceit and Fancy. I am moreover ſo little ſatisfied with the groundleſs grounds, and Principles of judiciary Aſtrology, that I fancy it the moſt vain, and moſt uncertain of all Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and thoſe that admire it to be none of the judicious ſort. I confeſs, the Heavens are great Volumes, wherein we may read the wonderful effects of Gods infinite Power and Wiſdom; but you ſhall ſee no Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters there that expreſs the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency of things to come, and the occaſional determinations of our free Wills. For what connexion can any rational man imagine between the Aſpects of the Stars, and a Childs being one day either a King or an Emperour, or to dye ſuch a
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93255:56"/>
death. We know neither the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Properties, nor Influences of the Celeſtial Bodies; how can then a man, not a meer Fool, preſume to determine their contingent Effects. Aſtronomy indeed is ſomewhat bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grounded. But how many things are we yet here ignorant of, the quantity of the natural year ſhall never be exactly determined, becauſe we can never know the critical Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute of the Suns firſt ſtep backward from one Tropick towards the other. The new Kalender is not as yet perfect, and may one day ſtand in need to be corrected a ſecond time: We can give but a very uncertain account of the Nature of Comets, and debate often about their hight, periods, movement and bulk; whether the light of the fixed Stars be innate, or only borrowed from the Sun, we are not as yet certain. We do but gueſs at their real diſtance from us and among themſelves. We ſpeak raſhly, and perhaps, upon not very
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93255:57"/>
good grounds, of their wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Rapidity and Swiftneſs. I ſhall ſay nothing of an infinite number of other things, that we can give no rational account of, as for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, of Antipathy, Sympathy, Poiſons, and of that ſort of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, we call Specificks. If I chance to meet with two men I never ſaw before, I find my ſelf more inclin'd to ſerve the one than the other, but why, I am to ſeek. As ſoon as the Lamb cometh into the World, it flyeth from before the Woolf, as from a known Enemy: Now by what kind of Impulſe or Impreſſion, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haves it ſelf ſo rationally, I ſhall wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly learn from any of the Modern, or Antient Philoſophers. The ſtrange effects of Poyſons are but too well known, whereof ſome are quick, ſome are ſlow, ſome cold, and others hot. But they all agree in this, that they deſtroy at length the ſtructure of our Bodies. I remember to have been preſent at the overture
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93255:57"/>
of a Lady, that had certainly been poyſon'd, which nevertheleſs we could not affirm by any viſible Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions made upon her inward Parts, the alteration made by this ſubtile Poyſon being quite inſenſible. I am of opinion that in this Life we ſhall never reach to a perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſuch odd pieces of Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Let us then acknowledge that there is no true Philoſophy in the World but Sceptiſiſm; not that I take Scepticks here for men that doubt of every thing, yea, and of their own Exiſtency too, for 'tis, perhaps, a vulgar Error to believe that there were ever any ſuch in the World, and withall not meer Fools: I mean then by Scepticks thoſe that are come to ſuch a pitch of Knowledge, as to doubt rationally of every diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble matter, becauſe ſeeing nothing under one light only, and looking narrowly into the reaſons of both ſides, they diſcover but ſome few, or

For this is no more than what the duller ſort are equally capable of. I am likewiſe ſomewhat out of conceit with moſt of our Modern Philoſophers, who will have none to be really <hi>Witty</hi> and Ingenious, but ſuch as underſtand perfectly Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm, or the Texture and Structure of things, or how to knit, weave and knead one Corpuſcle with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For at this rate Apothecaries, Smiths and Bakers, and the reſt of the Mechanical Tribe, are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted true Philoſophers. Yet I ever conceived Philoſophy to be ſomething beyond the reach of this common ſort, and would be very loath to become either a Smith or a Baker, in order to gain the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Name of a true Philoſopher.

I have a great reſpect, and I am for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to it by the very name, for what we call in <hi>England</hi> Divines, yet I look not upon them as great <hi>Wits,</hi> becauſe if they be good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, they muſt renounce the uſe of their <hi>Wit,</hi> and believe the moſt inconceivable Myſteries of Religion upon no better ground, than the Simpleſt ſort, that is upon the ſureſt of all, the Authority of a Divine, tho' obſcure Revelation. I conceive then to be ſhort, no other Notion of a great <hi>Wit,</hi> than what Sceptiſiſm af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords me: Not that I mean a man that doubts of every thing, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one that can ſhow demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively the incertitude of all diſputable matters, thoſe of Faith, with which we meddle not, laid aſide.

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:93255:60"/>
things. So as the greateſt <hi>Wit</hi> of Angels, conſiſts in knowing; the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Wit</hi> in Men conſiſts in doubting: whoever than after a due conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any difficulty in what Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſoever ſeeth the <hi>Pro</hi> and the <hi>Con,</hi> or whatever may be find for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining either part of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction ſo clearly, that he is forced to ballance his underſtanding in the middle by an almoſt equal Weight of counterpoizing Reaſons: This Man I ſay, and no other may aſſume to himſelf without Uſurpation, the Name of a great <hi>Wit:</hi> You ſhall eaſily know him either by his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, or by his Writings. He is not of the Humour of certain Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Heads, who becauſe they ſee things but under one light, undertake boldly to determine the greateſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties at the very firſt hearing of them. But the Man we are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of being wary and cautious, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires time to conſult with himſelf about the matter, before he ventures

to give a poſitive anſwer, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times occaſions the leſs underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſort to take him to be none of the ſharpeſt; and when he is come to a reſolution upon the caſe propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, his Deciſions are ſo moderate, ſo prudent, and ſo far from being too daring and bold, that they ſcarce ever amount to more than to the determination of ſome degrees of probability, if the thing be real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doubtful. I have always admir'd this Character in the Honourable <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Boyle</hi>: 'Tis to be met with every where in his Writings, and is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable likewiſe in his diſcourſe, if he be required an anſwer to any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable difficulty. Yet if it chance that ſome Eminent <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> expreſs themſelves ſometimes in doubtful matters, as if they judged them evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, this is not to be wondred at, becauſe as ſome Men cannot expreſs well their Thoughts, others have ſuch an eaſie utterance, that through the Heat of diſpute, or quickneſs of

But generally ſpeaking when you hear a man ſay, he can give an evident account for inſtance of the ebbing and flowing of the Sea, of the fits of the Ague, of the attractive faculty in the Load-ſtone, of the nature of Poiſons, and Specificks whether exteriour or inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, of the Origine of the Winds, of the ſolution of Gold by <hi>Aqua Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> and not by <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> of the ſolution of Silver by <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and not by <hi>Aqua Regia,</hi> and a thouſand other abſtruſe difficulties of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; you may be ſure that his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency is nothing inferiour to his vanity and preſumption. I fall much ſhort upon this account of the great Eſteem ſome have for <hi>Diſcartes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he pretends too much to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Truths, and will have us before we are fit for his Philoſophy, to make our Underſtanding <hi>Tabulamra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam,</hi> as a ſmooth board, capable of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:93255:61"/>
any Character by ſcraping out of it the Pictures of all things it was fraught with from our greener years, as if none had ever ſpoken Truth but himſelf, or as if our intellective fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty being thus naked, was not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually diſpoſed to be wrought upon by error, as well as by Truth. Some of his Followers betray themſelves to be but half witted, when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a thing, becauſe <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> whom they are not acquainted with, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it, and pretended it to be an evident Truth, becauſe forſooth <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi> held it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To do both theſe Philoſophers right, though with the learnedſt part of the World, I apprehend <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to be far beyond <hi>Diſcartes,</hi> as to ſharpneſs, depth, and penetrancy of <hi>Wit</hi>: They have ſpoken both many things to the purpoſe, and probable enough, and many others likewiſe with a greater appearance of falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood than Truth. The main difference I find between them both only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:93255:62"/>
in this, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> undertook to debate and diſcuſs matters beyond the reach of Humane Capacity. Such I reckon to be the <hi>Infinite,</hi> whether in number, or matter, the <hi>Diviſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and Compoſition both of the <hi>fluent</hi> and <hi>permanent continuum. Diſcartes</hi> ſpeaketh of Matter and Motion, and things indeed leſs ſubtile, but more intelligible; yet I conceive his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions drawn from thence to be no demonſtrations; and if any of his Diſciples look upon them as ſuch, I fear he is either prejudic'd, or ſees things but under one light: I have ſo good opinion of <hi>Diſcartes</hi> his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that I believe he intended not to give us a true demonſtration of God in his <hi>Metaphiſical Meditations,</hi> though grounded, if I miſremember not, upon theſe two principles, firſt, that whatever we have, a clear and diſtinct <hi>Idea</hi> of, exiſts, or may exiſt. Secondly, that we have a clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct <hi>Idea</hi> that God is in Nature. For I know not why I may not have a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:93255:62"/>
clear and diſtinct <hi>Idea</hi> of any impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing, ſince our Knowledge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth not ſo much its qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from its Object, as from the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of its tendency towards the Object, which may be clear, tho' the Object be confuſed. Again, no man of good ſenſe will take this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, <hi>Deus eſt, God exiſts,</hi> for one of thoſe we call <hi>Notas per ſe,</hi> known immediately by their own ſelf-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, without a <hi>Medium</hi> or reaſon to prove them. Nevertheleſs this muſt happen in our caſe, if we have a clear and diſtinct <hi>Idea</hi> of Gods being really exiſtent in nature, or of his being poſſible: For if I conceive an infinite good poſſible, 'tis conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial that he really exiſts, ſince in this very notion the actual exiſtency is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, as being a moſt material per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let us not then impoſe upon our ſelves, and take for demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by a certain Precipitation of judgement, what at the utmoſt bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:93255:63"/>
but a fair ſhow of probability. I may methinks be allowable to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt a Mans Capacity, when he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to know all things to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, or to ſay nothing, what is not either in it ſelf, or by conſequence clear and evident. I have always been a great admirer of <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> the Angelical Doctor, and do look upon him as a tranſcending <hi>Wit,</hi> but meerly upon this account, that he ſeems to be certain of nothing, though <hi>in Corpore articuli,</hi> he ſtands at length ſtiffly to one part of the contradiction, and anſwers the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for the other. But you may eaſily gather both from the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he propoſeth to himſelf, and his anſwers that he pretended no more than to doubt rationally of diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble matters; and more than this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expected from the capacity of Man, who has no comprehenſive knowledge of natural things, as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels have. I take then an ingenuous Ignorant to be of the moſt ingenious
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:93255:63"/>
or knowing ſort: I mean one that profeſſeth ſincerely he knoweth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing certainly, but who withal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his penetrancy, and great <hi>Wit,</hi> can give a rational, though not a demonſtrative account of every thing. Such an one I conceive ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to defend probably, and no further, whatever you may propoſe to him. For few things are to a man of this Character ſelf-evident. He doubts not only of the poſſibility of ever doubling the <hi>Cub,</hi> or ſquaring the <hi>Circle,</hi> of fixing of <hi>Mercury,</hi> of making malleable Glaſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But he diſcovers without Teleſcops, Stains, and Spots in the very Stars themſelves, I mean Obſcurity, Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, uncertainty in the cleareſt and moſt approved Notions, Errors, Miſtakes, and ſometimes flat Devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the Truth in the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate Authors. He neither admires the old Philoſophy, nor dotes upon the New, but takes up the Cudgels indifferently for either, as it ſerves his
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:93255:64"/>
turn, or his fancy. He is not always ſatisfied with what we call Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Demonſtrations, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers them often to be but falſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions, impoſing eaſily upon a weak underſtanding. He ſcrupleth at the vulgar Opinions, and values them no more than vulgar Errors. This is the Sentiment of an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Gentleman, whom I reſpect as a great <hi>Wit</hi>; I have heard him ſay more than once, that he found by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the moſt vulgar Opinions to be flat untruths, which he has inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly proved to conviction in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of his moſt learned Books. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, though ſuch Men ſeem to be ſatisfied with nothing, not through Pride, for they are of the Humbleſt ſort, but through Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, yet they are deſirous to learn from the meaneſt Capacities, as well knowing that their Underſtanding, how vaſt ſoever, is but of a limited ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and not <hi>Omniſcient.</hi> Tho' they be ſparing of their <hi>Elogiums,</hi> as admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:93255:64"/>
nothing, yet they are ſeldom guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of detraction, of too much bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, or raſhly condemning other mens labours; and if Books receive their Fates from the Capacity of the Readers, 'tis a good Fortune for a well penn'd Piece to fall into ſuch mens hands: for being great Artiſts themſelves, they are the beſt Judges of Arts, and do praiſe moderately what they judge to deſerve it, or ſay nothing at all of what they either cannot, or will not commend.</p>

            </argument>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>ADam</hi> was not only the firſt man in the World, but the firſt <hi>Wit</hi>: for as being the King of all other inferiour Creatures, I do rationally fancy he was fitted to ſuch an eminent Dignity, with proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Gifts, and Talents. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:93255:65"/>
Gods uſual way of providing for his Creatures whenſoever he minds to exalt them. I conceive then, firſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s Underſtanding fraught with clear and diſtinct <hi>Idea</hi>'s of all natural things. He was, I doubt not, a good <hi>Alchimiſt,</hi> and an ingenious Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer, an accurate Geometer, a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Logician, and a very acute Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher. But yet I cannot ſay that he was a very witty Husband, becauſe of his too ſimple and blind compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency to his Wife, which occaſioned his ruine, and that of his Poſterity. We muſt not think nevertheleſs that his Fall darkned his Underſtanding, though it corrupted his will: For I ſuppoſe he was not unlike to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, as to this point: of whom the Divines affirm, <hi>non ſunt vulnerati in Naturalibus,</hi> after their Sin commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they retained yet all their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural endowments, as not being wounded in their Intellectuals. He could then I fancy, and did really propagate to Poſterity a part of his
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:93255:66"/>
Wit and Knowledge: Not that I think <hi>Wit</hi> to be hereditary, ſince we know certainly by daily experience, that the moſt ingenious men beget ſometimes the dulleſt Children. My meaning only is, that he taught his Sons and Daughters, what he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf never learned but from God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, ſo they became in a ſhort time by his Inſtructions well vers'd in moſt Sciences, and skilful in all Arts, which they invented firſt for neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's ſake, and then for conveniency. Thus <hi>Wit</hi> flouriſhed in the World as by a lineal deſcent, till the days of <hi>Noah: When all Fleſh had corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their way, that is their Wit; Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis caro corruperat viam ſuam.</hi> It was confin'd then in the Ark to a little number, and if the Ark had ſplit, it had intirely periſhed. The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> after the retreat of the Waters from above the Face of the Earth, claimed more right to it for ſeveral hundred years, than any other Nation of the World. Every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:93255:66"/>
was to them a piece of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and what ſignifyed nothing to other Nations, repreſented to them profound Myſteries. Their <hi>Hierogli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks</hi> are evident proofs of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious meditations. To them, as much as to the <hi>Arabians,</hi> we owe the knowledge of Aſtronomy, and of moſt other Sciences: Yet as men are obnoxious to various changes, this moſt ingenious Nation became at length ſo dull, as to acknowledge, and worſhip Cats, Dogs and Rats for its Gods. But the <hi>Grecians</hi> ſucceeding in their Room, took upon them to be the great Inſtructers of the World, and were never equal'd but by the <hi>Romans.</hi> I know not what to make of <hi>Plato,</hi> whether we ſhould call him a God or a Man: I ſhall only ſay, he juſtly deſerves to be ſtiled Divine, <hi>Divinus Plato,</hi> becauſe of his high Sentiments of God, and thoſe Notable pieces of Divinity he has left to Poſterity. <hi>Anacharſis, Anax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agoras, Pythagoras, Euclides,</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:93255:67"/>
Stars of the firſt magnitude, and were the greateſt <hi>Wits</hi> of their times: But the <hi>Romans</hi> at length ſubduing the <hi>Grecians,</hi> became their Maſters, not only by the happy ſucceſs of their Arms, but alſo by their <hi>Wit,</hi> Learning and Eloquence: For if we reflect but a moment upon the preſent condition of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> we ſhall inſtantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that whenſoever the body is enſlaved, the mind is commonly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, or at leaſt loſeth much of its natural vigour and ſharpneſs, becauſe of its dependency upon the body. The <hi>Athenians</hi> under the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoke were no more called then, as before, <hi>Scientiarum Omnium Inrentrices Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae,</hi> the Inventors of all Arts and Sciences. The Muſes had now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted <hi>Athens</hi> to follow the <hi>Roman</hi> Conquerours, to the Imperial Seat of the World then, <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> now on the other ſide began to propagate, together with their own Authority, <hi>Wit,</hi> and Knowledge, through the reſt of the World; yet
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93255:67"/>
the <hi>Gymnoſophiſts</hi> flouriſh'd before them, as ſome fancy in the <hi>Eaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</hi> I know not what ſort of Men they were, but if we believe the relations of ſome not unlearned Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellours, they taught not very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Doctrines concerning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother life, a Rewarder, and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Crimes, of the Exiſtency, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſciency, Goodneſs and Immenſity of God. 'Tis reported that they delighted much in that pleaſant fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Tranſmigration of their Souls; which Doctrine I take to be moſt true in this Senſe, that Men in all ages do ariſe ſo like unto thoſe that have gone before them, as to <hi>Wit,</hi> Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Learning; that we muſt not quarrel much with ſuch as admit a certain repreſentative <hi>Metempſycoſis,</hi> or Tranſmigration of Souls from one Body into another: Which I fancy was the Opinion of the Firſt <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migrators,</hi> and is conceived to have been the meaning of the <hi>Indian Gymnoſophiſts.</hi> The <hi>Druides</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:93255:68"/>
before ever the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagles appeared on this ſide of the <hi>Alps,</hi> were look't upon as great <hi>Wits</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Gauls.</hi> Yet I could learn almoſt nothing of this Tribe abroad, though I have been very inquiſitive after their Doctrine, Diſcipline, and Manners, but that they lived in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote places, as upon Mountains, where I have ſeen ſome of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents, and in Woods much reſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, by the generality of the People that conſulted them upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and doubtful Caſes, as Oracles. Yet I was inform'd that they held the World eternal, and thought it a ſelf-evident Contradiction that any thing ſhould be made of nothing. They could not admit in God any foreſight of contingent effects, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together inconſiſtent in their Fancy with their Contingency. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the <hi>Gauls</hi> were but a blunt and dull ſort of People, under theſe ſelf-conceited and ſpeculative Maſters. Yet no ſooner the <hi>Romans</hi> had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:93255:68"/>
themſelves of the greateſt part of the World, but the <hi>Gauls</hi> and moſt other Nations began to improve more particularly their Natural Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nevertheleſs I believe, I ſhall not be contradicted, if I ſay that ſince the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was torn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder by its own diviſions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine Broyls, <hi>Wit</hi> and Learning made a greater Progreſs in the World than ever they had done during the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous Days of the <hi>Roman</hi> great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For not to ſpeak of Gunnery, Printing, Sailing, whereof either the <hi>Romans</hi> knew nothing at all, or never came neer the skill of after Ages, they can pretend to no inſight in Chymiſtry, and had made but few diſcoveries in Natural Philoſophy, in compare to what the <hi>Wits</hi> of our Age have made in both, to the great benefit of Mankind. Yea I am of Opinion, that if <hi>Cicero</hi> came now into the World again, he would be forced to ſtudy afreſh his own Tongue, and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93255:69"/>
learn from us the new ſignifications of many Latine Words, which we either borrow, or invent to expreſs new things, and that were perhaps quite unknown to him: Such I reckon to be moſt Chymical terms, as <hi>Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Solution, Stratification, Volati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, &amp;c.</hi> Some of the Antients I confeſs, were Eminent Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, as <hi>Ptolemy, Euclides, &amp;c.</hi> But Methinks we have no reaſon to yield to them in this point; ſince beſides many new things we have diſcovered that they never dreamt of; we may juſtly boaſt of the renowned <hi>Napers</hi> Divine Invention, I mean his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Logarithmes,</hi> whoſe Properties and Nature the more you ſtudy, the greater Wonders you ſhall meet with. I take this Divine Art, for I know no Elogium below it, to be the very Key of Mathematicks. Since what for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly could not be done without long and tedious Multiplications and Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, may now be perform'd by a ſimple Addition and Subſtraction, Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93255:69"/>
ſo eaſie, that a Man but of a mean Capacity may become capable in leſs than a days time, to teach them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I ſhall not forget here another no leſs curious, and more neceſſary piece of <hi>Wit,</hi> or regarding more nearly the common good. I have ſeen in <hi>France, Holland, Germany,</hi> many ſad effects of what we call <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam</hi> or Rupture: And being curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to know the beſt Methods of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, I converſt the renownedſ<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He deſigns to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh at conveneniency his Method, which undoubtedly will prove a great common Good.

            <p n="1">1. WE do often make an ill uſe of the beſt things, as alſo ſometime a good uſe of the worſt. Thus that great Overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Texture of Humane Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93255:72"/>
Poyſon, we turn into wholſome Remedies, and Powerful Antidotes. I know nothing worſe than Sin, which nevertheleſs has proved an occaſion of Salvation to many through Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and Humiliation, its ordinary Effects. St. <hi>Peter</hi> was never truly humble, till by a flat denyal of his Saviour, he became experimentally ſenſible of his own Weakneſs. St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Incredulity, or misbelief, wrought not only in him an increaſe of Faith, but likewiſe in the reſt of the Chriſtian World. For I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as a moſt powerful inductive to believe the Myſtery of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, becauſe it occaſion'd the Conviction of thoſe that then doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of this Important truth, or might perhaps in after times doubt of it. For who can hereafter mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt this point, if he reflects but a moment with what evidence <hi>Chriſt</hi> proved to St. <hi>Thomas</hi> the Realty of his Body: But now 'tis as true on the other ſide, as I was ſaying a little
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:93255:72"/>
before, that we miſuſe ſometimes the beſt things, as a ſickly and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly conſtitution turns the beſt Food not into a good Subſtance, but into pernicious Venom. Thus <hi>Wit,</hi> the Nobleſt of Natural Gifts, is made often an Inſtrument of all kind of Wickedneſs. I conceive it was not ſaid of the Devil only, <hi>Circuit tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam Leo rugens querens quam devores,</hi> That he runs to and fro like a roaring Lyon, to prey upon, and devour the firſt he meets with. This is likewiſe the chief and ordinary buſineſs of moſt Men in this corrupted age we live in. Some indeed like Roaring Lyons hold the World in a perpetual Stir, and Fear, by claiming right to whatever they can reach by their Arms. Others again make not an open War like Lyons, but more craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty like Foxes, lay ſecret Ambuſhes to their unthinking Neighbours. I would wiſh there were no Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the World, if Men could live as well without them. I know
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93255:73"/>
indeed they are thought neceſſary for the Good and Benefit of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; but the unjuſt meaſures they uſe ſometimes for their own private ends, under pretence of promoting the Common Good, makes me ſpeak thus, and wiſh we could want them. For I am of Opinion, that to trade with many, and to Cheat, are much about one. I ſhall not except that Noble, and neceſſary Art I do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs my ſelf, wherein I wiſh the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of able, and Conſcientious Men, did equal that of meer Pretenders, and bold Adventurers. I doubt not but there are Good Men of all Trades as of all Religions; yet I have known ſome Godly Tradeſmen, as to their out-ſide, prove at length the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Cheats under Heaven. They had no doubt read in Scripture this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tilis ad omnia pietas,</hi> that Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety is uſeful for everything: Whence they concluded, that it might be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the gaining of Money too, the beſt of things in their Conceit: and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:93255:73"/>
accordingly thought it a piece of Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and not of <hi>Wit,</hi> to adventure the cutting of a Purſe in the High-way, ſince they could do it with greater ſecurity, and certainly by long Prayers, reformed Looks, or by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they might gain the eſteem of thoſe they deal't withal, and could expect any thing from.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſhall ſay nothing of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and manifold tricks of Lawyers, who become often on a ſuddain very rich, though by the Law, yet very unlawfully. If men were not mad, they would undoubtedly agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, and give them leſs to do: It was not the only ſad effect of Original Sin, that our Bodies ſhould be obnoxious to the cruel handling of ſome Phyſitians, and our Souls to the intereſs'd deciſions of fanciful Caſuiſts, but likewiſe that our Goods, Subſtance and Riches, ſhould be plunder'd and pillag'd, by thoſe very Men who pretend to ſecure them to us by: certain
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93255:74"/>
Methods of equity and Juſtice: But this diſorder, I mean this perpetual reflex upon our own private concerns, is not only to be met with in <hi>Atrio,</hi> in the outer Court, but 'tis got into the very Sanctuary it ſelf, into the Church, and Pulpit, where no ſuch thing ſhould be expected. I doubt not but if we could ſee into the Breaſts of ſeveral Preachers, we ſhou'd there diſcover that their greateſt Zeal aims either at ſome Preferment, if they have none, or a fatter one then that they are poſſeſſed of. Neither do I fear the guilt of a raſh Judgement, by ſpeaking thus freely my mind, ſince 'tis commonly ſaid, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it be but a meer calumny, that Church-Men diſcourſe more toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their Livings, than of the means how to amend their own, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, or other Mens irregular lives. Yet I will charitably ſuppoſe that this is but the defect of ſome few particular Men, and not of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality: For I do leſs wonder to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:93255:74"/>
ſee a debauch't Clergy-Man, than a <hi>Judas</hi> amongſt <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Apoſtles. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs I pretend not that Clergy-Men, as well as others, may not make uſe of their <hi>Wit</hi> for their peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar ends: I allow them then to preach either for a Benefice, or for a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Benefice, provided this be but their Secondary Motive, and not the firſt mover of all their Actions, or provided perhaps, by being inabled to do more good, they pretend to glorifie God more in a Higher Condition, than in a lower: In all this I conceive nothing Irregular: Neither do I deny but that an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Tradeſman may, and ought to gain by his Ingenuity, cheating only, and the Art of Circumventing one another, I condemn; which I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be but too uſual among 'em: For if they have to do with a man that either underſtands not their Tricks, or ingeniouſly relies upon their Word, and Honeſty, 'tis odds but conſulting their dearly beloved
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:93255:75"/>
Intereſt, more than what Juſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of them, they will pretend to have <hi>uſed him kindly,</hi> as they ſpeak, when they have really put a Cheat upon him. But as the eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſome Stars argue not a general darkneſs in all the reſt, what I lately ſaid of Church-Men, may likewiſe be underſtood of Mechanicks, and all Tradeſmen, whereof ſeveral are Conſcientious, and well meaning Men, ſo well grounded in the Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims of true Honour and Honeſty, that they would not for all the World have done a baſe thing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I am ſatisfyed that men miſuſe not only theſe ingenious faculties they have received from God to the Corruption of their Morals, but likewiſe to the intangling and depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of their Intellectuals. I laugh more at, than I do pity the unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful attemps of ſuch as pretend to give us a true Notion of the <hi>Infinite,</hi> that is of a thing infinitely above the reach of our conceiving Faculty, or to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:93255:75"/>
inform the World with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> what or how many parts either time or matter is compounded of. <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes,</hi> if not ſo ſubtile as <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> is in my Judgement more prudent, for having left untouch't ſuch inſolvable, and uſeleſs Difficulties. The Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous Notions of Eternity, as a <hi>perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum nunc,</hi> a perpetual Inſtant, <hi>inſtans infinitum,</hi> an infinite Inſtant, <hi>Inſtans immobile,</hi> an immoveable moment, <hi>Vitae interminabilis tota ſimul ac perfecta poſſeſſio,</hi> a perfect and whole poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all at once of an interminable life, are but vain and airy Conceits, fitter to embroyl our Underſtandings, than to give them any New, or real Light towards the diſcovery of the Object they propoſe. We may tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay of Eternity what an antient Philoſopher ſaid of God, the more we think on it, the leſs we know what it is; which may be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe applyed to many other things, commonly thought leſs inconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, as to time, place, motion
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:93255:76"/>
and matter, whereof as I have never read any ſatisfactory Notions, ſo I think it not worth my while to make any new attempts about a Subject which I humbly conceive to be ſome degrees beyond the reach of my weak Abilities. What a ſtrange conceit is it in ſome to conſume whole years, and the greateſt part of their days in ſearching a perpetual movement, &amp; at the ſame time wholly artificial: A <hi>French</hi> Jeſuite ſpent unſucceſsfully a part of his Life, and a conſiderable Sum of Money in this vain attempt, and coming at length without have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found out the eternal move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to his laſt end, and eternal reſt, reaped no other thing by the continual, and long Labours of his Life, but this pleaſant Epitaph after his Death, <hi>Patri quaerenti motum per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuum requies aeterna.</hi>

            <p n="4">4. I take it likewiſe to be a loſs of time, which I would not value, if it proved not alſo ſometimes the loſs of Mens Fortunes, to ſearch after,

though perhaps it may be found out what they call commonly the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers Stone. A Man of a great Eſtate, who dyed at length in an Hoſpital, ſaid, a little before his Death, he could wiſh his moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Enemy no greater misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune than to become an Alchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, or a <hi>Chryſopeian,</hi> I mean one that endeavours to find out the Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture neceſſary for the conſtitution of a true Gold: This Texture I fancy is known to the Angels, whether good or bad, becauſe they have an intutive and comprehenſive Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge too, in ſome degrees, of the whole Creation: But I have juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to doubt if any Man has as yet ſtumbled upon it: And which makes equally for my purpoſe, though we were certain to find out at length this wonderful Art, all would be in vain and loſt labour, yea, and of a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conſequence too. Becauſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being juſtly jealous of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious Artiſts, would either uſe

But I conceive no worſe uſe of <hi>Wit,</hi> than to be buſie about acquiring too much inſight in Judiciary Aſtrology, which a man cannot be intirely addicted to, without being already come to the Years of Dotage in the Opinion of the Wiſer ſort. I often do wonder how rational Men are not deterr'd from the Study of this vain Science, by the very weakneſs of its imaginary Principles, and ſuffer not themſelves to be laught out of it, by the notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly falſe predictions of ſuch as have pretended to the greateſt inſight in this matter.

So extream was the folly of thoſe Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Heads, who deſerved not only to be pointed at for their inſufferable Vanity, but likewiſe to be ſeverely puniſh't for daring to thruſt upon the World at this rate theſe flat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths, and preſuming to play the Prophets, without the leaſt proof of their being inſpired, or ſo much as of a ſufficient Capacity for the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of probable conjectures.</p>

Though becauſe of their natural a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteneſs, they gueſs a great deal nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer what we are to determine our ſelves to, by the preſent Temper and Diſpoſition of our Bodies.

               </gap> Mankind, whoſe Prerogative it is, as of other Commonwealths, to have all Freedom, either of concealing from, or communicating to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners their Secrets. Thus if I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs

my Thoughts to the Devil, or to an Angel, I do not improbably think, that God being now free by my conſent, and yielding up my right from that Obligation he has put upon himſelf, the Angel really knows, and underſtands what I think; but if I do not direct after this manner my Thoughts, or will not diſcover them to any other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: God has put a tye upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, grounded upon the Priviledge of a Free Commonwealth, as that of Mankind is, not to lend a helping hand to the Diſcovery of my ſecret Thoughts. Since then the Devil can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at the utmoſt frame but very weak conjectures of things to come, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they be contingent: It is not only uſeleſs, but a not ordinary piece of madneſs, to take advice from, and conſult with them, who in all appearance have firſt conſulted him.</p>

For ſince we can never in reaſon ſuppoſe but that he aims at nothing more than the Peace, Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and common good of the Nation, as being inſeparable from
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:93255:79"/>
his own concerns, and wellfare: if you perhaps through a criminal mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake chance to be of another Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; you may certainly conclude from thence that you underſtand not the Publick concerns ſo well as he does, who ſits at the Helm, and is by Gods ſpecial command to watch over us all, as a Flock committed to his vigilancy and truſt.</p>
            <p>As the Stones cut by the preſcript of an Archytect into Triangles, Squares, Cubes, Pyramids, know not why they are thus ſhaped: For this being the buſineſs of the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect, or Maſter Maſon, who has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a clear and diſtinct Idea of the whole Building, he orders ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly whatever he thinks fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for the compleating thereof.

Would this in your opinion, be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rational or ſufferable, ſince they know nothing of the Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers deſign.

            </argument>
            <p n="1">1. IT may be a Paradox, though no untruth, that <hi>Wit</hi> is the worſt of Gods Gifts beſtowed upon Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, if we Judge a thing bad, that either is the occaſion or cauſe of evil, and miſchief: For it is not only the Headwel of Rebellion, Sedition, and Hereſie, which we may eaſily diſcover, whether we reflect upon our times, or by a ſtart backwards take a view of the foregoing Ages; but 'tis alſo the Inventer of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Engins made uſe of by men for the Ruine of Mankind, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence either of a neceſſary defence, or juſt attack: Yet as by Malice, or miſapplication, it may be a fit Inſtrument for evil; ſo if we
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:93255:82"/>
turn it once the right way, it may prove the moſt uſeful, as undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is the moſt ſhining participation of the Divine Nature. And I know not why <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid, that a Man who can live in a retired ſolitude, muſt be either a God, or a Beaſt: Since for this I conceive nothing elſe requiſite but a not too narrow <hi>Wit</hi>: For <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualis homo omnia judicat,</hi> the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Man, that's the <hi>Witty,</hi> diſcerns, and makes uſe of every thing. Of ſuch an one 'tis truly ſaid, <hi>Nunquam minus ſolus quam cum ſolus,</hi> that he is never in better company, than when he is with no body; for then in his retired Thoughts he calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to an account, and examines ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely all his own actions, thoughts and Words. I know not then where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon 'tis grounded, that a Man is a <hi>ſociable Animal,</hi> and loves to live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his like in Nature and Shape. For I have always obſerved the wittyeſt ſort of men to delight more in their retired Solitudes, than
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:93255:82"/>
in the greateſt Crouds. If this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Maxim be not a vulgar Error, as I believe 'tis none, it cannot be underſtood but of the duller Sort, who being once alone, are in all ſenſe alone, and with no body, becauſe they are no Company to themſelves; I mean they know not how to play the time away, with what either is within or without themſelves: But ſuch as can act the Philoſophers part with whatever they ſee, feel, or touch, do neither need, or incline much to converſe except perhaps thoſe that are of a no leſs, or rather of greater Abilities than themſelves. Nay Books to ſuch men are not neceſſary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in their Retirements: For they can want their Company too, though not ſo well as that of Men. One of theſe three they are always converſant with, themſelves, God, or the Obvious Works of his Power, that are without us. I conceive not, 'tis true, what God is; for how ſhould he be what he is, if I could compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:93255:83"/>
him, yet I may apprehend him to be a being infinitely perfect: that is to ſay, whoſe perfections are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs. I need not then, if I pleaſe, want a Subject to think on when alone, if conſidering apart thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections one after another; I mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as far as I can reach, their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions, their length, their breadth, and their depth. So I ſhall now me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate upon his Power, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the ſtrange effects thereof in the works of the Creation, which I ſhall always conceive infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low what he could have done, or may yet do. I ſhall again repreſent to my ſelf, though very imperfectly, the brightneſs of his Glory in the Sun, Moon and Stars, his conſtancy in the Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his activity in the Fire, the depth of his Eſſence in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs Seas, and the leaſt of his Creatures ſhall be unto me a fair Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of his Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and other Perfections.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:93255:83"/>2. But if I make no other uſe of my <hi>Wit</hi> than this, I am but a meer Moraliſt, and not a Chriſtian; for as ſuch I muſt lay aſide my Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, and believe what I conceive not upon the infallible Authority of an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Revelation. Nevertheleſs, tho' my Religion forbids me to play the Philoſopher, yet if I pretend to a rational belief, I preſume nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt its true Maxims. As I look then upon the meer light of Faith to be ſomewhat dark, ſo I know the light of reaſon to be ſomewhat clearer: May not I then joyn thoſe two Lights together, and make perhaps a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one of them both? I believe the myſtery of the Trinity, though I comprehend it not; I think it not unlawful to ſlatter my own Weakneſs with the diſcovery of ſome Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof in my Soul, as being one in Nature, and threefold in Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, I mean, as having three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Faculties, the Memory, Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Will. The <hi>Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:93255:84"/>
is above the reach of an Angelical Underſtanding: The Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the meer light of Nature could not but judge it impoſſible. 'Tis a ſtrange <hi>Metamorphoſis,</hi> that faith only teacheth me to be real. Stile me not nevertheleſs quite imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, if for my own ſatisfaction I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to perſwade to my ſelf the poſſibility thereof, by what I ſee daily in Nature, in the grafting of one Tree upon another, ſo that two Natures become now but one by union, and one almoſt individual Principle of their <hi>Common</hi> Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The reſurrection of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, or that after ſo many Changes, and different Shapes of Worms, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, Birds, Fiſhes, or whatever may feed upon us, we ſhall be at length our <hi>numerical</hi> ſelves again, is a thing that I incline to believe upon experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when I obſerve ſome Liquors or Waters, perfectly corrupted, to recover themſelves, though neither this, nor the foregoing Motives, could
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:93255:84"/>
ever make me a Chriſtian without the Authority of Divine Revelation, which I neither take from the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, Engliſh,</hi> nor <hi>Greek,</hi> but from the Catholick and Univerſal Church, conceiv'd by the Unbyaſs'd and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding ſort to be compounded of all ſuch, and the like particular true Chriſtian Aſſemblies. Thus what all true Chriſtians grant, and never debated, this and no other I take to be an article of Divine Faith, neceſſary to Salvation, if ſufficiently propoſed. I look upon the reſt as <hi>Supernumerary,</hi> or at the utmoſt as probable opinions, that may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to and fro amongſt School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but ought not to be impos'd upon Chriſtians, as Articles of Divine Faith, without the belief of which, their Names are raſed out of the Book of Life. I believe then not only that there is a Catholick Church, <hi>Credo Eccleſiam Catholicam,</hi> but likewiſe, <hi>Credo Eccleſiae Catholicae,</hi> I believe whatever it unamiouſly decides:
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:93255:85"/>
for, <hi>Audi Eccleſiam,</hi> hearken to the Church, is a true obligation, but the <hi>Romaniſt</hi> is extreamly prejudic'd, when he means always the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, as if it were, as it now ſtands, truly univerſal; whereas 'tis but a Member, and a very unſound one too of that great Body, we muſt all ſubmit to. I have obſerved another common miſtake of the leſs diſcerning Sort of <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> which is this, They pretend to a conſiderable advantage over Proteſtants from Antiquity, but reflect not that their Church is no otherwiſe diſtinguiſh'd from the reformed part of the World, than by meer Novelties, and Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries unheard of in the firſt three Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies: For I know no other mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial difference between a Proteſtant and a <hi>Romaniſt,</hi> but that the former adheres cloſely to the Doctrine of the Primitive times, whereas the latter takes for an articie of Divine Faith, not only what the univerſal Church held from all times, but whatever the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:93255:85"/>
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath declar'd ſince to be reveal'd. Yet becauſe I was ever of opinion that every man muſt ſtand, or fall by the verdict of his own Conſcience; I think it neither fit, nor a good uſe of <hi>Wit</hi> to quarrel with any man upon the account of his Religion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I ſhall therefore do better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, to clear in this point thoſe of my own Profeſſion, I mean the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, from a foul and too general aſperſion of the vulgar ſort, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they are not much concern'd with what we call Religion. For 'tis commonly, to our great ſcandal ſaid, <hi>Ex tribus medicis duo Athei,</hi> that of three Phyſitians there are but two Atheiſts. I am without Prejudice, of a quite contrary opinion, and think it no Paradox to ſay, that none are ſo Religious as Phyſitians, or at leaſt, that none have greater opportunities to raiſe their Souls to the higheſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Perfection: Which if I prove to conviction, nothing more can ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally be required for the taking
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:93255:86"/>
away this general ſcandal of our Profeſſion. What I ſhall ſay of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians muſt needs be underſtood of their near Relations, the natural Philoſophers, who likewiſe, if we credit the bigotted part of Mankind, are no great Patrons of either Virtue or Religion.</p>
            <p>Would one think that two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Cauſes could have the ſame Influence, or the ſame effect, yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more conformable to Truth. Thus I hold that as ignorance is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the Mother of Devotion in moſt men, I mean in the duller ſort of Mankind; ſo Knowledge, the oppoſite extream, begets undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly Piety and Religion, in ſuch as have eyes to diſcover God in the Works of his Power. But who has a greater conveniency for making of ſuch uſeful Diſcoveries than Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, whether we conſider the Object of their Art, or the Subject thereof. The former I take to be, whatever is contained in the three Kingdoms, as
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:93255:86"/>
they ſpeak, in the <hi>Animal, Vegetative</hi> and <hi>Mineral:</hi> where they cannot but admire that Soveraign being, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Providence over Mankind, in the production of whatever may prove inſtrumental to the conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Health and Life. The latter I apprehend to be no other than that wonderful Engine of our Body, whoſe wonderful Structure may furniſh them with higher Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, than that of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe it ſelf. Thus a Phiſitian conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering this moſt ingenious Fabrick, cannot but raiſe his thoughts towards the Maker thereof. For no man in his <hi>Wits</hi> will take the <hi>Coition,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Cohalition</hi> of all the parts of our Body into ſuch a comely and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable texture, to be meer fortui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, and not the real effect of Art and Wiſdom. I know not then whereon is grounded the general prejudice againſt this noble and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Science, which the Divines themſelves, eſpecially thoſe of the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:93255:87"/>
               <hi>Romiſh</hi> perſwaſion ſeem to be more concerned in than Phyſitians. For he was not perhaps guilty of a very flat untruth, who inverting thus the common word ſaid, <hi>Ex tribus Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gici duo Athei,</hi> That of three Divines its odds but two are Atheiſts, or in my leſs ſevere judgment perhaps, meer Deiſts; becauſe pretending ſometimes to circumſcribe our Myſteries with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Circumference of their narrow Underſtandings; they often fall from believing, what by their Weak Reaſon they cannot reach, and ſo turning Chriſtianiſm into Deiſm, they ceaſe to be in their Hearts what for intereſt ſake they make an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Profeſſion of. The <hi>Romiſh</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, to the great Scandal of the World, buſie themſelves in their Schools, in laying open the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that humane acuteneſs may frame againſt the poſſibility of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Incarnation; as if their anſwers grounded upon theſe obſcure princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Faith, could prove evident
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:93255:87"/>
confutations of ſuch Objections, as ſeem to us to rely upon Evidence. I know no ſhorter way than this to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, and thence by degrees to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm; when they teach that the moſt illuminate Angel could not by the meer light of Nature fall into the leaſt ſuſpicion of the poſſibility of an Hypoſtatical Union; do they not give occaſion to the weaker ſort to think that this Myſtery is not only above, but againſt reaſon? Yet I was ſcandaliz'd at nothing more than neither to hear, nor propoſe any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the exiſtency of God, which they pretend not to confute with a ſhow of probability, as if A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm were a probable opinion, which ſeems to be the conſequence of their Doctrine; for though each one claims to a demonſtration of Gods being actually in nature, yet no two do ever agree upon the ſame: what the one affirms, the other denies with equal grounds, as he pretends, from Reaſon: So that by their principles
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:93255:88"/>
they muſt hold it probable that there is no demonſtration of a Soveraign <hi>Being,</hi> which I look upon as a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and a too bold Aſſertion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The only then profitable uſe of <hi>Wit</hi> in ſuch matters of Religion as over-reach our weak Capacity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in <hi>captivating</hi> our Underſtanding by an humble ſubmiſſion to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Univerſal Church.</p>
            <p>As to other inferiour Subjects, I know nothing fitter to improve our Intellectuals, than the Study of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Philoſophy: For it filleth not our Heads with vain and airy Notions, with inſignificant School Terms, and Pedantick Niceties, but aims at the promoting in us of real Knowledge: Yet I am not ſo much out of conceit with the School Doctrine, as to put no value upon it at all. That part of it they call artificial Logick, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend not only to be uſeful, but neceſſary for the quickning of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing Faculty: for I have always obſerved ſuch as underſtand not the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:93255:88"/>
Art of a Syllogiſm, or the <hi>Ariſtotalian</hi> Method of drawing Coherent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, to raiſe often very illegal Inferences, which you can ſcarce make them ſenſible of, becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not acquainted with the general, and particular Laws of a <hi>formal</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; they ſeldom diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween what is concluded <hi>vi formae,</hi> as they ſpeak, and what is only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded <hi>vi materiae.</hi> I mean when a propoſition is eſſentially true, and becauſe of its dependancy upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and only accidentally, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Subject it expreſſeth. Yet I am of opinion that the Analy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Method is to be preferr'd before the Syllogiſtick, becauſe, beſides that the former, mean of analyſie and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution contains, if well manag'd, the Subſtance of the latter; it bringeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with it more Ornaments than is conſiſtent with naked <hi>Enthimema's,</hi> &amp; harſh Syllogyſms. I know not neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs if any of theſe Methods be fit for young Beginners; for I incline much
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:93255:89"/>
to think, that our Imagination, tho' generally ſtronger in our greener years, than our Judgement, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more various and changeable than in our Riper Days, muſt needs firſt of all be brought to ſome degree of conſiſtency: which may eaſily be done by following the cuſtom of ſome Antient Maſters, who would have their Scholars to learn firſt the Mathematicks, as the eaſieſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Demonſtrations both of practical and ſpeculative Geometry; Not ſo much upon the account of the great Evidence of ſuch Sciences, as chiefly becauſe they depend upon Figure and Proportion, two things neceſſary and ſufficient for the fixing of our inconſtant Imaginations.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I have no more to ſay of the uſe of Wit at preſent, except what may regard our familiar and daily Converſations: We are then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect with whom we have to do: For if they be really our Maſters in all ſenſe, or judged generally beyond
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:93255:89"/>
the common reach; whatever abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities we find our ſelves gifted with, we muſt rather keep them cloſe than diſplay them vainly in their preſence, leaſt we ſeem either to think too much of our ſelves, or not enough of them: To whom, as occaſion ſerves, we ought to pay without flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, the Homage due to their grand <hi>Genius's.</hi> If perchance we converſe with thoſe that we judge not ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to our ſelves, we may take more Freedom, but if we are in Company of the duller ſort, we muſt conform our Diſcourſes to their Capacity, and not to our own. For to behave our ſelves otherwiſe, I mean to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in our Converſe with ſuch men, to ſay nothing but what carryeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with it a certain Character of <hi>Wit,</hi> and Sharpneſs, would be a no leſs piece of Folly then, as they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſay, <hi>Projicere Margaritas ante porcos,</hi> to caſt Pearls before Swine becauſe they could neither digeſt, nor be ſenſible of ſuch a Spiritual Food.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:93255:90"/>
I remember upon this occaſion a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of two Gentlemen, who hearing a third ſay, that an Embaſſadour was an <hi>Honourable Spy,</hi> oppoſed warmly this expreſſion, as carrying in its Front an apparent Contradiction, and that an honourable <hi>Spy</hi> could amount to nothing more than an <hi>Honourable Rogue.</hi> Though they ſeem'd to be ingenious enough, yet they could not be made ſenſible of their miſtake, nor conceive ſomewhat of <hi>Wit</hi> in this reflecting way of ſpeaking, and more Senſe too than every mean Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is aware of.</p>

            </argument>
            <p n="1">1. AS I conceive nothing to be of a long continuance that may have an end, ſo I think nothing in rigour perfect, that contains not all Imaginable perfections; I know
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:93255:91"/>
not then why we ſhould call any man perfect, and not rather in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to others leſs Imperfect; ſince the imperfection of Mankind conſiſts not only in the real want of ſeveral perfections, but likewiſe in this, that men are not always capable of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of theſe great Abilities, that God perhaps has beſtowed liberally upon them, which may, and does frequently happen upon ſeveral ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe the perfecteſt Soul in the World is but of a limited Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, and conſequently cannot at all moments apply it ſelf to every Object with an equal attention: For <hi>Pluribus intentus minor eſt ad ſingula Senſus,</hi> the more objects we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of at once, the leſs notice we take of each one in particular. And if it be true that ſome of the Antients, as <hi>Caeſar,</hi> if I miſremember not, could write, ſpeak, and dictate at the ſame time; ſure I am, he could perform neither of the three, with that acuracy,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:93255:91"/>
had he done either of them ſeveral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. 'Tis then the prerogative of a Soveraign being only to underſtand all things equally; the perpetual contemplation of his own eſſence not hindring him from looking into the Secrets of our Hearts, and weighing the leaſt of our Thoughts: Men then even the Wittyeſt ſort, by reaſon of their limited abilities, when too much applyed to one object, ſeem to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get all others: And thus diſcovering their own Weakneſs, become ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Subject of laughter and ſport to thoſe they chance to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with. St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> deſervedly called the Angel of the School, was look't upon as very dull and ſimple, when at the Emperors Table he broke out on a ſuddain into theſe words, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſum eſt contra Manacheos,</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the <hi>Manichees</hi>! Or its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded againſt the <hi>Minachees,</hi> which though reported by ſome as a ſign of his profound Wit, and great Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; I take in the quite contrary,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:93255:92"/>
to be an infallible mark of a very li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Genius, as not being capable of performing two things at the ſame time: But the moſt obſervable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of thoſe Men, we eſteem great Wits, lies here, that they are not only not equally capable of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things at once, but what ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they can do to admiration, they are again within a ſhort time intirely unfit for. Thus a mans converſe will be often charmingly pleaſant, and witty, whom you ſhall find at other times dull and heavy. Which I may in <hi>Second Inſtance</hi> ſuppoſe to proceed from a certain neceſſary, or voluntary Wearyneſs of the Soul: For I ſee no cauſe why it may not fall weary, as well as the Body. The difference only is that the latter becomes weary becauſe of the loſs of its moſt lively parts, the Spirits; the former becauſe of its limited nature, and weak faculties, or rather through a natural deſire of change and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> we are not our ſelves
<pb facs="tcp:93255:92"/>
upon all occaſions, becauſe of our too green and domineering paſſions: whether they be of ſorrow, envy, hatred or anger, which turn all our natural ſharpneſs and Vivacity into malicious contrivances, and fits of Fury. When we have conceived an extream averſion from any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by inveighing againſt him upon all occaſions, we ſhow no more Wit than can be expected from a ſcolding Woman: No wonder then if we ceaſe ſometimes to be ingenious, ſince we are often over-ruled by our undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted paſſions, which overthrow yet more the inward temper of our Souls, than the outward Texture of our Bodies. Nevertheleſs we muſt confeſs that it is not always in our Power, either to ſpeak or write wittily at all times, or with that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy we are really capable of. The Great <hi>Homer</hi> is not always himſelf, but ſometimes of a dull and ſleepy Humour, <hi>Quandoque bonus dormitàt Homerus</hi>; but I underſtand Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:93255:93"/>
better than to wonder at ſuch accidental deficiencies in the greateſt Men, becauſe I am ſenſible of this common, but moſt true Word, <hi>Nemo omnibus horis ſapit,</hi> No man has always his Wits about him. For as the very change of Weather changeth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Temper of our Bodies, ſo it does alter that of our Souls: We ſhall then at ſome Hours of the day both write, and ſpeak eaſily, and wittily too, good ſenſe: At ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, we may ſcratch our heads long enough before we awaken, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive again our almoſt dead Spirits. Which gives me occaſion ſometimes to think, though no juſt grounds, that our Soul is really material, and of a very changeable Texture too, ſince it paſſeth ſo eaſily, and in ſuch a ſhort time from one extream to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For I would conceive in its ſuppos'd Spiritual Nature, a more conſtant and durable Temper. Yet I apprehend that ſeveral things may occaſion in us this accidental dulneſs:
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:93255:93"/>
And firſt, the very Company we converſe with, either we eſteem not enough, or too much. In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer caſe we want encouragement to endeavour to ſhow our Wit, becauſe we think not thoſe we ſpeak to worth our while, or deſerving our peculiar application: In the latter we are kept in awe by a prudent fear of the Cenſure, and inward ſlight of ſuch as we have a high Eſteem, and Veneration for. But as I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more prejudicial to Wit, than Want and Poverty; ſo I conceive thoſe common Sentences, <hi>Ingenii lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitor venter, vexatio dat intellectum, &amp;c.</hi> that Hunger, Vexation and Trouble do make men witty, to be but meer illuſions, and vulgar Errors grounded only upon this, that the very dulleſt of Men in great Straits will make odd ſhifts to rid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the preſent Neceſſity. We muſt needs then confeſs, <hi>Virtutibus Obſtat res auguſta domi, That a light Purſe,</hi> as the <hi>Scots</hi> ſay, makes a <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:93255:94"/>
Heart,</hi> and very unfit to exert thoſe not ordinary Abilities we are perhaps gifted with. Beſides, ſuch is the Nature of Mankind, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome encouragement, or proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of reward, 'tis not in our Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to do our utmoſt endeavours in any enterprize whatſoever.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I pretend to no extraordinary Skill in Phyſick, yet I know no cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable diſtemper; but methinks I could cure, provided I want not the neceſſary encouragements from my Patient, which if you look upon as a piece of Covetouſneſs, you diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more of a cenſuring, than of a ſharp and conſidering Genius: For as it is highly my concern, that you recover your Health by my care. So I cannot but deſire your recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moſt earneſtly, tho' I expected no juſt ſalary for my laudable endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours: Whereby I intend only to give this wholſom advice to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, as much for his concern, as for the Phyſitians intereſt, that if
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:93255:94"/>
he fail to do his duty, 'tis odds if the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, how conſcientious and skilful ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever perform ſucceſsfully his part, not deſignedly, nor through Malice, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch is the natural conſtitution of Men, that they cannot ſerve God himſelf but upon the account of ſome proportionable reward. So if you would have your Phyſitian take notice of every particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of your diſtemper, to apply uſefully his Skill for your recovery, it will be a piece of Wit in you not to let him want too long his due. For elſe it will not be in his Power to make uſe, to your advantage, of that Wit God has given him, becauſe you encourage him not, by doing what he juſtly expects, and may lawfully require. I doubt not but more Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients have periſhed through their own narrowneſs, than by either the Ignorance, or wilful neglect of their Phyſitians.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:93255:95"/>3. I know not why ſome Nations now, as the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and others, produce ſcarce a Wit in an Age, which formerly were in ſo great repute through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole World, but becauſe they are not awakened out of their Lethargy by that powerful inductive to do great things, a proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reward, which may quicken them into life again thoſe, whoſe Wits ſeem to be buryed in their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. So thoſe Princes that are great promoters of Learning, and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Men deſerve from them an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theoſis,</hi> a ſort of Divine Honour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they hold of them the very Life of their Souls, their Wit, by the daily encouragements of their Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Liberalities.</p>
            <p>I muſt in this place remember you, that the greateſt Wits ceaſe ſometimes to give light before the years of Dotage, either becauſe the Organs without which the perfecteſt Soul cannot make us ſenſible of its Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, are corrupted by our irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:93255:95"/>
or perhaps becauſe of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural limitation of Humane Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which could reach no further.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As to the wittyeſt Authors, there is not only a difference among them, ſuch as is between different Stars: But the fame Author is ſometimes ſo unlike unto himſelf, that one would take him to be another. I admire the Firſt Six Books of the <hi>Aenead,</hi> and the Sixth above all. I meet with nothing in all the reſt that deſerves my admiration. <hi>Ovid's</hi> Love-Letters are incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly well done, they are penn'd moſt ſmoothly and wittily; but he negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted himſelf too much in thoſe he wrote in the place of his baniſhment.

not every where beyond reach: the new Philoſophers ſpeak more diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and give more ſenſible Notions of moſt things.

            <p>What I have ſaid of the Antients, I may likewiſe ſay of our Modern Wits. For there are but few of 'em eminent in every thing, and moſt of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:93255:97"/>
them eminent in nothing. But I muſt not end this Section without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving you ſome rational account of this unevenneſs obſervable in moſt may Authors. Firſt then we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to that common anſwer to all ſuch difficulties, the limitation of humane Capacity; but becauſe this is too general, I ſhall ſay ſomething no leſs to the purpoſe, and more particular. I may be allowed then to ſay in Second Inſtance, that our own indiſcretion is commonly the cauſe of this diſorder: For as we never write wittily, but when our Imagination is exalted to a certain degree of heat, deſtructive to our cold dulneſs; ſo when our Spirits are ſpent by a long and ſerious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, it would then prove a piece of prudence in us to lay aſide our Pen, and meditate no more on the Subject till we recover our loſt Spirits, and firſt vigour. I believe <hi>Vigil</hi> kept this Precept, ſince he ſpent neer Thirty years in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:93255:97"/>
of his Poem; but our Folly is ſuch, that black paper we muſt, though our Soul be not able to act its part, becauſe of the ſuppoſed want of Neceſſary Inſtruments, furniſhing us with as lively <hi>Idea's</hi> as before. Which fancyful Humour I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend to be the true Cauſe, why we write not always ſo well as really we could have done, if we had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off our work till the return of our better temper and diſpoſition. Whereof I find a not unfit Analogy in a Subject ſomewhat like to that we now treat of. I ſee no other cauſe of the great difference as to Wit among Children of the ſame Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, but becauſe the latter obſerve not the fitteſt times for the act of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, coming together, when their Seeds are either yet raw, or not ſo elaborated and ſpirituous, as is requiſite. So if marryed People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the critical, and fitteſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute for this duty of Marriage, or would contain themſelves ſo long as
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:93255:98"/>
they were not fit for it, they would undoubtedly be more ſatisfied with their Children, than ſome of them have reaſon to be; becauſe I fancy the former would not be ſo unlike one another, as to the endowments of the Mind. We may proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly diſcourſe at the ſame rate of our Spiritual Children, our <hi>Writings</hi>: They may all reſemble one another in not unlike ſtains of <hi>Wit,</hi> if we manage our ſelves aright in conceiving of them.</p>

            <p n="1">1. IT may be thought not out of purpoſe to enquire in this place
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:93255:99"/>
why ſome do ſpeak ill and write well, and on the contrary, why o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſpeak well, and write ill. The difficulty I confeſs is conſiderable, and I am not fully reſolved in the caſe. Yet it may be ſaid that this proceeds from ſome of the different Characters of Wit we have ſpoken of elſewhere. For ſome are ſlow in conceiving, becauſe, perhaps they have a too weak Underſtanding, and fear too much to be miſtaken; ſo their utterance upon this account is very uneaſie: and ſuch ſpeak their Thoughts ſo imperfectly, that one would think they had but a very ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial Underſtanding. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they are ſometimes excellent Pen-Men, and the fitteſt Men in the World to appear in Print; becauſe the uneaſineſs of their utterance comes rather from a certain warineſs, and Weakneſs perhaps too of the Imagination, than from any real de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Judgement. But as for thoſe that ſpeak well, and write ill; if by
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:93255:99"/>
this expreſſion we mean that ſome do ſpeak great Senſe, who cannot write ſenſefully; I think I may be allowed to ſay, that there is no ſuch thing poſſible. For whoſoever can ſpeak Sence, I know not why he may not likewiſe couch it upon Paper, if he pleaſe. But if perchance we underſtand by ſpeaking well and wittily, a certain facility, eaſineſs of expreſſion, the Volubility of the Tongue, or a certain ſhow of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence without either great Sence, or acuteneſs, there are I confeſs, many half-witted Men, and more yet of the Weaker Sex that ſpeak well, though they write not wittily, becauſe of the ſhallowneſs of their Judgement, which is rather a help than a hindrance to their talkative humour; eſpecially if they have, as commonly they want it not, any quickneſs of Fancy. For ſuch Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, 'tis no leſs uſeleſs to preſcribe Rules of writing wittily, than to teach Fools how to ſpeak to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:93255:100"/>2. The firſt Precept then of this art, I conceive to be no other but the conſideration of the Subject we are to treat of. We muſt in the firſt inſtance conſider if it be not perhaps, beyond the reach of our Abilities: For, <hi>Non omnia poſſumus omnes, Nec om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis fertomnia tellus,</hi> there are but very few equally capable of every thing; Was not <hi>Cicero</hi> the Prince of Orators, but had no inclination towards Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry, wherein <hi>Ovid</hi> was eminent; who again had no other conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Talent we know of. The latter had proved, I fancy, a very ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and leſs perhaps than an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Writer of Plea's, and the former but a dull, uneaſie and conſtrained Poet. Our firſt Study then muſt be of our ſelves, and of our <hi>Genius,</hi> to know, <hi>Quid valeant Humeri, quid ferre recuſant,</hi> what we are really ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of. If then perhaps we are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of our fitneſs for any Science whatſoever, we may be the more daring to write our thoughts indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:93255:100"/>
upon any Subject: But this we cannot certainly know without a frequent Tryal of our Capacity. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, 'tis moſt certain there is ſtill one thing we are fitter for, than for any other, and to this we muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our ſelves more particularly: but it may be here enquired, how ſhall we know what Nature has made us chiefly for? I anſwer, Firſt, almoſt after the ſame manner that we know our Vocation, or Call to any State of life, as to a marryed, or ſingle life; by the very inclination we find in us to this, or that kind of Study, which not being given to us in vain, muſt needs be a ſign of our fitneſs to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed therein. I anſwer Secondly, whatever we do with greateſt faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that undoubtedly we are born to. Thus if I conceive more eaſily whatever depends upon Figure, ſhape and Proportion; or if I can make a Mathematical Demonſtration with leſs difficulty than a Verſe, or a Poem; I ſhall rather apply my ſelf to Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks than to Poetry.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:93255:101"/>3. Now having found out by the foregoing Method what I may with beſt ſucceſs undertake, I muſt then follow theſe particular Rules, and Precepts that regard the Subject I write of. But my chief care ſhall be to peruſe often thoſe that I know certainly to be eminent in that Art, or Science I apply my ſelf to: Thus if I mind to write natural Philoſophy, I ſhall conſult the <hi>Engliſh Philoſopher, Boyle,</hi> or the Famous <hi>Verulam.</hi> Yet without any deſign to plunder or pillage them, for I know nothing more deſtructive to the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Wit, than the ſtealing hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of ſome Writers, who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times make great Volumes of other Mens Labours; which is not ſo much always a ſign of their incapacity, as of their Lazyneſs, and miſtruſt of their own Abilities; if we can be at the pains but to think by our ſelves, and to write nothing but our own thoughts, we may perhaps become at length ſenſible by experience, that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:93255:101"/>
we are nothing inferiour to thoſe, whoſe borrowed Wit we had made our own. 'Tis a great Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Author, when it may be truly ſaid, that what he writes is not borrowed, which is not ſo to be underſtood, as if he ſhould write always things never any dreamt of before him; for this is impoſſible, ſince the <hi>Beaux Eſprits</hi> muſt needs ſometimes jump together by chance, as to the Subſtance, though not as to the Tour, and manner of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. My meaning is, that an ingenious Man ought not to copy out any mans Works, but write his own Thoughts and Meditations, as if he were alone in the World without the help of Books. I know no Author in this Age ſo much ſearcht into as the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Robert Boyle,</hi> and by ſuch as enrich their works with his ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous contrivances though they are neither ſo civil, nor ſo grateful, as to make an Honourable mention of him. <hi>Takenius</hi> has been more guilty
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:93255:102"/>
of this fault than any other that I know of. But to return to what I was ſaying, how can we ever improve that <hi>Wit</hi> God perhaps has beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon us in a larger meaſure than we are aware of, if we never make uſe of it, or exerciſe it, which we do not, though we write every year a Volume, ſo long as we are meer Tranſcribers, and not true Authors. As the <hi>French</hi> do frequently reproach this to the <hi>Germans,</hi> ſo they ſay com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, <hi>Qu'un livre d' Allman, ceſt un livre on il n'y a rien de l' autheur, That there is nothing in a</hi> Germans <hi>Book, of the Author, but his Name.</hi> Which I confeſs ingenuouſly not a few of that Nation to be guilty of. But yet whilſt they put other Mens pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions in room of their own, which perhaps would prove as good, if not better then theirs, they are ſo juſt as to name the Authors with proportionable Elogiums; upon which account I look upon them as publick and profeſt Robbers, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:93255:102"/>
than ſubtile Thieves, which I take to be the Character of the <hi>French</hi> Writers, who ſteal wherever they meet with any thing that may ſerve their turn, and returning no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement to the Author from whom they take they will cunningly, &amp; wittily too, pretend they have ſome reaſon not to acknowledge the theft, as being moulded now into another frame and ſhape; which ſome of them do to the very deceiving of the Author himſelf at the firſt view: and this I reckon to be the height of the <hi>French</hi> Wit, as ſcarce reaching to the invention of any thing, but perhaps of new modes: For this Nation is now ſo us'd to plunder, and pillage their Neighbours, that if they lay aſide what they have ſtoln out of <hi>Spaniſh, Italian, German</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Books, what is properly their own, would not make a very large Volume.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Being then fully reſolved to be Authors, rather than either Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers with the <hi>Germans,</hi> or Thieves
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:93255:103"/>
with the <hi>French</hi>; we ſhall conceive firſt a general deſign, whereunto all the particulars of the piece muſt be either directly, or indirectly related: But though I eſteem a mean Author more than either a <hi>German Robber,</hi> or a <hi>French Thief</hi>; yet I do allow thoſe following uſes of other Mens Labours: Firſt I may, and ought to peruſe them for the quickning of my fancy, and for the acquiring of what we call, a <hi>Style,</hi> or an accurate and polite elocution; not that we ought to borrow their <hi>witty Words, Leurs bons mots:</hi> For 'tis better to utter our ſelves in our own language, than to ſpeak in other Mens terms: But my meaning is, that the peruſal of what they have written, whether it regard our Subject or not, may by heightning our Imagination, hinder us from a too flat way of writing. Thus if I mind to write an Elegy, I <gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hall firſt run over ſome choice piece <gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:93255:103"/>
ſome Paſſages of <hi>Cicero, Virgil, Livy, &amp;c.</hi> before I undertake to write a <hi>Latine</hi> Oration, an Hiſtory, or Poem. The ſame advice is to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, what Language ſoever we write in, whether it be <hi>French</hi> or <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh.</hi> If the Authors we peruſe have written upon the ſame Subject, we muſt endeavour to improve what they have ſaid, or confute their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors that deſerve to be taken notice of: wherein we are to take heed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things not to be too poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, as if we pretended to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate every thing we ſay; for this would betray us to be none of the moſt knowing ſort: For I think it no Paradox to ſay, that the very things we are ſure of, and hold for undoubted Truths, we can no more prove by the Light of an undeniable Demonſtration, than what we look upon as meer Opinions, and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Conjectures. For ſince I know nothing but by the help of my falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and often failing Senſes; how
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:93255:104"/>
do I know but I am impos'd upon by the very things I think, I touch, I feel, I hear. This affirmative way of debating may be allowed in the Schools, where the conceived infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Maſters is neceſſary, both for gaining and conſerving their Credit among their Scholars; but it muſt be avoided, <hi>cane pejus &amp; angue,</hi> above all things by a ſober, witty and judicious Writer. This neceſſary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration is obſervable every where in the Works of the renowned <hi>Boyle</hi>: I do certainly believe he thinks more before he ſays, <hi>ſuch a thing perhaps is,</hi> than others do before they poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm, it is undoubtedly ſo.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Obſcurity is another defect we muſt be careful to ſhun, ſince, <hi>prima virtus orationis perſpicuitas eſt,</hi> the chief and moſt neceſſary Ornament of any diſcourſe, is it perſpicuity and clearneſs. I have a very ill opinion of a mans Capacity, when whatever he writes is a miſtery to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſort: Yet I ſhall be ſo far
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:93255:104"/>
favourable to the <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> as to think there may be ſome real ſecrets, and Myſteries known only to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which they will not reveal to others. But I muſt beg their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, if I incline more to believe their affected Obſcurity to be nothing elſe but a Childiſh vanity, or rather a ſpecious Nonſence, propoſed to the World in obſcure Terms, in order to gain Credit among the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant ſort of Men, who commonly admire nothing more than what they leaſt underſtand. This defect is juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproacht by the New Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers to the <hi>Peripateticians,</hi> and to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> himſelf, eſpecially in his defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions where perſpicuity is moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and is moſt neceſſary.</p>
            <p>I ſhall inſtance ſome few examples for proof of what I ſay. If then you ask <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> the nature of what we call a <hi>quality,</hi> he ſhall give you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly this miſterious definition, <hi>Qualitas eſt aqua quales quidam dicun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> I know not how either to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:93255:105"/>
or make ſenſe of this obſcure Notion; but 'tis all one as if you had defin'd white to be that whereby we are made white. I am ſure every ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Man underſtands better what <hi>move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is, than its definition given by <hi>Ariſtotle, Actus entis in potentia qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus in p<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tentia,</hi> which beſides its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, far beyond that of the thing it intends to clear, is, Firſt, ſuch a piece of Nonſence, that I defie any man in the World to make intelligible <hi>Engliſh</hi> of it, without a large Comment; and Secondly, it contains an evident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in <hi>adjecto,</hi> as they ſpeak, in the very terms: Since the former words, <hi>astus entis in potentia,</hi> are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together inconſiſtent with the latter, <hi>Quatenus in potentia. Locus,</hi> or place, we undoubtedly conceive better, than what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, in order to furniſh us with a clear Notion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: For I thought always I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in ſome meaſure what it was, till I heard <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> call it, <hi>Superficies prima acris ambientis immobilis,</hi> the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:93255:105"/>
immoveable ſurface of the ambient Air. Now my weak head is full of endleſs doubts, and I underſtand no more what I underſtood ſome thing of before, by its own ſelf-evidence; for firſt I underſtand not how the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Air is immoveable: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, I know not why a Body a Stone, for inſtance, in <hi>vacuo,</hi> ſhould be no where, becauſe it is not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with Air. I apprehend Thirdly, the Natural place of every thing to be nothing elſe but the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary and immoveable ſpace that it fills with its three Dimenſions, depth, breadth and length, which <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle's</hi> definition makes no mention of.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay nothing of that other Notion of his relating to <hi>Time,</hi> which he calls, <hi>Motus ſecundum prius &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterius,</hi> that is literally, and <hi>verba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim, a movement</hi> according to what is before, <hi>and according to what is behind,</hi> what more clear? <hi>Auditum admiſſi riſum teneatis amici.</hi> But to ſpeak ingenuouſly; all this argues
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:93255:106"/>
no defect of Capacity in <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> but only betrays him to be guilty of attempting I ſhall not ſay preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to give us exact definitions of things that are above the reach of Humane Capacity; ſuch as <hi>Time, Place, Movement, &amp;c.</hi> becauſe they are primary Principles, whereof we may give perhaps, ſome imperfect Deſcriptions, but no true Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>We are not only to ſhun obſcurity in our definitions, which ought to be always ſelf-evident to any man, underſtanding the terms they are conceived in, but likewiſe in every particular Word, and Sentence, if it can be avoided. For I take it to be a vulgar, and a ſilly error, that great Wits are commonly obſcure, miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and cloudy; becauſe, as I am fully perſwaded that perſpicuity is the chief, and moſt neceſſary Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Diſcourſe, ſo I conceive it to be the beſt Character of a true Wit. We muſt then give to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:93255:106"/>
we write, all the Evidence, and plaineſs the Subject can bear, which we ſhall perform the more eaſily, if we ſhun with all poſſible care a too great multitude of ſuperfluous Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, as likewiſe Subjects, that are not only hard to be underſtood, but which no Humane Capacity can compaſs. A too great affectation of harſh and hard Words, of far fetcht Expreſſions is juſtly condemned by the Polite and wittieſt ſort of Writers: For ſince Words are the Images of our thoughts, we muſt make choice of thoſe that are their beſt repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives. Whatever then is made uſe of in common diſcourſe by ſuch as ſpeak well, and naturally, that is fitteſt for us to make choice of. Thus our Style ſhall be ſmooth, natural and eaſie, without either obſcurity, or that miſterious Nonſenſe that ſome weak Heads naturally incline to; and is termed by the <hi>French, du Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limathias.</hi> But I know nothing that may contribute more towards the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:93255:107"/>
clearneſs, and ſmoothing of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, then a fit and ingenious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, not more inſiſted on than is neceſſary, nor too frequent. The <hi>Engliſh Philoſopher,</hi> I mean the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Boyle,</hi> underſtands better than any I ever yet read, the art of illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating, and proving too, what he affirms by witty and natural compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons. As his Style is every where ſmooth and clear; I know no better Maſter of natural Philoſophy, not only upon the account of his Doctrine and ingenious Solutions of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt difficulties, but likewiſe for his extraordinary perſpicuity and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

            </argument>
            <p n="1">1. SOme, who make it their whole buſineſs to inveigh againſt Women, though perhaps they be not quite out of conceit with them, may be apt to think that they are rather
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:93255:108"/>
naturally wilful, than Witty; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, perhaps, they were made of one of <hi>Adams</hi> Bones, and not of his Brains; yet 'tis certain they may claim a juſt right to it as well as Men, and ſometimes to wiſdom too; The coldneſs of their Temper is no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to me of their ſtupidity or dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for beſides, that the melancholly, though cold, are commonly ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, This ſuppos'd coldneſs of their temper is often corrected by ſuch a degree of heat, as may improve them into real Wits. Their Bodies, I confeſs, are not of ſo cloſe a texture as thoſe of Men, as being both ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and more moiſt: But in all this I ſee nothing inconſiſtent with their being really witty. And if we are not convinced as yet of this ſelf-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent truth by reaſon, daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may eaſily clear all our doubts. Speak they not to the purpoſe in a familiar converſe, and as good Senſe as moſt Men; yea, ſome of them can act the Philoſophers part, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:93255:108"/>
Books, and write Verſes too, not very impertinently. And if we will ſpeak our mind impartially, they have ſomewhat more of a ſuddain, and extemporary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wit than Men themſelves, who can ſpeak Sence, but after Meditation; whereas they talk ſometimes to the purpoſe, without being at the pains of much thinking. Shall we doubt of their acuteneſs, if we reflect but a moment upon their quick Reparties, in certain Rencounters, where in Men are like <hi>Equus, &amp; Aſinus quibus non eſt intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectus,</hi> as dumb as Beaſts: And if the beauty of the Soul be proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that of the Body; we have reaſon to think that as they exceed our Sex in the former, ſo they have ſome conſiderable advantage over us in the latter too, whereof they give ſometimes but too certain proofs by circumventing, and impoſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Greateſt Head pieces amongſt Men; which is nothing elſe but an ill uſe of a very good thing, their
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:93255:109"/>
Wit. <hi>Sampſon</hi> could neither be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, nor out-witted by the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> but ſubtiler <hi>Dalila</hi> put a cheat upon him, that coſt him at laſt his life. <hi>Solomon</hi> was the wiſeſt Man of the Age he lived in, yet he was prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon by the forcible perſwaſions of his Concubines to adore falſe Gods. <hi>Abigail</hi> with a ſhort <hi>Harrangue</hi> triumph'd over <hi>David</hi>'s warlike re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions. And <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf could not reſiſt the Rethorick of his Wife <hi>Eve,</hi> but ſubmitted to her as to his Maſter. So true it is that Women have out-witted the greateſt men in all ages, and for ought I know, the World turns yet round at their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. But nothing ſheweth more their Wit, than their ſubtile man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement of intrigues, whether of Love or Revenge; for they can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble better than Hypocriſie it ſelf, and put what Face they pleaſe upon their Secret, and real Deſigns. I ſhall ſet down here on this occaſion what happened in <hi>France</hi> not many years
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:93255:109"/>
ago, as being a true Fact, and no Romance; though becauſe of the oddneſs of the thing, it looks ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like one.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When the <hi>French</hi> King invaded <hi>Holland</hi> in the year 72. if I miſremem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not, the Nobility, as 'tis uſual on ſuch occaſions, followed him by his expreſs Comand from all parts of the Kingdom: A Gentleman of a mean Fortune, but of Good Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, in obedience to his Soveraign, and beſides incouraged by a promiſe of ſome conſiderable Preferment, reſolved to leave his Lady, being marryed but Three Months before, and to hazard his life for the increaſe of his ſmall Fortune. But whether he was not very <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xorious,</hi> or which I am more apt to believe, had bin wholly taken up with Military Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, he never in the ſpace of Five years abſence inform'd her once what condition he was in. She began then to ſuſpect him killed in ſome rencounter. But all her doubts
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:93255:110"/>
were at length cleared by a Letter ſhe received from one of his intimate Friends, who was very well infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of his continual Silence all the while of this long abſence. He aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured her then by his Letter of her Husbands death, becauſe he judged his recovery out of a Diſtemper he was then in, impoſſible. He added, that he was coming to preſent her with her Husbands Diamond Ring, as a part of his laſt Will, and a mark of his moſt ſincere Love and Affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her: And accordingly not thinking that his Friend could reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſets forward for <hi>France.</hi> He failed not at his arrival to preſent the Lady with the Ring, and at the ſame time with his Sevice, if perchance ſhe diſlik't him not, as he profeſt he did not diſlike her. She ſeem'd, as Women commonly do upon ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, to be ſomewhat ſhy at firſt, and ſurprized at his unexpected offer. But weary now of a ſolitary Life, and fearing ſhe ſhould not meet with
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:93255:110"/>
ſo good an opportunity again, ſhe thought it a piece of Prudence to lay hold on it; and ſo being at her Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, as ſhe thought, ſhe engaged within a few days to this Second Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; who not uſing her near ſo kindly, as the firſt, though, as it ſhall appear hereafter, ſhe never really lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him neither; ſhe began to wiſh for a change, and that it would pleaſe God to rid her of this Husband as he had already delivered her of the Firſt when he recovering unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly out of that Diſtemper, his Friend, but now his Rival, had left him in without any hopes of recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, comes on a ſuddain home, not knowing any thing of his wifes ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Marriage. Being ſoon infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the whole matter, and how innocently it had happened on her ſide, he appeared to be ſomewhat ſatisfied, and told her that he wa<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Husband, and however that the Law
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:93255:111"/>
would right him in this caſe. It was accordingly ordered that ſhe ſhould leave her ſecond Husband, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the firſt again, wherewith ſhe appeared to be well ſatisfied, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of her hard uſage from her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Husband: They liv'd then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while together very contentedly, and he doted on her more than ever he did when he was firſt marryed: She failed not to uſe him likewiſe with all imaginable kindneſs, which ſo gain'd his heart, that he could not croſs her in any thing; yea, not in ſuch things as were neither lawful nor allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. As he was ſtill highly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned if any thing ſhould diſpleaſe her, or put her in a melancholly temper, he inquired of her one day why ſhe appeared to be ſomewhat dejected; how can I be other, replyed ſhe, ſince I know certainly that you are in a greater danger then ever you was in the <hi>Holland</hi> Wars, becauſe my ſecond pretended Husband, as I am credibly inform'd, is reſolved to
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:93255:111"/>
murther you, that he may enjoy me again. I hear indeed he is going for <hi>Burgundy,</hi> but I know he will make but a ſhort ſtay there. So you may eaſily judge, that loving you as tenderly as I do, I ſhall never have a moment of Reſt either by Night or Day, till I be rid of my too well grounded fear, by preventing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way this deſigned blow, which at once would kill two, and be the occaſion of a deſerved, though ſhameful death to a third, the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner himſelf, your Rival: Her Husband being extreamly ſurpriſed at this diſcourſe, knew not what to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve upon; but being near concern'd in the caſe, and loving her more than his life, he took a ſuddain reſolution to do whatever ſhe would put him upon. This ſubtile Lady taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this yielding humour he was in, ſpoke to him thus again, or to this effect; you ſeem to be in doubt what you have to do: You muſt then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, for I know your Rivals Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:93255:112"/>
and there is no middle, either to kill or be killed, and all wiſe men, methinks, will prefer the former be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the latter: Now becauſe I cannot ſuffer you to expoſe your ſelf to the leaſt hazard, I ſhall furniſh you this Night with the fitteſt Opportunity that can be deviſed of doing your ſelf, and me too, a moſt important piece of Service. Your Rival then will come about Six of the Clock, as he hath given me notice by a Letter, to take his leave of me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his departure for <hi>Burgundy</hi>; which civility I ſhall not only admit, but invite him likewiſe in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to Supper, under pretence of a pretended Reconciliation to be made up between him and you. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman comes as he had promis'd, and yielded with all his heart to their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil offers, being now almoſt fully perſwaded, that as in <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> he had had all things in Common with his Friend, this jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture would furniſh him with an
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:93255:112"/>
overture to the like privacy at home, which was all that he either aim'd at, or car'd for. Before the Gentleman came to take his leave of the Lady, they had contrived, and agreed upon the manner of his Death, which was to preſs upon him ſeveral Healths, and when he ſhould be almoſt inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of what was doing about him, to diſſolve ſome Strong and Heady <hi>Soporifick</hi> in his Wine, that ſo they might the more eaſily ſtrangle him, the Servants being firſt diſpatcht out of doors upon pretended Errants. The murther thus executed without reſiſtance or noiſe; the Lady took after this manner her meaſures for concealing this horrid fact, and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Body from the eyes of the World. She deſired her Husband to take it upon his ſhoulders, while ſhe would bear up the Legs upon hers for his greater eaſe in carrying it. Thus they went quietly along toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about Midnight by a back door through the Garden, ſtraight to the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:93255:113"/>
River that waſh't the very walls thereof: But as they were thus in their March, the Lady tyed dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly in more than one part, the dead Mans Cloaths with thoſe of her living Husbands, which he, as being intent upon the compleating of the buſineſs, could neither miſtruſt, nor be ſenſible of. They were come near to the River, when ſhe told him to go as near as he could, and being now upon the very brink of the precipice, ſhe moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifully thruſt him over, and ſo both headlong down together into the River. Thus ſhe got her ſelf rid of both her Husbands at once, whom it ſeems ſhe had equally dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik't. It may be yet ſomewhat to my purpoſe to tell you, that being returned home, ſhe made a great ſtir among her Servants, as if ſhe had known nothing of the matter, and ask't them often if they had not met with her Husband and the other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, for that ſhe fear'd they had
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:93255:113"/>
challenged one another, and had gone to ſome remote place agreed upon, to put an end by the Sword to their old Quarrels: But though this was for a while the general opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Town, the two Bodies being found two Months after by ſome Fiſher-men bound together, and the Lady being upon ſuſpicion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and according to the Laws of that Country, in ſuch doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful caſes, threatned with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Tortures, if ſhe would not confeſs her crime: She made at length a full diſcovery of the whole matter: And ſuffered by the order of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice what ſhe had well deſerved an, infamous Death.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let us make here but this one reflection: Could there be a greater wickedneſs than this, and at the ſame time a greater abuſe of Wit; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we ſee clearly that this weaker Sex has nothing of real Weakneſs when they reſolve upon a deſign, whether bad, as this was, or good, as that
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:93255:114"/>
of <hi>Judith,</hi> who in my judgement cheated not <hi>Holofernes</hi> ſo ſubtilely out of his life, as this Woman did her two Husbands out of theirs.</p>
            <p>I pretend not by this diſcourſe to puff Women up with Pride, for they are but too proud already; my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign only is to ſhow that they ought not to be undervalued by Men, as if they were little better than Fools, and had no kind of real Wit; ſince their very Malice and Tricks do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the contrary. But never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, though it may be allowable to call ſome Women fine Wits, becauſe of ſome peculiar vivaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they are gifted with; yet few of them can pretend to be great Wits, ſuch a Character requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a conſtant temper of the Soul, which they, becauſe of their changeable humour, are not capable of. I ſhall not perhaps be juſtly ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led impertinent, if I ſay, that ſince Wit depends moſt upon the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Souls, they have not received
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:93255:114"/>
from God ſo perfect Souls as Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by Gods ſpecial appointment they are to obey, and Men to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; they are to be Servants, and Men their Maſters: Now 'tis conformable to the Wiſdom of that <hi>all wiſe being,</hi> that as they are inferiour to us by the condition of their State, ſo they ſhould be likewiſe far ſhort of Men, as to the innate endowments of the Mind. Yet I deny not but that God may, and does ſometimes lodge a Soul of the Firſt <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> I mean a moſt perfect one in a Womans body; but this is not uſual, and ſeldom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, but when he pleaſes to make choice of Women to rule over great Empires, and whole Nations, which hinders not the generality of them, from falling far ſhort of thoſe emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent abilities that men are deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed for. I conceive the <hi>French</hi> to be more ſenſible of the truth of this Doctrine than moſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations, becauſe by their <hi>Salick</hi> Law, Women can claim no right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:93255:115"/>
them to the Soveraign com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. I ſhall not ſay, it would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, prove to our great advantage, to put the ſame affront upon them by giving place to this Law amongſt us; but ſure I am that <hi>England</hi> would be no more a Purgatory for Men, as it is commonly ſaid to be, and would not ceaſe neither to be a Paradiſe for Women, if the <hi>Salick Law</hi> were once eſtabliſhed in every private Houſe and Family of this Kingdom.</p>

Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting again upon our corruptibel
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:93255:116"/>
Bodies, my Thoughts are put to a ſtand, when I am preſt to give a rational account either of their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, or diſtempers. Yet if I pretend to be but an ordinary Phyſitian, I muſt have a ſort of comprehenſive Knowledge of this Engine, our Soul moves, and of all its particular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; which being upon ſeveral ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts an inſuperable difficulty, what wonder if the ableſt Phyſitians miſtake not only ſometimes a mans diſtemper, but which is of a worſe conſequence, take ſometimes one for another: Becauſe two different Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes may have ſuch an affinity in their Symptoms, that they can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to no infallibility in diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing them. On the other ſide, when I conſider the obſcure Origine of moſt Diſtempers, I am quite out of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour with the Practice of Phyſick. I may but too eaſily miſtake that, without the Knowledge of which I cannot cure my <hi>Patient,</hi> the true cauſe of his diſeaſe; yea, I wonder
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:93255:117"/>
how any Man dare venture to ſtudy Phyſick, if he peruſe but a moment <hi>Hypocrates</hi> his firſt Aphoriſm, <hi>Vita longa, ars brevis, occaſio celeris, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum difficile, judicium periculoſum,</hi> Our life is too ſhort, and the Art is of an infinite extent, the occaſion gives us eaſily the ſlip; the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is hard, doubtful and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and it is not eaſie to diſcern well, either the Remedies, or the Diſtempers: We can have then but little certainty of the Cure, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if we take notice of what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the ſame Aphoriſm, <hi>Oportet autem non modo ſeipſum exhibere quae oportet facientem, ſed etiam aegrum ac praeſentes, &amp; externa,</hi> that the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents Recovery depends not only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Phyſitians care and skill, but no leſs upon the Patient himſelf, who muſt contribute towards his own cure by an exact ſubmiſſion, and ſcrupulous performance of what he is order'd to do, take, or obſerve. And beſides, all our endeavours are
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:93255:117"/>

Out of all this diſcourſe I raiſe the ſame inference that made my firſt propoſition in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Section, That there is no ſmall difficulty to become a good Phyſitian; yet on the other part, one would think that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more eaſie, becauſe of the great number of Phyſitians to be met with every where, whom we know in all other reſpects to be but meer Blockheads. If the Knowledge of Phyſick were a thing ſo hard to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to, and beyond the common reach, could either a Taylor, or a Shoemaker, and the reſt of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned Tribe practice Phyſick, as able and Famous Doctors. I confeſs if there were no more required to be a Phyſitian than what the leſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding ſort, or the <hi>Mobile</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:93255:118"/>
to be neceſſary, the whole World might ſoon be turn'd into a Colledge of Phyſitians: It is not then the Knowledge of a Receit, or two not unſucceſsful on ſome, or ſeveral occaſions that give us right to this honourable Tittle, nor the art of making up this or that Phyſical Compoſition, unleſs we will fooliſhly reckon up old doting Wives, and Apothecaries Prentices, with the ableſt Doctors. Yea, I maintain it to be no Paradox to ſay, that a man may comprehend perfectly the whole <hi>Materia medica,</hi> and an hundred good Remedies againſt every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Diſtemper, and yet prove a very inſignificant, and ignorant Phyſitian too. Becauſe the chief Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of Phyſick conſiſts not in the goodneſs of the Remedy, but in the due application thereof, with regard to time, place, the Temper of the Patient, and other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Who underſtands this, and no other, is a true Phyſitian, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:93255:118"/>
capable to cure the worſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, by not very odd, nor far fetcht Remedies. Whether there be any <hi>Panicea's,</hi> or univerſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies againſt all ſort of diſtempers, I ſhall not here examine; but ſure I am that <hi>Opium</hi> perhaps for diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of pain excepted; there are no ſuch found as yet: and though there were any of this Latitude, I would ſtill look upon them as meer Inſtruments that may miſcarry by the unskilfulneſs of thoſe that handle them. I am then ſenſible that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral are quite miſtaken, when they complain that ſuch a Remedy did wrong their Bodies, or increaſe their Diſtempers, whereas the Phyſitian only is to be blamed; who, tho' he preſcribed a thing in it ſelf very good, neither underſtood the criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Minute it was to be given in, nor his Patients conſtitution, nor other Circumſtances which we muſt needs take notice of, elſe we may preſcribe the beſt remedies to no
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:93255:119"/>
purpoſe. A Phyſitians Wit then ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in framing modiſh Receits, and preſcribing a numberleſs num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Remedies, whether <hi>Chimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> or <hi>Galenical,</hi> but in a certain pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical judgement, which is not got in the Univerſities, of applying what is fitteſt for the cure of the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, with regard to time, place, the ſtrength of the Patient, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Circumſtances. I look there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon ſuch as ſell Secrets againſt all ſorts of diſtempers, to be meer Cheats; becauſe if their Remedies be indeed <hi>Panacea's,</hi> or Univerſal, this Character I allow not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal to them, but meerly extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal, as derived from the practical Judgement of ſuch as preſcribe them ſucceſsfully, which as they cannot ſell, nor communicate, neither can they either ſell, or communicate their Secret: Hence we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude what a piece of imprudence, or rather madneſs it is, to take Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies from the hands of meer Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricks,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:93255:119"/>
without the advice of ſome Judicious Phyſitian; becauſe, as I was ſaying lately, our recovery de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not ſo much upon the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Remedy, as upon a due application thereof. For we are taught both by reaſon, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that we may either kill or cure with the ſame Remedy diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently applyed, and to different Subjects, or not in the ſame Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>

            </argument>
            <p n="1">1. ONe would think that there is no great Wit, nor no very much art neither, in making of a good Tranſlation; but how far they are deceived, we may eaſily conjecture by the infinite number of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:93255:120"/>
bad Tranſlations done in this City: For as an Ingenious Gentleman did lately obſerve, ſome of the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors underſtand not the Language they Tranſlate from, others under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not the Language they Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate into, and others again under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not the Subject they tranſlate: What wonder then if they fall not only often very ſhort of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, but beſides furniſh the World with ſuch imperfect Copies, as may ruine the repute of the Authors, in the judgement of thoſe that know them not. I conceive then, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire in a ingenious Tranſlator ſuch parts, as I fear we ſhall meet with but in a very ſmall Number. We muſt not then think that a man is qualified to make, for Inſtance, a good <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Verſion out of <hi>French,</hi> becauſe he has ſtayed a year or two, or if you pleaſe, ſome years in <hi>France,</hi> unleſs he underſtand the very Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſim, and Tour of the Language, which can ſcarce be attained to
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:93255:121"/>
but by thoſe who have been bred up from their greener years among the Politeſt ſort of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and beſides, have made good uſe of their time by writing, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, converſing, reading, and all ſuch exerciſes as are the fitteſt for acquiring the perfect Knowledge of any Language. 'Tis then a piece of Simplicity in ſome Bookſellers to make their application for the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlating of <hi>French</hi> Books, to ſuch as have been but a year or two in <hi>France,</hi> or which is yet worſe, have never ſtirr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d from home; tho' I grant they may by their private Study underſtand in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the French Tongue, yet I am ſure that they never conceive aright the whole Energy, Pith and Delicacy of the Phraſe; the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whereof is ſo neceſſary, that without it, the verſion cannot but be very imperfect, and to the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Author. Moſt of thoſe <gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat tranſlate Novels being ſenſible
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:93255:121"/>
of their inſufficiency as to this part, paſs by, and ſupply what they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not by ſome irregular Fancy of their own, and ſometimes not very much fitted for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. I conceive then the Art of Tranſlating to be like unto that of Portraying. He is a very mean Painter, who can but repreſent the meer Lineaments, and external Shape of a Mans Face. The chief Secret of this Art conſiſts in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to life the very Soul it ſelf; I mean, in repreſenting the very Air, Temper, Humour and Complection. For a Man is not drawn to Life, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the moſt habitual indiſpoſition of his Soul ſhine in the Piece. So I may proportionably ſay, to turn <hi>French</hi> into flat <hi>Engliſh</hi> preciſely, is not beyond the reach of the meaneſt Capacity; but it is a piece of harder work than the unexperienc'd are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of, to repreſent the Original to life: This requires, beſides a ripe Judgement, an extraordinary quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:93255:122"/>
of the Imagination, with an eaſie and ingenious utterance. And here I think it is not amiſs to enquire in which of the two languages the Tranſlator ought to excel, whether in that he tranſlates from, or in that he tranſlates into. I think it then no paradox to aſſert a perfect Knowledge of the former to be more neceſſary than that of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: my reaſon is, becauſe if I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand never ſo well the Tour, for inſtance, of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>; this will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail me but little, if I comprehend not that of the <hi>French</hi> likewiſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with its whole Energy and Pith, for without this foreſaid Knowledge I ſhall never be able to make a true and Natural Copy of the Original, how Politely ſoever I do write in <hi>Engliſh.</hi> For a good <hi>Engliſh Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> conſiſts not in the goodneſs of the Language, abſolutely conſidered in it ſelf, but reſpectively to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal, which it muſt repreſent and equal, if poſſible, in all Senſe. On
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:93255:122"/>
the other ſide, though I underſtand not ſo eminently the Language the Verſion is done into, yet if I be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Language the Orignal is written in, I ſhall be capable of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlating it exactly and well. For in this caſe I ſhall be ſenſible of the leaſt expreſſion that ſhall fall ſhort of my Author, and ſo with a little more application I may reach him at length by changing the Phraſe or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, which is not very uneaſie to do, till comparing the Original with the Copy, I find them nothing inferiour to each other, or rather as near as poſſibly they can be. A good Tranſlator then may in ſo me reſpect be as much eſteemed, as the Author himſelf: For ſure I am that ſometimes the ingenious ſort find it a harder Task to tranſlate, than to write, or to invent themſelves; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is eaſier, no doubt, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our own thoughts, then thoſe of other Mens, which are often none of the cleareſt. Their obſcurity
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:93255:123"/>
ſometimes prove a lawful excuſe for our miſtakes, but we can, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no pretence, ſhun a juſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved confuſion, if through our own ignorance we quite abuſe and miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent our Authors. I fear he was of this number who tranſlated, <hi>Le pont Euxine,</hi> the <hi>Euxine Bridge,</hi> in lieu of the <hi>Euxine</hi> or Black Sea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Moeotis</hi> and <hi>Tenedos,</hi> as alſo that other, who tranſlates thus the receit of an eminent Phyſitian, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulveris panonici Rubri, &amp;c. take of the Powder of Red Cloath Two Ounces,</hi> as if <hi>Panonicus</hi> was derived from the <hi>Latine</hi> Word <hi>Pannus,</hi> Cloath, and not from <hi>Pannonia,</hi> the name of a Country.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I ſhall in this place take notice of what but few perhaps reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that as the living Languages of <hi>Europe</hi> are but <hi>Jargons</hi> compared to the <hi>Latine,</hi> ſo all Books done out of <hi>French, Spaniſh, Italian, &amp;c.</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Latine</hi> by an accurate, and Polite Pen, and in a true and Natural Style,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93255:123"/>
are always far beyond the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: becauſe this Language carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth along with it a certain Energy that no other reacheth. I ſhall give you a proof of what I ſay by tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting theſe enſuing Verſes to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to you the wide difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe two Languages. The Four firſt were penn'd by a Man more eſteemed by ſome than he deſerves. The Anſwer was made by an Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> and a Famous Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, of whom I have ſpoken ſeveral times in this Treatiſe.</p>
