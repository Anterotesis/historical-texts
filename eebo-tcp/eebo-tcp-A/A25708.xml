         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>God's Grace is infinitely better with our Sufferings, then our Peace could bee with our ſins. <hi>p.</hi> 5. 19.</p>
            <p>As our ſins turn Antidotes into poiſon, ſo God's Grace turn's poiſon into Antidotes. <hi>p.</hi> 5. 22.</p>
            <p>No man who will avoid inconveniences of State, by Acts of ſo high injuſtice, as no pulick convenience can expiate, or compenſate, is worthie to bear the name and place of GOD on earth. <hi>p.</hi> 7. 20.</p>
            <p>It is a bad exchange to wound a man's own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thereby to ſalv State-ſores: to calm the ſtorms of popular diſcontents, by ſtirring up a tempeſt in a man's own boſom. <hi>p.</hi> 7. 25.</p>
            <p>An upright Magiſtrate is more afraid to take away anie man's life unjuſtly, then to loſe his own. <hi>p.</hi> 10. 24.</p>
            <p>Juſtice, which is the will of God, ought to bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before all contrarie Clamors, which are but the diſcoveries of men's injurious wills. <hi>p.</hi> 11. 22.</p>
            <p>A Prince ought not for anie reaſon of State, to go againſt the reaſon of his Conſcience: which is highly to ſin againſt the God of Reaſon, and Judg of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. <hi>p.</hi> 11, 27.</p>
            <p>The Spirit of God ſubject's the Will of a Prince to none but the light of Reaſon, Juſtice and Religion, which ſhine's in his Soul. <hi>p.</hi> 12. 4.</p>
            <p>No preſent importunitie, or popular vindications will bee ſubterfuge ſufficient to reſcue men guiltie of evil machinations from the exact tribunals of God and their conſciences. <hi>p.</hi> 15. 3.</p>
            <p>In obſtructions of of Juſtice among men, wee muſt religiouſly appeal to God and men's own Conſciences, as beeing an argument to us Chriſtians of that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unavoidable judgment which ſhal re-judg, what among men is but corruptly decided or not at all. <hi>p.</hi> 15. 7.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:99455:3"/>Afflictions cannot bee eſteemed (with wiſe and godly men) anie argument of ſin in an innocent perſon, more then the Impunitie of wicked men is, among good men, anie ſure token of their innocencie. <hi>pag.</hi> 16. <hi>li.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>As it is one of the moſt convinceing arguments that there is a God, while his power ſett's bounds to the raging of the Sea: ſo 'tis no leſs, that Hee reſtrein's the madneſs of the people. Nor doth anie thing portend more God's diſpleaſure againſt a Nation then when Hee ſuffer's the confluence and clamors of the Vulgar to paſs all boundaries of Laws, and reverence to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie. <hi>p.</hi> 17. 7.</p>
            <p>Good men had rather want anie thing they moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, for the publick good, then obtein it by unlawful and irreligious means. <hi>p.</hi> 19. 7.</p>
            <p>The juſt Avenger of all diſorders often make's men ſee their ſin in the glaſs of their puniſhment. 'Tis more then an even-lay, that guiltie men may one day ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs puniſhed by that way they offended. <hi>p.</hi> 22. 29.</p>
            <p>God order's our diſorders: and magnifie's his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and mercie, when our follies and miſeries are moſt diſcovered. <hi>p.</hi> 23. 30</p>
            <p>Our ſins are the Tumults of our Souls againſt our God. <hi>p.</hi> 24. 10.</p>
            <p>What man cannot, or will not repreſs, the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Juſtice can and will. <hi>p.</hi> 21. 30.</p>
            <p>Reaſon ſett's bounds to our Paſſions, Truth to Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, Laws duly executed to Sedition, Charitie to Schiſms. <hi>p.</hi> 25. 4.</p>
            <p>A man that know's the ſinceritie and uprightneſs of his own heart, although hee may ſeem leſs a Politician to men, yet hee need's no ſecret diſtinctions or evaſions before God. <hi>p.</hi> 30. 9.</p>
            <p>As manie Kingdoms as the Devil ſhewed our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and the Glorie of them (if they could bee at once enjoied) are not worth the gaining by the waies of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

ingratitude and diſhonor, which hazard's a Soul worth more worlds, then this hath kingdoms. <hi>p.</hi> 30. 9.</p>
            <p>God's All diſcerning Juſtice ſee's through all the diſguiſes of men's pretenſions, and deceitful darkneſſes of their hearts. <hi>pag.</hi> 31. <hi>li.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>Grace will teach us wiſely to enjoy as well the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratings, as the fulfillings of our beſt hopes, and moſt ſpecious deſires. <hi>p.</hi> 31. 23.</p>
            <p>The Comfort of God's Mercies often raiſeth the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Sufferers to bee the moſt glorious Saints. <hi>p.</hi> 32. 26.</p>
            <p>I will rather chuſe to wear a crown of Thorns with My Saviour, then to exchange that of Gold (which is due to Mee) for one of lead, whoſe embaſed flexible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall bee forced to bend and complie to the various, and oft-contrarie dictates of anie factions. <hi>p.</hi> 38. 14.</p>
            <p>I know no reſolutions more worthie a Chriſtian King, then to prefer his Conſcience before his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. <hi>p.</hi> 38. 24.</p>
            <p>It is God's will that wee ſhould maintein our Native, Rational and Religious freedom. <hi>p.</hi> 38. 29.</p>
            <p>Though God doth require us to ſubmit our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings and wills to His, whoſe wiſdom and goodneſs can neither err, nor miſguide us, and ſo far to denie our carnal reaſon, in order to his ſacred myſteries and commands, that wee ſhould believ and obeie, rather then diſpute them: yet doth hee exſpect from us onely ſuch a reaſonable ſervice of him, as not to do anie thing for him againſt our conſciences. <hi>p.</hi> 39. 1.</p>
            <p>A good Chriſtian ought to bee willing to ſuffer the greateſt indignities and injuries, rather then commit the leaſt ſin againſt his conſcience. <hi>p</hi> 39. 30.</p>
            <p>A Chriſtian King ought not to ſubject his Reaſon to other men's Paſſions and deſigns, which ſeem unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, unjuſt and irreligous. So ſhall hee ſerv God in truth and uprightneſs of heart, though hee cannot ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisſie <hi>ſom men. p.</hi> 40. 8.</p>

               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:99455:4"/>Truth and Juſtice will bring a man at laſt to peace and happineſs with God, though hee hath much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble among men. <hi>pag.</hi> 40. <hi>line</hi> 18.</p>
            <p>The ſcandal of Subjects, who profeſs the ſame Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with their Sovereign, may be an hindrance to the love of Truth, and hardning others in Error. <hi>p.</hi> 45. 3.</p>
            <p>Conſtancie in Religion the beſt Antidote againſt the poiſon of ill example. <hi>p.</hi> 45. 9.</p>
            <p>The experience of the vanitie and uncertaintie of all humane Glorie and Greatneſs ſhould make us the more ambitious to bee inveſted in thoſe durable Honors and perfections, which are onely to bee found in GOD, and obteined through JESUS Chriſt. <hi>p.</hi> 45. 29.</p>
            <p>I deſire alwaies more to remember I am a Chriſtian then a King: for what the Majeſtie of one might juſtly abhor, the Charitie of the other is willing to bear: what the hight of a King tempteth to revenge, the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie of a Chriſtian teacheth to forgive; keeping in compaſs all thoſe impotent Paſſions, whoſe exceſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure's a man more then his greateſt enemies can. For theſe give their malice a full impreſſion on our ſouls, which otherwiſe cannot reach verie far, nor do us much hurt. <hi>p.</hi> 47. 25.</p>
            <p>No puniſhment ſo ſtain's a man's honor as wilful perpetrations of unworthie actions; which, beſides the conſcience of the ſin, brand's with moſt indelible cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of infamie the name and memorie to poſteritie; who, not, engaged in the factions of the times, have the moſt impartial reflections on the actions. <hi>p.</hi> 51. 1.</p>
            <p>My outward ſtrength, God know's, is little, or none at all: but I have a ſoul invincible through God's grace enabling Mee: here I am ſure to bee Conqueror, if God will give Mee ſuch a meaſure of conſtancie, as to fear Him more than Man; and to love the inward peace of My Conſcience, before anie outward tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie. <hi>p.</hi> 53. 14.</p>

            <p>No condition can make a King miſerable, which carrie's not with it his ſoul's, his people's, and Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie's thraldom. <hi>p.</hi> 204. 3.</p>

            <p>The ſins of a Prince have the aggravation of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the eminencie of his place adding weight to his offenſes. <hi>p.</hi> 218. 29.</p>

            <p>Such as wil adventure on a King (without anie Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion but that of Will and Power) to take his Perſon into their cuſtodie, muſt not bee thought over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt or timorous to carrie on anie deſign they have a minde to. <hi>p.</hi> 225. 5.</p>

            <p>Wee muſt not meaſure a Cauſ by the ſucceſs; nor a mans judgment of things by his misfortunes. <hi>p.</hi> 231. 28.</p>
            <p>A Prince that hath begun, and ſpent ſom years of diſcretion in the experience of troubles, and exerciſe of Patience, hath an advantage of wiſdom above moſt Princes. <hi>p.</hi> 232. 6.</p>
            <p>Pietie and all virtues both Moral, and Political, are commonly better planted to a thriving, in troubles, as trees ſet in winter, then in warmth and ſerenitie of times; or amidſt thoſe delights, which uſually attend Princes Courts in times of peace and plentie; which are prone, either to root up all plants of true Virtue and Honor; or to bee contented onely with ſom leavs, and withering formalities of them, without anie real fruits, ſuch as tend to the Publick good, for which Princes ſhould alwaies remember they are born, and by providence deſigned. <hi>p.</hi> 232. 9.</p>
            <p>Flatterers are as inſeparable from proſperous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as flies from fruit in ſummer; whom adverſitie, like cold weather, drive's awaie. <hi>p.</hi> 232. 29.</p>

            <p>The beſt Government, and higheſt Sovereigntie a Prince can attein to, is to bee ſubject to God, that the Scepter of his Word and Spirit may rule in his heart. <hi>p.</hi> 233. 18.</p>
            <p>The true glorie of Princes conſiſt's in advancing God's Glorie, in the maintenance of true Religion, and the Churche's good: alſo in the diſpenſation of civil Power with Juſtice and Honor to the publick peace. <hi>p.</hi> 233. 22.</p>
            <p>A Prince ought ſo to order affairs in point of Power, that hee need not to fear or flatter anie Faction. For, if ever hee ſtand in need of them, or muſt ſtand to their courteſie, hee is undon. The Serpent will devour the Dove: Hee may never exſpect leſs of Loialtie, Juſtice, or Humanitie, then from thoſe who engage into Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Rebellion; Their intereſt is alwaies made God's: under the colors of pietie, ambitious policies march, not onely with greater ſecuritie, but applauſ, as to the populacie.

            <p>The ſettled Laws of the Kingdom are the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Rules a Prince can govern by. <hi>p.</hi> 237. 24.</p>
            <p>Ingenuous Libertie conſiſt's in the enjoiment of the fruits of induſtrie, and the benefit of thoſe Laws to which ſubjects themſelvs have conſented. <hi>p.</hi> 238. 4.</p>
            <p>A Princes Prerogative is beſt ſhewed and exerciſed in remitting, rather then exacting the rigor of the Laws; there beeing nothing worſ then Legal Tyrannie. <hi>p.</hi> 238. 15.</p>
            <p>I cannot learn that leſſon, nor I hope ever will you, that it is ſafe for a King to gratifie anie Faction with the perturbation of the Laws, in which is wrapt up the Publick intereſt, and the good of the Communitie. <hi>p.</hi> 239. 3.</p>

            <p>A Prince ought not to repoſe ſo much upon anie mans ſingle Counſel, fidelitie, and diſcretion, in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nageing affairs of the firſt magnitude (that is, matters of Religion and Juſtice) as to create in himſelf, or others, a diffidence of his own judgment, which is likely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to bee more conſtant and impartial to the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of his Crown and Kingdom, then anie mans. <hi>p.</hi> 240. 1.</p>
            <p>A Prince muſt beware of exaſperateing anie Factions by the croſneſs and aſperitie of <hi>ſom mens</hi> Paſſions, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, or private opinions, imploied by Him, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed onely upon the differences in leſſer matters, which are but the skirts and ſuburbs of Religion. <hi>p.</hi> 240. 10.</p>
            <p>Favors and rewards muſt bee diſtributed, to all men by the Prince with an equal eie, and impartial hand, as Hee finde's them for their real goodneſs both in abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and fidelitie worthie &amp; capable of them <hi>.p.</hi> 241. 8.</p>
            <p>As a Prince need's no palliations for anie Deſignes (as other men) ſo Hee ought to ſtudie really to exceed, in true and conſtant demonſtrations of goodneſs, pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and virtue towards the People; even all thoſe men, that make the greateſt noiſ and oſtentations of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſo Hee ſhall neither fear anie detection (as they do who have but the face and mask of goodneſs) nor ſhall Hee fruſtrate the juſt exſpectations of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: who cannot in Reaſon promiſe themſelvs ſo much good from anie ſubject's Novelties, as from the virtuous conſtancie of their King. <hi>p</hi> 242. 13.</p>
            <p>None are greater Oppreſſors of the eſtates, Liberties, and conſciences of the People then thoſe men, that entitle themſelvs the Patrons and Vindicators of them, onely to uſurp Power over them. <hi>p.</hi> 242. 30.</p>

            <p>Parliaments, in their right conſtitution with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Honor, wil never injure or diminiſh the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the King; but will rather bee as enterchangings of Love, Loialtie, and confidence between a Prince and his People. <hi>p.</hi> 247. 2.</p>
